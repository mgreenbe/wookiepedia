Yiv was successful in subjugating or otherwise making allies of several factions, but the involvement of the Chiss Ascendancy driven by Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo hindered and ultimately ruined Yiv's manipulations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a Nikardun attack on a refugee starship in Chiss territory, Captain Thrawn began to investigate the situation with the help of Admiral Ar'alani, discovering forces of the Nikardun Destiny in the Rapacc system. Throughout several encounters with Nikardun forces or their allies, Thrawn gained information about General Yiv and his regime, managing to outmaneuver the Nikardun in a battle near the Vak homeworld of Primea. Thrawn captured Yiv, who became a prisoner of the Chiss Ascendancy. Following Yiv's disappearance, the Nikardun conquests fell apart, with no successor able to repair the damage Thrawn had done to their campaign."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After interrogating the imprisoned Yiv, the Ascendancy learned the locations of remnants of Yiv's forces. Sufficiently convinced of the threat posed by these Nikardun remnants, the Syndicure allowed the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet to \"bend\" the protocols prohibiting pre-emptive strikes to hunt them down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
