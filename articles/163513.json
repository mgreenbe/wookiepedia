There, he encountered the Force wielder known as the Son, the embodiment of the dark side, who showed the Jedi Knight a vision of his future as Darth Vader. Distraught by what he witnessed, Skywalker fell under the Son's sway after being promised the power to avert the events that he had foreseen. Soon afterwards, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi descended into the Well in pursuit of Skywalker and discovered that he had fallen under the Son's influence. The Jedi Knight then used The Force to push Kenobi's jumpspeeder into the dangerous magma lake and departed with the Son to Mortis' surface, forcing the Jedi Master to stay in the Well and scale the chasm until he was retrieved by Ahsoka Tano, Skywalker's Padawan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Well of the Dark Side first appeared in \"Ghosts of Mortis,\" the seventeenth episode of the canon animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars' third season, which originally aired on February 11, 2011."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some of the concept design for the Well of the Dark Side was taken from early Ralph McQuarrie designs for subterranean levels of the Imperial Palace where Luke Skywalker was going to face the Emperor deep within Coruscant in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.
