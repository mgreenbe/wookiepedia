The elite Clone commandos of Delta Squad were dispatched to defend the bridge. After pushing back a brigade of Super Battle Droids amidst debris and the strewn-about bodies of Wookiees, Delta's objective was to destroy the bridge and stop the forward advance of the Separatist forces. Delta attempted to blow the bridge from a weak stop in the middle, however the explosives misfired. The resourceful Deltas were able to destroy the bridge by targeting a fuel line that ran under the center span of the bridge, with a Wookiee Guided Rocket Launcher, there-by succeeding in delaying the droid invasion in time for a Republic counter-offensive at the Home Tree."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the video game, Star Wars: Republic Commando, the player has the option of destroying the fuel line underneath the Kachirho Bridge by using the anti-armor attachment of the DC-17m, as opposed to using the Wookiee Guided Rocket Launcher."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
