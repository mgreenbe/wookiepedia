It was built for speed rather than survivability. During the Clone Wars, the company began producing a militarized version of the bike known as the 74-Z speeder bike. Rejecting the BARC speeders of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Galactic Empire used the older, 74-Z model. By the Imperial Era, the 74-Y had been discontinued."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
