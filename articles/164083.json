Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes of the Royal Naboo Security Forces used the fallen pillars to delay Federation Army C, while thermal detonators were placed on the bridge to prevent the convoy from passing through to the battle raging on the Great Grass Plains. Sykes delayed the convoy long enough for the detonators to be placed, but they subsequently failed to activate. Sykes used the proton bombs in his bomber to manually discharge the detonators, destroying the bridge and thereby stopping the convoy. Sykes also bombed the laser turrets which had been placed in the valley."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Widow's Valley appears during a mission in the 2000 video game Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo, in which the player flies as Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes. The objective of the mission is to stop the convoy, so it is not necessary to destroy the pillars if the player can destroy the convoy vehicles first. If the vehicles reach the end of the bridge before the detonators go off, the mission will end in failure. To detonate the bomb, the player has the option of dropping bombs or using lasers. Also, if playing through the level after the first time, the player can choose to fly in a variety of craft. The article assumes the player uses the proton bombs to complete the objective."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
