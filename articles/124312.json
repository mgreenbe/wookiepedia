In 32 BBY, the Prince Bail of the House of Organa became Senator of the Alderaan system to the Galactic Senate, the main decision-making body of the Republic.

Disposing of their dresses, the two women revealed combat bodysuits. They fought their way to Drexx's tower and split up when they found a split end. Eventually, Amidala caught Drexx on the act of accepting a case of gold from the uncle of Passel Argente, a Separatist leader. However, the Senator's hidden holocamera was noticed by the two corrupt bureaucrats, who sent their guards after her. Amidala escaped the tower while Retrac waited for her outside at the controls of a speeder ready to streak off and vacate the premises."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the fifth month of 19 BBY, the Clone Wars were brought to an end.
