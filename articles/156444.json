In 3950 BBY, she was chosen by Murtog, the captain of Dark Councilor Darth Nyriss' security force, along with two other soldiers to be part of a team that would ambush the Jedi Knight Meetra Surik in a cave outside of the Kaas City, the capital of Dromund Kaas. During the skirmish, Surik's droid T3-M4 used his headlamp to temporarily blind the soldiers who immediately opened fire on reflex. They forced Surik to dodge their fire and in response Surik leapt and ran her lightsaber through a nearby male soldier, and used the Force to throw the female soldier against one of the cave walls, killing her on impact."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The female soldier first appeared in Drew Karpyshyn's novel The Old Republic: Revan which was released on November 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
