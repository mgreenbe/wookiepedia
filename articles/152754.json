Groups of two to three plants were grouped together underneath a wooden tripod tied together with yellow cord. In concentric circles ringing these tripods, the farmers grew a short plant that produced a yellow crop. The farmers utilized scarecrows to protect the plants, and collected the red fruits in woven baskets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galactic Empire considered Gibbela an attractive site for colonization, following initial reconnaissance suggesting the local population incapable of mounting significant resistance. A small Imperial task force landed on the planet, and claimed it as Imperial territory in the name of the Galactic Emperor. That brazen act was achieved by landing their Sentinel-class landing craft on top of several fruit trees and crops circles. Retaliation from a local farmer ensued, and he killed the entire Imperial task force. Following this incident, leftover Imperial equipment was converted to agricultural use: Imperial blaster rifles were used to construct tripod supports and stormtrooper helmets were used as baskets to collect fruit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ken Lizzl and Lucas Marangon created the fruit tree for the two-page comic, \"The Value of Proper Intelligence to Any Successful Military Campaign is Not to Be Underestimated\", originally published in Star Wars Tales 19.
