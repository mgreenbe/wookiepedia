As it happened, the Gran shared a history with Katarn. Regardless, the meeting was set to take place at the Rimmer's Rest cantina. 8t88 arrived first and conversed with Katarn, who had sought 8t88 to divulge information surrounding the death of his father. Although late to the confrontation, the Tusken and Gran arrived as 8t88 told Katarn what he knew: a warlord named Jerec had killed Katarn's father. At this moment, the Tusken slid behind Katarn and held a DH-17 blaster pistol to the rebel's head as the Tusken confiscated Katarn's weapon. 8t88 revealed that he was actually working for Jerec, but promised Katarn freedom if the rebel agreed to now give 8t88 information. Katarn refused, and 8t88 left the cantina, leaving his hirelings to kill Katarn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before they could, the Gran tried to taunt Katarn, giving the latter enough time to grab the Tusken's arm and slam him onto the bar table, which disarmed both bounty hunters.

Like all Grave Tuskens, the Tusken had removed the covering that otherwise concealed his face, allowing the galaxy at large to see him. After Katarn used the Force to grab his Bryar pistol, the Tusken was surprised by the sight, and pointed out to the Gran how the blaster was moving without anyone touching it. According to 8t88, the Tusken was not as skillful as the bounty hunter Boba Fett. When Katarn voiced his plan to track 8t88 down, the Tusken doubted Katarn's ability to do so, as Nar Shaddaa was a maze-like locale.

The bounty hunter appeared in the game's second cutscene, where only the arm of an actor was visible. When gameplay started right after the cutscene, the bounty hunter was shown to be a Grave Tusken. However, in the novella adaption written by William C. Dietz, Dark Forces: Rebel Agent, the bounty hunter was described as being a Rodian. In addition, while in the novella and game the bounty hunter is knocked unconscious during the encounter, he is only disarmed during the audio drama and is never rendered completely unconscious. A final difference between versions is that in the game, Katarn steals the bounty hunter's weapon and aims it at the Gran bounty hunter, whereas in the other two sources he uses his own Bryar pistol. This article treats the events from the novella as the correct depiction of events, but treats the individual's species as a Tusken Raider as seen in the game, since the game is the only source to have physically depicted the character."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The actor who portrayed the Tusken character in Dark Forces II's live-action cutscenes was uncredited. In the audio adaption of Rebel Agent, the bounty hunter and his partner are identified by 8t88 as \"goons.\" Credited as Goon 2, as he was the second of the two characters to speak, the character's voice was provided by Bill Slichter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
