General Crix Madine, the Alliance commander in charge of planning the attack, explained that members of a strike team led by General Han Solo would be sent to Endor to deactivate the SLD-26 planetary shield generator on the moon protecting the Death Star from frontal assault, which would allow Alliance starfighters to destroy the station's main reactor. Janse was among the members of the strike team, serving alongside Lieutenant Greeve as a reactivated sharpshooter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Janse and the rest of the strike team traveled to the Endor system aboard the stolen Imperial Lambda-class T-4a shuttle Tydirium, piloted by Solo. Queried by the Super Star Destroyer Executor in defensive orbit over Endor, Solo gave a stolen Imperial code, and the Executor provided the shuttle clearance to land on the Forest Moon. Shortly after landing on the moon's surface, the strike team waited while Solo and the team's command crew\u2014Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, and the Wookiee Chewbacca\u2014scouted the area ahead to make sure it was clear. In the process, Solo alerted a scout trooper patrol to the strike team's presence, resulting in a speeder bike chase between Skywalker, Organa, and several of the Imperial scouts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Janse and the rest of the squad waited until only Skywalker returned. When it became evident that Organa was missing, Solo took the rest of the command crew to search for her, ordering the squad to continue on and to rendezvous at the deflector shield generator at 0300 hours. Major Bren Derlin, the strike team's commanding officer, led the squad toward the shield generator. Several times along the way, the squad encountered Imperial patrols and managed to hide. However, Corporal Delevar, the team's medic, almost compromised their position by preparing to take a potshot at a speeder bike; he was consequently stopped and reprimanded by Derlin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At nightfall, Janse and the squad made camp in a camouflaged shallow ravine, where they posted two sentries and set up a blanket grid with their scanning equipment. Shortly after the squad members started their first sleeping shift, the scanners picked up an All Terrain Scout Transport walker moving toward them. Derlin ordered the team to take cover, but when it became clear that the walker would not pass them by, Corporal Dansra Beezer jammed its transmissions. Lieutenant Greeve destroyed both of the walker's spotlights with precise shots from his A280 blaster rifle, and the squad circled the walker in order to keep it off balance. When the AT-ST began to fire randomly into the trees and foliage, Delevar fired a smoke canister into its cockpit window. The resulting explosion forced the walker pilots to abandon the vehicle and surrender to the strike team. The squad captured the pilots and forced them to make a comm check-in at blasterpoint."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The squad continued on to the rendezvous point, forcing the walker pilot to make several more check-ins on the way to explain the scout walker's absence. By the time the strike team reunited, Solo and the rest of the command crew had allied with the moon's native Ewok tribe from Bright Tree Village, who showed the strike team a path to the shield generator bunker's back door. The strike team then infiltrated the bunker in order to destroy it with 7-PrG proton grenades; however, they were subsequently ambushed and led outside the bunker by Tempest Force, the Imperial Army legion stationed on the moon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The strike team's capture was only temporary, however, as the Ewoks attacked the Imperial troops and the strike team fought back, with the tide of the battle eventually turning in the Rebels' favor.
