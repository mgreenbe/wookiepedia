When a Fondorian patrol ship disappeared after encountering the false Sun Runner, the Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Bultar Swan, as well as Kenobi's apprentice Anakin Skywalker, were tasked with investigating."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi and Skywalker discovered that the ship was a fake\u2014not the actual Sun Runner\u2014and, by planting a proton grenade on the vessel's hypermatter reactor and demolishing its sensor-guided missile silo with the concussion-missile launcher of a borrowed CloakShape fighter, Skywalker was able to destroy it before it could complete its mission. In the process, the 18-year-old Jedi Padawan was forced to crash his starfighter on the Fondor jungle-moon of Nallastia. Kenobi and Swan followed his homing beacon to the fortress of the moon's Skull Queen. The queen was also the moon's margravine, Quenelle, and Nallastian warriors had brought the zoologist-parents of the child Klay to her fortress to be force-field sacrificed between the Trinity Stones, because Nallastia's princess Calvaria wrongfully accused the \"outlanders\" of violating their sacred law concerning the moon's wildlife. Skywalker, in turn, took Calvaria hostage in order to bargain for the release of Klay's parents, and Quenelle acquiesced. She and Kenobi set out to find the Lost Stars of Nallastia, which alone could dissipate the energy field that the captives were trapped in. Their hunt, which culminated in the Cavern of Screaming Skulls, was a success, but Kenobi called Coruscant for backup, sensing that something wasn't right on nearby Fondor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Backup arrived in the form of Jedi Masters Mace Windu and Kit Fisto.
