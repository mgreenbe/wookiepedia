The enforcer chased the crime lord and six of his thugs into a Skar'kla base where they sealed it's blast doors behind them. The Jedi impersonator began cutting through the blast doors with a stolen blue lightsaber and rolled a Thermal detonator through the ruined door which exploded, completely obliterating the three of the thugs.
