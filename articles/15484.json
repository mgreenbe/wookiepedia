There she worked as a receptionist in Figg Hall, a public space in the city's Tourist District for residents or visitors to speak to representatives of the city. As such, she could arrange meetings with Lando Calrissian, the Baron Administrator of the city, or Lobot, Calrissian's chief administrative aid. Bea worked alongside the protocol droid B-7G, and was polite and efficient while at work. A pretty woman, she could be charmed into showing the city's official records, but would alert Lobot to individuals of interest viewing such material."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bea first appeared in The Jewel of Yavin, an adventure module released in 2014 by Fantasy Flight Games for Star Wars: Edge of the Empire.
