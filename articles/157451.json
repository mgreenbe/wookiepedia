In 14 ABY, he gained important information on the Disciples of Ragnos, a cult attempting to revive the dead Sith Lord Marka Ragnos. Padawan Jaden Korr of the New Jedi Order was sent to meet him in an abandoned outpost three kilometers outside the Zonju V settlement, Zoronhed. During their meeting, the spaceport worker was assassinated by a member of the Disciples of Ragnos before he could tell Korr anything. Korr quickly headed back to his starship before he could be killed as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The spaceport worker appeared in the Raven Software video game Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, released in 2003."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
