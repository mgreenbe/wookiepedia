Rau supported the Republic's successor government, the Empire, who tasked him with keeping a watch over the Concord Dawn system for rebel activities. This brought him into conflict with the Phoenix Cell, when they attempted to seek safe passage through the system in order to travel to the Lothal sector.

There, he along with the rebels Wren, Ezra Bridger, and C1-10P \"Chopper\" discovered that his nemesis Imperial Viceroy Gar Saxon had killed the Protectors. Rau was forced to work with his nominal enemies to escape Saxon and his Imperial Super Commandos. Due to his respect for Wren's devotion to her rebel comrades, Rau decided to join the rebellion.

Rau traveled to the ocean planet Kamino, where the Kaminoans were centered, in their capital, Tipoca City. In recognition of Rau's ability as a pilot, Rau specialized in training clone troopers who went on to become pilots in the Republic Military. Years later, not long after the first batch of cloned soldiers reached maturity, the clones were called on by the Republic for use against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, which began the galaxy-wide conflict named for the clones, the Clone Wars.

About three years before the Battle of Yavin, Rau became the Empire's main ally on Concord Dawn. As Protector of Concord Dawn, he was tasked with fighting rebels forces and reporting on their activities to the Empire. When the rebel pilot Hera Syndulla and Phoenix Cell's Phoenix Squadron traveled to the Concord Dawn system to negotiate for safe passage, they were intercepted by Rau and his Fang fighters, who demanded to know why they were visiting his system. Syndulla replied that the rebels were seeking safe passage and that they would stand with Concord Dawn against the Empire. Rau responded by ordering an attack on the rebels' A-wing starfighters. During the ensuing dogfight, Rau and his Fang fighters shot down two A-wing fighters, Phoenix Three and Phoenix Four, and badly damaged Syndulla's fighter. Syndulla managed to escape back to Phoenix Cell but sustained serious injuries.

Despite Jarrus's objections, Wren came along intent on seeking retribution against Rau.

Splitting up, Jarrus followed Rau into a building, while Wren proceeded to plant charges on the fighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Rau was fetching a drink, he spotted Jarrus and allowed the intruder to reveal his identity. Jarrus identified himself as a Jedi veteran of the Clone Wars who had taken part in the Third Battle of Mygeeto. Jarrus thanked Rau for saving him and his master's lives during that battle. Rau recalled being a young and reckless fighter during that battle but failed to see what it had to do with Jarrus infiltrating his base. Jarrus then appealed to Rau to join the rebellion but the Protector was unwilling to side against the Empire. In his mind, the rebellion had little chance of victory and he thought that it was foolish to commit to a losing side. Despite Jarrus's arguments, Rau remained uninterested in fighting another losing war alongside the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rau's conversation with Jarrus was interrupted by the arrival of one his subordinates, who reported that a group of Protectors had encountered an intruder who had invoked the Mandalorian code to seek justice through single combat. This intruder turned out to be Sabine Wren, a member of Clan Wren, a part of House Vizsla which had sided with the Death Watch, the sworn enemies of the Protectors during the Clone Wars. While Jarrus offered to reason with Wren, Rau decided to accept Wren's challenge and so confronted Wren in the square near the parked Fang fighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Rau drew his blaster pistol, Wren shot it out of his hand, and then triggered several explosives, which destroyed seven of the Fang fighters.

Despite Rau's attempts to shake off Jarrus, the Jedi managed to breach the cockpit with his lightsaber and damage the starfighter's controls.

Rau spoke up for his men and explained that something bad must have happened to the Protectors. He agreed to go and investigate.
