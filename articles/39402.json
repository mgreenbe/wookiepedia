A huge chamber with a high ceiling, it contained the Count's formal throne and desk, which were placed on a raised dais at the far end of the room. On the back of the throne stood a stained glass window through which the sunlight bathed the room with a greenish glow. That vast window was as high as twelve Galactic Republic clone troopers stacked one on top of another, which was around 22 meters. The throne chamber was directly connected to the Count's bedroom by a gangway."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
