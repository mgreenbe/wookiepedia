When Zarro, one of Jaum's workers, escaped the caves and attempted to report his crime, she was told by the local law enforcement they could not help due to Jaum's bribing of the council."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Andelm IV council was first mentioned in the 2015 comic book Chewbacca 1, written by Gerry Duggan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
