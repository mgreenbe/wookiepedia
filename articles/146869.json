Tizowyrm translation of the words bioengineer and scientist made little sense to the warrior Vua Rapuung, leading him to conclude the words were obscene. Amnesty and mercy also did not translate well through a tizowyrm because the idea that allowing one to escape the destiny of death was generous ran contrary to Yuuzhan Vong ideals. The word massage also was incomprehensible to Yuuzhan Vong when translated by a tizowyrm, becoming something akin to \"inflict pain,\" when in fact it meant the opposite."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Advance agents of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion force, such as Yomin Carr of the Praetorite Vong, used Tizowyrms to communicate with the native species while they carried out their tasks to lay the groundwork for their invasion of the galaxy.

In the battle that ensued, Lah suffered a defeat at the hands of the young Jedi Jacen Solo.
