Formed during the height of the Galactic Civil War, and working against the Charon Death Cult, the Cult of Light were completely opposite in views compared to their \"doom bringing\" brethren in that they sought peaceful contact with other species and to share technology. This group was unique in that they were the first Charon who developed hyperspace technology after the Battle of Endor. Using this technology, the cult hoped to follow the Illuminated One to another galaxy and escape the black holes of Otherspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
