Individual recruiters varied in their skills, but the best rivalled bounty hunters and scouts as they tracked down independent operations. Recruiters also had to be resourceful as many of the operations they investigated did not want them reporting their findings to the Guild. As such, they were often the targets of accidents and ambushes. Recruiters were fully empowered by both the Guild and the Empire to apprehend claim jumpers, although many preferred to hand their evidence over to local law enforcement agencies. Jinjur Tomas served as a recruiter for the Mining Guild during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
