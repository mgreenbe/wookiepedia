Born several decades before the Jedi Civil War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire under the Sith Lord Darth Revan, Scourge excelled during his time as a student at the Sith Academy on the Imperial capital of Dromund Kaas.

Nyriss revealed the existence of a conspiracy against the Emperor as she showed the younger Sith how the Emperor had stripped the Force from his own homeworld of Nathema and killed millions in order to become immortal. Convinced that the Emperor needed to be stopped, Scourge allied himself with the Jedi Masters Revan and Meetra Surik while planning to confront the Emperor\u2014but when he witnessed the future and saw that it was another Jedi who was destined to destroy the Emperor, Scourge turned on his allies to ensure his own survival."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rendered immortal and appointed as the Emperor's Wrath, Scourge served the Emperor loyally for over three centuries, killing the Emperor's enemies and carrying out his will.

Scourge watched as the Hero was forced to become a servant of the Emperor when a strike team of Jedi failed to capture the Sith ruler, but when the Hero broke free from the Emperor's control, Scourge betrayed the Sith to help the Jedi escape. Pledging his loyalty to the Hero, Scourge aided the Knight and the Jedi's crew in foiling the Emperor's plans to repeat the dark-side ritual that he had used to devastate Nathema but on a galactic scale.

However, Scourge was born in the territory of another Empire\u2014the reconstituted Empire, which had been in hiding in the Unknown Regions for almost a thousand years since the collapse of the original Sith Empire in 5000 BBY. In his youth, Scourge was often threatened with fearsome legends of the Jedi when he was disobedient, leading him to become a strong believer in the idea that the Jedi Order would gladly exterminate the Sith if given the chance again. Found to be Force-sensitive in 3964 BBY, Scourge was sent to the Empire's capital planet of Dromund Kaas, where he was enrolled in the Sith Academy as a young acolyte. Upon arriving on Dromund Kaas, the young Scourge sensed the power of the dark side that emanated from the Imperial Citadel, the structure that housed the Imperial government and the Empire's ruling Dark Council, and he swore to himself that he would one day set foot inside the building.

By the end of his time at the Academy, Scourge was considered to be a master in the art of interrogation, but his hopes for a posting on the Imperial capital were quashed when he was unexpectedly assigned to the fringes of the Empire to quell a series of rebellions there in 3956 BBY. Scourge suspected that one of his instructors had recommended him for the posting out of jealousy or spite, but he was unable to prove his theory. Despite his posting, Scourge was able to craft a powerful reputation by crushing the resistance groups and pursuing their leaders, earning the attention of several influential figures in the Imperial Military."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "In Nyriss's service"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Political machinations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3954 BBY, Scourge was granted the title of Sith Lord, and he was ordered to return to Dromund Kaas at the personal request of Darth Nyriss, one of the Dark Council's most senior members. Given the assignment of discovering who was behind the recent string of assassination attempts against Nyriss, Scourge arrived in Kaas City and was greeted by Nyriss's primary aide, Sechel\u2014a Sith pureblood whose paltry strength in the Force earned Scourge's immediate disgust. Brushing aside Sechel's servile attempts to placate him, Scourge ordered the aide to bring him to Nyriss's stronghold, and the two set off through the rain that was constantly falling on Dromund Kaas. However, two mercenaries refused to get out of Scourge's way, as was expected of the Subjugate caste within the Empire, and it was only Sechel's hurried attempts to get them to move aside that prevented Scourge from having the two Humans arrested. As Sechel drove Scourge to Nyriss's compound in a speeder, the Sith Lord grew confused as to why Nyriss had not sent an entire honor guard to receive him, as his presence would be a public statement that the attempts on her life were being dealt with."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon reaching Nyriss's stronghold, Scourge was enraged when her chief of security, a Human named Murtog, refused to allow him entry until he confirmed Scourge's identity.

Nyriss and her subordinates viewed Scourge's assignment as an intrusion. The Sith Lord was considering his new situation when he became aware of an approaching speeder and sensed a threat through the Force. Drawing his lightsaber, Scourge reached out to the newcomers through the Force. His suspicions were confirmed\u2014they were coming to kill him\u2014but Scourge was then forced to leap aside in order to avoid blasterfire. Using the Force to augment his speed, Scourge raced across the entrance courtyard of Nyriss's compound to avoid the speeder's automated blaster cannon before disabling the weapon with a toss of his lightsaber. Avoiding a falling statue that had been damaged by his attackers, Scourge then charged the downed speeder, only to recognize the same two mercenaries from earlier.

However, the mercenary was suddenly killed by Murtog and several security guards, who had just arrived in the courtyard. Murtog then informed Scourge that Nyriss would now receive him, and the Human led the Sith Lord through Nyriss's stronghold as Scourge ignored the pain from his recent wounds. Disregarding Sechel's running commentary on the artwork present in the building, Scourge began to contemplate the reasoning behind the attempt on his life, and he came to realize any number of parties might be responsible\u2014a jealous rival, Sechel, Murtog, or any combination of the three. Scourge's musings ended when the group arrived at Nyriss's chambers, and the Sith was surprised to discover how much of a toll the dark side had taken on the Dark Councilor's physical form\u2014her face was particularly sickly and aged, and her form frail after years of immersion in the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nyriss informed Scourge that she was impressed with how he had handled the mercenaries, and the elder Sith dismissed both Murtog and Sechel after Scourge made it clear that Murtog's killing of the female mercenary had been a mistake\u2014they could have interrogated her for information. Once they were alone, he explained his suspicions as to who had hired the assassins, but Nyriss surprised him by revealing that she had arranged the attack as a test for him. The Dark Councilor then informed her new vassal of a lead that he could follow up on in the investigation of who was trying to kill her\u2014the droid used in the latest attempt had been traced to the Uxiol Droid Manufacturing plant on the planet Hallion. Nyriss wanted Scourge to accompany Sechel to the plant so that Sechel could hack into the facility's computer systems, but the two would not depart for several days.

Scourge proceeded with the mission nevertheless and leaped the fence in a single bound, relying on the Force to lift him the extra centimeters necessary to avoid the electrified metal.

However, Scourge was then confronted with a three-meter-tall UDM assault droid equipped with two heavy blaster cannons, and the Sith Lord was forced to find cover as it opened fire and charged.

The other man reported that he had copied the files they were looking for before shutting down the facility's power grid. However, Sechel warned him that the trivium generators that powered the vats had been destabilized, and the pair raced out of the building just in time to avoid the massive explosion that destroyed the factory just as they passed through the perimeter fence.

During his meeting with Nyriss, Scourge was irritated when the elder Sith had him recite the Sith Code and then reprimanded him on his lack of understanding of the basic Sith tenets. Nyriss continued her lecture by explaining that Scourge had what she described as a \"special gift\"\u2014the ability to draw strength from living opponents by gorging himself on their emotions, amplifying his powers beyond the normal levels of a Sith. However, as Nyriss explained, Scourge's ability came with a drawback, as he weakened himself by trying to feed off the emotions of droids in combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thanking Nyriss for her counsel, Scourge listened as the Dark Councilor discussed Sechel's findings on Hallion. Her aide had traced the payment for the custom assassin droid used against her to a Human separatist movement on the planet Bosthirda, which was a longstanding member world of the Empire. The two discussed the possible reasoning behind the attacks on her life and why the separatists would target her instead of the Human Darth Xedrix, who had served on the Council longer than she had. Nyriss then announced that she would be sending Scourge, Sechel, Murtog, and her soldiers to Bosthirda that night to wipe out the separatists and uncover more information.

When night finally fell, Murtog contacted Scourge via his comlink, informing the Sith that his team was in position. Scourge ordered the soldier to wait until his signal so that he could disable the cameras, and he brushed off Sechel's attempts to taunt him before ordering Murtog to keep Sechel out of the fighting. The Sith Lord then crept around a nearby building and climbed the utility ladder to the roof, where he leaped the ten meters across the street onto the roof of the separatists' building. Rolling to his feet, Scourge drew his lightsaber and dispatched the four security cameras with telekinesis, then ordered Murtog's soldiers to make their move.

The Sith Lord proceeded to butcher the Humans, slashing with his lightsaber and using the Force to send bodies flying into the walls. Savoring the terror and confusion of his opponents, Scourge cut down the only two women who attempted to fight back, and both Scourge's and the soldiers' respective battles were over in a matter of minutes. However, when the Sith Lord ordered Murtog to bring in Sechel, he was furious to learn that the two were already in the building despite his orders. Finding the two in the building's command center, Scourge expressed his fury at Sechel and Murtog, though an amused Sechel explained that he had entered the building to ensure that he could retrieve information from the separatists' computers before they deleted anything. Scourge let the matter drop for the time so that they could examine Sechel's findings, and the three were surprised to discover a partial recording of a communication between the separatists and the Dark Councilor Darth Xedrix.

However, when the trio began to discuss Xedrix's treachery with the Dark Councilor, Scourge felt confident enough in his analysis to voice his opinion that Xedrix's betrayal did not seem legitimate. Nyriss assured him that Xedrix had more than enough reason to betray the Emperor and the Dark Council, but Scourge was uncomfortable to learn that she had no intention to report Xedrix's treachery to the Emperor. Nyriss then proposed that Scourge himself assassinate Xedrix, and when the Sith Lord sensed Scourge's reluctance, she dismissed Sechel and Murtog in order to speak with him privately.

Drawing on his own emotions to fuel his strength, Scourge prepared to fight Xedrix and his acolytes, but was surprised when Xedrix backed away and let his subordinates fight alone. Scourge drew further strength from his opponents as he attacked the two Sith. Early in the fight, Scourge realized that the female acolyte cared for the male acolyte.

Taking Scourge to her chambers, Nyriss promised to answer his questions but asked him whether he was loyal to the Empire\u2014and informed him that the Emperor himself was not loyal to the Empire. According to Nyriss, the Emperor intended to start another war with the Republic, and she revealed that she and Xedrix had been part of a conspiracy to unseat the Emperor. The assassination attempts against herself had been to draw suspicion away from the conspiracy, and Xedrix had been sacrificed in order to distance the group from the separatist movement and keep the alliance secret. The Dark Councilor then explained that she was telling all of this to Scourge so that he could join their cause\u2014though if he refused, he would be implicated in the conspiracy itself and thus would be unable to reveal its existence.

Tenebrae conquered Medriaas's northern continent over the next four years before he killed Dramath, and shortly afterward, he was summoned before the reigning Dark Lord of the Sith, Marka Ragnos. Ragnos anointed Tenebrae as Lord Vitiate, ruler of Medriaas, and Vitiate promptly renamed his world Nathema. A century later, as the first Empire collapsed in the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace War, Vitiate convinced thousands of Sith Lords to join him in a ritual of Sith magic on Nathema.

On the surface, Scourge was horrified by the overwhelming sensation of death that surrounded them, and he came to truly understand why Nyriss and her fellow Councilors had decided to oppose the Emperor\u2014if the Sith ruler had his way, all life would be snuffed out, and the galaxy itself would be wiped from existence. Scourge fought the urge to vomit as they lifted off from Nathema, but as his ability to sense the Force returned, both he and Nyriss became aware of a strong presence in the Force.

Taking the weapon, Scourge carried the man out of the wrecked ship and to Nyriss, who recognized him as Revan\u2014a Jedi Master. Revan and his friend Malak had discovered Dromund Kaas five years before, but they had been captured and supposedly executed by the Emperor.

Over the years, Scourge used his expertise at interrogation to take advantage of Revan's isolation, gradually building a relationship with his prisoner and learning bits and pieces of Revan's knowledge of the Force. Revan manipulated Scourge in return, and upon learning that Scourge and Nyriss wanted to overthrow the Emperor, the Jedi had gradually worked to build trust with his captor.

Scourge often enveloped his fist with lightning during combat and delivered punches to his opponents. His skill with the blade, regardless of whether he wielded it with his dominant right hand or his left hand, was such that even his instructors at the Sith Academy had been reluctant to battle him while he was still an apprentice. Scourge's primary gift was the ability to draw strength from the emotions of his opponents, gorging himself on their fear and anger to bolster the strength of the dark side within himself. While his ability initially put him at a disadvantage when facing non-living opponents, as he weakened himself by trying to draw on nonexistent emotions, he learned to overcome his weakness and became just as proficient in fighting droids as any other Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Scourge was skilled in using the Force to sense enemies in his surroundings, and he made frequent use of telekinesis in combat and as a tool of intimidation. He bolstered his physical abilities with the Force in order to increase his speed and agility, and he could guide a thrown lightsaber with the Force to strike his intended target in the heat of battle. Another of his skills was the ability to wrap the dark side around himself, concealing his presence from others and also keeping him warm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Early in his time at the Sith Academy, Scourge showed a natural affinity for interrogation and torture. He had an innate skill at discerning the truth and instinctively knew which questions to ask in order to get the answers he wanted. A master in the art of interrogation, Scourge could also bolster his skills with the power of the dark side, enabling him to dominate the minds of the weak-willed and undermine strong-willed individuals. His centuries of service to the Emperor gave him a unique perspective on his fellow Sith; Scourge's skill in interrogation eventually developed to the point that he was able to analyze a person's flaws and personality after only a short period of observation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After becoming the Emperor's Wrath, Scourge received extensive biochemical enhancements throughout his body, which further increased his strength and worked to sustain the effects of the immortality ritual that Scourge underwent at the Emperor's hands. He was classified as a heavily armored, close-combat assassin, wearing a suit of heavy, black, spiked armor and utilizing a personal energy shield generator to protect himself from blasterfire and most attacks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Scourge first appeared in the 2011 novel The Old Republic: Revan by Drew Karpyshyn, a tie-in book to the BioWare\u2013LucasArts video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, which was released later that year. The novel introduced Scourge and much of the Sith Empire and Emperor's backstory, while also continuing the storylines of Revan and Meetra Surik, who were the player-characters in the 2003 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and its 2004 sequel, The Sith Lords, respectively. The novel also established the backstory for the Jedi Knight class in The Old Republic, in which Scourge is a companion character for the Jedi Knight who is acquired at the beginning of Act III in the class storyline."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Scourge is voiced by Joseph Gatt in The Old Republic, and as with all companion characters in the game, the player can gain or lose affection with Scourge depending on chosen actions and choices in cutscenes. Scourge gains affection when the player uses power against the weak or expresses anger, revenge, or spite and loses affection whenever the player makes decisions that are greedy or merciful and when the player submits to Jedi or Republic authorities. The character was excluded as a romance option for the Jedi Knight for a variety of reasons, which included budget limitations, practicality, and creative direction. However, with the release of Onslaught, Scourge has now become a romance opportunity for the Jedi Knight, both male and female."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a companion character, Scourge is one of five characters who can be utilized by player-characters. Unlike companions like Kira Carsen and T7-O1, he is not required to accompany the player-character on any class missions. Therefore, this article assumes only that one of the companions accompanies the Knight on the class missions but does not specify which one. Also, as a Republic character, the Jedi Knight is assumed to be a light-side character; therefore, the Hero of Tython\u2014the in-game title for the character\u2014is assumed to choose only options that result in the maximum light-side points.

Scourge also appears as a companion character for the Jedi Knight in The Old Republic's paid expansion, Rise of the Hutt Cartel, but as the expansion can be played by any of the four Republic classes, it is uncertain as to who canonically performed the events of the expansion.
