She fought against the Galactic Empire in the Battle of Scarif serving as Bistan's \"delivery driver\" - piloting a UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft in which the Iakaru served as a door gunner. Joma was known to be even-keeled, and tolerated Bistan's exuberance because of his widely-respected marksmanship skills. She also served as Blue Eleven in Blue Squadron. During the Battle of Scarif, her ship was shot down after she delivered troop reinforcements on the ground."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
