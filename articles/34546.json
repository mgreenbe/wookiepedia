It was also taken to signify giving up one's old life. Such examples are Anakin Skywalker becoming Darth Vader, or Jacen Solo becoming Darth Caedus. But the origins of the word are uncertain. It is often thought that \"Darth\" is merely a contraction of the title \"Dark Lord of the Sith\", but there are theories that suggest a deeper interpretation."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Origins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some historians suggest that \"Darth\" is actually a corruption of the Rakata word Daritha, meaning \"emperor\". Others note another Rakatan connection: the words for \"triumph\" or \"conquest\" in Rakatan is darr, and the word for \"death\" is tah, leading to the theory that \"Darth\" is derived from darr tah and therefore means \"triumph over death\" or \"immortal\". Given the Sith obsession with discovering the means to achieve immortality, this idea is not entirely without merit, at least on the surface. But others point out that the true meaning of darr tah is \"conquest through death,\" meaning the conquest of one's enemies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, the flaw in such theories involving a Rakatan origin is that, even if they are accurate, they cannot spring specifically from Revan or Malak's re-discovery of the Rakata and the Star Forge. Five years prior to their emergence as Sith Lords (3964 BBY), the title \"Darth\" was already well known by the Jedi in connection to the Sith, which is why Padawan Zayne Carrick could call Jarael \"Darth Sunshine.\" In addition, Haazen claimed that if he were to take a name like the Sith of old, it would be \"Darth Hayze,\" all but asserting that the title Darth was around prior to Revan and Malak's discovery. There is still the possibility that one of the Rakatan theories could be correct, since the ancient Sith homeworld of Korriban had once been occupied by the Rakata (circa 28,000 BBY), which is one way either the Daritha or darr tah term could have entered the ancient Sith language. Darth Andeddu lived during the time of the old Sith Empire (6900 BBY to 5000 BBY), early enough for his holocron to come into the possession of the fallen Jedi Freedon Nadd. He was known for experiments into eternal life, a possible link to the Rakatan term."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "But even if the Rakatan connection proves to have some validity, numerous other cultures make similar claims to the etymology of the title, so for the present, there is no definitive answer as to what the term \"Darth\" truly means."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Usage"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Ancient Sith"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amongst the Sith Lords who held the title of Darth long before the time of Darth Sidious' successful conquest of the galaxy was Darth Andeddu, a hoarder of Sith lore.

After the fall of Darth Revan and Malak, the strongest remnants of their empire gathered to form the elusive Sith Triumvirate, and the triumvirs each took up a Sith title containing the prefix Darth. The Lord of Betrayal styled herself as Darth Traya, whilst her apprentices, consumed by darkness, took up the names Darth Nihilus and Darth Sion. Traya was cast out by her pupils and came to be Kreia, the teacher of the Jedi Exile who led the true Jedi despite Sion and Nihilus' Jedi purge, which brought the Jedi Order's leader, Atris, to betray herself in her lust for power and made her the new Darth Traya. Nevertheless, the Sith Triumvirate was eliminated by the Jedi Exile, ridding the galaxy of the Sith."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Vitiate's reconstituted Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the True Sith that descended from the efforts of Lord Vitiate, who came to power during the time of Naga Sadow, continued to grow outside of the Republic's borders. Vitiate took up the mantle of Darth and Sith Emperor, and allowed high-ranking Sith Lords of his reformed Empire to take up the title of Darth. Amongst the numerous Darths of Vitiate's reconstituted Empire were members of the Dark Council, such as Vengean and Vowrawn, as well as enforcers of the Emperor's will on the battlefield such as Darth Malgus.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The New Sith Wars and the Brotherhood of Darkness"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later Sith Lords of the Jedi Civil War era also used the title Darth, as did the founding Sith Lord of the Light and Darkness War, Darth Ruin, though there were few later Sith bearing the title until the rise of Darth Rivan and Darth Bane. During the Draggulch Period, Lord Kaan discouraged the usage of the term within the Brotherhood of Darkness, claiming that it promoted rivalry among the Sith. With the Sith of late suffering from constant infighting, Darth Bane believed that the concept of multiple Sith Lords diluted Sith power, and thought that the reason for prohibiting the use of the Darth title as merely the result of their fear of usurpation.

Not all usages of the term \"Darth\" during this time, however, preceded a Sith name, as Darth Maul's name had the title of \"Darth\" preceding his birth name."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The One Sith"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the One Sith, the \"Darth\" title was reserved only for those who proved their power and their unquestioning loyalty to Darth Krayt.
