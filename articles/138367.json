The plating was never visible to the player. The upgrade was mentioned again in the game's strategy guide. An exact price is difficult to figure out, due to the fact that the price of different parts will fluctuate depending on how many upgrades have been previously purchased. For each Podracer statistic category, there are nineteen upgrade levels, and the T100 is the eleventh defense upgrade, where a base price of 900 truguts can be roughly established."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
