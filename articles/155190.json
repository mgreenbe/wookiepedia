Eight months after the Battle of Yavin, the Troukree and his comrades accompanied Vaantaar to aid the group of rogue stormtroopers known as the Hand of Judgment in the defense of Imperial Governor Bidor Ferrouz of the planet Poln Major, which was similarly being threatened by Esva. During a fight against Esva's troops in Whitestone City, the Troukree died when he used his own body to shield the leader of the Hand of Judgment, Daric LaRone, from the fire of an E-Web heavy repeating blaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A male Troukree, along with a group of refugees of his species, fled from his homeworld after it was threatened by the advances of Nuso Esva, an alien warlord. At some point by 0 ABY, the Troukree refugees settled on Poln Major, capital planet of the Candoras sector, in the Outer Rim Territories. During the group's stay on Poln Major, the leader of the refugees, Vaantaar, also acted as an agent of Senior Captain Thrawn of the Galactic Empire. On Poln Major, the Troukree male joined Vaantaar in helping the Hand of Judgment, a group of five stormtrooper deserters, to protect Imperial Governor Bidor Ferrouz against assassination attempts organized by Esva's elite troops, the Chosen. The Governor's death was intended to be bait to lure Thrawn into a trap prepared by Esva in the Poln system. In the basement of the Whistling Wind tapcafe in Whitestone City, two members of the Hand of Judgment, Joak Quiller and Korlo Brightwater, taught basic stormtrooper battle tactics to their Troukree allies, while Daric LaRone and Saberan Marcross, two other stormtroopers, fought off the first attack against their sanctuary."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the second attack, the Troukree male sacrificed his life to shield LaRone, the stormtroopers' leader, from the fire of an enemy E-Web heavy repeating blaster with his own body\u2014one of the Troukree's companions helped him to jump over LaRone's head as the stormtrooper approached the weapon, thus providing cover. The defenders fought off three attacks against their sanctuary, losing only the Troukree male during the second wave, before Troukree reinforcements arrived outside the tapcafe. His sacrifice deeply touched the stormtroopers, as they had not expected an alien to risk his life to protect a Human. The act later contributed to their decision to accept Thrawn's offer to join his shadow Empire to train a new strain of stormtroopers, who would accept aliens into their ranks and which was named after the Imperial 501st Legion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like the other Troukree warriors following Vaantaar, the Troukree male was experienced with knives in close-quarters combat. He was also skilled in acrobatics, a talent he used to enhance his combat performance and to jump high into the air with the help of a companion when protecting Daric LaRone against an E-Web heavy repeating blaster. During their time with the Hand of Judgment, the Troukree received additional training in the use of blaster weapons from Joak Quiller and Korlo Brightwater. The Troukree male was willing to sacrifice his life to ensure that LaRone's attempt to destroy the E-Web threat was successful. He had green, scaly skin, with patches of fur of the same color."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The unnamed Troukree first appeared in Timothy Zahn's novel Choices of One in 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
