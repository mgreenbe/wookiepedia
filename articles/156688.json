The guard was in charge of holding several criminals prisoner during the Kijimi summit, in which lead Spice Runner Zeva Bliss gathered numerous allies and enemies in order to execute them. Poe Dameron, a Spice Runner who had deduced Bliss's plan and was attempting to stop her, brought a case of weapons to the prisoners, claiming Bliss had ordered him to give the criminals a last meal. The lead guard was perplexed by the order, but had two subordinates open the case, instead finding the weapons. Dameron shot down the two guards, but the lead guard and the remaining subordinates stood between the prisoners and the weapons. Dameron's droid, EV-6B6, distracted the guards by claiming Bliss had been killed, and the lead guard was knocked down and shot by Tarand Crowe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
