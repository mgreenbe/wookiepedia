Yrica Quell, Caern Adan, and his unique IT-O crashed onto the planetoid after escaping the destruction of the Lodestar. The planetoid contained a Sith tower located on top of a mesa. The tower was laced with sophisticated biosensors that were designed to scan for a specific signature, perhaps biological or physiological, that also served as a locking mechanism for the structure. The tower was eventually opened by Yrica Quell, and she escaped the planetoid in an advanced starship with cloaking technology."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
