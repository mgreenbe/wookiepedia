After his pirate outpost was destroyed during the Second battle of Florrum, Ohnaka escaped aboard Slave I with his surviving men, his massiff, as well as Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano and a group of Jedi Initiates in her care. When Ohnaka safely delivered the wayward Jedi to General Obi-Wan Kenobi's cruiser, his pet entertained itself by gnawing on a battle droid head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
