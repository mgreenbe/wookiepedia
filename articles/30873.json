Leia and Tarfang fought over the Tyrossum jawbone for control of the conversation as per customs. Since Leia was not able to use the Force the battle was difficult and brutal with Tarfang trying to choke Leia and bash her head against the rock. Eventually Leia tossed Tarfang off of the rock just as Luke arrived. Tarfang gave the jawbone, which granted whoever held it the right to speak at the Council, to Luke."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
