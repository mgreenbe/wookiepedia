Blurrgs were notably used by the Twi'lek Resistance and Free Ryloth Movement during the Clone Wars and the Imperial Era. They were also corralled by the moisture farmer Kuiil on Arvala-7."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Blurrgs were a two-legged non-sentient reptilian species that were used as beasts of burden on a number of worlds located across the galaxy, including Endor and Ryloth. Blurrgs had two short arms that had two fingers with claws, and a thick tail that helped them balance. The creatures possessed large mouths and many sharp teeth that could chew through most materials, including grasses and weeds, though they were not strictly herbivores and were known to consume other organisms, even members of their own kind. The hip joint that connected their stocky hind legs to their body was unusually high up on a blurrg's body. They stood around 2.5 to 3 meters tall."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Blurrgs were typically dark in coloration, ranging from a dark blue, green, or gray, to brown and black, but also featured a lighter mottled pattern that could be shades of lighter blue or orange. Rebel leader Cham Syndulla's blurrg had white markings on its head."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their awkward appearance, blurrgs could run very fast. During the Battle of Ryloth, blurrgs easily outpaced the All Terrain Reconnaissance Transports used by the Republic's Lightning Squadron, which could top out at 75 kph on flat terrain, as well as reportedly being able to match the velocity of Imperial speeders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stoic and strong, blurrgs were used for everything from agricultural labor and transportation to war. They were very versatile for various kinds of service despite their poor intelligence. Blurrgs were also strong enough to carry large loads. Blurrgs were commonly found in an agricultural setting, employed by farmers to move equipment or clear weeds and grass."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some blurrgs could also have a hostile disposition when provoked. When one Twi'lek Resistance member invited a clone to mount his blurrg, the blurrg roared and bucked as the clone unsuccessfully attempted to control it. Their viciousness when provoked made them useful in battle. Male blurrgs were eaten by females after the mating process."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, when the Confederacy of Independent Systems invaded the planet Ryloth, the Twi'lek Resistance, led by Cham Syndulla, had blurrgs in their care that they used as mounts. They set up a hideout inside a ruined Separatist ship and had several stables for their blurrg mounts inside."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Syndulla and the Resistance met with in battle Jedi General Mace Windu and the Grand Army of the Republic's Lightning Squadron, they agreed to work together to retake the capital city of Lessu. During the final offensive against Separatist forces in Lessu, several of the freedom fighters rode blurrgs that charged at droid troops alongside the AT-RTs utilized by the clone troopers. During the time of the Mission to Zygerria, some blurrgs were sold in the markets of Zygerria."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial Era, Syndulla's Free Ryloth Movement continued to use blurrgs. After the occupation of the Tann Province, Syndulla and Numa rode blurrgs on a raid on an Imperial Troop Transport alongside Syndulla's daughter Hera, eventually riding into Hera's ship, the Ghost, to escape Imperial reinforcements."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 9 ABY, the Ugnaught Kuiil had a small moisture farm on the planet Arvala-7 where he kept several tamed blurrgs that he used for transportation across the difficult terrain. When the bounty hunter Din Djarin traveled to Arvala-7 after taking a job from The Client, he met Kuiil, who helped him learn to ride before loaning him a blurrg to use for travel. Later, when Djarin returned to Kuiil's farm to ask the Ugnaught that he accompany him to Nevarro on a mission, Kuiil agreed to join him when Djarin allowed him to bring his blurrgs along. The creatures would sit in the cargo hold of the Razor Crest. During the mission, the blurrgs were killed when the group was attacked by several native reptavians. Later, Kuiil traveled with Grogu back to the Razor Crest on the remaining blurrg, but was run down by scout troopers, who killed Kuiil and his blurrg before taking Grogu back to the city."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Star Wars canon, blurrgs first appeared in \"Liberty on Ryloth,\" an episode of the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars that first aired in 2009.
