When he took up bounty hunting, Bocck continued to work for the Empire, as well as the underworld. He was responsible for the assassinations of at least two teams of New Republic scouts. This, along with other crimes, earned him a posting in one of General Airen Cracken's Wanted by Cracken reports."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cracken speculated that pride could very well be Bocck's downfall, for he always boasted about the trophies he displayed at his hidden estate.
