Tramp shuttles were of a variety of makes and models, reflecting the fact that the Alliance made do with whatever they could get their hands on. These tramp shuttles generally could not carry as many troops into battle as a speeder truck could, but they were intended to deliver them directly into hot combat zones, requiring them to be fast and agile. The Alliance used a number of modified Arrow-23 landspeeders as tramp shuttles during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
