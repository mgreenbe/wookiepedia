Although Aion was a pickpocket, he helped Boba to locate the Slave I where Gjon had taken the ship to be smelted. But when the two of them stole thousands of counterfeit credits, Aion betrayed him; taking his share as well as Boba's. This incident caused Boba to become more distrustful in the future."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Labyrinth of Evil states that Jango Fett was recruited by Count Dooku to be the prime template for the clone army on Bogg 4 while other sources state that he was recruited on another moon, Kohlma.
