The vessel was a common sight around the planet Bakura in the Outer Rim Territories during the conflict fought by the denizens of the galaxy against the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong. In 28 ABY, the crew of the Jaunty Cavalier was contracted by Molierre Cundertol, Prime Minister of Bakura, to take delivery of a Human replica droid made in his image and take it to Lwhekk, the Ssi-ruuk homeworld. The crew then staged Cundertol's kidnapping to transport the Prime Minister to the same location."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cundertol was in league with the Ssi-ruuk, a reptilian species that inhabited a star cluster near to Bakura. After a failed invasion attempt on Bakura twenty-four years earlier, the Ssi-ruuk were looking to try again. In exchange for using the Ssi-ruuvi entechment process to transfer his life essence into the Human replica droid, Cundertol was to assist them in taking the planet. With the process completed, the Jaunty Cavalier took Cundertol back to Bakura. However, to ensure secrecy about his new immortal condition, Cundertol murdered the crew of the Jaunty Cavalier and sabotaged the ship.

In doing so, they were implicated as radical members of the Freedom resistance movement, an anti-New Republic organization that supported a more independent Bakura free of outside influence. The Jaunty Cavalier was then used to take Cundertol back to Bakura. However, the Prime Minister could not risk the crew of the Jaunty Cavalier contradicting any story he came up with to cover his disappearance, so he murdered the crew and sabotaged the ship."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Return to Bakura"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Jaunty Cavalier exited hyperspace over Bakura, it went into an uncontrolled spin and its drive units fired at random intervals.

Since the Jaunty Cavalier was out of control and dangerously close to the Pride of Selonia, the commander of the Alliance frigate's starfighter squadron, Jagged Fel, attempted to hail the vessel, instructing them to change course or action would be taken."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When no response was forthcoming, and with the possibility that the Jaunty Cavalier might hit the Pride of Selonia, Fel requested and received permission from Bakura Orbital Control to attempt to nudge the wayward freighter out of the Pride's way.

He told those assembled in the medical bay\u2014which included Fel\u2014that he believed he had been kidnapped with the express intention of being interrogated and then killed. Because of this, Cundertol chose to attempt to escape and managed to get free from his restraints. He told them a tale of how he overpowered the crew, then turned the ship around and headed back to Bakura, where the Jaunty Cavalier developed \"system rot\" and began falling apart around him, barely escaping the vessel in time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Cundertol's involvement in the subsequent Ssi-ruuvi invasion of Bakura was discovered, and the truth behind the Jaunty Cavalier's mission and later destruction was revealed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Commanders and crew"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jaunty Cavalier was owned and commanded by Rufarr, a Wookiee.
