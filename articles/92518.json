The course opened in a large set of grandstands and remained that way until the course broke off into the mining fields. From there competitors would encounter soft turns and several straightaways. The course also passed by numerous mining vehicles left around the course, some which served as obstacles. The Er'Kit pilot Ody Mandrell favored this course, and would challenge opponents on it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The course first appeared, unnamed, in the 1999 Gameboy Color video game Star Wars Episode I: Racer.
