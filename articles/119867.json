Circa 1 ABY, Roric Goldenfield managed to capture some of them while they were looting the ranch and hold them captive in the house. In the meantime, an adventurer attacked the pirates in their base. Nevertheless, the spacer spared the pirate leader's life after he surrendered. The pirate leader tasked the spacer to head to the ranch and free the captive pirates. However, the spacer instead helped Helen Goldenfield to prevent the pirates to escape while her husband was contacting Imperial authorities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
