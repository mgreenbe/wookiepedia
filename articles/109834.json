At some point by the year 4 ABY, D'nec allegedly encountered a tribe of Tusken Raiders, a herd of angry banthas, and a raging krayt dragon in the Dune Sea, and defeated all of them within minutes, emerging from the Dune Sea with a bantha tusk over his shoulder. For this alleged exploit, the Jawa was regarded as the \"Hero of the Dune Sea.\" However, many suspected the legend grew in the telling. D'nec was also undefeated in the game of Dune Sea Sabacc, with no witnesses to the contrary. D'nec wore brown Jawa robes and had yellow eyes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R'kik D'nec was first mentioned in 1998, on a couple of cards for the Jabba's Palace Limited expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game.
