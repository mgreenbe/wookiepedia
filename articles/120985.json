The trio traveled to Coruscant, intending to collect a bounty on a smuggler who had lost a shipment of blasters belonging to Rogun. The three cornered the smuggler in the Dealer's Den cantina as he returned from business, but Egara and Riloh's love talk aggravated Scorch, and he boldly faced the captain. Scorch wanted to rush into the fray with flamethrower and take the bounty, but the smuggler was able to convince Riloh that killing him was a bad idea. The three departed the cantina, with Scorch complaining that he would have bought a rocket launcher had they collected the bounty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the conversation in which the smuggler encounters the three bounty hunters, the player's choices can also convince Egara that she tracked down the wrong person instead of the one on the bounty listing.
