The nebula's three suns gave local space a ruby-red tint, hence the name, Ruby Nebula. The density of the nebula's stars was known to disrupt starship sensors, making it easy for spy ships and starfighters\u2014and even larger vessels such as landing craft and patrol interceptors\u2014to remain hidden amid the free-floating asteroids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Master Adi Gallia met Nym's informant, Reti, in the Ruby Nebula while attempting to set up a meeting with the pirate captain. Reti was followed to the area by droid starfighters, disgorged from a Trade Federation landing craft. Gallia and Reti destroyed the fighters, the landing craft and a Sabaoth Squadron spy ship, and continued on to Maramere."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
