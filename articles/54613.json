While serving aboard the Yavin, Ginbotham saw action at the Battle of Almania, where the Republic engaged three Victory-class Star Destroyers under the command of the terrorist Kueller. Ginbotham was ordered to fire at one of the Republic's allied ships, the Wild Karrde, in order to confuse the opponent's droid-operated forces into mistaking the Yavin for one of their own ships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
