During his time as a Jedi, Skywalker married the Kiffar Droo and adopted her daughter Ahnah; he also adopted a young boy named Skeeto. When the Sith\u2013Imperial War began, Skywalker helped the Jedi Order find a suitable planet, Taivas, to build a Hidden Temple. After leaving the Order, Skywalker adopted the alias \"Bantha\" Rawk, with his family taking the surname as well. In 130 ABY, after the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Krayt's Sith-Imperials massacred the Jedi on Ossus, Rawk assumed that Cade had perished during the attack.

The former Jedi Master revealed the Hidden Temple's location to Cade when his nephew expressed a desire to assassinate Darth Krayt. Rawk guided Cade's crew and Rae to Taivas and met with the reconvened Jedi Council as his nephew presented them with his plan to kill the Sith Lord. The Council ultimately refused, and Rawk bid his nephew farewell as Cade left with his crew to assassinate Krayt, going against the Council's wishes. After Cade and his team had apparently killed Krayt, he met Rawk and his family on Droo's homeworld, Kiffex, and asked for their assistance in healing Rae, who had been grievously wounded during the mission. Rawk and Droo were forced to encase Rae in a life-preserving suit that Rawk had built for the Kiffu Guardians. When he discovered that Rae had not wanted them to heal her, Rawk gave Cade and his crew two days to repair the Mynock and leave Kiffex.

Skywalker was aware of his brother's secret marriage to the Imperial spy Morrigan Corde, although he never understood why until Kol brought his and Corde's son, Cade, to the Jedi Praxeum on the planet Ossus. Skywalker raised Cade on Ossus, since Kol had to remain on the galactic capital, Coruscant, to tend to Jedi affairs. Kol eventually brought Cade to Coruscant.

Eventually, Rawk and Cade, who was now a bounty hunter, were reunited. Rawk helped his nephew and the Zeltron Deliah Blue, a member of Cade's crew, build the starship Mynock. Rawk also supplied his nephew with weaponry, building a modified double-barreled blaster carbine called the Rawk chopped special.

Rawk reminded his nephew that he had abandoned his former identity when he left the Jedi, and told Cade to leave Iego if he were to tell Rawk's children their father's reasons for leaving the Jedi.

The holovid showed an image of Cade and called him by his full name. Cade confirmed his identity as a Skywalker to his cousins, and Rawk began to scold his nephew. The two attacked each other, but quickly managed to calm down. Rawk ordered Skeeto to turn on the long-range scanners for Imperial activity, and told everyone not to panic.

Rae used a mind trick to convince Gurlok to leave, and the Imperials went back to the Star Destroyer and left the system. Two hours later, Rawk gave Cade another Rawk chopped special, and commended Rae for her actions.

As Rawk finished conversing with Vos, Syn contacted him over his comm system and asked Rawk to transmit the compound's coordinates to the Mynock's navigation computer. After sending the coordinates, Rawk and Droo met Cade and his crew outside their home. Cade, who was using his healing ability to keep Rae alive, gave Rae to Droo.

Droo believed that they had to let her die, but Rawk disagreed, stating that Cade had seen too many promises broken in his life. Despite hesitance from Droo, the two placed Rae in the life-preserving suit that Rawk had developed for Sheyf Vos. After finding out that Cade had lied about Rae wanting to live, Droo confronted Cade and told him to leave and to perhaps never return to the Rawks.

Rawk joined the Galactic Alliance Remnant's Emergency evac fleet, and piloted his CR90 corvette to the docks of the recently captured city of Heurkea. He pledged to come back as many times as needed.

Later Cade and the Mynock crew arrived at the Temple to warn that the Sith had become aware of the Temple's existence. At first it was suggested that the Jedi flee while they could, however Cade then proposed a plan to lure the Sith into a trap which the Jedi, Roan Fel, and Gar Stazi agreed to.
