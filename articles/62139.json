Holoprojectors came in various sizes. Low-quality holoprojectors did a poor job of rendering colors accurately, as they fed everything through a strong blue filter. Transmission across light-years often distorted hologram consistency. Holoprojectors could also be within a droid, or even attached to the gauntlet of the user as well as a comlink. It was common to see hidden holoprojectors for conversations without apparent blue light projected, and sometimes rendering a coloured image."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Approximately 30 years after the Battle of Endor, holoprojectors had become sophisticated enough to display the subject in full color, with no filters or scan lines visible. The First Order's Supreme Leader Snoke used this technology to broadcast himself larger than his actual size."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
