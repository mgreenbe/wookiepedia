She was kidnapped on the order of Soergg the Hutt. The kidnapping took place in a marketplace in Cuipernam, capital of Ansion. While Jedi Masters Luminara Unduli and Obi-Wan Kenobi, and their Padawans Barriss Offee and Anakin Skywalker were walking through the marketplace, Barriss was lured away and sprayed with a gas that rendered her unconscious. After being taken to the room of an unnamed building on Jaaruls Street by her captors, Barriss was able to convince them to release her by curing them of mental disabilities that they had been living with for years. The cured assailants, Kyakhta and Bulgan, then decided to join the Jedi as guides on their mission to end the ongoing conflicts between the Unity of Community, Ansion's official government, and the Alwari nomads."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
