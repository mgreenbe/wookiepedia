These large creatures had smooth sloping heads with reflective eyes that allowed them to see even in near darkness. They had razor-sharp talons and their massive wingspan was covered in black feathers that made it seem nearly the size of a small Human. Despite this being the case, kreehawks had the potential to reach great speeds and were extremely nimble animals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A quarter of kreehawks were kept in the aviary of Darga the Hutt. These birds were trained to respond to Darga personally, but could also be controlled using a command whistle. Darga's kreehawks could attack on command, and were capable of killing and completely devouring a victim's remains."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
