He was interested in buying alien animals for use in a zoo on Manaan, although due to Manaan's rules in the matter, Nubassa was forced to utilize slightly less-than-legal means. He wanted creatures which were non-sentient and non-carnivorous, and preferred those which were easy to manage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Revan offered to donate the colony of gizka that had invaded the Ebon Hawk, Nubassa quickly refused, citing the gizkas' high reproduction rate and the incredible nuisance they posed.
