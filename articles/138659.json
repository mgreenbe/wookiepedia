Externally, the TIV looked like an anonymous battered utility shuttle.

The ship's clone trooper pilot, CT-1127/549 nicknamed \"Sicko\", was killed in the incident. Due to the secrecy of Omega Squad's mission, the true nature of the vessel was never released and the skipper of the Nova Crystal was regarded as a hero for his actions by the Perlemian Traffic Control."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
