Criminals and thugs went to the Undertow when they want to avoid Imperials. Galen Marek went there to find Rahm Kota as part of Darth Vader's fake plot to overthrow Emperor Palpatine. When Marek threatened the owner about whether they knew where Kota was, the patrons started attacking the Dark Jedi, since due to the Great Jedi Purge, any Jedi they found would be placed with a bounty for the Empire. After finishing off the bounty hunters, Imperial Navy commandos arrived and after killing them, Galen fought an Emperor's Shadow Guard and a squad of Shadow Troopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
