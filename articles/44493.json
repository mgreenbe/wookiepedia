The Dread Masters, who were capable of using a dark side version of battle meditation to inspire crippling fear in their opponents, were sent to the Republic's secret prison complex on the planet Belsavis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Dread Masters were able to reach out to one of their apprentices and ordered him to steal the Fatality, an Imperial destroyer that was carrying dozens of the highly advanced HK-51 assassin droids, and break them out of prison. The apprentice complied with their orders, bringing the Fatality to Belsavis\u2014a location which the Republic had worked hard to ensure that the Empire never discovered. Fortunately for the Republic, the rest of the Empire was unaware of the apprentice's purpose or location, so when the prison's defenses shot down the Fatality over the district of Section X, the Republic's secret prison remained secret. However, the Republic was unaware that the Fatality was not destroyed on impact, but had in fact crashed into a frozen lake near Section X where it would remain for the next three decades."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The HK-51 droids aboard the Fatality remained frozen and deactivated until 3639 BBY, when the recently-freed Dread Masters brought the Dread Guard\u2014an army of Imperials and other individuals under their mental control\u2014back to Section X and began to excavate the destroyer while also pursuing other goals in the area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle above Belsavis was first mentioned in several promotional releases for Game Update 1.5 of the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, as the update featured the addition of Section X and a series of missions that allowed players to acquire HK-51 as a companion.
