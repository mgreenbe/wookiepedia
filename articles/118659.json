In 10 ABY, during the reborn Emperor Palpatine's insurrection, the Empire retook Balmorra and all the remaining SD-9s were sold into the Imperial arsenal. The Emperor also assigned Umak Leth\u2014the creator of the World Devastators and the Galaxy Gun\u2014to work with the Balmorran engineers.

The Balmorrans also unleashed their new X-1 Vipers. This was to counter-act Sedriss' Shadow Droids.
