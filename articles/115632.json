The flotilla was made up of seven vessels carrying what remained of the planet Alderaan, which had been destroyed by the Galactic Empire. While the ships were gathered in the remains of Alderaan within the Alderaan system, the Sunspire's sensors picked up several large ships approaching. Worried, Beagle reported via hologram to the Alderaanians' Regent Administrator Eglyn Valmor, but then quickly announced that the ships had New Republic code clearance. The new ships turned out to be bringing the wreckage of the Death Star to the flotilla as a gift from the New Republic, which some then suggested should be used to build a space station for the Alderaanians to live on."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rickert Beagle first appeared in the novel Aftermath: Life Debt, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released in 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
