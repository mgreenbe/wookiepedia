Upon arrival on the so-called 'night planet', the Jedi found themselves plunged into darkness. Mace Windu had feared that such a place would be perfect for an ambush, and he was proved right when swarms of Shadowmen warriors attacked the two Jedi. Using a variety of weapons, including sonic blasters, the Shadowmen almost overwhelmed the two Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using the Force, the Jedi were able to defend themselves and found their way to a secret Separatist base. Relying entirely on their Jedi senses, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker staged a hasty assault on the foundry, cutting down several battle droids as they ascended the steps to the main entrance. Skywalker planted a charge in the base, and the two Jedi fled before the entire facility was consumed by the resulting explosion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
