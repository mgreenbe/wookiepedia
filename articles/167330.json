A landspeeder capable of turbothrust could safely tolerate a 1000z buildup. The manufacturers would install low gauge turbothrust converter coils to prevent them from exceeding that amount. Rebel General Airen Cracken thought to exchange these for larger gauge versions from more powerful machines, increasing the craft's top speed. However, this procedure would allow the machine to surpass its intended buildup limit, possibly disabling the craft. Cracken himself totaled two speeders this way."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The z unit was mentioned in Cracken's Rebel Field Guide, a 1991 in-universe supplement to Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game written by Christopher Kubasik."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
