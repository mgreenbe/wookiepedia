The visors of Mandalorian helmets and clone commando helmets contained HUDs that provided information to the user and were capable of searching databases or uploading maps. The clones became somewhat dependent on the information the HUD gave them, and often felt handicapped when their helmets were off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Specifically, Boba Fett's helmet contained a very advanced HUD, which featured information on the surrounding environment as well as a 360-degree field of vision. In addition, an advanced radar allowed his HUD to provide information on nearby rooms, and could be used to scan the HoloNet and connect with databases, allowing him to perform tasks which would normally require a computer terminal, such as trading on the stock market and buying real estate, from anywhere that was accessible through the HoloNet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
