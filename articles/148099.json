Tracker along with Threepwood and Boil accompanied the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker during a mission to hunt down the Sith fugitives Count Dooku and Quinlan Vos, who had escaped from Republic custody and crash-landed their ship, the Banshee, on Christophsis. Tracker found blood at the crash site, and the Jedi-Republic party deduced that the fugitives had survived but were injured. Shortly, Republic forces launched an attack on the Separatist base on Christophsis, leading to the Second battle of Christophsis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
