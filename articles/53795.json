Around the year 18 BBY, Geniserian sand monkey meat flamb\u00e9ed in foyv\u00e8 oil was a rare dish that was considered a delicacy by some individuals. Despite the rarity of the species around that time, an Elomin named Haninum Tyk Rhinann successfully obtained a dish of Geniserian sand monkey meat flamb\u00e9ed in foyv\u00e8 oil on the planet Coruscant, the Galactic Empire's capital. The Elomin provided the dish to satisfy the epicurean tastes of a client of a private investigator named Jax Pavan, with whom Rhinann worked."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Geniserian sand monkey was first mentioned in Coruscant Nights II: Street of Shadows, a 2008 novel written by Michael Reaves.
