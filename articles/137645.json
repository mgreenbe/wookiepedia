Two swarms intermingled during swarm dances; males from each swarm fertilized the eggs of females from other swarm. Each swarm created globules of protein paste in which two thirds of the females laid their eggs. The two swarms then created a globule between them which belonged to neither swarm. The remaining third of the eggs from both swarms were laid in the globule and abandoned with the intention that the eggs would mature into a new swarm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
