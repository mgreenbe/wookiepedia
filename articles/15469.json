Following Embo's response, Netal replied that she would do more than try and capture it, she would succeed. After paying Embo the credits they agreed upon, he told her that he had heard the ship had surfaced somewhere.

During this, Moloch, who served the White Worms, captured Han and Chewbacca and brought them to Proxima. Proxima told Han he would be punished because he owed her coaxium and had given her face scars from the sunlight. Chewbacca gave Han a thermal detonator which he used to explode the window which brought in sunlight. The sunlight damaged Proxima's face again and blinded her right eye as Han and Chewbacca made their escape.
