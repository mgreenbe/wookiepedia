Ascendants using this spell enter a deep meditation in which they shield their presence from other Ta-Ree or Force users. While in the meditative state, casters still dehydrate and hunger normally, and they must bring themselves out of the state. Initiates learning cloak presence were known to have died during the training when they were unable to bring themselves out of the meditation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ascendants under the effects of cloak presence were difficult to detect by individuals using either the Force or Ta-Ree abilities. The caster was required to know the trance spell to successfully learn the cloak presence spell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
