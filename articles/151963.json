When a team of clone troopers lead by Jedi generals Plo Koon and Anakin Skywalker and commander Ahsoka Tano arrived on the planet to take down the Separatist stronghold, TZ-33 ordered all of the droids inside the facility to form up for a counter attack and engage the Republicans in battle. In the end the battle was lost by the Separatist forces and all of the droids, including this one, were destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This B1 battle droid, like every battle droid in The Clone Wars movie and The Clone Wars TV series, was voiced by Matthew Wood.
