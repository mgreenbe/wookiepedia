She possessed magical powers, being able to transform into multiple shards of white light, and although she was not Force-sensitive, her powers stemmed from the Light side of the Force. During the Clone Wars, she and the Kindalo, a species native to Aleen's underworld, caused groundquakes that would effect Aleen's surface, because the Great Seal, which served as a barrier between Aleen's surface and underworld, was displaced. The Seal was sacred to Orphne and the Kindalo, and they believed that it was attacked by the Aleena.
