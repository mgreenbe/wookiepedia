Republic forces were able to seal the base before any of the viral agent could be released into Naboo's atmosphere, but with the exception of Jar Jar Binks, all others were infected by the virus. Skywalker and Kenobi were safely outside the lab when it was sealed, having apprehended doctor Vindi before he could escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Skywalker and Kenobi went in search of a cure for the virus, Commander Ahsoka Tano led what remained of her team, including Rex and some clone troopers, to eliminate any remaining Separatist droids who were attempting to break out of the facility and thereby release the plague onto the surface of Naboo. They succeeded in destroying all remnants of battle droids before they could escape the facility, realizing they were likely sealed in their own tomb. However, Skywalker and Kenobi returned with a cure to the deadly Blue Shadow Virus and rescued their trapped comrades."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
