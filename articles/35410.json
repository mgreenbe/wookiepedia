In 44 ABY, his parents owed Garik \"Face\" Loran a favor, so Davian decided to pay Loran back by hacking into classified Galactic Alliance files in order to look into the disappearance of Alliance vessels. Davian's contribution to Loran's investigation was invaluable because it pointed to corrupt General Stavin Thaal as the culprit, who had already been under investigation by two Wraith Squadron units for his involvement with the Lecersen Conspiracy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
