Ikopis were also found on a ocean planet. They had gold-colored coats of short fur, large floppy ears, and four twisting antlers. They had hollow tongues, which were up to two, to three times longer than their own head. They were used to slurp up water or nectar. The species were fast runners, and so were a favored game animal on Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
