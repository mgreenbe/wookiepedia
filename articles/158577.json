The Ka'hren researcher interpreted prophecies written in the ancient texts to mean that he was destined to become the Third Prophet, a restorer of the worship of Ni'Shaw. This prompted Naklian to immediately form the new religion of Ni'Shaw-Dak Ministry, which became the fastest-growing faith on V'shar. Ni'Shaw-Dak had over a thousand priests across the planet, with Naklian serving as the religion's leader. Due to its large membership, Ni'Shaw-Dak Ministry became a prominent force in V'shar politics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The other way in which the writings found in the V'shar cavern changed Naklian's life was that the information on the rantok weapon contained within allowed him to become proficient in the use of the ancient blade, over time becoming regarded by his own people as the best rantok wielder in history. Eventually, the Ka'hren scholar resigned from the position he had held for years at the University of Timb and left V'shar to become a respected \"scalp hunter,\" hunting members of furred species regardless of their sentience.
