At some point, numerous species, including an argora, an acklay, a mordon, a dianoga, and multiple tookas were being transported to the zoo. However, Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka boarded the freighter carrying the animals, and released all of them in an attempt to locate the argora. The Rebel cell known as the Spectres later arrived, and rescued all of the animals from the freighter while returning the argora to its home planet, saving them from captivity in the zoo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
