Under DeFalco's guidance, Marvel entered a phase of expansion that provided an opportunity for an army of \"new talent\" to enter the comic book industry, and released a number of new titles with original characters. After clashing with the company's upper management, DeFalco was fired in 1994. During the year following his departure, Marvel decided to distribute its own comics and sales on most of Marvel's core titles sagged. At the same time, the company's finances entered a crisis point amidst accusations that owner Ronald Perelman had strip-mined the company for his own gain. Initially the position of overall Editor-in-Chief was scrapped in favor of breaking the line into five sub-sections with their own group editors.
