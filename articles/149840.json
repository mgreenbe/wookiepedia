The threat was reported by Republic Security Zone Monitoring Satellite 777B-Alpha, in the orbit of the planet Trymant IV. The only Jedi Order or Galactic Republic starship within range was the Padawan Academic Cruiser Star Hopper, which immediately diverted to assist. At the same time, the Nihil pirates took advantage of the situation to evacuate select individuals from Bralanak City, including members of the Elders of the Path, before launching an attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
