If rebels eliminated rival mercenary groups, Jabba would trade valuable intelligence on the Galactic Empire's operations on Tatooine. After the rebels had defeated the mercenaries, and the arrangement was broken off due to the rebels themselves receiving intelligence on the Empire, they were attacked by Jabba and his own mercenary forces, yet were able to defeat them and discourage further attacks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "An alliance formed"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After upgrades to the Rebel Alliance base of operations, Colonel Jennica Pierce contacted Agent Saponza and Saponza's partner with an interesting proposition by Jabba the Hutt. The proposition was that if the rebels eliminated several mercenaries, the Hutt Clan would trade valuable intelligence on the Galactic Empire. Saponza was skeptical of the proposition but agreed regardless. The rebels were then contacted by Bib Fortuna, Jabba's majordomo, and received orders from him to destroy a mercenary base, a task which the rebels accomplished. Fortuna contacted them again, elaborating that Jabba is in several disputes with mercenary groups, including the group that the rebels had defeated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Operations continue"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After defeating more mercenary groups on behalf of Jabba, Fortuna stated that at least one of the groups had strong influences throughout the galaxy.

After the arrangement was broken, the rebel base was attacked by mercenaries, though the attack was fought off. After building up their defenses, the rebels attacked an Imperial base to retrieve sensitive information. After another upgrade to the rebels' base, Pierce contacted the rebels and informed them that the mercenary groups were working with the Empire, and that the rebels would continue to work with Jabba's forces to destroy those mercenary groups."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Overcoming a betrayal"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After defeating more mercenary bases, Pierce informed the rebels that the final mercenary base had been discovered, though she expressed caution in dealing with the Hutts.
