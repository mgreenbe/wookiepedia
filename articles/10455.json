She was the lover of fellow Gotal Goethar Kleej, and together the two produced a son named Aubin. Around the time of the ignition of the Mandalorian Wars, the Gotal and the rest of her family were captured by The Crucible, a brutal slaving organization structured around aggression and violence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aubin had difficulties sorting through the extra-sensory signals that Gotals received through their cones, so he relied heavily on his mother to function on a day-to-day basis. His dependency was particularly pronounced after Chantique, the leader of the slave ring, severed Goethar's horns, thereby depriving him of cone-reliant sensory information and the ability to connect with his son on that level. Aubin's mother was later killed by The Crucible, resulting in her son's descent into silent agony."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aubin Kleej's mother received her first and only mention in Knights of the Old Republic 40, an issue of the Knights of the Old Republic comic series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
