Assisted by Luke Skywalker, the rebels destroyed the KX-series security droids at the facility, securing its fuel supplies. As the rebels departed aboard Imperial Support Vessel 49AX3, an Imperial II-class Star Destroyer arrived at the facility, deploying TIE/ln space superiority starfighter. During the skirmish, Darth Sidious attempted to use a Force vision to manipulate Skywalker and turn him against his fellow rebels.
