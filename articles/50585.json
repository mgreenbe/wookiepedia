When he constructed the weapon, Nadd utilized a rubat lightsaber crystal in the blade and chose a straight, cylindrical hilt style. After training with and later killing Naga Sadow, the Sith lightsaber was part of Nadd's personal arsenal when he brought his dark rule to the planet Onderon. Only someone who had embraced the dark side could wield the lightsaber. In 3951 BBY, companions of Meetra Surik broke into the tomb of Freedon Nadd on Onderon's moon, Dxun, in order to prevent the Sith from aiding a coup d'etat on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The trio claimed the lightsaber from Nadd's sarcophagus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Freedon Nadd's lightsaber was first alluded to in 2001's The Dark Side Sourcebook.
