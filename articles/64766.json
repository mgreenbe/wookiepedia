They compensated for that with a long, tube-like tongue, roughly two to three times longer than their head, to reach and grasp food far above their reach. The tongue was hollow, which allowed them to suck up water below their knees, as well as to drink nectar, like a straw. When not being used, the ikopi's tongue would coil up inside the animal's cheek sack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A tallish mammal with long, telescopic legs for fast locomotion, the ikopi was less a swimmer than a runner and swift forder of swamps.
