Using the glass key, the Prince activated the giant. However, the Jedi Master Mace Windu attempted to stop him and damaged the key, which made the giant uncontrollable. The two decided to work together to disable the enormous machine: the Jedi went to retrieve the key, while the Prince went inside the Ardana Shadex through its mouth and hit the dead switch. The resulting explosions destroyed the giant, killing the prince who was still inside it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Simocadia, the Republic took possession of the Ardana Shadex to study the ancient technology.
