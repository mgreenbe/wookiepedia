The combined forces of the Shu-Torun Loyalist/Imperial Delving Fleet ultimately secured the decisive victory, bringing an end to the war and the insurrection of the ore-dukes.

Trios obeyed her father's commands, and was waiting for Vader with two guards when he landed on one of the palace's landing platforms in his TIE Advanced x1 starfighter. The Sith was displeased that the king himself was not present, but Trios blamed her father's absence on his age and began leading Vader toward the palace's abyssal rooms below the planet's surface, where a ball was being held to showcase Shu-Torun's culture.

As she and Vader moved across the room, they were stopped by Duke Rubix, who demanded that the Sith Lord dance with his daughter Bixene. Trios advised the duke against pushing the matter, but when he persisted in his demands, Vader used the Force to lift Rubix into the air and whirl him around before dropping him.

As the pair supposedly moved toward the king, Vader complimented Trios, and was still impressed with her when the doors of the tunnel they were in sealed and molten lava began pouring in from the ceiling.

After they witnessed the toppling of an Imperial All Terrain Armored Transport in a battle against one of the ore-barons' delving citadels, she declared that their foe was too strong and demanded a retreat.

They then fought through Rubix's men onboard and cut holes in either end of the vessel, leaving it to sink into the magma from which it had emerged as Trios picked them up in the shuttle. Upon arriving back at the retreat, Trios was reprimanded by her chamberlain Jooli, who claimed she should not be putting herself in such danger.

She argued with the chamberlain, but when he would not change his mind she offered him one last chance at blaster point.

With the return of her Imperial allies, Trios knew that she had won the day and was proven correct when Vader forced Rubix to surrender immediately upon Vader's arrival on board the citadel. The baron ordered his men to allow Trios and her troops on board and declared he would recognize her rule. When she reached the traitor, he began to give a speech about his failure, but tired of hearing the baron speak Trios ordered his immediate execution for the thousands of deaths he had caused.

As Vader mounted the ramp to his ship, she asked one final question, wanting to know if Vader thought he had chosen well when he made her queen. The Sith simply replied that she had been the only choice before entering his vessel, but 0-0-0 remained and pointed out that there were multiple possible meanings to Vader's response.
