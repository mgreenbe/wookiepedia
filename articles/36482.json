When active, holomonsters\u2014full-color, three-dimensional hologram playing pieces measuring between 5 and 30 cm tall\u2014would be projected on the board. The pieces all resembled creatures, real and mythic, from throughout the galaxy, including the Mantellian Savrip, Grimtaash, the Molator, Ghhhk, Houjix, Ng'ok, Kintan strider, K'lor'slug and the M'onnok. These pieces, when moved by the player, acted out the moves as if really specimens of their species. If the pieces were not used for a certain amount of time or the game was abandoned by both players, they would simulate boredom."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Major dejarik tournaments included the Galactic Core Interzonals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The kintan strider death gambit was a notable tactic. Another was the fork, in which a player moved one holomonster to threaten at least two of the opponent's, so that no matter what the opponent did one piece would be lost. It was considered a mistake in play to leave oneself vulnerable to a fork. The word fork came to be used as a generic term for facing a choice between two disasters: \"We are well and truly forked.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Millennium Falcon had a dejarik table in its lounge, installed at Chewbacca's urging.
