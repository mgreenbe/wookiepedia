Between them was a holotank with star charts. Each player sent their ships to battle one another in virtual space. The holotank was rigged with sensory feedback, so that the players experienced the sensations of acceleration and battle damage. The game could also be played against a simulated computer player. Starfight consoles were available to patrons of The Free-Flight Dance Dome on Etti IV, aboard the passenger liner Lady of Mindor, and in the amusement pavilion The Palace of Light on Lianna."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
