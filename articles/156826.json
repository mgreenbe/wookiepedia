The camp was designed to search for plasma resources on Naboo and also served as a plasma shipping site for the Trade Federation. The Trade Federation Droid Army began attacking the camp with several tanks, and a ship resembling Borvo's personal transport left the scene during the skirmish. Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes of the Royal Naboo Security Forces' Bravo Flight, traveling in a speeder, was searching for his downed flight leader, Captain Kael, at the same time and discovered the mining operation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After destroying the droids that were attacking the camp, Sykes radioed the mine operator, demanding to know who was in charge there.
