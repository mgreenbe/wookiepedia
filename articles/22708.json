Caleb refused to treat him at first, going so far as to thrust his hand into a cauldron of boiling liquid to demonstrate his impartiality to pain. This implied that he would be immune to any torture that the Sith Lord had planned; they would have no power over him since he accepted his fate. The impossibility of scaring the healer frustrated Bane, however, Bane sensed the nearby presence of Caleb's daughter. After Bane threatened to end her life, Caleb agreed to cure him.

Darovit made a deal with Caleb to heal Bane, as long as Zannah turned herself and Bane in to the Jedi and deactivated their ship, the Loranda. At last Zannah complied and after Caleb healed Bane and removed the orbalisks, he made sure Zannah sent out a message to the Jedi Order that there was a Sith Lord on Ambria, waiting to be arrested. Zannah, however, wished to save Bane and preserve the Order of the Sith Lords, therefore she killed Caleb and drove Darovit insane with her sorcery. Later, she hid Bane and herself in an underground hiding spot of Caleb's, cloaking their presences in the Force. The Jedi arrived and found Caleb's body chopped up outside of his shack. As they neared, Darovit attacked them and was killed almost instantly.

In 980 BBY, Caleb's daughter, who had become Princess Serra of Doan, saw the name while visiting the Temple to negotiate on behalf of her planet.
