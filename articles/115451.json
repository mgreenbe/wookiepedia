Shuttles used by the Republic Medic Corps were known as Republic medical shuttles. The Rho-class largely physically resembled a Nu-class attack/transport shuttle, with key differences being the ability to carry a cargo pod for passengers or supplies, as well as a dorsal wing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rho-class transport shuttle was deployed by the Republic during the Clone Wars. One shuttle was stationed on Abafar, where it was used by Separatist Alliance forces to transport rhydonium from a Separatist mining installation to a stolen Republic Venator-class Star Destroyer. There, the shuttle was retaken by the Republic special forces unit D-Squad, under the command of Colonel Meebur Gascon. Once aboard the Venator, the squad discovered that the ship was under Separatist control while in hyperspace. Evading Separatist droid forces, the Venator eventually reached its destination, the Republic space station Valor. The station was hosting a strategy conference with the high echelons of the Republic Military. There, D-Squad managed to escape from the Venator on the Rho-class shuttle they previously used, and survived the blast when the Venator detonated prematurely."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rho-class transport shuttle was again deployed during the Battle of Ringo Vinda. There, one was used in its medical capacity to transport clone trooper Tup, who had suffered a medical episode and killed Jedi General Tiplar in the middle of battle. Despite being escorted by four ARC-170 starfighters and a small contingent of clone troopers, Separatist forces were able to ambush the shuttle and kidnap the sedated Tup. Later, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, Clone Captain Rex, and ARC trooper Fives investigated the wreckage and launched a mission to recapture their comrade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, another medical shuttle was deployed in the aftermath of the Battle of Ord Mantell, an engagement between the Separatist Alliance and the Shadow Collective. Another Rho-class shuttle was deployed in the aftermath of the Siege of Mandalore between the Republic and the Shadow Collective. There, the shuttle transported the Collective's leader, renegade Sith Lord Maul, to the Venator Tribunal under armed guard."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the reorganization of the Republic into the Galactic Empire at the end of the Clone Wars, the Imperial Military continued to use the Rho-class transport shuttle. Now with Imperial livery, a group of shuttles were used on the Imperial planet Ryloth to transport local Twi'lek workers to an Imperial doonium refinery. Free Ryloth Movement member Hera Syndulla and the young clone Omega of the rogue special forces unit Clone Force 99 stole a Rho-class shuttle from a landing pad and used it to destroy the control systems for the facility's turbolaser defences. As a result, the five autocannons were disabled and open to attack by Clone Force 99's Omicron-class attack shuttle, the Havoc Marauder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
