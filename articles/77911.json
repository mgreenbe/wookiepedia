Krasov participated in several campaigns throughout the Yuuzhan Vong War; most notably she was a member of the Myrkr strike team and was one of many to die during that disastarous mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to Barabel mating customs, it was impossible for Krasov to know if she shared a father with Tesar Sebatyne. However, while aware that she was definitely the sister of Bela Hara, the two referred to themselves as hatchmates, along with Tesar. The three were each trained in the ways of the Jedi by Tesar's mother, Saba Sebatyne. Krasov's experiences with her two hatchmates resulted in them sharing an extremely strong connection through the Force, which served them well as members of the Wild Knights; allowing them to sense the intentions and feelings of the others during combat."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Yuuzhan Vong War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Saba decided that her three apprentices would go to the Jedi academy to continue their Force training under Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, the Wild Knights set out for Yavin 4.

The team was tasked with gaining voxyn samples so as to help Cilghal cofirm her theory that voxyn came from a common template.

Krasov was the fifth Jedi to fall during the mission, shortly after her hatchmate Bela. Krasov was struck in the face by acid spat by a voxyn, and slowly succumbed to her wounds. Krasov ensured that she held a thermal detonator as she died. Her body then attracted voxyn, and as they knocked the detonator from her hand, it ignited, killing several voxyn and allowing the remainder of the strike team, except Anakin Solo, to survive the mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
