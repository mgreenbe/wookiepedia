Initially released on February 21, 2020, the theme is played throughout that season and in Star Wars: The Bad Batch to represent Clone Force 99. It is also played during the end credits of the episodes of The Bad Batch, where it is followed by Omega's theme. Dave Filoni told Dean, Sean, and Kevin Kiner that Clone Force 99 were a group of misfits like those in The Dirty Dozen, and so the composers watched the films The Dirty Dozen, Guns of Navarone, and Kelly's Heroes, and listened to their soundtracks. The composers then took the element of misfits from those films and incorporated it into the theme for The Bad Batch."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
