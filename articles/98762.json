These birds could not fly and were known for their stupidity, but were also adaptable and easy to care for. Nunas had spread across the galaxy, prized for their meat and eggs. They were omnivores, feeding mostly on plants and, on rare occasions, fish. An average nuna could feed a family of four. Nunas were also used as a ball in nuna-ball. When nunas became angry or intimidated, they could inflate their body to a larger size. Nunas were capable of growing blue and red feathers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The legs of a nuna could be deep-fried to be food.
