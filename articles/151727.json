The droid was attending to the infants in the nursery when the bounty hunter Vianna D'Pow infiltrated the nursery, looking for a Sullustan infant. D'Pow depowered the droid with an electrical device in order to avoid detection. Later, when all of the infants were awoken by a fight right outside the nursery, their combined call on the Force threw numerous objects, including the droid, across the room."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
