It was comparable in size to a Consular-class space cruiser and had a Corellian Engineering Corporation design aesthetic. After finishing her Anzati training, Aurra Sing took revenge on her kidnappers and stole their blockade runner. Sing would leave the ship adrift as a decoy for pursuers while ambushing them from her starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
