The DF.9 laser cannon was mounted atop a four-meter tower which was heavily-armored and proton-shielded. The DF.9 was mounted on a turret which had a three-hundred and sixty degree field of fire, a rapid firing rate, and a closed canopy. Two crewmembers operated the DF.9/B, both of whom were housed inside the armored tower. The optimum effective range of the weapon was three kilometers, but the DF.9/B's targeting sensors were capable of strike targets at ranges up to sixteen kilometers away. The tower was popular with Imperial governors for defense against dissenting and unarmed populations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
