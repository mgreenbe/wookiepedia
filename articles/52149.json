But Solo is met by Genzhor's assistant, Ooris, who led Han to the pits where the sarlaccs are located. During their walk to the pits, Ooris talked about a battle that took place on the planet, in which the Galactic Empire ravaged the planet's ecosystem but it was later turned into a nature reserve where Imperial officers hunted the exotic animals of the planet. When the group arrived at the sarlacc pits, Han Solo didn't find them appealing to look at, but then Ooris betrayed Han and pushed him into the pits, while the Dowutin workers stunned Chewbacca, trying to get him into the pits with Han. Han landed right near a pit and shot at Ooris. Ooris told Han that he was going to take his ship and its codes to escape the planet with enough frozen sarlacc spores to make him rich. Then one of the workers fell into the pits with Han but was eaten by a baby sarlacc.
