During the Invasion of Naboo by the Trade Federation in 32 BBY, Ceel lead the army in their march towards Theed as a diversion. On the Great Grass Plains south of Theed they met the Trade Federation Droid Army in Battle battle, where General Ceel gave the orders to raise the deflector shields and for the counterattacks after the shields were breached. The Gungan also signalled the order for retreat from the overwhelming battle droids, but was taken prisoner along with the other Gungan commanding officers. The battle was unexpectedly won for the Gungans when the loss of the Droid Control Ship shut down every battle droid on the plains, and Ceel led a victory procession of Gungans in a celebration held in Theed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Gungan general"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tobler Ceel, a male Gungan, was Commander-in-Chief of the Gungan Grand Army on the planet Naboo, in which he also held the rank of general. In the year 32 BBY, Naboo was invaded by the Trade Federation, who after occupying the Human Naboo's capital city of Theed, turned their attentions to pacifying the Gungans to prevent any reprisal attacks. The Trade Federation discovered the Gungan city of Otoh Gunga and drove the inhabitants out, although many were able to escape in a mass evacuation and rallied at their Sacred Place. The Gungan military leadership, including General Ceel and Captain Roos Tarpals, immediately began planning retaliatory attacks. Their plans involved strategic guerilla warfare raids on Trade Federation forces, where Gungans would perform hit-and-runs before disappearing into the swamps."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ceel's plans went unfulfilled when the Monarch of Naboo, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, formed an alliance with the Gungan leader, Boss Rugor Nass. They planned to retake their planet by amassing the Gungan Grand Army on a march towards Theed as a diversion while the Naboo infiltrated the capital. Ceel knew that the Gungans would need to make use of their fambaa-mounted energy shields to withstand the Trade Federation's artillery. His plan was to force the Trade Federation B1-Series battle droids into close-quarters combat, where the Gungans stood a better chance of defeating them, or could at least hold them off until Queen Amidala captured the Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ceel rode at the front of the army as its leader, along with the new Bombad General Jar Jar Binks, who had been personally promoted by Nass. Ceel disapproved of Binks' promotion, giving him no practical responsibilities in the army other than to set an example by dying well. Ceel had hoped to position the army atop Shaak Ridge south of Theed, using the high ground as a vantage point to decimate the Trade Federation machinery with energy catapults and snipers wielding atlatls and cestas. But the Trade Federation anticipated the Gungans procession early and claimed the Ridge first, which was discovered by scouts under Ceel's command. The general was disappointed in the lack of strategic maneuverability, but knew that the Plains' proximity to the swamps would allow the Gungans to make a quick retreat if necessary."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The heat of battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Riding at the head of the army alongside his command unit, General Ceel personally hand signalled the troops to halt. Ceel activated the shield generators, covering the whole army in a force field. The Trade Federation Armored Assault Tanks fired on the shield, but it was found to be impregnable, causing the Gungans to cheer. In response the Trade Federation began unloading B1-Series battle droids from their Multi-Troop Transports, which caused concern amongst Ceel and the Gungan commanders. The battle droids were able to walk right through the shields and begin firing on the Gungans, which prompted Ceel to order his militiagungs to counterattack with atlatls, cestas, and electropoles. Multiple waves of battle droids were destroyed, but as the fighting escalated Ceel tightened his forces around the shield generators, aware of the danger the Trade Federation tanks would pose if they could strike the Gungan army. The fighting grew to such an intense state that the general had to commit all of his reserve troops."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, droidekas breached the force field and destroyed the shield generators, opening up the Gungans to tank fire. Ceel realized that the battle had been lost and signalled for the retreat to the swamps. A majority of the Gungans were not able to escape, including the general, who was taken prisoner on the battlefield and held near the other officers, including General Binks. Ceel and Binks expressed concern about their situation, hoping that Amidala's plan had still been successful. The Gungans were unexpectedly saved when Anakin Skywalker, who had accidentally joined Naboo's Bravo Flight in space, destroyed Trade Federation's Droid Control Ship Vuutun Palla. The loss of the ship quickly deactivated every battle droid on the Great Grass Plains. Confused at the development, Ceel urged Binks to investigate, and an unresponsive droid fell to the ground at his touch. The Gungans realized their seemingly impossible victory and cheered. Ceel and Binks would later lead the Gungans on kaadu mounts in a celebration of Naboo's freedom in Theed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a high-ranking career officer in the Gungan Grand Army, Tobler Ceel had a tactical mind, crafting multiple strategies during the Invasion of Naboo to protect his people. In his capacity as a general, Ceel wielded command over the entire Gungan Grand Army, and was responsible for directing its movements during the Battle of Naboo. He grunted sourly after learning of Jar Jar Binks' promotion in the army, telling the notoriously clumsy Gungan to die well. Ceel was a male Gungan of the Otolla lineage, and he had yellow eyes, and purple and white skin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of the Great Grass Plains and the celebration held at the end of the invasion, Ceel rode atop a kaadu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "General Ceel was present in drafts of the 1999 film The Phantom Menace, written by George Lucas, but the character was not included in the film, with Holocron continuity database manager Leland Chee confirming his lines were spoken by Captain Tarpals instead. However, the novelization by Terry Brooks and the junior novelization by Patricia C. Wrede both include Ceel role in the battle and Tarpals is not mentioned as being present. Ceel's full name was first given in the 2000 Star Wars Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook as an example Gungan name.
