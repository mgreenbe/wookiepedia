It is played by flutes in scenes accompanying Bodhi Rook's position as a rebel messenger. While Giacchino made use of the musical figure as a leitmotif in the score of Rogue One, the musical motion was originally written by John Williams and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra for the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In A New Hope, the motif is played when Luke Skywalker first discovers the holographic message recorded by the rebel princess Leia Organa. In the score of Rogue One, the messenger motif is first played when Saw Gerrera's Partisans bring Bodhi Rook, a defected Imperial pilot and the messenger of the rebel Galen Walton Erso, to their Jedha base at the Catacombs of Cadera. The motif is also played when the rebel agent Cassian Jeron Andor finds Rook imprisoned at the Partisans' base, and again when Rook transmits codes to the Imperial Shield Gate over Scarif. Fragments of the motif are played when Cassian Jeron Andor and Jyn Erso contact Bodhi Rook before they part ways with K-2SO at the Scarif vault."}]}
