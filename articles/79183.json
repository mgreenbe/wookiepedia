General Whorm Loathsom and Nuvo Vindi were each known to possess one of these droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droids had a high voice and spoke in either an odd language, consisting of changing high and lower pitch, or in Basic. The model had ear-like attachments on the head that could be used to hold a hologram transmission projector. They were also known to use their hands to dust off seats that their master was about to sit on. One of their common tasks was to fetch refreshments. Others were used as waiters, or for carrying luggage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Much like certain protocol droid models, assistant droids seemed to have somewhat cowardly personalities, due to their self-preservation programming. They would often attempt to run or hide during violent altercations. However, when backed into a corner they could turn violent if threatened. For instance, Nuvo Vindi's servant droid, LEP-86C8, lashed out at Padm\u00e9 Amidala while securing a virus bomb. More proof assistant droids have self-preservation programming is that during the battle of Christophosis, Loathsom's servant would prefer to ride in the inside of Loathsom's tank instead of the exposed commander's hatch in the tank."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, it was possible to modify the droid to make it more aggressive and allow it to fulfill a bodyguard role. This involved upgrading the shell to make the droid sturdier and installing a blaster pistol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The LEP-Series was originally designed for childcare and was well received. Unfortunately, a design flaw in the locking storage on the droid caused children to become trapped and this greatly damaged the company's image. They then changed their approach and marketed the droid as a servant droid, a role which it also excelled in. The droids were built on the manufacturing world Teagan along with PK-series worker droids during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Whorm Loathsom received an assistant droid and kept it nearby during the Battle of Christophsis. Soon, this droid could only watch helplessly as General Obi-Wan Kenobi captured its master seconds before being destroyed. Later, on Naboo, Doctor Nuvo Vindi had his assistant droid, LEP-86C8, take a virus bomb back to the bomb containment area. This droid eventually would resort to running away from clone troopers to complete this task and soon end up with only the virus container. The droid figured if he could release the virus, Vindi's plot could succeed. The little droid did succeed in releasing the virus, forcing Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker to find a cure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another unknown unit was present at the Republic Executive Building when it was seized by the bounty hunter Cad Bane. It unsuccessfully tried to escape before being shot and destroyed by one of the bounty hunters. The Mandalorian Duchess Satine Kryze was known to have many of these droids working on board her private yacht, the Coronet. There were some on a Coruscant docking bay working for the Galactic Republic. There were also some on Alderaan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known units"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The design of of the LEP servant droid can be dated back to early concept art by Doug Chiang for Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars, the LEP Servant Droid is featured as playable character, although it is incapable of doing anything useful.
