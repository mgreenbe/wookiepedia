It was a vaguely humanoid unit measuring 1.9 meters in height, with two fine-control manipulator arms and two legs possessing a suspension system that cushioned its steps. It was built with an advanced protocol chip for communicating with organic scientists, a molecular microscope and sophisticated olfactory analysis technology, and an \"endosystem\" designed to mount accessories on six ports located in its upper torso. The droid's success in the Imperial Military led TelBrinTel to create the civilian S2R(A) model, designed to match the original droid's performance but with security features preventing it from working on weapons or military projects."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Science Research Droid was a first-degree droid of the biological science class measuring 1.9 meters tall and having a vaguely humanoid appearance. It possessed a highly advanced protocol chip in its droid brain, enabling it to engage in \"creative brainstorming\" sessions with living coworkers. Its monocular eyepiece contained a high-powered, multi-spectrum molecular microscope, and it possessed olfactory sensors and a sophisticated olfactory databank and analysis package. Its two arms were designed for fine control and manipulation, and its two legs were equipped with a suspension system that cushioned each step, preventing unstable chemicals and compounds from potentially dangerous jarring. The droid's upper torso held its \"endosystem,\" a marketable feature that provided six ports on the droid's vertebrae for the attachment of dockable accessories. These accessories could include additional arms, work surfaces, or small tools or injection needles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galactic Empire commissioned the Science Research Droid from TelBrinTel Corporation for use in the Imperial Military's chemical and biological weapon programs, and also for research into new armor and power-guidance systems for the Imperial Navy. The droid, designated the \"S2R droid\" by the military, first reached Imperial research centers in large numbers immediately after the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY. A large portion of this initial shipment wound up in the hands of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Despite this, the droid's performance in the Imperial Military was regarded as a marked success, leading to production of a civilian-oriented model. This model, the S2R(A), performed many of the same functions as the initial model, though hardwired protocols prevented the droids from knowingly working on weaponry or projects with military applications. These protocols could be bypassed, but secret programming installed by TelBrinTel would then kick in, causing the modified droid to modify chemical formulas so that the resultant products were inert."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The original Science Research Droid caught the attention of Toria Tell, a droid inventor and collector who maintained \"Toria Tell's Droid Journal,\" a small, private scandoc distributed in a limited fashion around the galaxy. The droid was also featured in Version 4.7.110 of Cynabar's Droid Datalog, which discussed both the S2R and S2R(A) models. There, Tell added commentary to the droid's entry, informing readers of the surreptitious programming added by TelBrinTel to thwart those who bypass the hardwired protocols of the S2R(A). Another reader, a slicer using the pseudonym \"Ranger,\" confirmed Tell's information. Ranger had been hired by Rebels to remove such safeguards in similar droids, and noted that the TelBrinTel subroutines were quite subtle, hard to locate, and deeply ingrained in the droid's systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Numerous TelBrinTel science droids were used by the Baobab Archives, which assigned many of them to analyze the Dha Werda Verda, an ancient poem etched into Roonstones discovered by the merchant Mungo Baobab."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One notable Science Research Droid was Geth. This droid had been modified by former Rebel General Reesen Jivrak, who had been ejected from the Rebel Alliance for his unethical and cruel conduct. He used Geth to create toxins that would strengthen and enrage the docile deripors of Ohratuu for use as mounts in hit-and-run attacks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Science Research Droid was introduced in Toria Tell's Droid Journal, an article written and illustrated by Christian Piccolo, published in Star Wars Adventure Journal 10 in May 1996."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
