This culminated in the group being chase into the Coruscant underworld by the Jedi where Bane and his group jumped between oncoming speeders, which drew the attention of crowds of people, including the Martez family. Eventually, Bane shot the engine of a transport ship, sending it spiraling out of control and towards a populated landing platform. The Jedi managed to steer it away from the heavily populated area, but instead sent it crashing into the side of the same Underworld portal where the Martez family lived. Seeing the oncoming danger, Trace and Rafa's parents rushed to evacuate them from their home; however, before their parents could escape along with them, the transport crashed into the portal wall, killing both of the Martez sisters' parents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of Ziro's escape, the Jedi came back to inspect the collateral damage that had been caused by the transport's crash. A green-skinned Jedi soon came over to the grieving sisters and simply told them that she needed to make a choice, but that they shouldn't worry as the Force would be with them before departing. This left Trace and Rafa embittered against the Jedi Order both for their role in the death of their parents and their attempt to comfort the sisters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orphaned, the two sisters began to dream of leaving Coruscant to \"escape from the war.\" In order to accomplish this goal, Trace attempted to earn as much money as she could by working as a mechanic within the repair shop she had inherited from her parents and began slowly piecing together a Nebula-class freighter that she named the Silver Angel.

Trace also had a sense of morality and responsibility as she was bothered by Rafa making shady dealings with criminals, though Trace knew that her sister was only doing it so the two of them could survive. Unlike Rafa, Trace was very trustworthy to individuals whom she befriended, such as Ahsoka. When Trace found out Ahsoka lied to her about being a former Padawan, Trace was hurt and angry, but quickly forgave Ahsoka and still regarded her a friend."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trace could also be na\u00efve and impulsive. On a mission to deliver spice to the Pyke Syndicate, she heard that the Pykes might damage her beloved ship, the Silver Angel. So, she decided to dump the spice instead of losing her ship.
