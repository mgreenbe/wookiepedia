It was a circular white building with eight spires, and in 40 ABY it was the headquarters for the Tralus Ground Occupation Forces, housing the city's shield generators. It was destroyed in the Battle of Tralus.\nHan Solo and Wedge Antilles were two of the ones responsible for its destruction while flying the new shriek class bombers. The new bombers confused the GA forces. It is debated that Leia Organa Solo was committing treason by confusing the GA forces and sending Han classified information to save hers and Wedge's families."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
