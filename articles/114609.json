Jinn and other Wookiees had previously been captured by the Trandoshans during a Life Day celebration. His apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Wookiee leader Brennonn developed a plan to free the Jedi and the Wookiees. Kenobi tricked Trandoshan leader, Korgan into believing that he had surrendered. While Korgan was distracted, Kenobi used the Force to open Jinn's cage. Jinn then grabbed his lightsaber, which was with Kenobi and joined forces with him. Korgan was still unintimidated but then Wookiee calls roared throughout the forest as armed Wookiees appeared lead by Brennonn. Korgan then agreed to surrender. The Jedi and the Wookiees then went back to the village to continue the Life Day celebration."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
