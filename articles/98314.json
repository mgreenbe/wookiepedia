Norys believed that Zekk could be useful as his right-hand man, but Zekk rejected the proposal because he did not want to be associated with a bully like Norys. Norys had a mixed reaction to the perceived slight. On one hand, he did not mind it if Zekk was maimed or killed by one of the members of his gang. On the other hand, he kept his invitation open."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On another occasion, Zekk led four other youths into the hideout of the Lost Ones. Zekk then began to denounce Norys's character. At this, Norys and his gang came down through the ceiling to surround the group of interlopers, of which four were Jedi trainees.
