It was 1,200km in diameter with 0.15 standard gravity and practically no atmosphere, which meant that repulsorlift vehicles were useless. It was the location of Tembora Research Station during the Clone Wars. The station was attacked by Separatist forces during the Clone Wars and the only ship guarding it, the Myrkos, was badly damaged, plunging into Tembora\u2014creating a two-kilometer-wide crater and causing Tembora's orbit to change. The Republic Army Weapons Research Department scientists at the station developed the KLR series combat droids, but the prototype KLR-B1 killed the scientists as well as whomever crashed on the moon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
