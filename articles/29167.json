The shock wave was strong enough to knock people off their feet. Since the technology required for these weapons was more complex than common blaster weapons, only Arakyd Industries and BlasTech Industries produced them. As a sonic weapon, a lightsaber-wielder would not be able to deflect this weapon with a lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One notable model was the Stouker concussion rifle, a weapon used extensively by the Trandoshan Sissk gang.
