Passing through his studies at the Coruscant Jedi Temple academy, Kcaj graduated and was selected by a Jedi Master for one-on-one training as a Padawan. After years of study and field work, Kcaj passed his Trials of Knighthood and was made a Jedi Knight by the High Council. Further work on behalf of the Order and independent study into the ways of the Force saw Kcaj join the ranks of Jedi Masters, the highest rank along the Jedi Path."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following years of tension between the Separatist Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Galactic Republic, the conflict came to a head on Geonosis with the capture of Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Under the leadership of Master of the Order Mace Windu, Master Kcaj was part of the strike team that landed around the Petranaki arena on an extraction mission. Storming the arena, Kcaj fought along his brother and sister Jedi, including fellow Ongree Jedi Pablo-Jill, cutting down countless battle droids. Surviving the conflict, Kcaj returned to the Jedi Temple and accepted the rank of General within the newly created Grand Army of the Republic."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi High Council"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After nearly two years of fighting, circa 20 BBY, Master Kcaj was approached by the Jedi leadership and offered a seat on the Jedi High Council. He would help shape the Republic war effort for the remainder of the conflict."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after his ascension to the Council in 20 BBY, Kcaj attended a session of the High Council where the holographic form of Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin addressed the High Council. At that time, fugitive Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano had escaped Republic captivity and had been re-captured to be put on trial. The Admiral went on to suggest what would happen to her, and once the transmission ended, this generated debate between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Mace Windu."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some months later, Kcaj participated via hologram when the High Council reviewed reports of a clone trooper who murdered the Jedi Master Tiplar and was being assessed for mental illness or defection to the enemy. The Council eventually concluded that the specialists at the Temple were best equipped to investigate the clone's condition."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the deceased Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas' ship was found by Jedi Master Plo Koon. During a Council meeting, Koon presented the lightsaber of the fallen Jedi, worrying the Council. Then, Obi-Wan Kenobi revealed that during his Jango Fett investigation, it was Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas that ordered the production of the clones, without the consent of the council or the Galactic Senate. Mace Windu then revealed that Dyas had sat on the council years prior to the war and Kcaj's appointment, but was removed because his ideas were judged too extreme. Later, Kcaj and the rest of the Council were informed by Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker after the death of Prime Minister Lom Pyke that it was Dooku that had the clones created. Windu then said that if this had gotten out into the public, then all respect towards the Jedi, the Republic, and the war would disappear, causing mass chaos, so, Kcaj and the Council were forced to keep this new development secret. Sometime later, Kcaj was present when the Council meditated with Yoda, but could not hear the voices that the elderly Jedi Master could. After this, Ki-Adi-Mundi started to become suspicious and pointed out that the Dark Lord of the Sith could be using Yoda to destroy the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Fall of the Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly following the battle over Coruscant, Kcaj attended a performance of Squid Lake at the Galaxies Opera House, where he was seen speaking with Senator Sweitt Concorkill shortly before the show."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the following days, Jedi Anakin Skywalker was appointed to the High Council by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, an unprecedented move that disturbed the Council. Not long after this event, the Chancellor was revealed to be the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, the orchestrator of the entire war, and the puppet master of both the Republic and the Confederacy. The majority of the High Council was killed in what became known as the Great Jedi Purge."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Jedi Order disbanded and its members hunted to near extinction, all traces of Kcaj disappeared. In the junk heaps of Raxus Prime, the diminutive Knight Kazdan Paratus succumbed to insanity, building a replica of the Coruscant Jedi Temple. Filling the junk edifice with puppets of his peers, Paratus filled the seats of his makeshift High Council Chamber with a replica of each Councilor, including Kcaj. Spending years among the puppets, Paratus was eventually hunted down in 3 BBY by Sith Lord Darth Vader's secret apprentice, Starkiller. During their confrontation, Paratus manipulated the puppets with the Force, ordering them to attack the assassin. Chopping through the Kcaj puppet just as he did the others, Starkiller slew Paratus and left the replica Temple to crumble."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Coleman Kcaj was created as a Master on the Jedi High Council for Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. A completely CGI rendered figure, his model was created based on an altered version of Jedi Pablo-Jill. Named Sweitt Concorkill in the Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith: The Visual Dictionary, the name was later changed and Concorkill became the name of a Vurk Senator also seen in the film. Revised in the Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, the image of Kcaj was replaced with the correct depiction of Concorkill. The name Coleman Kcaj, is in reference to Rob Coleman's son, Jack, with Kcaj being the reversed spelling of Jack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
