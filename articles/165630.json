When the ship was damaged and stuck out in the Unknown Regions, Xarval found the engines to be completely useless, and was angry to find that non-emergency power was being shunted to the ship's research labs. As time went on, Xarval and other crewmembers suspected Chief Diirn of hoarding food in the lab, but when they broke into the lab, Xarval and the others were killed by Specimen Gamma 19."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
