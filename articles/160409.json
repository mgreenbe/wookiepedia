It was disguised as a basic New Republic transport, trying to bypass the New Republic's efforts to de-militarize. Jamoreesa made special modifications to the ship, outfitting it with military-grade weapons. Sometime following the Battle of Endor around 7 ABY, Han Solo and Lando Calrissian used the ship to travel to Substation Grimdock, a New Republic prison complex."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
