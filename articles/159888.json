The Sword was equipped with the experimental Null Cannons as part of a massive fleet that was preparing for an invasion of the Imperial capital of Dromund Kaas, but the fleet was ambushed by the Imperial Navy near the Hoth system. The ship survived for several days until the battle reached the planet Hoth, when it was among those warships that crashed to the surface during the Battle of Hoth, and it broke in two when it landed in the region later known as the Starship Graveyard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
