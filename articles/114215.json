It was not until 24,000 BBY, when the Tionese War against the Honorable Union of Desevro & Tion began, that a centralized navy was created; the Republic's member worlds had relied on their own militaries and were expected to contribute resources and troops to a centralized force if a threat presented itself. According to navy tradition, the Republic Navy was headquartered on Foerost, the site of the Republic's largest shipyard, but it was disbanded at the war's end around 23,900 BBY. During the Tionese War, the cruiser-sized Gilagimar was active, and it was one of the most famous vessels from the Navy during the Expansionist Era."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early Alsakan Conflicts, a series of seventeen wars between the Republic and the allies of the planet Alsakan, the Galactic Senate resisted calls for the Navy's reinstatement. In the early conflicts, both Alsakan and the Coruscant-controlled Republic attempted to use massive battle fleets to secure victories, but neither side had the military resources to split their forces between attack and defense. During the Duinuogwuin Contention of 15,500 BBY, when the Duinuogwuin species attacked the Republic capital of Coruscant, further calls for the Navy's return were blocked by internal feuding in the Senate. Around 15,000 BBY, however, the Senate finally heeded the pleas of the outlying systems and re-established the Navy with its headquarters on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Pius Dea"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the subsequent Alsakan Conflicts, both the Navy and Alsakan began to use their larger battleships to guard their planets in the Core while smaller and faster cruisers raided and protected colonies in the Expansion Region. The Conflicts grew less and less brutal over the centuries, as all of them ended in ceasefires and most consisted only of raiding of colonies. During the first few centuries of the Navy's existence, they fought battles at planets such as Esaga, Caulbon, and the Sundered Veil nebula, and the Navy's ships defended the Republic's colonies and fought back against the slavers who plagued the Outer Rim Territories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 11,987 BBY, the Human Contispex I became Supreme Chancellor, beginning the period known as the Pius Dea Era. Contispex was a high-ranking member of the Pius Dea religion, and his ascension to the head of the Republic soon brought Pius Dea adherents into most of the government's positions of power. In 11,965 BBY, Contispex launched the First Pius Dea Crusade, a military crusade against the Hutt species, and the Republic Navy's forces launched along the Ootmian Pabol route and from the planets Ord Yndar and Ord Wylan against the western edge of Hutt Space. Under Contispex's descendants and successors in the Contispex dynasty of Chancellors, the Republic would launch a total of thirty-four crusades against alien species, and the Navy became a stronghold of Pius Dea influence during their reign."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic Military converted at blasterpoint thousands of people in the Mid Rim and the Outer Rim, and though defeated populations could retain autonomy if they converted, only those who joined the Republic Navy could move freely between planets. By the 11,500s BBY, Pius Dea cathedral ships made up a large part of the Navy, crewed by descendants of the original naval crews and commanded by missionaries. Under the Pius Dea, the Navy also established a large number of Ordnance/Regional Depots along the frontier of the Republic, planets that served as home bases from which the Pius Dea and the Navy could push forward into the \"alien chaos\" of the Outer Rim. The Navy plundered many of the worlds that they discovered on their crusades, descending upon those worlds found to be impure and deploying millions of troops to purge the inhabitants and claim their riches. The bi-wing snub fighter saw use in the Republic Navy during this time, as did the man-of-war."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Sith Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For 4,000 years, the Republic Navy also worked almost side by side with the Jedi Order in repelling attacks from the Sith Order and other aggressors. The mandate of the Republic Navy allowed them to move into designated star systems in order to deal with any unrest that had formed with the knowledge that the majority of the governments of the Galactic Republic supported these actions. Any planetary government could call upon the Navy's help, although it would need Senate approval if the action was to last longer than seven standard days. Individual senators also often commandeered Navy groups for their own benefit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Mandalorian Wars, the technological ancestors of the Star Destroyer would be manufactured, such as the Interdictor-class cruiser and the Centurion-class battlecruiser. Later, during the Jedi Civil War, the Republic had to rely on smaller ships such as the Hammerhead-class cruiser. Centuries following this event, the Republic fleet suffered heavy casualties from the onslaught of the newly reborn Sith Empire. Despite losing many worlds in the initial stages of the Great Galactic War, the navy was responsible for the Republic's first major victory at the First Battle of Bothawui where fleet warships destroyed a Sith squadron of warships that intended to invade Bothawui. After the New Sith Wars, the Republic scaled down the Navy as part of the Ruusan Reformation, and placed it under the control of the Judicial Department. Its priorities were shifted from full-scale conflict to sector-scale and system-scale patrol, anti-pirate operations, and exploration of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the final years of the Republic, a Militarist faction attempted to reform the Republic Navy and Army, but progress was slow. The Katana fleet was the first attempt by the Republic to make a functioning armada for the Navy, but it was soon lost. In 44 BBY, during the Stark Hyperspace War, Ranulph Tarkin tried to portray the space forces of his fleet as the legitimate Republic Navy, even referring to it as such."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Decades later, the Republic Navy operated alongside the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, and absorbed the local member world defense fleets into the consolidated Navy following the Battle of Rendili. Until the passage of the Security Act amendment shortly before the war's end, the Navy was under the joint command of the Galactic Senate and Jedi Council; afterwards, the Supreme Chancellor served as its sole commanding authority.

The rich and heavily industrialized Core Worlds like Corellia, Humbarine, and Kuat built fleets centered around powerful multi-kilometer long warships. However, due to their limited hyperdrives these large warships were designed to only defend their respective local sectors. The robust planetary and sector fleets of the Core Worlds not only assisted in defending their own planets against pirate raids and crime lords, but were also relied upon to provide sufficient firepower to defend the Core from invasion. This was evident during the Great Sith War when a Corellian fleet launched a major counteroffensive along the Corellian Run against Sith forces. Fleets from planets and sectors such as Kuat, Humbarine, and Rendili would also take part in the fighting during the Clone Wars. These planetary and sector navies were headed up by the Admirals of the Coreworlds, whose authority was recognized only within in their respective sectors.
