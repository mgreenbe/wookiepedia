Such weapons had a very limited fuel supply, but the Firecaller relied on accelerite, an unstable starship fuel ingredient that burned hotter and longer than most substances. However, this substance was easily acquired around shipyards and fuel depots. Accelerite enabled the weapon to spray far less fuel than most projectors per burst, as the flames quickly ignited surrounding materials. Favored by the vilest of beings, the Firecaller generated intense heat that caused terrible pain and horrible disfigurements for those who survive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The \"Firecaller\" light flame projector was mentioned in Gadgets and Gear, a roleplaying supplementary sourcebook for the Star Wars Roleplaying series that was published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
