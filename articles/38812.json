Aside from the Millennium Falcon itself, the hangar also contained at least three repulsorlift shuttles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ohwun De Maal and his wife owned this bay along with five others nearby.

The pit absorbed and deflected the blasts made when starships landed or took off. By law, ships with repulsorlifts were required to use them when entering and leaving the docking bays."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The docking bay cost 25 credits per day to use.

George Lucas stated in the DVD commentary that he intended to replace Mulholland with a stop-motion puppet effect but as the budget and schedule were running well over what was expected the filmed scenes were shelved. Later, in 1997, digital technology allowed Lucasfilm to use a computer-generated imagery for Jabba the Hutt more in line as he appeared in Return of the Jedi. The Special Edition version is canonical."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The number 94 appears on the walls of the docking bay."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After killing Greedo, Han Solo went to Docking Bay 94.
