They grew up to 80 meters long. They were covered in a glossy membranous skin black in color. While they could bite with deadly power, their diet consisted entirely of wood pulp. During the day, they rested underground or inside a hollow oak. They were not aggressive creatures and shied away from sentient beings as a rule. However, if disturbed by the vibrations of timber cutting or large vehicles, they occasionally would lash out at loggers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
