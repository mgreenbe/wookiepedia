It stated that starships should not take any Sith Lords aboard due to their perceived destructive tendencies. The doctrine was first coined by the Republic Navy Admiral Telettoh who had unknowingly carried the future Sith Lord Darth Malak aboard his Hammerhead-class cruiser Testament. At that time, Malak was a member of a Jedi faction known as the Revanchists who advocated a hardline stance against the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders. Telettoh would spend the rest of his career trying to undo the damage caused by his actions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Millennia later, the mercenary leader Jarrow Rusher would cite Telettoh's Maxim as an argument against the Jedi Knight Kerra Holt's decision to bring the captive Sith Lord Quillan aboard his ship Diligence. Following their escape from the Sith world of Byllura, Rusher accused Kerra of trying to endanger the lives of his crew by bringing a Dark Sider aboard. However, Quillan did not pose a threat to the crew and passengers due to his mentally challenged state and infantile upbringing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
