Various degrees of mundicide occurred throughout history, caused by such things as supernovae, superlasers such as the Galaxy Gun or the Death Stars, gravitational weaponry such as Centerpoint Station, or other superweapons. Some planets, while not completely destroyed, were rendered uninhabitable, such as Caamas and Uphrades. The deliberate destruction of a planet, such as the Destruction of Alderaan, was sometimes comparable to speciecide due to wiping out a significant portion of the planet's population."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Completely destroyed"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Destroyed by solar expansions, solar explosions, or supernovae"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Destroyed by weapons, by Yo'gand's Core tactic, or by usage of the Force"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Centerpoint Station"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Death Star"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Galaxy Gun"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Sith artifacts/the Force"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Sun Crusher"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Yo'gand's Core"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Other superweapons"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Conventional weapons"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Means of destruction unclear"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Other completely destroyed planets/bodies"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Rendered uninhabitable"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Bombardment by Jedi, Sith, Imperial, Republic, or other non-Yuuzhan-Vong forces"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Inadvertent/accidental devastation"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Vongformed or otherwise affected by the actions of the Yuuzhan Vong"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
