The transport was a commercial success and became more popular than similar transports that Sadon's rivals were producing. However, following an incident in 3951 BBY involving the Zhug brothers, a group of Duros bounty hunters, sales of the Heraklon-class fell. A number of Sadon executives considered designing a new type of transport, to replace the Heraklon-class. However, it was saved by a change in Sadon's advertising, to highlight how the passengers and cargo of a Heraklon-class transport would be safe in the event of an accident. The rebranding succeeded and sales of the Heraklon-class returned to a profitable level again, ensuring the ship's continued production."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
