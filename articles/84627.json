The ships were known for their organic-looking, bulbous shape. Many MC-series Star Cruisers were used as part of the Rebel Alliance, and were their main capital ships. After the Battle of Yavin, Han Solo, Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker went to Mon Cala to convince the Mon Calamari to donate their fleet to the rebel cause. After seeing the broadcast of the death of their king, the Mon Calamari mutinied against the Galactic Empire and joined the Rebel Alliance.
