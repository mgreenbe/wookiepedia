The station was attacked by Grysks, who captured the pirates and tortured them in an attempt to make them into followers. According to fellow pirate Bleary, the interrogation was more successful on Yimmer than it was on most of the crew."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
