Sab\u00e9 and the soldiers that served her worked as rebels against the Galactic Empire following Amidala's death, having walked with Sab\u00e9 at her funeral. Investigating the death of Amidala, Sab\u00e9's team broke into her former apartment on Coruscant to retrieve security recordings before heading to a base on Vendaxa. After some time on Vendaxa, the native Vendaxan land squid attacked the complex, killing a number of the crew. The Gungan warned Sab\u00e9, insisting that they evacuated, but was similarly killed by one of the creatures. Shortly after the deaths of the team, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, similarly investigating the circumstances of Amidala's death, arrived at the complex on Vendaxa, correctly deducing Sab\u00e9's identity. Sab\u00e9 agreed to work alongside Vader, but demanded that the forensics droid ZED-6-7 help her bury the fallen soldiers before the departed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gungan first appeared in the comic Darth Vader 1, written by Greg Pak, illustrated by Raffaele Ienco, and published by Marvel Comics on February 5, 2020.
