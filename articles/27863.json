They were equipped with HT-77 Cold Assault Armor and other cold-assault gear to handle combat in frigid environments. They served on planets like Rhen Var, Toola, and Orto Plutonia. They also flew freeco bikes on Orto Plutonia. A platoon of clone troopers of the 501st Legion donned cold-assault gear and served as clone cold assault troopers during the Battle of Orto Plutonia. The Galactic Empire later modeled its cold weather assault stormtroopers after this type of clone trooper."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
