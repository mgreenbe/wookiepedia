He enjoyed his retirement from piloting, although he missed the feeling that came with being in space at the helm of a starship. However, he did not miss the bureaucracy and bookkeeping that also came with piloting a freighter. Woodle preferred to spend his retirement outside the spaceport in Theed, trying to relive his glory days by talking with other pilots and spacers. Woodle spoke Mon Calamarian, and, according to his droid, that was the only language he knew.
