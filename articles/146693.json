During the battle that ensued, she noticed clone trooper CT-5385, nicknamed \"Tup\", approaching her and, assuming that he was coming to reinforce her, was stunned when he pointed his blaster at her and shot her at point-blank range, killing her instantly. Tiplee noticed this occurrence and ran to Tiplar, but she was already dead.

Fellow trooper CT-5555, or \"Fives,\" attempted to prove this, but thanks to the Chancellor's manipulations, the secret died with him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When engaged in combat, Tiplar wielded a green lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tiplar's design, alongside that of her sister Tiplee, was based on concept art for a female Sith that was cut from Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
