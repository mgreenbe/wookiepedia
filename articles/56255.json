The hall was large enough to seat all of the Academy's students and support staff, and it contained a floating platform, from which speakers could address their audiences. The hall was used by visiting dignitaries who wished to speak to the Academy's students, as well as by the Academy staff for delivering annual addresses. The annual recital of the Ritual Tale of Kibh Jeen also took place in the grand lecture hall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
