A male Ychthytonian was among the well-wishers, senator's aides, and employment seekers that gathered in Mothma's anteroom to offer their congratulations. Also in the room at the time were the droids C-3PO and R2-D2, who believed they had uncovered the source of the bombing. The latter concealed himself behind the Ychthytonian from a Kloperian guard he had encountered earlier. When C-3PO almost announced their findings to all present in the waiting room, R2-D2 screeched to get him to stop, causing the Ychthytonian to use all four hands to cover his ears in discomfort. When R2-D2 then fled the anteroom, the Ychthytonian pointed the protocol droid in the direction of his missing counter-part."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Ychthytonians in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some Ychthytonians found work in the galaxy as bartenders, taking advantage of their four arms to deliver drinks quickly.

Another Ychthytonian bartender was B\u00f4mlas. He was infamous for having bet and lost one of his arms in a particularly savage game of sabacc; however he was still the fastest bartender known to Han Solo.
