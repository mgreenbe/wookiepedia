It resembled a wooden stick wrapped in silvery wire and delivered a powerful energy charge that could render a victim unconscious. The Vor'cha were able to penetrate armor and electrocute a victim regardless of what they were wearing. Ben Skywalker reasoned that it was very powerful as it was designed by 'rock guys' to fell their enemies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
