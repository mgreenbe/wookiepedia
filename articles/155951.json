Later in \"Hunt for Ziro,\" two Twi'leks identical to the chorus girl appear together, although this article does not assume that either of them is the same chorus girl who performed for the Hutts. The Clone Wars Supervising Director Dave Filoni and series designer Darren Marshall devised the Hutt-inspired headdresses worn by the chorus girls in the episode.
