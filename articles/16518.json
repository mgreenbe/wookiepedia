The metal was durable enough to withstand a direct blaster shot and could repel lightsaber strikes. A superweapon created by the Mandalorian Sabine Wren and used by the Galactic Empire, called the Arc Pulse Generator, was capable of super-heating the metal to the point that it would burn to a crisp everything it was protecting, as in the case of Mandalorian warriors encased within their beskar armor. However, Wren was able to destroy her weapon during the Mandalorian Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beskar was one of the toughest and most legendary metals in the galaxy. The alloy could withstand direct blaster fire and was capable of repelling the strikes of a lightsaber. The metal could also be reforged to any warrior's liking. In ingot form, beskar was silver with wavy patterns, reminiscent of crucible steel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Usage"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beskar was a common material used by the various groups, clans and houses of Mandalore's people, such as the clans Wren, Vizsla, Saxon, and Kryze; and the Nite Owls, as well as the Children of the Watch. Due to its unique properties, beskar was used to forge armor capable of repelling Jedi lightsabers during the Mandalorian-Jedi War. According to Mandalorians, all beskar belonged to them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Armor forged from beskar was used as early as 501 BBY. During the Clone Wars, the Death Watch and the Nite Owls continued to use beskar in their armor. The Death Watch continued using the alloy in their armor when they became part of Maul's Shadow Collective and Viceroy Gar Saxon's Imperial Super Commandos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During her time with the Mandalore resistance led by Bo-Katan Kryze, former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano was given a Mandalorian-designed combat outfit with beskar plates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While a cadet at the Imperial Academy of Mandalore, Sabine Wren constructed the Arc Pulse Generator. Invented as a challenge, the so-called \"Duchess\" was designed to target the beskar in Mandalorian armour and vaporize the wearer. Upon realizing that the Galactic Empire had tested the weapon on her own people and intended to keep using it, Wren sabotaged the weapon, destroyed the plans and fled, eventually joining up with the Spectres, a band of rebels who later became part of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Although Wren believed she had destroyed her weapon, the Empire salvaged and rebuilt it, although they were unable to restore it to its full power. Rumours spread that the Empire had tested such a weapon, but there was never confirmation among other Mandalorian clans that the Duchess was real. Eventually, a civil war broke out after Clan Wren rebelled against Clan Saxon, which had been placed in power by the Emperor, and Governor Tiber Saxon attempted to use the Arc Pulse Generator, fitting it onto the AT-DP Arc Cannon Prototype. After Grand Admiral Thrawn suggested that Saxon capture Wren to restore the weapon to its full capacity, Saxon laid a trap for Wren and the Mandalorian resistance aboard his Star Destroyer. However, Wren and Bo-Katan Kryze were able to destroy the weapon for good after Wren reprogrammed it to target the plastoid in stormtrooper armor, and the weapon's detonation also killed Saxon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Great Purge, the Empire took beskar as spoils after killing the majority of the Mandalorians. In 9 ABY, an Imperial known as \"The Client\" gave bounty hunter Din Djarin a piece of the beskar imprinted with the Imperial crest taken from the Mandalorians during the purge, which he then used to forge a new shoulder plate for himself and gave the excess to Armorer for future foundlings. Later, after capturing a child of the same species as Jedi Grand Master Yoda, the Client gave a camtono of beskar to Djarin in payment. He then used the Beskar to forge a new set of armor for himself and once again gave the excess to The Tribe's foundlings. Morgan Elsbeth had in her possession a spear made of beskar, which was given later to Din Djarin after the liberation of Calodan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The name beskar originated in the Star Wars Legends article The Mandalorians: People and Culture, published in Star Wars Insider in 2006. Before that, it was simply known as Mandalorian iron. It was first introduced unnamed, in the form of Mandalorian manacles, in the Legends comic Tales of the Jedi 5, and was later named Mandalorian iron in the comic Freedon Nadd Uprising. In Legends, it was regarded as a natural-forming ore rather than the rebooted canon's depiction of it as an alloy.[source?] However, the Mandalorian Season 2 frequently refers to Din Djarin's armor and spear as \"pure beskar\", implying the existence of diluted beskar and explaining how his armor and spear seem far more durable than the alloy seen in The Clone Wars and Rebels. In this case, it is likely that beskar is once again a natural-forming ore as in Legends and it is diluted into alloys with other metals due to its rarity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boba Fett's armor was previously stated to be made of durasteel.
