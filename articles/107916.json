The probe attempted to abandon the unfortunate mechanic, but was stopped when it grabbed hold of the probe and pulled itself free.

The probe zoomed away, quicker this time, and made great distance before being abducted by some stealthy Jawas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While in captivity, the probe hovered around inside the massive sandcrawler in dismay.
