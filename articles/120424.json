A Satab's term lasted one standard year, after which the monarch would go into suspended animation in the Hall of Satabs to avoid succumbing to the effects of the shadeshine, the Satab regalia. The stone would then be handed down to the next Satab, someone chosen from ordinary citizens in a special ceremony. The line of Satabs was ended by Han Solo, who, after an attempt to make him Satab, destroyed the shadeshine and killed the last Satab some time during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
