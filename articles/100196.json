As a youth, Ommin was instructed in Sith teachings by his father, the previous King of Onderon. He became king after his father's death, as well as the Sith apprentice of Freedon Nadd, the ghost of whom accelerated the new monarch's Sith indoctrination. Early during his reign as King, Ommin married the noblewoman Amanoa, and eventually the couple birthed a daughter named Galia, whom they intended to also be trained in the ways of the Sith. When his relentless studies into the dark side began to have adverse effects on his physical body, Ommin curtailed them, retired from Onderonian politics and faded from visibility, leaving the rule of the planet in the hands of his wife."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The general populace of Onderon believed Ommin to be dead, and rumors of him actually being alive were unfounded until the death of Amanoa in 4000 BBY at the hands of the Jedi. Ommin then returned to the forefront of Onderonian events, having survived through use of a special life-support system and in command of a dark side army. Supported by the power of Freedon Nadd, the army waged war on the invading forces of the Jedi Order and Galactic Republic. In 3998 BBY, Jedi Master Arca Jeth and his apprentices defeated Ommin and ultimately triumphed over Nadd's influence, finally bringing peace to the war-torn planet. The sorcerer-King of Onderon joined both his wife and Sith Master in death, with all three being interred in a mausoleum on his home planet's fourth moon of Dxun."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ommin was a member of the Onderon Royal Family.

As a youth, Ommin was apprenticed to his father who began his rudimentary instruction into the ways of the ancient Sith. Ommin originally felt as though Sith lore was merely part of his royal tutoring, believing his father was only teaching him lessons in the use of power; however, he soon realized that the dark side offered many other possibilities. Thus, Ommin devoted himself to learning Sith sorcery. After his father's death, when Ommin assumed Kingship of the walled city of Iziz, he had also grown enough in skill to summon Nadd's spirit from Chaos."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Sith training"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Freedon Nadd taught Ommin much more than his father had, imparting not only dark side knowledge but ancient Sith traditions as well. Ommin ruled Iziz in the same manner as his forefathers, dominating the citizens through the power of the dark side. Sometime during his tutelage under Nadd, Ommin married Amanoa, the daughter of an Onderonian nobleman, thereby taking her as his Queen. Over the years the couple had a daughter named Galia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ommin eventually lost interest in the mundane daily activities of life and secretly focused his attention on his training under Nadd. Ommin learned more and more of the dark side and its nature from the Sith Lord, and soon he was completely given over to it. Amanoa did not suspect Ommin's dark side allegiance for many years, and when she did, she attempted to break the bond between him and his Sith ancestor. Her attempts were futile ones however, as Ommin had become too strong. Eventually, with the help of Nadd, Ommin corrupted his wife to the dark side, and the couple became powerful Sith sorcerers. Someday, Ommin decided, he would turn his daughter Galia to the dark side as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The love between Ommin and Amanoa faded during their quest for dark side power. Mistrust, loathing, and outright hatred filled the empty space. Little did the couple know that they were both being manipulated by Nadd. Nadd's ultimate goal was to physically resurrect himself and wield the dark side once more as ruler of Onderon. By teaching his descendants well, Nadd hoped to find a candidate powerful enough to master Sith alchemy, and help recreate a body to house his spirit. To ensure Ommin or Amanoa would be powerful enough, Nadd made them compete with each other."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Pall of the dark side"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, forbidden teachings were not absolved of consequence. Ommin's bones and flesh slowly decayed under the weight of the dark side, until he became an invalid, decrepit and helpless. To compensate for this, his personal doctors constructed a special iron exoskeleton to support his physical body and flesh. The trappings of a metal support frame severely restricted Ommin's mobility, and as a result, personally attending to matters of state became difficult. Ommin therefore charged his personal aide, a young Onderonian politician named Tolo Kad, with the business of the King's affairs. On one such occasion, Kad failed him utterly in the arrangement of a state dinner. In the midst of the engagement, Ommin lashed out with the dark side and killed Kad for his embarrassing blunder. In reality, Kad's failure had been the secret design of Kad's own aide Novar, who often completed the tasks Kad took credit for. The young Novar was then appointed Minister of State and also selected as the King's new aide. The failure of Kad happened just as Novar knew it would, having engineered the event himself to further his own political machinations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a decade of Novar's maneuvering, Ommin took him as his Sith apprentice. However, two years into Novar's teaching, Ommin's body had become too ravaged to continue any further. The King retired from the public eye, handing both Iziz and Novar's dark side study to his wife. Thus, Amanoa assumed the daily responsibilities as ruler of Onderon. It was then that Nadd realized the King and Queen had failed him: Ommin himself would never be strong enough to fulfill Nadd's dream, while Amanoa would not further her own study once her husband failed to maintain competition with her."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Freedon Nadd Uprising"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After years of isolation, pieces of major news began to reach Ommin in his lair. He learned that his wife, Queen Amanoa, had come into conflict with Onderon's Beast Riders, and that she had requested the assistance of the Onderon system's Jedi watchmen to help her defeat them. He also learned that the Beast Riders staged an assault during which Galia was kidnapped by the Beast-Lord Oron Kira, and that Amanoa ordered the Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma to rescue her daughter. Qel-Droma then brought Galia and her Beast-Lord husband before the Queen with hopes of peacefully settling their differences, but the Jedi discovered that Amanoa was given over to the dark side, and that under her, the citizens of Iziz were worshiping the spirit of Freedon Nadd. Peace talks utterly failed between the Queen and the Beast-Lord, and the meeting quickly degenerated into more aggressive negotiations. The Jedi/Beast Rider war effort was successful, though Amanoa perished with the arrival of Jedi Master Arca Jeth, and Ommin's daughter Galia was newly wed to the Beast-Lord Oron Kira. Galia filled her mother's vacancy and became Queen, with the Beast-Lord as her consort. Ommin in turn plotted to take the planet back from his daughter and the Beast-Lord, and reclaim the throne as rightful King of Onderon.

Before the tombs could be relocated, however, one of Ommin's minions, the armor-clad Dark Jedi Warb Null, ambushed the Knights with a massive groundborer and the King's Naddist army in tow. Ommin meanwhile sensed Jeth's presence above ground, and incapacitated him through the Force with a dark side backlash.

Soon, Galia discovered that she was unfamiliar with the tunnels, as they ran deeper than any she had previously encountered. Jeth, though, was following the strong pull of the dark side in the tunnels, until the trio came upon none other than Ommin himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Galia gasped in horror at the sight of her father, who was connected to a complex life support system. The most intriguing sight to them was Ommin's mechanical exoskeleton, which, as he described to the Jedi and his daughter, was a necessity; the King's prolonged exposure to the dark side had detrimental effects on his body, and over time he grew dependent on this iron support contraption to replace his natural mobility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Appearing weak and virtually helpless to his guests, Ommin was confronted by Jeth, who demanded the return of the physical remains of Freedon Nadd. When the Jedi Master approached the King, however, Ommin blasted him with a torrent of Force lightning, which knocked Jeth back. As Qel-Droma rushed to his Master's side, the spirit of Nadd himself suddenly appeared behind the King. Only then did the Jedi realize that Ommin was far from being as helpless as he pretended, and in fact had been empowered by Nadd's spirit. As Jeth was distracted by the ancient Dark Lord, Ommin rose and seized him by the throat, then incapacitated Jeth by smothering him with waves of dark side energy. Ommin attempted to seduce Galia with the dark side as well, but was quickly rebuked by the Princess. Nadd then ordered his foremost servant, Warb Null, to deal with Qel-Droma, and he obliged by engaging the Jedi in a lightsaber duel.

Also because of his restriction, he found it necessary to trick individuals into coming near him, and then attack them with dark side energy. Occasionally Ommin sacrificed those whom he deemed expendable, as evidenced when he did nothing to stop the impending death of Warb Null at the hands of Ulic Qel-Droma. He was fully devoted to his dark side Master Freedon Nadd, carrying on Nadd's legacy just as his fathers before him had done.
