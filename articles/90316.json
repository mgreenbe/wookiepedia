It was only approachable on foot, and was impassable by ground vehicles. Even starships could not find suitable clearance to land. The area was riddled with alcoves and small caves, and there was a magnificent view of the Doaba Badlands and the Socorran skyline. The Min Min Heights got their name from the Min Min lights, a light phenomena that appeared in the late dawn and early dusk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
