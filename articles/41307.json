Marr's search for the origin of the echoes lead her to Surik, a former Jedi General in the Mandalorian Wars who had lost her connection to the Force during the war's culminating battle at Malachor V. The general alone returned to Coruscant to answer to the Jedi High Council and defend her actions in disobeying them by joining Revan in his crusade against the Mandalorian threat. As a result, she was exiled from the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After roaming the Outer Rim for nearly a decade, Surik had returned to Republic space and was being hunted by Sith assassins who believed her to be the last Jedi Knight. In an effort to save the Jedi Order, Surik set out on a mission to find the Jedi Masters that had not been present at the conclave on Katarr. During her journey, Surik experienced a burgeoning reconnection to the Force and any subsequent decisions she made sent tremors throughout the Force, thus allowing Marr to find her. Marr infiltrated Surik's starship, the Ebon Hawk, and incapacitated the crew."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Duel"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a brief intense lightsaber duel Surik destroyed Marr's lightsaber defeated, and wounded her. Convinced of Surik's superior strength, Marr yielded and begged Surik to end her life, for the alternative was death by her master's hand for her failure. When Surik refused, Marr pledged her life to her, abandoning Nihilus before losing consciousness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Surik then took the unconscious woman to the ship's medical bay. This act of mercy was met by surprise from Surik's companion, the pilot of the Ebon Hawk, Atton Rand, who was uneasy in the presence of powerful Force users, as the Miraluka were known to be. He also expressed his amazement at seeing a Miraluka Sith, saying that he had heard of Miraluka Jedi, but never Sith, further speculating that he was unsure as to how to go about killing one. The idea of killing Marr was met by incredulity on the part of Surik, who voiced her regret for having hurt the Miraluka during their duel. Rand reassured her that Marr's injuries would heal, noticing that even though some of her wounds were severe, she looked like she had suffered from many more in the past. While Rand grudgingly accepted Marr, Kreia, Surik's informal master, met her arrival with barely concealed contempt. She was of the opinion that the Miraluka's ability to see through the Force was wasted on her people and that she should be considered a servant. Furthermore, Kreia felt it necessary to remind Surik that the Sith were often betrayed by their own apprentices and that even though Marr had pledged herself to Surik, she was bound to other masters, thus insinuating that Marr's loyalty would always be suspect."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wary of Kreia's attitude towards Marr, Surik nonetheless sought her advice regarding the change Marr had brought about in her eyesight during their clash. While Kreia explained this alteration of Surik's perception was nothing that hadn't already been present, the elder woman had nothing but utter disdain for the forceful and \"crude methods\" that were the mark of the Sith. Surik accepted her into the ship's crew and retrained her in the ways of a Jedi Sentinel. With Marr gained as an ally, Surik knew she could not hide her presence for long, however she also knew that she had an inroad into finding at least one of the Sith Lords who hunted her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Marr's first genuine encounter with Surik left her disquieted. Unused to the mercy shown by Surik not only toward her, but others as well, Marr believed that this type of action would weaken Surik for the enemies she had to face in the near future. Nevertheless, impressed by Surik's skills, Marr rediscovered hope and came to consider that the universe was perhaps not as her master had shown her, and that, with her help, Surik would be able to stop him. The fact that her master neither understood nor saw Surik as she did was of some comfort to her. However, Marr cautioned Surik that she would need to understand why this was so if Surik was to have a chance of defeating Nihilus. She refused to guide Surik to him untested and without her potential realized, as Marr felt the Jedi was not yet ready to face such a threat. She foresaw that Surik and Nihilus would meet in the near future, however."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
