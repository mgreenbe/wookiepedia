Some time after the Battle of Yavin, this crime boss made a deal with the infamous smuggler Sana Starros to buy a pair of ancient lightsabers that were once wielded by the Sith Darth Atrius. After realizing that Starros delivered only one of the sabers instead of two on Hradreek, the criminal was corrupted by the ancient weapon's dark power and attacked his own Devaronian guards in anger. Shortly later, the Jedi trainee Luke Skywalker discovered the boss' corpse lying next to his guards' bodies and retrieved the Sith artifact."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
