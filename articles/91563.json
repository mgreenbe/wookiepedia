The operators split into two teams, Bantha and Thumper. Their transport was destroyed, but Bantha created a diversion at an administration center while Thumper infiltrated the hub to place explosives. Ryenne stole a shuttle to escape while Thumper completed the mission. Team Bantha then rendezvoused, with Ryenne hacking the door to allow them to escape. Alliance reinforcements then arrived."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mission appears in the opening short narrative of the Star Wars: Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2014."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
