It was the location of a branch of the Obroa-skai library, where a BRT supercomputer called Mistress Mnemos was installed about 200 BBY. Although Obroa-skai closed the branch, it was maintained locally. Fusai became a Rebel Alliance safe world, and it was here C-3PO reported to Mistress Mnemos the incidents that occurred to Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa on Vorzyd V, where they faced the minion of Blackhole. In addition to recording mission details, Mistress Mnemos helped the Alliance with tactics and long-term planning."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
