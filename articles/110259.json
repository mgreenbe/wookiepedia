Standing 0.97 meters in height they generally had shorter, cone-shaped heads and were equipped with repair arms. Their reputation was so bad that their manufacturer, Industrial Automaton, had to pull the model from the market to save their own reputation. R5-D4 was one of the last units produced in the R5 line.
