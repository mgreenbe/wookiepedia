CECs were also the central component in Ves Volette's light sculptures. Removing the crystal from a sculpture would result in the collapse of the gaseous light within. Certain compressed crystals, when used in lightsabers, caused the energy blade to take on a peculiar \"pulsating\" appearance with a thinner core. Lightsaber blades created by compressed crystals appeared to be more precise than normal blades."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Compressed energy crystals included but were not limited to Luxum, Ilum and Adegan crystals, and Corusca gems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
