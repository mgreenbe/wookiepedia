That year, the Mandalorians sought to dominate the Core World of Duro through an offensive they called \"Mandalorian Triumph.\" The assault was two-pronged, with one element originating in Mandalorian territory. This charge brought many star systems under Mandalorian control as they made their way Coreward. Eventually, they took the planet of Commenor and proceeded to attack the Quellor system, conquering it as well during the ensuing battle. Afterwards, they moved on to the Exodeen system and staged their successful capture of Duro from there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle in the Quellor system was mentioned in the 2009 reference book The Essential Atlas, written by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
