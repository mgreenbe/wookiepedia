Unlike many other New Republic worlds in the Bormea sector, which fought against the Yuuzhan Vong, Corulag's leaders surrendered in hopes of avoiding the collateral damage that their neighbor worlds had suffered. Despite this, the majority of the world's ten billion citizens opposed the puppet government set up by the Yuuzhan Vong. Following the rescue of Alliance military figure and Corulag native Judder Page, resistance groups on-planet contacted the Alliance for support in an upcoming rebellion against the Yuuzhan Vong occupation. Eager to aid a former New Republic world and secure a key world close to Coruscant, Alliance commanders Sien Sovv and Traest Kre'fey approved the assault."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Second Fleet arrived in-system, the situation on the ground had already begun. Resistance groups and citizens alike had turned on their conquerors and had begun revenge attacks on Yuuzhan Vong soldiers. Fighting raged across the surface of Corulag, while parts of the planet experienced orbital bombardment from Yuuzhan Vong warships. The elite fighter units Blackmoon Squadron and Shocker Squadron attacked Corulag's primary moon, escorting Scimitar assault bombers in runs to destroy a Yuuzhan Vong base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In space, Alliance capital ships traded fire with mataloks and other Yuuzhan Vong warships. Several of the mataloks succumbed to fire from the Elegos A'Kla and the Mon Mothma, determined to protect the lone yammosk carrier. When the Mon Calamari cruiser Harbinger arrived and added its fire to the attack, the yammosk vessel was destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the battle drew to a close, a squadron of TIE fighters commandeered by the Peace Brigade entered the battle, and were hunted down by Alliance forces. As the Yuuzhan Vong fleet was being destroyed in detail, the resistance's appointed provisional governor of Corulag, Forridel, announced complete victory over the Yuuzhan Vong occupation."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Atrocities were reported across Corulag as frustrated citizens took out their rage on Yuuzhan Vong and collaborators. The former governor, a supporter of the Yuuzhan Vong, was hanged and pelted with stones in a square of the capital city of Curamelle. Despite this, the strategic world had been secured for the Galactic Alliance, who now had a key stop on the Perlemian Trade Route. The victory celebration was short-lived, as the Second Fleet was immediately dispatched to Coruscant to aid in its liberation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
