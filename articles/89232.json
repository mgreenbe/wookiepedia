Once described as \"distressingly intelligent animals\", merlie herds were often kept by the local farmers for their milk, wool, and meat. Standing nearly a meter high at the shoulder, they were covered in long brown ringlets of wool and had green eyes that were once noted as being \"disturbingly Human\". Merlies were often allowed into the houses of their owners, particularly during winter where they provided additional body warmth, but primarily to protect them from predation by gdans. Their pungent odor also repelled insects. They made an \"intermittent gargling noise\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
