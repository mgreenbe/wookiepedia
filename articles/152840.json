The Gungan was curious about the visitor's job, and impressed that she owned her own starship, the light freighter Meridian. As he spoke to Garsea, she noted that his accent reflected that of the other farmers. The Gungan and Shari entreated the smuggler to stay on the farm to work, though she declined. After the group ate together, Garsea entertained the farmers by relating a tale of how her ship had run out of fuel and was saved by the Frinn Mak Traveling Circus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The farmer first appeared in A Crash of Fate, a 2019 young-adult novel written by Zoraida C\u00f3rdova."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
