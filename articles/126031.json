Also distinct for their bone spurs, facial tentacles, and genetic predispositions toward both left-handedness and the dark side of the Force, the Sith species coalesced into an empire ruled first by kings and later by Dark Lords. After the arrival of the Human Exiles on Korriban in 6900 BBY, interbreeding and genetic manipulation altered the Sith species; over the course of several generations the original species became a hybrid race of Sith and Human heritage. Original Sith blood became a symbol of pride among the Sith, with the term \"Sith Pureblood\" referring to Sith who had a higher than average concentration of Sith blood."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite a society dominated by barbarism and infighting, Sith civilization culminated in a Golden Age, after which the species was scattered across the galaxy.

Sith had a larger than average number of individuals with potential to use the Force in their species, so high in fact that the entire species was considered strongly Force-sensitive. The abundant Force-sensitivity resulted from a symbiotic relationship with the dark side of the Force, where they\u2014like the other few creatures that inhabited the planet\u2014derived sustenance directly from the dark side of the Force, and empowered it in turn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Adult Sith characteristically had skin of a crimson-hue, although infants of the species appeared a lighter shade of red. However, even though typically a dark red, some members of the species retained more pink shades of skin tone in adulthood. Sith had sharp, fierce predatory profiles and features all over their bodies, including bone spurs protruding from under their skin at various locations like the elbows. Their faces displayed a notable pair of cheek tendrils that hung down from their high cheekbones. Sith also had cranial horns, pointed teeth, simian mouths below their small noses, and glowing yellow eyes covered by cartilaginous eyebrow\u2013stalks. In addition, some Sith had long bony chins, while others did not show this trait and instead possessed less prominent chins that receded from their mouth. Most Sith had three clawed digits on each hand, and three on each foot; two forward facing and one backward facing.However, some Sith had five digits on their hands and feet, such as Sek'nos Rath. The Sith were commonly left handed too, and as a result their signature weapon, the lanvarok, was constructed only for their left-handed tendencies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cheek tendrils on the jowls of Sith that descended from their cheekbones displayed different expressions amongst their species through twitching and other movements. For example, slight curling of the tendrils showed that the particular Sith was of a rejuvenated attitude, while stroking of the right tendril was an expression of thoughtfulness. Also, quivering of the tendrils could show signs of anger, as well as a questioning expression when coupled with raising of the eyebrow\u2013stalks. The Sith\u2014specifically the Massassi subspecies\u2014also had very keen senses relative to those of Humans, particularly their hearing, despite their small ears."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Hybridization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After their arrival in Sith space after the Hundred-Year Darkness, Human Dark Jedi began to interbreed with the Sith. For nearly two thousand years, superstition, loyalty and sympathy were bred out as the two groups interbred, and qualities such as cunning, ambition and affinity to the Force were favored, which shaped Sith society over the centuries. In the Sith Empire, as time progressed pure-blooded Sith were steadily bred out, resulting in only a few pure-blooded Sith left in the Sith Empire by the time of the Great Hyperspace War. Long after, the true species in the Empire were believed to have gone extinct due to the interbreeding process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Characteristics shown would be determined depending on how much Dark Jedi or Sith blood an individual possessed due to interbreeding. By the time of the Great Hyperspace War in 5000 BBY, the majority of the Sith within the Empire displayed mainly Sith traits. It was common for the Sith of this age, especially half\u2013breeds (like Ludo Kressh and Marka Ragnos) to have four digits on each of their hands. Although there was at least one who showed more than average Dark Jedi traits like Naga Sadow\u2014who had among the purest Jedi lineage, with minimal Sith blood. Sadow showed many Human features, including five digits on his hands and feet, as well as the absence of bone spurs and eyebrow-stalks. However, he maintained qualities of the Sith species such as cheek tendrils (albeit shorter than those of purer Sith lineage), and red skin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, some such as the hybrid Sith Purebloods in the Great Galactic War showed even more dilute Sith characteristics than the likes of Sadow. One such example was Exal Kressh, who only expressed Sith traits such as red skin, glowing yellow eyes, and Force-sensitivity. All other features such as cheek tendrils or eyebrow-ridges were not present, though some other members did show other features shared with the original species. Some members even expressed more features than the actual Sith species showed; like the presence of extra pairs of cheek tendrils. In fact, the Sith Purebloods were thought to be very different from the original Sith species as a whole, and to be a Pureblood required that one had retained enough traits shared with the original species to be visually clear in their appearance. Elderly Purebloods showed signs of old\u2013age through their skin developing deep wrinkles, paling and mottling with dark brown age spots. Aged Purebloods also tended to have withered tendrils. Unlike their ancestors, Sith Purebloods did not exist as an entirely Force sensitive race, though it was extremely rare to find members unable to manipulate the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The extremes of hybridization were shown in an individual named Ebya T'dell, who was part of the Lost Tribe of Sith around 4985 BBY. Though considered Human, she had unusually pink skin and high cheekbones, which were considered to be signs of apparent Sith species ancestry. Further still, many of the so-called Human crew of Omen in the Lost Tribe had had some degree of interbreeding with the Sith species, though they showed no morphology to suggest it\u2014their Force-sensitivity was the only known feature they retained from the interbreeding. After 2000 years deformities seen in the Lost Tribe were associated as being related to the Red Sith originally in the Lost Tribe, and even in 44 ABY it was deemed possible for Lost Tribe descendants to still have traces of Sith DNA."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 3642 BBY, it was estimated that 97.8 percent of the Sith Empire's population had some amount of Sith ancestry, but the amount was usually insufficient to express itself in any noticeable way."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The certain Dark Jedi traits inherited from the Dark Jedi\u2013Sith interbreeding Post\u2013Hundred-Year Darkness were selected for by some individuals, claiming that they were the strongest because of it.

Their constant warring led to a dwindling of the population on their original homeworld of Korriban as well as cultivated an intensely xenophobic society."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Native Sith culture included the Sith, the consumption of bloodsoup, a rigid and stratified caste-based society, live sentient sacrifices to the Sith deities and use of ancient and arcane alchemy and magic. For the Sith, war and violence were just as much a part of the natural order of life as peace or serenity. Their social order was very rigid, and while many rose to the title of Sith Lord, only one, King Adas, attained the position of monarch. Another aspect of Sith culture, the creation of Sith holocrons to record knowledge, originates from their first contact with the Rakata of the Infinite Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One aspect that originated from Korriban was the position of Shadow Hand; a title that was analogous to that of a Jedi Padawan.

This great power allowed them to accomplish great feats such as causing stars to go supernova."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Castes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith society was very hierarchical, utilizing both a rigid caste system and a stratified rank structure to put its subjects in their proper place. Due to how long Sith society has separated the Sith into castes (across approximately 100,000 years), each caste is sometimes referred to as a sub-species of Sith. All Sith castes were red-skinned humanoids with distinctly sharp, predatory features and tentacle beards. Among the Sith, the stroking of a right cheek tendril was a sign of thoughtfulness. After interbreeding with the Dark Jedi exiles, the original members of the species became known as Red Sith. Their caste system included the skilled and intelligent Zuguruk caste, the priestly Kissai caste, and the war-like Massassi caste."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The following were notable castes present amongst the Sith:"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Technology"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith art of alchemy allowed them to imbue objects as well as living beings with the dark side. Due to their great skill in sorcery and magic, the Sith often created Talismans in order to focus their concentration as well as to further tap great amounts of dark side power. Such artifacts were often used during long elaborate rituals and allowed a sorcerer to temporarily enhance their abilities. These constructs often took many different forms ranging from crystals to amulets. After encountering Jedi attempting to use their talismans for the light side of the Force, the Sith developed ensnarement talismans which, when used, turned their users to the dark side. This in turn led to Sith artifacts being outlawed following the destruction of the Sith. In addition to these artifacts, the Sith long ago developed healing talismans after a revolt led by Naga Sadow which led to pure blooded Sith finding means to provide an advantage to their faction. Healing talismans worked by quickening natural healing processes but at the expense of the user's connection to the Force. Another talisman was the shield talisman that worked by absorbing any form of energy attack and using that as a power source for the relic. Following the destruction of the Sith Empire, the Jedi discovered that talismans were very difficult to destroy due to different means employed in obliterating them - some made use of the destruction of physical components while skilled Jedi Masters were sometimes needed to remove the reservoir of Dark side energy in the relics and some were even capable of being destroyed by the dark side only. This led to certain talismans being hidden while others were placed in hazardous locations such as nebulas or stars in order to prevent them from falling into anyone's hands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Talismans were not the only Force empowered artifacts that the Sith were capable of creating. They had long ago learned that the usage of the Force created ripples that could be sensed by others which led to the creation of Force masks in order to hide this emanation from others. In addition, they were also capable of creating potent toxins such as Sith poisons that weakened their targets from the influence of the dark side. While there were many forms of common artifacts used by the Sith, there were certain relics that were unique and created by individual Sith Lords. This had led to several specially crafted items such as the Gauntlet of Kressh the Younger, Muur Talisman, Dreypa's Oubliette, Eye of Horak-mul, Helm of Dathka Graush, Scepter of Ragnos, Sword of Ieldis and the Heart of Graush as well as the Yoke of Seeming."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During ancient times, the Sith often made use of tomes and manuscripts to record their knowledge. These scrolls and tablets contained teachings on how to learn certain techniques ranging from alchemy to weapon crafting to magic. It was only later that the Sith began to adopt holocrons as teachings tools. One piece of technology that did not originate from the Sith was holocrons which had been originally adapted from the Rakata. Following this event, holocrons became a preferred method of storing Sith teachings, though they were considered rare. By transferring a portion of the user's personality into the device as well as imbuing it with the Force, they were capable of creating a Gatekeeper that was a sentient presence that interacted with future users. As the different creators of holocrons had different specialities, it meant that these data storage devices often contained aspects of a single field of Sith lore. This had led to the side effect of certain Sith teachings being lost because the knowledge was either never recorded or destroyed. Those holocrons that had survived over the years either fell into the hands of dark side acolytes or remained within the sanctuaries of the dead Sith Lords. Their usage also had a corrupting influence on those that accessed its forbidden knowledge. While holocrons were used, manuscripts and other means of containing Sith teachings were also used. Such relics included the Epistle of Marka Ragnos and the Codex of Karness Muur."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sith alchemy was also regularly used in the creation of weapons such as Sith swords. These blades were one of the earliest weapons made by the Sith and were remarkably effective. Such blades were treated so that they were reinforced to withstand any blow, which allowed them to combat lightsabers. Their unique creation also meant that they were capable of surviving for thousands of years and in perfect condition. The ancient Sith Lords of Ziost were known to have made use of Cortosis-weave to create Sith Tremor Swords: a powerful vibroblade melee weapon. In addition, they made use of Sith alchemy to enhance the strength as well as destructive power of blade weapons such as Sith war swords. A primitive ranged weapon created by the Sith was the Lanvarok that was originally used as a hunting tool. In contrast to weapons, the Sith also crafted dark armor which provided additional protection for their wearers and were crafted to meet the individual requirements of their user."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This talent in Sith alchemy also extended to create biological weapons which allowed them to genetically engineer creatures to become tainted abominations. Such feats were used to engineer the Tuk'ata that served as guardians for various Sith tombs. In fact, the ancient Sith Empire made use of this art to create Chrysalis beasts that were used as guards as well as pets to various Sith Lords. They even engineered weapons to be employed for sieges such as mutating Silooth in order to break enemy defenses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sith were noted for considering the construction of structures and edifices to be a work of art. They felt that such buildings were an extension of their creators personality. This had the resulting effect of preventing enemies from being able to properly chart the internal structure of such sanctuaries and provided the Sith a tactical advantage. Such techniques were also used to create focusing chambers designed to amplify a Sith Lord's power. This allowed the Sith to create vessels such as the Sith Meditation Sphere that were imparted with a level of sentience as well as the capacity to magnify Force power to great levels. Grander scales of their technological abilities included the creation of Force-empowered superweapons such as the Dark Reaper that was constructed during the years of the Great Hyperspace War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early civilization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sith civilization evolved on the planet Korriban, leading barbaric and hedonistic lifestyles while using the dark side of the Force. The Sith had a natural symbiotic relationship fused with the dark side. They fed on it and empowered it, developed and perfected techniques of the dark side through it, that were once thought impossible\u2014such as sorcery. Though they had great power, the Sith were not united, and lived in tribal \"circles\", led by one or more Sith sorcerers who were responsible for the safety and protection of their people. The state of war between the Sith nations on Korriban was common in their society, but this existence was treated as one on par with peace and serenity by the Sith people. They did not, or could not differentiate one state from another, and this, including other barbaric practices, were accepted into Sith society not as being antagonistic or contrary, but integral to their lives. They could not see these barbaric practices they undertook as anything else but their only way to live; their ultimate existence. Sith civilization described as such was said to have began around the year 100,000 BBY; however, the Dark Holocron contained Sith lore and forgotten histories that dated back even further."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was speculated among some historians that several of the ancient Sith practices, such as the consumption of bloodsoup, were due to an interaction been Sith and Anzati cultures at some point in pre-history. The Jedi Volfe Karkko was fond of remarking to the Jedi Knights that the Anzati\u2014his own species\u2014\"remember the very first Sith\" after studying a Sith holocron.

These contained dark knowledge, such as writings that described dark side powers, alchemy, the construction of Sith weapons and artifacts, and treatises on the domination and destruction of others. However many of these ancient writings were imbued with the madness of those Sith who wrote them, and consequently, the knowledge was capable of driving unprepared seekers of knowledge to insanity. It was known that the Sith already had a great knowledge of the depths of their powers by this era, specifically the rage and revenge that lead to the dark side of the Force.

The Rakatans hid their ultimate agenda from Adas, and tried to lull him into their confidence by teaching the Sith new technologies such as how to build and store knowledge inside a device known as a Holocron. Eventually however, the Rakatan's tried to conquer the Sith people, and the Sith'ari rose to repel the invaders with the indomitable will of his people behind him. During this time of war, it was known that the Rakata also took at least one prisoner\u2014Raspir, who was once a court magician of King Adas, but was imprisoned inside a Rakatan mind trap. Adas took his battle axe to the invaders and managed to outsmart the immensely powerful Infinite Empire despite the advanced technology the Sith were up against, eventually defeating the conquerors. From there, he took control of the Rakatan hyperspace-capable craft and spread his rule and Sith civilization to neighboring worlds, including nearby Ziost.

With Korriban devastated by the Rakata, and the constant war all over the planet, the Sith were forced to relocate the Sith capitol to Ziost using new Rakatan Force-based technology the Sith had obtained. There, the priestly Kissai caste oversaw the rebuilding efforts. The Sith prospered, continuing to expand their Empire to nearby planets like Jaguada, as well as to planets further out such as Malachor V and Arbra.

Like Ragnos, Kressh was a half-breed, and also like Ragnos, he sought to maintain the Empire in its current state of wealth. Kressh followed the old traditional ways of the Sith, and was conservative; he believed that the Sith Empire must grow strong within itself before looking to expand into new territories. In contrast, Sadow was more of a progressive Sith Lord who claimed to be largely of 'Jedi' blood. He believed that through the Golden Age of the Sith, the Sith Empire had become stagnant and that it was necessary for the Sith to expand and conquer new worlds to bring glory to the Empire, in opposition to Kressh's views. Sadow was extremely unusual compared to the other Sith Lords; because of his progressive attitude, those who were not Red Sith were allowed to rise to more prestigious positions under his command. This saw Human descended beings becoming miners and captains of ships under Sadow. If allowed, those non-Red Sith who excelled in areas such as science and medicine were also able to make breakthroughs in their field, under the very few Lords like Sadow over the millennia, while the Red Sith occupied themselves with the dark side's secrets.

By 4000 BBY, \"Purebloods\" were anything but pure Sith from a species point of view. The name itself was vanity. It had become clear that there is a direct correlation between those with enough of the old Sith blood in them to still be born with original Sith species traits and Force sensitivity. While not any stronger in the Force than the more human Sith, it was extremely rare to find a Pureblood who is completely without Force sensitivity. Thus those with the marks of the old Sith came to call themselves Purebloods with the obvious insinuation that they are superior to those without. All of this was purely the realm of fashion and societal politics, though no non-Pureblood would stand up and say the entire claim was foolish."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Emperor was known to keep many Purebloods around him; many of his inner circle and his personal apprentice bared the characteristic red-skin of the Purebloods.

The Emperor would continue to hollow her out to do his bidding, filling her with his power. Eventually, following stories and tribal legends of shamans who could escape death, she would come across Lenico IV and a tribe of Ortolans there. These people's myths told of patriarchs who lived through their descendants, and as it was a power the Emperor craved, he watched through his apprentice as she learnt the truth to their legends, and then had her destroy them.

When he felt his forces were completely prepared to defeat the Jedi and the Republic, the Emperor initiated his offensive against them. He first devastated Outer Rim Republican worlds, and sent Sith battle cruisers to the fringes of the Tingel Arm, and waited for a diplomatic convoy from the Republic to arrive, so that the Emperor could reveal to the Republic the true nature of his forces. After he revealed to the Republic what they were up against, his forces destroyed the convoy, and the Emperor's forces moved on to the Aparo sector, conquering it before the Republic forces had a chance to arrive there. When the Republic did arrive in the Tingel Arm, they found themselves surrounded by enemies as their allies on Sernpidal, Ruuria, and Belkadan had turned on them.

During this time, the way that the Republic had sent for all its ships left Korriban defended by only a few Jedi security ships, leaving the Sith to take the holy planet back as their first priority, without the Jedi Council even realizing it. Meanwhile the Sith continued to attack and seize targeted Outer rim worlds, destroying the Sluis sector's Republican shipyards, blockading the Rimma Trade Route, and forcing the Minos Cluster and their resources into submission. The Republic and the Jedi were unable to respond to the initial invasion, caught up in confusion, and politics over whether choices made would leave specific systems open to attack.

As the first major victory for the Republic, the hopes of Republican citizens were re-vitalized. The Sith struck back at the Bothan space and the renewed strength of the Republic, and suffered heavy losses against their Republican and Jedi foes that had already accepted that their death was inevitable. The Republican soldiers and Jedi were eventually wiped out, but not before the Imperials were forced into a full retreat. The Emperor had expected to sweep through the galaxy destroying the Jedi and the Republic without the need for alliances, however he did not foresee the sacrifices his enemies were willing to make, such as the heroic stand on Bothawui that restored hope, and rallied the Republic's forces to fight with renewed courage. As a result, the Empire changed strategy by 3667 BBY, and used Imperial Intelligence officers to forge alliances with criminal networks, Hutt cartels and Bounty Hunters. Most would remain independent however, until Imperial Intelligence managed to produce a puppet Mandalore figure for Mandalorian mercenaries and Bounty Hunters to rally under. This was the second step in the Emperor's master\u2014plan. Using their Mandalorian allies to their advantage, the Sith used them to blockade the Hydian Way, and block off the Republic's supplies and military support to the Outer rim.
