When word spread across Kashyyyk that a Separatist Droid Army would soon be invading Kachirho, Wookiees from all across the planet rushed to the coastal city's defense. Merumeru's volunteer soldiers fought on the ground during the battle, and were one element of a much larger Wookiee force that also included aerial vehicles.
