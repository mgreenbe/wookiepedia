A student of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, Tai learned the ways of the Force alongside other students, including Skywalker's nephew Ben Solo. He was returning from an off-world mission with fellow Jedi Hennix and Voe when the Jedi training temple was destroyed. Finding the temple ablaze, they confronted Solo who overpowered the trio before retreating to Snoke. The three Jedi pursued him, believing he was responsible for the death of their master, although Tai remained adamant that Solo was not a murderer. However, after Solo accidentally killed Hennix on Elphrona, Tai concluded that his former friend was lost and set himself to track him down with Voe so they could kill him. When they traveled to the Minemoon to confront Solo and the Knights of Ren, Tai made another attempt to get through to his friend Ben, but was then killed by \"Ren,\" the original leader of the Knights of Ren.

When Ben told him that he did so because of the pressures of living up to his family's legacy, Tai assured him that he needed to be who he really was and that he wasn't as bad as he thought. Comforted, Solo asked him if he was really sure about his words, leading Tai to reiterate him that he shouldn't be afraid of what other people thought about him and just be himself, as the rest would follow."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Temple's destruction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 28 ABY, Tai was on an off-world mission with Voe and Hennix. By the time they returned, the Jedi temple was destroyed. They confronted Solo amidst the burning ruins of the Jedi temple, having sensed only his presence in the Force. Solo, who believed their master tried to murder him in his sleep, told the students that he killed Skywalker in self-defense. Tai cautioned restraint, hoping to learn more about what had transpired from Solo's perspective, but the others drew their lightsabers and attempted to subdue Solo by force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Solo used the Force to overpower them, including Tai, the three Jedi returned to their starship Verity to prevent Solo's escape. Tai warned Voe against pursuing Solo, knowing that he came from a family that boasted some of the most renown pilots in the galaxy. Solo ultimately escaped and found sanctuary with Snoke, having disabled the Verity with his own vessel, the Grimtaash. Although the three Jedi agreed to continue pursuing Solo, Tai proposed informing Solo's mother, Leia Organa, about the situation. He was overruled by his colleagues, who believed they needed to learn the full story before involving anyone else. They traveled to the Jedi outpost on Elphrona where they found Solo with a mask that once belonged to Ren, the leader of the Knights of Ren.

However, Hennix threw his lightsaber from behind to kill Solo, leading the conflicted apprentice to let go Voe and redirect Hennix's weapon back to him. Tai did his best to slow Voe's fall with the Force, but Hennix was already dead. Before they could do anything, Solo ordered them to enter into the Jedi outpost. Tai tried to ask Solo about Hennix's fate, but Solo insisted that it didn't matter anymore and pushed them into the outpost, then sealing the entrance with rocks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Long after Solo left Elphrona for Varnak, Tai and Voe pushed the rocks off their way.

Tai responded that it was not yet too late for Solo to turn around, saying that every path goes in two directions.
