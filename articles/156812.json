He first took part in the events of the Invasion of Naboo when the Trade Federation lured the Queen of the planet Naboo into an ambush. A squadron of mercenary craft engaged portions of Bravo Flight as the Queen was escorted by Essara Till and Rhys Dallows. While piloting N-1 starfighters, the two Naboo pilots, destroyed all the attackers. After the Queen had escaped into hyperspace, the mercenary leader shot down Till's starfighter with his craft's missiles, killing her. He then turned his weapons onto Dallows, disabling his starfighter. Dallows was later rescued by the Toydarian junker, Reti, and the two eventually joined the Naboo Resistance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dallows and the mercenary leader met again during the final battle of the Naboo conflict when the Naboo pilots of Bravo Flight were assaulting the Trade Federation's Droid Control Ship to disable the Trade Federation Droid Army. After the N-1 starfighters destroyed the first wave of droid starfighters and the Control Ship's Receiver Stations, the mercenary leader joined the battle and shot down one of the Naboo pilots. Dallows pursued the mercenary and successfully damaged his ship, but not before the mercenary was able to launch missiles in return. Dallows survived their explosions, but while the hangar bay shields were down when the Control Ship launched a C-9979 landing craft, the mercenary ducked into the right-hand hangar. He was pursued inside by Dallows and they dueled inside the hangar. After their duel, the mercenary was forced to fall back deeper inside the Control Ship. Dallows continued his pursuit, and the mercenary flew through the power grid and into the innermost hangar. There, Dallows confronted him again. As they dueled, the mercenary complimented Dallows' skill, expressing regret about killing the talented Naboo pilot. Ultimately, Dallows proved to be the superior pilot, and the mercenary died when his craft exploded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This individual, identified as Mercenary Leader by the targeting computer, appears in the 2001 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Starfighter.
