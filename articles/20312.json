She was related to Bail Antilles, who represented their home planet in the Senate of the Galactic Republic. As a child, she grew up in the Royal Palace of Aldera, the planet's capital city. She was introduced to Alderaanian pacifist values by her mother, and was first in line to inherit the mantle of Queen of Alderaan. At some point before she was fourteen, Princess Breha accompanied the queen to help her negotiate a treaty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the age of sixteen, she underwent her Day of Demand ceremony, during which she claimed her right to the throne by naming three challenges she would have to complete to prove herself worthy. While completing her Challenge of the Body, Breha suffered a bad fall, and her injuries nearly killed her, if not for the quick action by the guards who were observing at a distance. Although she did survive, her heart and lungs had to be replaced by pulmonodes.

She also served as the minister of education for her planet. During Queen Breha's reign, and through her husband's efforts in the Senate, Alderaan advocated ending the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, due to the planet's pacifist beliefs, and hosted a conference to assist refugees displaced by the galactic conflict."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Clone Wars came to an end, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine\u2014secretly the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, who manipulated the conflict to his own tyranical ends\u2014abolished the Republic and transformed it into the Galactic Empire, with himself as absolute ruler. He also issued Order 66, a command to all clone troopers to kill their Jedi leaders, thus destroying the Jedi Order. During that time, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala gave birth to twins, Luke and Leia, before dying. The children's father, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, had also turned to the dark side of the Force and become Darth Vader bringing an end to both the Jedi and the Separatists. Knowing that the children would be in danger if the Sith discovered their existence\u2014both the Emperor and Vader believed that Amidala died before giving birth\u2014it was decided that Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi would take Luke to live with Vader's family on Tatooine. With the consent of both Kenobi and Master Yoda, Bail decided that he and his wife would adopt Leia and raise her as their daughter; the two had always wanted to adopt a girl. The Queen then received a letter from her husband, informing her of Amidala's passing and the imminent arrival of something that would \"change [their] lives forever in a profound way.\" When the Viceroy finally came back to the palace, he placed baby Leia in the arms of the Queen, who gazed lovingly at her new daughter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One day, as the queen had retreated to the palace's gardens to read a book, she welcomed her toddler daughter, who had escaped the vigilance of her attendant droid WA-2V.

Because she refused to provide the location, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, the station's commander and Governor of the Outer Rim Territories, threatened to destroy Alderaan if she did not comply. The princess provided a false location and, though Tarkin trusted her, the Grand Moff nonetheless chose to target Alderaan; the Empire considered it to be a haven for rebellious activity, and Tarkin believed destroying it would be an effective demonstration of the station's power. The planet was destroyed upon being hit by the Death Star's superlaser, killing all who resided upon it\u2014including Queen Breha and her husband. Breha had worried about Leia while she was on her mission, and as Bail was away, she could not talk to anyone else, due to security concerns. She was supposed to be planning for the upcoming equinox festivities, but had no enthusiasm for it. Bail's return home from Yavin 4 only amplified Breha's worry, as the Viceroy had learned that the Tantive IV, Leia's ship, had been captured and destroyed. The Queen knew nothing of her daughter's fate, and was intensely worried.

As Leia coped with her loss in a way that made her seem indifferent, Evaan resented the princess for not mourning her parents properly.
