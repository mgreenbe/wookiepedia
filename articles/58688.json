Unlike YT-series of ships for tramp captains, the Hawk line was aimed at more upscale clients, like wealthy merchants and noble politicians. The series saw modest success, but never reached the amount of sales of YT-series, and was discontinued during the Clone Wars to make way for military production."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Measuring twenty-nine meters in length, the HWK-290 resembled the head of a large raptor, and required a pilot and co-pilot to operate. The freighter could accommodate up to six passengers and 150 tons of cargo. The ships were produced without armament; they used speed and maneuverability to escape most situations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The most famous of the series was the Moldy Crow, a heavily modified HWK-290 freighter used by Kyle Katarn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
