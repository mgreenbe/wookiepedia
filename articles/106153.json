In real-life astronomy, the Pleiades is an open star cluster located in the constellation of Taurus. A June 12, 2015 update to the Star Wars: The Essential Atlas Companion added an Endymion system in the Kalamith sector of the Outer Rim, though no mention of the Pleiades was made."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
