The planet was connected by hyperlanes to the Solacton and Sriluur systems, lying at a distance of one hour and two hours' hyperspace travel using a Class 1 hyperdrive, respectively. Occupying the third and outermost orbital position in the Vaath'kror system, Vaathkree was a considerable distance away from the other two planets of the system, with its year lasting 197 local days, each of which was fifty-four standard hours long."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet had heavy, 1.8 standard gravity and a corrosive, poisonous, searing hot Type IV atmosphere that necessitated the use of environment suits for most sentient beings. Vaathkree's harsh, highly volatile surface, which suffered constant meteor impacts, included chains of active volcanic mountains and deep crevasses as well as extensive flats of lava and exposed radioactive metals. The planet had an arid hydrosphere."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Space surrounding Vaathkree was explored between 15,000 BBY and 8000 BBY, although the planet had already been located in the territory controlled by members of the Hutt species by 25,000 BBY. During the Pius Dea Era, a period of time between approximately 12,000 BBY and 11,000 BBY, Vaathkree was situated outside the borders of the Galactic Republic. It was a part of Hutt Space in 22 BBY, when the Republic's Thirteenth Sector Army was charged with engaging the military forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems in Vaathkree's vicinity as part of the first campaigns of the Clone Wars that began that year."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 17 BBY, the northern portions of Hutt Space, including Vaathkree, were annexed by the Galactic Empire, although that government mostly ignored the planet.

The Vaathkree began their multi-stage life cycle as \"Stonesingers\"\u2014small, mobile nodes of living metal ore that inhabited the planet Vaathkree's lava flats and crevasses. Young Stonesingers did not possess cognitive abilities and spent the nights roaming their homeworld's plains and absorbing bits of lava and stone, which were then incorporated into the fluid structure of their bodies. Over a period of two decades, the Stonesingers evolved into mature Vaathkree, in the process adopting a permanent\u2014most frequently Humanoid\u2014shape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For many millennia, the Vaathkree, who communicated in the Vaathkree trade language, were active members of the Republic, and they were active traders, adhering to a religious tradition known as The Deal. The population of Vaathkree numbered six million, and it was governed by the Vaathkree Council. The Vaathkree society had reached the space level of technology, and it imported computers, droids, and other high technology from off-world while exporting mid-level technology and raw materials."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Off-world tourists often encountered the Vaathkree Stonesingers on the planet but were ordered to only observe them from afar.
