While Zeer and his men served as a distraction by barricading themselves in Docking Bay 84 of the nearby Coruscant Spaceport, Tarnis then escaped to the territory of his allies in the paramilitary Justicars' Brigade and continued his plans to acquire the Planet Prison superweapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3643 BBY, during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, the Jedi Council sensed a disturbance in the Force on the Republic capital of Coruscant and dispatched the Jedi Master Bela Kiwiiks and her Padawan, Kira Carsen, to investigate. Kiwiiks was able to confirm the dark presence on the capital, though she was unaware that its source was in fact the Sith Lord Tarnis, who was posing as a Republic scientist named Eli Tarnis on the Republic superweapon initiative. Sensing that his position was compromised, Tarnis contacted the Migrant Merchants' Guild and Black Sun criminal syndicates, and arranged for the theft of the design files for Tarnis's project, the Planet Prison superweapon, in order to draw potential suspicion away from himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When a young Jedi Knight, the former apprentice of Jedi Master Orgus Din, was sent to retrieve the files from the criminals in the Old Galactic Market region, Tarnis contacted Black Sun's leader, Salarr.

Zeer and his team barricaded themselves in Docking Bay 84 of the spaceport as a distraction, though Carsen and the CSF officers eventually broke the criminals' lines with the aid of the Jedi Knight who had been sent to retrieve the stolen design files.
