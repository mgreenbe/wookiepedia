Designed specifically to contain multiple cargo containers in the Xizor line, the container hangar could be customized with laser turrets for protection. In addition, a number of them served as starfighter hangars for installations that required starfighter defense, but did not have the hangar facilities to support them. The TIE Experimental Project used container hangars to store the Experimental TIEs both at the Nomlis III Factory and at Obsidian platform."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
