She would then have her merchants sell their antiquated weapons to the Tuskens more much more than they were worth. The Tuskens' Jedi leader, Sharad Hett, who had lived with them for several years, found out about Gardulla's plot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sharad Hett and his Tuskens retaliated, first attacking Jawa sandcrawlers and places where the weapons were being sold, then moving on to attack bigger settlements, like Anchorhead. During the raid on Anchorhead, a Galactic Republic surveyor took a holo of the Tuskens slaughtering with amazing skill the thugs who opposed them. He took the holo to the Jedi Council on Coruscant, so that they and the Republic might be able to put an end to this conflict."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the holo arrived, Jedi Masters Yoda and Eeth Koth took a look at it, and discovered something amazing. If they enlarged the holo on the Tusken in the holo who appeared to be the leader, they would see a lightsaber hanging at his belt. Ki-Adi-Mundi came to take a look at it, and recognized the lightsaber. He knew that it was the weapon of Sharad Hett, who had vanished about 15 years before. He believed Sharad to be dead, but Yoda and Koth thought that that was him also. From what they had heard from the surveyor of the mysterious Tusken leader, the Tuskens now weren't just fighting sloppily in tiny bands, they were now launching full-scale assaults with the precision of an elite army. The Jedi then sent Ki to investigate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ki arrived and eventually met up with Sharad, he tried to convince Sharad to return, but was rejected. Sharad revealed he had had a son, and was now with the Tuskens, but still a Jedi nonetheless. Eventually, Ki and Sharad saw a huge task force led by Gardulla set out to attack the Tusken camp."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sharad set off to aid his warriors, and discovered that Gardulla had set a trap. She had had several of her troops on flyers and drawing the Tuskens closer. When the Tuskens had charged they threw and set off large bundles of explosives, killing many of the warriors. Sharad then rallied his troops, and attacked. The two armies fought, with Sharad's superior combat knowledge coming in hand and gaining him the upper hand. Gardulla eventually decided to pull back to Mos Espa, but Sharad leapt onto her flyer and quickly killed all five of her bodyguards. Meanwhile, Jabba's troo, (tipped off by Sing), arrived to help Gardulla. Sharad then decided to not kill Gardulla, but stood at the top of the railing on her flyer, commanding his troops. This made him an easy target, and Aurra Sing shot him in the arm, wounding him. She leapt forward and engaged him in lightsaber combat, and eventually stabbed Sharad. Sharad's son and Ki arrived, and A'Sharad angrily sprung toward Sing. He was about to kill her, but Ki told her that was not the way of the Jedi, A'Sharad considered this, and this bought Sing a moment to kick A'Sharad and escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the end, A'Sharad decided to become Ki's Padawan, and the Tuskens were decimated, losing the battle. With the death of their leader, the Tuskens now were very uncoordinated and unable to reassemble an army. The Tuskens then returned to their isolated life in the Jundland Wastes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
