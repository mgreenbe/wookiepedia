When the Delorf \"sensitives\" detected a threat, they gathered in a ritual known as Renik, which purged the hostility from the individual in question, \"making him one of the Delorf in mind if not in body\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although it is not explicit in the extant Imperial accounts, this phrase suggests that the Renik was primarily used against non-Delorf, and aided the survival of the species in the heavily industrialized and high-tech Core by brainwashing interstellar visitors to their homeworld, and forcing them to join the Delorf herd-mentality."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An Imperial Security Bureau report included in The Imperial Sourcebook dismisses this story, however, and says that \"Renik\" was simply the name of Admiral Kiner turned back-to-front, a pun on the fact that it was a counter-intelligence agency. It is thus unclear how much any of the information on the Delorf current within Renik was true."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The original account of the Renik, however, bears some similarity, however, to the effect of the t'landa Til mating call on beings of other species, known as the Exultation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
