During the Clone Wars, Syub Kyak and his family hired it for their vacation. However, his children rewired the navigational controls, causing it to get stuck in a radiation storm on Genarius. Syub sent out a distress call and the CST safety ship Starchaser IV arrived and was able to save the Crest. It was then flown to the nearby floating city of Edic Bar, so that repairs could be made to it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
