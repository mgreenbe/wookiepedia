They were genetically made to serve as a race of builders to replace the Charr Ontee who were banished. They appeared as a race of huge worms that could exude a resinous substance which was used to form the structural supports of buildings. Once the Darkstryder's fortress lair was finished, the Segmi's purpose had ended and they wandered away, forming their own civilization. Like most of the other Kathol servants, the Segmi also learned to manipulate the Ta-Ree life energy around the Kathol's ancient homeworld. Some members of the species were recaptured when the Darkstryder required new parts to be developed in its fortress."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
