Above that ring was a central tower with four sections branching off at even intervals from the top, and the sections curved downwards with two of them ending just above the lower ring and the other two ending at the same level as the ring. On account of the vessel's ancient construction, it was virtually invisible to standard sensor technology as of 3639 BBY, and its technology dwarfed that of the rest of the galaxy by that time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "First created by the Gree species thousands of years before the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, the Gray Secant\u2014as the ship became known to the Gree by 3639 BBY\u2014was dispatched to explore and study the far reaches of the galaxy as an automated vessel. The vessel jumped from star system to star system for centuries, studying each of the planets and species it encountered. When the vessel finally came back into contact with the Gree around 3639 BBY, it became an icon of almost religious significance to its creators, who had lost much of their technological advances and techniques. When it reappeared over Ilum, it drew the attention of the Gree and both the Republic and the Empire, and the nature of the ongoing Battle of Ilum changed as both sides attempted to win favor with the Gree and unlock the ship's secrets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gray Secant was first mentioned in an early press release for Star Wars: The Old Republic Game Update 1.7: Return of the Gree on January 15, 2013.
