Slashrats exuded a combination of sweat and pheromones called killscent to alert other slashrats and could attract them for miles. The pack surrounded the prey, striking repeatedly and mercilessly, stripping it to the bone. Slashrats ignored all other prey while engaged in a killball, and one way to escape them was to distract them by incapacitating another creature. Jedi Corran Horn defeated Yuuzhan Vong warrior Dranae Shai by summoning slashrats with a mental projection of killscent, prompting them to form a killball around him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
