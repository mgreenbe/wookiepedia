During the blockade, the ship attempted to leave the planet Burnin Konn; however, the vessel was shot down by Imperial forces and crashed. The Empire then cordoned off the crash site, deploying a force of Imperial cadets to protect it. The Trade league was ready to write the vessel off as a loss, but the gangster Happy Dapp, a friend of the League active on Burnin Konn, then sent a young smuggler to create a distraction in front of the Pretty Profit so that the gangster's droids could recover the cargo from the back undisturbed. The smuggler fought a large number of cadets at the vessel's front in order to create the distraction, which allowed for all cargo to be recovered by Dapp."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Pretty Profit first appeared in the video game Star Wars: Uprising, which was released on mobile platforms in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
