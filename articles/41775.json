After a noted criminal Bel Nerodia took over the gang, he quickly made Dust Vipers into a force to be reckoned with, establishing the Den near Anchorhead. In 3630 BBY the Dust Vipers ambushed an Eternal Alliance supply convoy and obtained security plans for the Alliance base on Odessen. This prompted the Alliance to retaliate against the Dust Vipers and a task force was sent into the compound. Bel Nerodia himself confronted the group, but was defeated and killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dust Viper Den appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne during the \"Done and Dusted\" Uprising."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
