Obsessed with prophecies and visions of the future, the Presagers committed millions of sacrifices in hopes of being granted visions. During the Republic Era, the Presagers were thought to be extinct. However, the last coven and its priestess managed to survive, and hid on the planet Asusto. The Presagers on Asusto led the Jedi Master Lene Kostana and Padawans Dooku and Sifo-Dyas into a trap in order to undertake a ritual. Upon experiencing a Force vision, Dooku unwillingly used Force lightning to kill the Presagers and free himself and his fellow Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
