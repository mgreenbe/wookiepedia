It was used when a pilot told his astromech droid to make it look like his engines were damaged by trailing smoke. The enemy would think the ship was damaged and vulnerable. To stop any allies from trying to help the Rebel, the pilot would tell his squadron, \"I'm wobbly as a mother Gorgybird.\" The pilot would then tell his droid to kill the smoke, and finally he would destroy the unsuspecting enemies on his tail."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The phrase stemmed from the mother gorgy-bird, who pretended to be wounded to lure predators away from her nest.
