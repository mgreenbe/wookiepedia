The arms dealer Ebann Drake boarded the vessel after being invited to what he claimed was an incredible opportunity. Lady Domina Tagge of the Tagge Corporation, Drake's cousin and business associate, sent the rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Aphra and the smuggler Sana Starros to locate Drake when Tagge did not hear from him following his departure. Aboard the Opal Empress, Aphra and Starros found that Drake and the other passengers had been killed by the parasites known as cymotes. The bounty hunter Durge, attempting to take out the bounty on Drake, confronted them aboard the vessel, but before either could determine the cause of the deaths, a number of cymotes swarmed out of the ship's vents and attacked them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
