It was used to turn Lord Shadowspawn's prisoners into Pawns. Pawns would use their neural stunners to liquefy a coffin-sized area in the smooth stone into a fluid stone that was the consistency of cold barkmeal. They would then place a stunned prisoner inside the liquid stone until only the individual's head was exposed. From there, they would be slowly turned into Pawns after much tinkering with their brains."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
