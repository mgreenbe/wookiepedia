Blotus's ascension to the office marked the apex of millennia of Hutt immigration to the Republic; in becoming the first Hutt Supreme Chancellor, Blotus had dispelled the fixed stereotypes assigned to the Hutt species. Under his reign as Chancellor, the Republic benefited from a period of prosperity. When Blotus granted tax breaks to independent merchants, trade prospered within the Core Worlds, and the Republic capital of Coruscant specifically enjoyed substantial economic growth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hutt's term as the leader of the galactic government lasted for 275 years, after which Blotus died at the age of 912, peacefully passing away in his sleep.
