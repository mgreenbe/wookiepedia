The Ultragungan Militia was known to be in open conflict with the Naboo and with the rest of the Gungan society. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, they stole an artifact from Boss Rugor Nass, broke it into six pieces, and scattered it across different areas of Naboo, namely the Darkwalker Cave, the Mummer bunker, the Moenia University Hall, the Keren Bank, the Mauler Stronghold and the Skaak Tipper Hideout."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 1 ABY, Boss Nass hired a spacer to recover the six pieces of the artifact. The spacer succeeded, and in return, Nass assisted the spacer with recovering an experimental Old Republic droid module, a stochastic decision chip, contained into a super battle droid in possession of the Ultragungans. Boss Nass first suggested examining flawed Ultragungan battle droids for clues about how to bypass the hardware security on Ultragungan droids. The spacer then attacked Ultragungan foot soldiers and discovered that the super battle droid self-destruct security mechanism could be bypassed using a password. The spacer eventually found the password from an Ultragungan droidtech toolkit in the Ultragungan Droidtech Camp. With this password, the spacer was finally able to enter the Ultragungan Lair and destroy the super battle droid to recover the Old Republic droid module."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ultragungans appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
