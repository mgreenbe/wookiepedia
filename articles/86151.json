Saxon and his followers later became the Empire's Super Commandos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this time, Imperial Academy cadet Sabine Wren created a weapon known as The Duchess.

The two fought until Sabine was able to reclaim the Darksaber and used both it and Bridger's lightsaber at Saxon's throat. However, Sabine refused to kill Saxon, who was instead killed by Ursa.

As the convoy approached the edge of a cliff, Bridger gave Alrich his jetpack to jump before the Imperial Troop Transport went off the cliff. Sabine and Alrich briefly reunited before Imperial reinforcements arrived. Despite Ursa's belief they would have two victories, the Empire deployed a AT-DP of unusual design.

Kryze and Sabine were tortured by the Duchess until Sabine acquiesced to his wishes, despite Hark's and Kryze's objections to this. After Sabine fixed the Duchess, Saxon reactivated it. However, Sabine had altered to target stormtrooper armor and the Duchess then targeted Saxon and the stormtroopers all across the Star Destroyer. At first, Sabine wanted to kill Saxon for rebuilding her weapon, but Kryze convinced her to destroy and fight with honor.
