In 7 ABY it was part of a task force lured into a trap by New Republic forces in the Morobe system. During the battle X-wings from Wraith Squadron delivered a barrage of proton torpedoes across the ship's midsection, literally snapping it in half. Loss of atmosphere and further internal explosions killed any remaining crew members before New Republic rescue forces could arrive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
