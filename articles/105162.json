Around the year 1 ABY, the Rebel Alliance began a campaign into the Mid Rim which lasted nine months. During the campaign, the Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry, better known as Twilight Company, fought at Phorsa Gedd's factory-deserts. When the campaign failed and the Alliance began withdrawing from the Mid Rim, the Twilight Company was redeployed to a number of locations it had fought on just months before and the engineer Vifra joined the company off of Phorsa Gedd between 2 ABY and 3 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, Hazram Namir, a First Sergeant in Twilight Company reflected on the fighting on Phorsa Gedd, which he remembered vividly, in his mind when looking back on the failed Mid Rim campaign while on the planet Haidoral Prime. Shortly before the Battle of Hoth that same year, Namir reminisced about the battle to his comrades Beak and Roja on the planet Hoth. Following the Siege of Inyusu Tor, Carver, another member of Twilight Company who had served on Phorsa Gedd, told stories of the latter battle while in a cantina in the Sullust's capital city Pinyumb. Several weeks after the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, the New Republic pilots Wyl Lark and Nath Tensent told stories of their worst nights in the wilderness, one of them described spending evenings in the factory-deserts of Phorsa Gedd."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Phorse Gedd was first mentioned in Battlefront: Twilight Company, a novel written by Alexander Freed and published in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
