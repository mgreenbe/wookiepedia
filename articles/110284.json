During the war, R8 accompanied Windu to the planet Vanqor, where they looked for survivors of the crash of a Venator-class Star Destroyer Endurance. Alongside Anakin Skywalker and fellow astromech R2-D2, R8 and Windu searched the wreckage of the cruiser, unaware of a pair of gundarks stalking the group. After the Jedi journeyed further into the crash site, the gundarks attacked the two droids and tore apart R8 during the struggle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
