It was once a spaceport, but after Nom Anor's rise to power, it was torn down to create an area where citizens could stone droids and other pieces of technology to destruction. It could contain over 10,000 people for such ceremonies. The center of the Square was a pit thirty meters wide and ten deep, where the Portmaster's Pavilion once stood."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
