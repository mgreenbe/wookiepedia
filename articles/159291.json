General Jan Dodonna assigned Willard, now an Alliance general, to command Yavin 4's planetary defenses. Willard was speaking with Bail Organa through a secure HoloNet channel when Alderaan was destroyed. Willard feared that Princess Leia Organa had perished, and was elated when she arrived at Yavin 4 with the plans for the Death Star. When the Death Star arrived in the Yavin system, Willard began devising an evacuation plan after assisting Dodonna with the development of an attack plan against the space station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Willard was consulted with Luke Skywalker's successful flight simulator results prior to the battle, and supported Skywalker joining Red Squadron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Alliance victory at Yavin, Willard coordinated the Battle of Shaylin 18, and then was assigned the command of Delta Base and of Suolriep sector.

While the CCG accurately identifies Willard (as played by Byrne), other sources, such as Star Wars: Rebellion and Star Wars: Rebellion: Prima's Official Strategy Guide, have confused Byrne's Willard with the mustachioed General Bob Hudsol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
