He served the Believers, a Sith-worshipping cult that operated in the Cularin system, and became brainwashed into supporting the ideology of the sect. Around 31 BBY, the Believers devised to steal the Pulas, a powerful Sith artifact, which was being transported to the planet Coruscant by the Jedi Order. Blaise joined a team of Believers who set out to steal the artifact when it arrived on the world, being brought along on the mission for his technical skills. The cultists ambushed a starship on a Coruscant landing platform that they believed was shipping the Pulas, shooting the Bothan Jedi Knight Nysis Belzara and incapacitating the vessel's crew, though Blaise himself took no part in the attack. Blaise and the other Believers then seized a Mandalorian iron box that they thought contained the Pulas, though which was actually a decoy planted by the Jedi, and fled the scene in a speeder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cultists sought to take the stolen box to a secret base in the Coruscant undercity. However, the Believers were tracked by a group of spacers who were assisting the Jedi with the transportation of the Pulas and a speeder chase ensued. The pursuit ended when the Believers' speeder crashed into a building in the Coruscant undercity. Blaise survived the impact and was thrown to one side severely injured, being left struggling to breath and with a face covered by burns. The other cultists abandoned Blaise at the crash site and ran off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi-allied spacers arrived at the wrecked speeder and provided Blaise basic medical treatment to stabilize his condition.

He also viewed all beings who were not part of the cult as gravely evil and as a result he did not expect any non-Believers to come to his aid when he was injured a speeder crash on Coruscant.

In Coruscani Dawn, the players roleplay as the spacers who pursue the Believers through the Coruscant undercity and it is possible for the player characters to provide medical assistance to Blaise. If they restore him to consciousness then the player characters can coerce him, either through persuasion or a Jedi mind trick, into providing details of the location of the Believers' hideout in the Coruscant undercity. If taken prisoner by the spacers, Blaise refuses to accompany them away from the speeder wreckage but does assent to being tied up and left in the spacers' own vehicle. If the players do not intervene to stabilize Blaise's condition the cultist dies at the crash site from his injuries sustained in the collision."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
