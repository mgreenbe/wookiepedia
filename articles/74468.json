Along with his Padawan, Etain Tur-Mukan, Fulier was assigned to the planet Qiilura to investigate oppression by the Trade Federation. While Tur-Mukan went on to complete the mission, Master Fulier did not survive his time on the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Discovered to be Force-sensitive at an early age, Kast Fulier was trained at the Jedi Temple's academy on Coruscant, eventually being selected by a Jedi Master to study as a Padawan. After years of study and constructing a blue lightsaber, Fulier passed his Trials of Knighthood and was made a Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council. Serving the Order for many years and building a reputation as being loose with rules, like to that of Master Qui-Gon Jinn, Fulier eventually took on Initiate Etain Tur-Mukan as his own pupil, after having achieved the title of Master himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, the High Council was made aware of a growing presence of the Trade Federation on the world of Qiilura and suspected that they may be aiding in the growth of the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Separatist Crisis. Dispatching Fulier and Padawan Tur-Mukan to investigate, the Council was particularly interested in the involvement of the notorious scientist Ovolot Qail Uthan and the Mandalorian mercenary, Ghez Hokan. Undercover on the agricultural-reliant planet, the Jedi began attempts to infiltrate small farming communities, but they only met in failure as the farmers were aligned with Hokan thanks to his pay-offs. Eventually, the Jedi were turned over to the Mandalorian, but not before Tur-Mukan could escape into the country side. Brought to the Trade Federation stronghold for interrogation, Hokan killed Fulier with his own lightsaber after the Knight refused to talk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Survived by his Padawan, reinforcements eventually came to her aid on Qiilura in the form of Republic commandos. Raiding the Trade Federation facility, the commandos killed Hokan and arrested the scientist he protected. Commando RC-8015 retrieved Fulier's lightsaber from Hokan's corpse and passed it along to Padawan Tur-Mukan at the end of the Qiilura incident. While Tur-Mukan died in the initial stages of the Great Jedi Purge, Fulier's lightsaber was recovered by her loyal commandos and passed along to her secret son, Venku Skirata."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Those that knew Fulier noted that he never backed down from a challenge. While on Qiilura, Fulier used his and his Padawan's entire supply of bacta spray to help the villagers instead of keeping any for their own use. He was captured while trying to teach one of Hokan's thugs a lesson about abusing the townsfolk. Fulier refused to let a difficult or impossible situation stop him from doing what he felt was right, no matter the consequences."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
