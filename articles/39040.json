When Solo arrived at the reserve, he found that Dr. Genzhor had been slain by his assistant, Ooris, when he pushed him into a pit of sarlaccs, and he was trying to scam him and attempted to steal his ship, the Millennium Falcon. After the events on I'vorcia Prime, Dok-Ondar was met again by Solo, returning the infant sarlacc.

Dok-Ondar fired a EMP pulse at BT-1 and refused to let the sword go to her. Aphra refused to give him the sword and had BT-1 take out the last of his muscle. Dok-Ondar shot at Aphra and split the sword in half. As he tried to reclaim the sword, which was now stuck in the ground, he noticed 0-0-0 rebooting and decided to take what he could, claiming one half and leaving Aphra the other half.

Dok-Ondar was disappointed with how late the crew was, due to the First Order's arrival and Io needing to take a longer route through an alley. While there, the other member of Voss' crew, Wooro, noticed an infant sarlacc. Dok-Ondar told him the story of Solo smuggling them in from a reserve on I'vorcia Prime, but Voss immediately got to showing Dok-Ondar what she wants to sell him. When Dok-Ondar saw what was on the screen, a lightsaber, he asked them to leave immediately. His assistant asked him how that weapon could have been retrieved, and Dok-Ondar wanted to make sure it did not fall into the wrong hands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the First Order arrived at Dok-Ondar's place to investigate the lightsaber that he owned.

Varg incapacitated Io and impersonated him to get on the inside of the Kendooh Gang. Then, Dok-Ondar listened in on a conversation between Voss and Hondo Ohnaka, who he was in league with. Voss revealed part of her plan to Ohnaka, trying to hire him as a pilot, unaware of his ties with Dok-Ondar. However, when Voss showed Ohnaka what the cargo was, the Sword of Khashyun, Dok-Ondar was furious to see Ohnaka reveal his knowledge of the sword to Voss."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ohnaka made his way to Dok-Ondar to inform him of what he knew, but when he began to babble loudly in the street, Dok-Ondar angrily silenced him, warning him of the amount of spies in the area.

Dok-Ondar explained the mission he and Aphra undertook on Moraband to Ohnaka, and when Ohnaka asked for more details, Dok-Ondar told him that they could talk more at the safe house, expressing his desire to move the hilt to Ohnaka's ship before it could be stolen.

After the stormtroopers beat Wooro and hit Voss on the chin with a blaster, they questioned Voss about her intentions on Batuu, believing her to be with the Resistance. Then, Voss improvised, eventually passing off the hilt to Wooro, who would unknowingly give it to Varg, thinking he was Io. Varg returned the hilt to Dok-Ondar, who then contacted Voss via hologram to reveal he was the benefactor that had hired them. Dok-Ondar told them that he could not afford to let them sell the blade and instead tried to unite the two pieces. As he succeeded in doing so, he told the crew that their payment was leaving the planet safely, saying he gave the First Order an anonymous tip regarding their location that would give them enough time to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dok-Ondar was known for being a bit temperamental, yet he was willing to sell good stuff to his customers if they did the right deals with him.
