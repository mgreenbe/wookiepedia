Using sonic weapons in the underground Geonosian-built tunnels, the hives battled one another for the planet's resources as well as dominance over each other, contesting for rulership of the major hives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Geonosians were associated with the Galactic Republic when the neighboring planet Tatooine was first settled, the Republic later withdrew from the latter after settlement attempts there largely failed. As a result, the Geonosians had lost the means to readily trade with wealthier worlds and were left to focus on their internal conflicts. However, the conflicts ended after the Republic rediscovered Geonosis, whereby the world became an industrial powerhouse for weapons of war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Geonosian wars were first mentioned in the 2016 reference book Star Wars: Complete Locations, in a section focusing on locations from the 2002 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.
