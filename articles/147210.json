He and his crew were one of several groups that converged on the crashed Separatist cruiser Obrexta III when it began emitting a distress signal on the planet Ponemah Terminal, hoping that he could claim the legendary lost treasure of the Sith Lord Count Dooku stored inside. The Devaronians traveled to the ship's location in the Sea of Sand on a wind-powered sailer in order to try and loot it, avoiding a battle being fought by three other pirating groups\u2014the crew of the Crimson Corsair Sidon Ithano, a gang of pirates led by the Weequay Scorza, and the Gray Gundarks biker gang\u2014on his way to the vessel in the hopes of beating them to it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sailer was halted before it could reach the cruiser when the Ithano's crew used a kinetic disruptor missile to freeze an approaching sandstorm, depriving Toltek's vessel of wind. After an hour of waiting, the wind returned, and the Devaronians finally reached the Obrexta III, only to find that the Corsair had already entered. Knowing he had the rival pirate group outgunned, Toltek chose to wait for Ithano to emerge with the prize and then take it from him. The Devaronian's plan never came to fruition however, as while he and his crew waited, the after effects of the kinetic disruption caused all the affected particles of sand to begin releasing energy in blasts comparable to the detonation of a thermal detonator, obliterating Toltek and his men."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Toltek first appeared in \"The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Count Dooku\", a short story written by Landry Q.
