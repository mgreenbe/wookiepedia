In 3640 BBY he and Moff Graham were invited by a fellow Moff Valion Pyron to observe the testing of the Silencer on the Harrower-class dreadnought Doombringer. When Pyron introduces Lord Kallig as the one responsible for the completion of the Silencer, Dolus was initially skeptical, as Kallig was a rival of Dark Council member Darth Thanaton. Before the testing, Captain Joris of Darth Achelon's flagship Carnage requested aid and Graham suggested to destroy Achelon, which displeased Dolus. After the successful testing of the Silencer, Dolus agreed to support Kallig."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moff Dolus appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the Sith Inquisitor class mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
