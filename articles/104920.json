It was a terrestrial world, with vast oceans divided by thin, mountainous, roughly linear continents that stretched between the planet's poles. Some mountain ranges were bordered by wide plains and low hills, while others steeply rose out of the water, forming fjords and long inland canyons. Phatrong had heavier gravity than the galactic standard and an uncommon atmospheric makeup."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Phatrong was a member of both the Galactic Republic and its successor state, the Galactic Empire.

Their reputation made the Empire cautious on Phatrong, and as long as taxes were paid on time, it generally exerted little direct influence over the world. Despite this, Kyuzo rebel sympathizers on Phatrong worked tirelessly to recruit like-minded individuals in hopes that they could bolster the Rebel Alliance at large and form the core of a major resistance force on their homeworld. The planet was mentioned in an artist's journal, which was restored, expanded, and displayed at the Graf Archive at some point after 34 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Phatrong was the homeworld of the Kyuzo species, which evolved dense muscle fibers and fast reflexes in the planet's heavy gravity and spoke their own language. Starting with early city-states, the natives developed societies that spanned considerable geographic areas of Phatrong. Kyuzo cities were scattered throughout the continents; most continents and major islands were their own political units, and the majority of Kyuzo identified as members of a particular country or region, though they did form a loose confederation that elected the planet's senators in the Senate of the Galactic Republic as well as the Imperial Senate of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kyuzo had a proud military history on Phatrong. Separate from their governments were the clovocs, organizations of warriors and other combatants that had their own traditions and rules outside the political region they inhabited. All forms of Kyuzo government made deals with the clovocs to provide security and military forces. Though they were not monolithic, as some regions had more traditional structures with integrated militaries, clovocs were common in several of the largest nations. Further, because many Kyuzo who traveled offworld were members of a clovoc, these warrior orders were one of the most recognized elements of Kyuzo culture by the galaxy at large, though many also sought simple lives as farmers and merchants, along with a number of other professions. Embo, a Kyuzo male who worked as a bounty hunter during the Clone Wars, was from Phatrong."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gorobe was one of the larger countries on Phatrong; the Gyaryi clovoc held a contract with it for centuries, and its ruling members had loyalties to the country's various houses. The inhabitants of southern Phatrong's haunted Kwaidan Peaks originally designed the Kyuzo war shield as a headpiece to protect travelers from torrential rains during monsoon season. However, the shield was transformed into a defensive weapon by the warriors of the Sulddo, a clovoc that operated in rugged, mountainous territory whose foundational myth claimed that its order hailed from the Kwaidan Peaks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Phatrong was originally created as the homeworld of the Kyuzo bounty hunter Embo, a character from the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series, and was first mentioned in the 2010 Star Wars Legends reference book Star Wars: The Clone Wars Character Encyclopedia, written by Jason Fry.
