During this battle, the Republic dropped an electro-proton bomb, the force of which formed a sinkhole. After the electromagnetic pulse wave dissipated, the All Terrain Tactical Enforcer (AT-TE) this trooper was piloting fell into the hole, along with several others. He survived the fall but was badly injured. He was later recovered by a rescue party led by Jedi General Mace Windu. As Windu knelt beside him, the clone informed the general that something other than Separatists was down there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cloned on the water world of Kamino from the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett, this pilot served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Battle of Malastare, he served under Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Mace Windu, commanding an AT-TE Tank against the approaching droid army.
