Thanks to information given to them by a local starship dealer, the Jedi were able to track the bounty hunters to a nearby filling station on Orondia. Ahsoka spotted the trio entering their ship to leave Orondia and so Anakin rammed it with his own ship to catch their attention. He then handed over the controls of the ship to Ahsoka whilst he jumped onto the bounty hunters' ship to prevent their escape. Cad Bane got out and used his rocket boots to fly around the ship and engage the Jedi. Meanwhile, Ahsoka attempted to keep the bounty hunters' ship close to the ground by ramming it from above. Skywalker deflected one of the blaster shots back at one of the Bane's boots, causing it to malfunction. Bane lost balance and crashed onto the hull of the ship with Skywalker following behind. Kenobi swerved the ship, causing Skywalker to lose balance and keep him from attacking Bane. He then fired on several fuel pipes ahead, causing them to explode and then flew right through the smoke. Ahsoka was caught off guard and collided with the bounty hunters' ship, sending both ships hurtling to the ground. Ahsoka temporarily lost conscience while Obi-Wan ran outside with a blaster in hand. Out of the fog, Skywalker jumped Kenobi and was about to deliver a fatal blow with his lightsaber when Bane fired his wrist rope around Skywalker, subduing him and saving Kenobi. As Bane dragged him away, Skywalker overwhelmed him, but Kenobi returned the favor by tackling Skywalker and began to beat him. But before knocking him unconscious, Kenobi whispered to Skywalker that he should stop following him. As Bane picked up his blaster, Ahsoka came to her master's rescue and deflected the shots. Eval announced that the ship was still operational and could fly. With that, the two bounty hunters and Kenobi left, while Ahsoka tended to her master."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker awoke a few seconds later and informed Ahsoka that he had felt Kenobi's presence through the Force.
