The code advocated the use of harsh methods of discipline, such as floggings and throwing crew members out of airlocks, and it was intended as a means by which to keep starship crews disciplined, so as to prevent mutinies. The starship captain Kortho Hatanga was an ardent supporter of The Code of the Stars, and of the principles that were demonstrated in the code."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
