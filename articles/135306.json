In 22 BBY, picadors riding orrays used static pikes to control the reek, nexu, and acklay that were released into the arena in order to execute the prisoners Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Padm\u00e9 Amidala. One picador prodded the nexu with a static pike, prompting the creature to attack and kill the picador. After the execution expanded into the First Battle of Geonosis, Kenobi took a picador's static pike and hurled it like a javelin at the ackaly, piercing it's hide but to little effect."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
