Before the perpetrator had been caught, the Jedi led an investigation to determine who was behind the attack. Skywalker approached Drallig, who was standing guard with the Temple Guard at the gates of the Jedi Temple, where protesters were demonstrating against the war and the Jedi Order's involvement in it. Skywalker showed Drallig a holographic image of their then-suspect, Jackar Bowmani, and asked the Jedi Master to be on alert for him. This led to the suspect's wife, Letta Turmond, being taken into custody after spotting the holographic image, and the Jedi ultimately learned that Turmond was part of the plot to attack the Jedi Temple."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Temple was later attacked by Captain Rackham Sear of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

He ordered the guards to stay with the younglings and destroy any more explosives that entered the area. Drallig then joined Masters Mace Windu and Kenobi, reporting to them that the younglings were safe, but that there were explosions throughout the Temple and that the source was unknown.
