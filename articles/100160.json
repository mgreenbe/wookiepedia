While en route to the DS-1 Orbital Battle Station, she received a vision of fiery destruction and was able to escape her containment. She attempted to flee the vessel by making use of her species' natural ability to camouflage, but was discovered by two Imperial stormtroopers. Although she was able to dispatch the two stormtroopers, by surrendering herself to the power of what she could only describe as \"It,\" she realised that there was nowhere to go, and retreated back into her containment, until finally arriving on the Death Star. Once aboard, Omi once again received a vision of fire, and was dumped into a garbage chute, introducing her to garbage masher 3263827, where she would feed on the organic materials that would fall in."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After rescuing Princess Leia Organa aboard the Death Star, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Luke Skywalker were temporarily stranded inside garbage masher 3263827, along with the Princess in the year 0 BBY.
