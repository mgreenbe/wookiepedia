A highly particular Roonan, Aang was an important member of the Senate Military Oversight Committee, and his vote was recruited by Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala during her campaign to curb the Republic's spending on the Grand Army of the Republic's war effort. Ultimately, however, Amidala's efforts failed, and the Senate instead voted to increase military spending to fund the production of five million additional clone troopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Roonan male Aang lived during the last decades of the Galactic Republic's rule. A politician, he became a senator of the Republic Senate, which was based on the galactic capital, Coruscant. He eventually attained a seat on the Senate Military Oversight Committee, a bureau affiliated with the operations of the Republic Military. By the time of the Clone Wars, his vote on the committee was considered to be decisive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 21 BBY, the war's second year, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala began a campaign to reduce the Republic's spending on the war effort against the separatist Confederacy of Independent Systems. She thus tried to persuade Aang to vote with her coalition, given his prominence on the Military Oversight Committee. As part of her negotiations with the Roonan, Amidala hosted a state banquet\u2014one that was said to be the most important party of the season\u2014in his honor at her apartment on Coruscant. The event also served as a celebration for the Roonan's birthday. Aang attended the event alongside Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and fellow senators Jakker-Sun, Kin Robb, Bail Prestor Organa, Mon Mothma, and Dantum Roohd. At the banquet, Amidala made sure to serve Aang's favorite dessert, jogan fruitcake, despite the rarity of fresh jogan fruit on Coruscant. Aang thereafter agreed to sign a treaty and support her campaign, leading a toast in honor of his decision."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aang was later present in the Senate when Senator Gume Saam proposed a measure for the deregulation of the InterGalactic Banking Clan to gain access to funds for the war effort. Despite Amidala's efforts to establish peace negotiations with the Separatist Parliament, the Senate ultimately voted in favor of Saam's bill in light of a Separatist attack on Coruscant's power generator. Even with Aang's support, Amidala's initiative to reduce military spending soon suffered a similar end, with the Senate rejecting it and instead electing to fund the production of five million additional clone troopers for the Grand Army of the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Roonan male, Aang had blue eyes and gray skin. Like most members of his species, he was very particular, and he sometimes mistook the slightest mistake on another's part for a deep insult. An influential senator of the Republic during the Clone Wars, he came to hold a decisive vote on the Senate Military Oversight Committee. Even though fresh jogan fruit was hard to come by on Coruscant, he greatly enjoyed jogan fruitcake as a dessert, to the point that Padm\u00e9 Amidala was able to win his support for her military spending reduction measure by serving the dish at a state banquet celebrating his birthday. Aang's favorite color was red, and he often wore a suit of red with black boots to official proceedings affiliated with the Galactic Senate. His high particularity caused Amidala to go to considerable lengths to entertain him; she even chose to wear a red dress at the banquet to please him with his favorite color."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Senator Aang was created for the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series and first appeared in the episode \"Evil Plans,\" which aired on November 5, 2010 as part of the series' third season.
