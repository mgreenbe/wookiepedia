The guns themselves were cobbled together from whatever scrap the Jawas could scavenge. The gun was made of a blaster rifle stripped down to its power pack, and then had its components replaced with an ion accelerator which was created using a droid restraining bolt and an accu-accelerator from a capital ship ignition system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When fired, the blaster attached the restraining bolt to the droid and then ordered a stop command which made the droid halt. Normally the bolt just told a droid to halt, but the addition of the accu-accelerator caused a large ion burst to completely disable the droid for a short while. Its maximum range was about 12 meters while its optimum range was about 8 meters. The blaster would cause no damage against organic creatures but would give them a nasty sting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Jawa ionization blaster was used to capture C-3PO and R2-D2 when they were stranded on Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
