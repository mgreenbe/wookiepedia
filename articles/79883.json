A relative of Magda Ulbreck, Langer was employed as a security guard on the moisture farm belonging to her husband, Wyle Ulbreck. Langer had a reputation as a good shot with a blaster rifle but had not had cause to fire in years before 19 BBY. During that year, Langer was guarding the Ulbreck's home when it came under attack from Orrin Gault, Mullen Gault, Veeka Gault and Jabe Calwell disguised as Tusken Raiders in an attempt to scare Wyle Ulbreck into joining the Settlers' Call Fund. Langer shouted a warning, but was knocked unconscious by the attackers before he could open fire. The Ulbrecks escaped the attack with the help of the exiled Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
