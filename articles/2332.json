A repulsorlift engine pod was mounted to each side of the fuselage, giving the landspeeder its signature appearance. The AB-1 could carry two people and could reach the same speeds as the X-34 landspeeder, but had worse terrain negotiation which made it slow on hills. However, its superb maneuverability and compact size made it an ideal city vehicle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
