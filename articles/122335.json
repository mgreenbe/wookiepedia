They utilized local materials, expanding by building their own facilities and maintaining themselves, slowly consumng the available space around them with no consideration for their surroundings. When the General Grievous, Supreme Commander of the Separatist Droid Army, led the occupation of Utapau, he did so backed by the forces of the Techno Union. The corporation added the planet to their portfolio, with Feethan Ottraw Scalable Assemblies becoming a Techno Union design firm. Grievous ordered the construction of Self-Constructing Armament Factories to build battle droids, starfighters, vehicles, and war machinery using Utapau's raw materials. Techno Union technicians installed one of these automated production faciltiies in Pau City's ancient Grand Hall of the Traders' Guild with no regard for the planet's architectual heriage. If left undisturbed, they would have turned Utapau into a fortress world riddled with ugly refineries and assembly lines, trembling under the weight of Separatist war machines."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
