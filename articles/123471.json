Taking the youth as his Padawan, Barrek escorted him to the Jedi Temple on the galactic capital of Coruscant so that Gi could be trained as a Jedi.

As the assembled Jedi waited for Grievous to assault them, Gi panicked and rushed out of the wreckage to face the enemy leader. Grievous appeared from above Gi, landing on the young Padawan and crushing him to death. Grievous went on to battle the assembled Jedi, killing Tarr Seirr and wounding the others.

This resulted in a similar appearance to that character. Initially, Tartakovsy wanted the Jedi to have more of a high-pitched voice like Shaggy. Still, Tartakovsky realized that the voice didn't fit and became \"too goofy.\" The Clone Wars character was listed simply as \"Padawan\" in the end credits of the Volume I DVD, but soon received the name \"Sha'a Gi\" when StarWars.com added the character to its Databank. Since then, Gi has been referenced in other works, such as being a \"hero unit\" defending Hypori for the Republic in the turn-based strategy game Star Wars: Battle for the Republic released by THQ Wireless for cell phones, Unknown Soldier: The Story of General Grievous, and The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sha'a Gi was voiced in his single appearance in the Clone Wars cartoon by John DiMaggio, a veteran voice actor known for voicing the role of Bender on the cartoon Futurama."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
