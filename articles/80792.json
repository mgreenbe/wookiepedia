Sha Dun says that they have captured or destroyed several of Stazi's ships, but Azard uses Force Grip on him and uses his lightsaber to execute him for his failure. Azard then places Admiral Dru Valan in charge of the fleet. Valan says he will not allow Stazi to escape him like he did at the Battle of Caamas. As Azard leaves, Valan tells Captain Hoge to replace all 'alien' personnel in his fleet with human personnel, saying he wants a 'superior' crew to deal with Stazi. He then informs Hoge of his intentions to trap Stazi with bait that he can't afford to pass up."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, at the planet Dac, an advanced Star Destroyer called the Imperious has nearly been completed. Former Triumvirate member Gial Gahan and his niece Monia Gahan are gathering intelligence about the new Star Destroyer. After they have gathered sufficient information, Monia has her fellow Rogue Squadron pilot Anj Dahl take her back to the Alliance Remnant fleet. Once there, they report their findings to Admiral Stazi and his second in command, Captain Jaius Yorub. Once they are alone, Stazi reveals to Yorub that he knows Valan is setting a trap for him. But they can't afford to pass the opportunity to steal the Imperious up, on the grounds that they need to make military strikes. Stazi also comments that if they know its a trap, then they might be able to make it work in their favor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two days later, Gial Gahan disables the Shipyard's automated guns from the command center on the planet's surface while Alliance troops take over the Imperious.

Valan sends a message telling Stazi that he is trapped and that there are only two choices for him to make: surrender or die. Stazi's reply is simply \"Caamas.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Niffla sneaks out from her hiding place, a crate next to her carries the Aurebesh text \"SOLO ENTERP\"[panel ends]."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
