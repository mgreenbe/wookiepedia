Originally named Gritha Dar, she was brought to the station as a slave to serve the Hutt Cartel's operation led by Prava. While her master was distracted by the Conquest of Makeb, she persuaded smugglers, gun runners, former Mandalorians and slavers to join her. With their support, Dar rallied her fellow slaves and defeated Prava and his mercenaries. With the space station taken, she named it Mek-Sha as a tribute to a friend, and formed a council of powerful figures to rule alongside her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
