During that mission, the X-Wing squadron discovers that the Empire was not simply mining ore, but is instead supplying rare metals required to manufacture a stealth version of the TIE Fighter; the new V38 \"Phantom\" equipped with a cloaking device invented by Grand Admiral Sarn, allowing them to move through space neither spotted on sensors nor by any pilot until they were ready to strike.
