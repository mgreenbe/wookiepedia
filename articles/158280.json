In 32 BBY, he was wanted by Gardulla the Hutt for leading raids on her compound. If captured alive, he was to be fed to the Hutt's pet Krayt dragon. He was caught by Jango Fett in Tusken Canyon; although it was unspecified whether or not the bounty was for a live capture or a death, he was worth more dead (for a 5,000 credit payoff) then he was alive (for only 1,000 credits)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
