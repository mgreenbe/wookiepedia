The collection of hyperlanes known as the Gevarno Loop connected the Ventran system to the Killisu, Jutrand, Loposi, Opari, and Ch'manss systems, as well as the Gevarno Cluster. Due to local star configuration, a starship traveling between any two systems on the Gevarno Loop could decrease its journey time by days if it transited through the Al'Har system in the Dustig sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, a conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Ventran system remained loyal to the Republic.
