There, the shadow lurkers communicated with the agents and urged them to destroy the crystals, to sever the lurkers' connection to the Darkstaff. However, the staff learned of the agents' plan and it dispatched a team of Believers to prevent the agents from destroying the crystals. The Believers landed on the asteroid and subsequently engaged the agents in combat. However, the agents defeated the cultists and shattered the shards, which allowed the Oblee to be reborn in their physical form."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
