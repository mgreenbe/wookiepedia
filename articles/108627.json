During the battle, the ship suffered a shield generator coolant leak, which cascaded through the upper levels. Several other levels also reported fires. The ship's captain, Groff, went mad and made a deranged comm to Grand Moff Randd on the Super Star Destroyer Ravager, launching into a tirade against the New Republic inspired by Rax's pre-battle speech. His comms then fell silent, and the nose of the Punishment swung into the Starhawk-class battleship Amity, resulting in the destruction of both ships. Despite his fervor, this sacrifice caused a chain reaction that would lead to the Ravager being destroyed and eventually the defeat of the Imperial forces in the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
