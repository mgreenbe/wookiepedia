While the Guineo was still new to the job, a speeder arrived that the worker assumed contained nerf meat. The guard's Draag supervisor corrected the Guineo and stated that the shipment was of death sticks. However, when the Draag failed to find the speeder's owner, someone named Gloom, upon the vessel, the reptilian told the Guineo to watch over the speeder and left to inform the plant boss, Groff Haugg. The bounty hunter Jango Fett then sprang upon the scene and stopped both the Guineo guard and the Draag boss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
