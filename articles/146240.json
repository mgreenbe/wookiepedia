The creatures were able to fly gracefully through a combination of their giant flat wings and internal gasbags. They had green eyes and long tails, and a mating call that sounded similar to some communication frequencies, sometimes causing the frequencies to attract the creatures. This led a group of tibidees to think that the jamming frequency of the Phantom, an attack shuttle, was a mating call. Though normally gentle, tibidees would attack anything they felt was threatening, including stormtroopers. They were remotely related to neebrays and mynocks, both of which were also pests to starships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tibidees were created for \"Rise of the Old Masters,\" the third episode of the first season of Star Wars Rebels.
