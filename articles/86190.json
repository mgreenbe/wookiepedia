The vehicles were equipped with lasers and two appendages: a clawing arm and a trip hammer. During the New Sith Wars, these were used alongside Mandalorian soldiers and Lagartoz War Dragons to ambush the Dark Underlord's camp during a campaign against the Sith Lord's forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One such harness was owned by Olag Greck sometime around 5.5 BBY. Olag forced the astromech droid R2-D2 to utilize one in his droid fighting venue on Hosk Station.
