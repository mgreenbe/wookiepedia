It floated about three meters above the ground on powerful repulsorlift engines. It was crewed by 6 people and could hold 12 passengers as well as 800 kilograms of cargo while going at a maximum speed of 90 kmh."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One such siege tower was deployed on the forest moon of Endor during the Battle of Endor where a group of Rebels came across it thanks to Major Perrn's warning. The rebels noticed a weak spot in the tower's armor; the armor around the repulsorlift engines (located beneath the tower) was weaker then the rest of the vehicle.\nThanks to this weak spot, the group was able to take out the tower before it could join the battle at the shield generator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
