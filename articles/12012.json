It was rectangular in shape, with repulsor chairs to accommodate all forty of Bakura's senators. Senior Senators sat on the lower levels, while Junior Senators were further back. During the Imperial rule of the planet, Governor Wilek Nereus sat in a repulsor chair at the front of the room, positioned effectively like a throne."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
