The rail system consisted of electromagnetic strips along the body of the weapon, which mean attachments could be swapped quickly even during battle. The rifle was also equipped with a stun setting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The DDC-MR6 was produced by Drearian Defense Conglomerate for the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. Due to the rifle's high cost, the Separatists only ordered a single experimental manufacturing run before ultimately deciding to use cheaper alternatives. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, the rifles were fairly rare and cost 1000 credits. The few that were still in circulation were mostly held by collectors or mercenaries with a specific need for a versatile weapon that could cover a variety of their different needs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The DDC-MR6 modular rifle was first mentioned in the 2016 Star Wars Roleplaying supplement Special Modifications, which was published by Fantasy Flight Games."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
