The terrain was treacherous, and the area around the mesa boasted numerous predatory creatures. Those Corellians who did manage to reach the mesa found that the bleak, weather-beaten landscape actually offered great solitude. The Kor Vella mesa became a site for introspection and meditation and a small religious sect later established a monastery on the mesa. After local miners located large deposits of ore near the mesa, the religious retreat quickly grew to become one of Corellia's most respected cities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kor Vella mesa first appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
