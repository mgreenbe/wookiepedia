However, it could not harvest a wound in the Force. When in use, the Harvester also radiated a bright purple glow. It was originally a device created by Exar Kun to operate the Dark Reaper during the Old Sith Wars, however, the Jedi Knight Ulic Qel-Droma found a way to it and clues about the Reaper and the Harvester were scattered across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For thousands of years, the Force Harvester lay hidden beneath the piles of intergalactic debris on the garbage world of Raxus Prime.

Anakin Skywalker and Bera Kazan escaped the Harvester on a stolen STAP and called in Republic forces to stop the Harvester. This did not stop the Dark Reaper Crisis however, for Count Dooku had escaped with the Harvester and used it on other worlds such as Mon Calamari, Agamar, and Bakura. Once filled with enough energy, Count Dooku traveled to the moon of the distant planet of Thule. There it was attached to the underbelly of the Dark Reaper, and after thousands of years, the ancient Sith weapon was operational yet again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Thule, the Harvester was targeted by Anakin Skywalker during the final encounter with the Dark Reaper.
