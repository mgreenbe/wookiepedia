As the first lightsaber, the Kyber Saber was said to magnify the wielder's Force powers a thousandfold. Upon wielding it, Kantoo discovered its creative potential to reshape landscapes and destroy whole planetary bodies with a single swing.

Darth Sidious immediatly wanted to collect all the Kyber Crystals and use them to destroy the galaxy in one big blast. The Sith Lords dispatched the Sith agent Naare to retrieve the shards of the Kyber Saber. Naare traveled to the jungle world of Nal Kapok where in an underground cave she found the first Kyber Saber crystal still embedded in it's original hilt. During that trip, she encountered a Force-sensitive boy named Rowan Freemaker and his B1-series battle droid Roger; whom she saved from being devoured by a dianoga. Naare managed to convince Rowan that she was a Great Jedi Purge survivor. After relating to him the history of the Kyber Saber, she gained Rowan's trust and offered to train him in the ways of the Jedi. Naare then settled with the Freemakers at the Wheel space station by tricking the owner into renting her a room for one credit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Rowan sensed through the Force that the second Kyber Saber crystal was in the Belgaroth asteroid field. While Naare and his older sister Kordi Freemaker argued about Rowan's safety, Rowan and Roger sneaked off on a ship to the Belgaroth asteroid field. There, they discovered that the second kyber crystal was lodged in a rock over a vat of lava. Despite retrieving the crystal, the two were quickly captured by the Hutt crime lord/expert miner Graballa, who desired the crystal. Rowan's older brother Zander and sister Kordi mounted a rescue mission with the help of Naare. While escaping from Graballa's base, the kyber crystal was sucked out into space. After escaping Graballa and his henchmen including the bounty hunter Dengar, Naare was so enraged with the Freemakers that she attempted to destroy their starship, the StarScavenger.

However, Naare joined forces with Graballa, who wanted the crystals to raise funds to build a beachside resort and buffet. In order to catch Rowan, the two reached an agreement to share the crystals. With the help of Graballa's starship Rancor's Fist, Naare managed to steal the fourth, fifth, and sixth Kyber Saber crystals from the Freemakers on Takodana, Ningoth, and Naboo.

There, Rowan and his siblings discovered that the last Kyber Saber crystal was hiding in an underground ice cavern.
