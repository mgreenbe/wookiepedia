Zandoo met with Trantos and a Jedi Padawan in a cantina on the outskirts of the city Acquos on Xxan, and she suggested that, in return for a payment, she put the pair into contact with a Rodian ship-dealer fired of hers, who had placed a tracking beacon aboard the bounty hunter's vessel. The trio met with the Rodian and learned that the bounty hunter had traveled to the planet Pzandias, and they planned to journey to the world and further investigate the individual's dealings. However, en-route to the Acquos spaceport, Zandoo, Trantos and the Padawan were captured by a bounty hunter who sought to recover Zandoo's debt to Jabba."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
