A short time after the destruction of Tund, he came in contact with Emperor Palpatine, who named him Scrivinir of the Centrality in return for a number of the order's secrets. The Centrality was a mostly overlooked state in the Outer Rim Territories, and as such, Gepta was free to operate as he wished. However, he sought more power, desiring to rule the entire galaxy, and so allied himself with Governor Duttes Mer of the Rafa system in hopes of finding the fabled artifact known as the Mindharp, which Gepta believed would allow him to control the minds of others."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 BBY, Gepta and Mer roped the gambler Lando Calrissian into locating the Mindharp for them.

He blamed Calrissian for this and hounded him, attempting to kill him by having his men place a bomb on the gambler's ship, although this assassination attempt failed. Determined to pay back the gambler for the humiliation he felt Calrissian had caused him, Gepta killed Bohhuah Mutdah, the richest man in the galaxy, and disguised himself as Mutdah. He arranged for Calrissian to deliver a shipment of the drug lesai to Mutdah's home on Oseon 5792; when the gambler arrived, he revealed his true form.

He soon arranged for a final confrontation with Calrissian by threatening to unleash the same bioweapon that he had used on Tund on the ThonBoka's inhabitants, a species known as the Oswaft.

He was born on Crakull at least 20,000 years prior to the Battle of Yavin, and became skilled in creating illusions and deceiving others, something for which his species held a reputation. Thanks to his illusion-casting skills and forceful personality, he gained a reputation as someone who was not to be trifled with, with very few beings daring to stand up to him. He spent several decades prior to 5 BBY researching the Sharu, a highly advanced species native to the Rafa system that was believed to be extinct. In 5 BBY, Gepta, a Force Adept, joined the Sorcerers of Tund, a reclusive group of Force-users who practiced arcane forms of Sith magic. He learned all of the Sorcerers' secrets, including how to create an electromagnetic torpedo, a device containing a bioweapon capable of wiping out any life with which it came in contact. Once Gepta had learned all that the Sorcerers had to offer, he killed them all, using the electromagnetic torpedo's weapon to destroy Tund and turn the planet into a wasteland. In the following years, he occasionally returned to Tund to meditate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After destroying the Sorcerers, Gepta came in contact with Emperor Palpatine, ruler of the Galactic Empire. Palpatine was also a Sith Lord, and had an interest in learning from the Sorcerers of Tund. In return for some of the order's secrets, Palpatine promised Gepta power. Gepta was given a decommissioned Republic vessel known as the Wennis to command, and was named Scrivinir, or leader, of the Centrality, a largely ignored state in the Outer Rim Territories that contained the planet Tund. Thanks to Palpatine, Gepta, acting as the Central Administrator, had the authority to override the orders of Centrality government officials, as well as the power to call in Imperial Navy ships when necessary, and command them in operations in the Centrality.

He had learned of the Mindharp thanks to his decades of research, and scoured various ruins in the Rafa system in hopes of finding the object, which he believed would give him control over all beings in the system. However, after trying and failing to locate the legendary artifact, Gepta decided to force someone else to find it for him. At some point, he entered into a partnership with Duttes Mer, governor of the Rafa system. Though Gepta told Mer that the device would provide him control over the Toka, Mer did not believe his explanation. Unbeknownst to the Croke, he hired private investigators who had previously worked for Gepta. Thanks to these investigators, the Governor learned of the Mindharp's true power, although he did not reveal this to his co-conspirator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to legend, a wandering stranger was needed to discover the artifact; unless Gepta and Mer could find such a being, the Toka, descendants of the Sharu and keepers of the ancient legends, would not give their assistance in locating the Mindharp. Thus, the duo hired Ottdefa Osuno Whett, an anthropologist, to investigate the system and then go to the asteroid Oseon 2795. There, he was to wait for a suitable individual, whom he would then convince to go to Rafa IV, where Mer's office was. In 4 BBY, they had their stroke of luck when Whett met the gambler Lando Calrissian. After losing to Calrissian in sabacc and running out of money, he offered the gambler his droid, Vuffi Raa, which Whett said he had left in storage on Rafa IV.

After picking up the droid and checking in at a hotel for the night, he was woken by a group of policemen, who took him and Raa to Mer. The Governor played several friendly of games of sabacc with Calrissian before he broached the matter of the Mindharp. However, Gepta grew tired of waiting and stormed into the office, much to Mer's dismay. The Croke explained to Calrissian what he sought, and also told him that the Mindharp was nothing more than an instrument of music. Calrissian, Gepta stated, would find the Mindharp for him and Mer, and would then be allowed to depart from the system. He would also be given a cargo of valuable life-crystals. To ensure that Calrissian did not simply flee as soon as he left the meeting, Gepta had the gambler's ship rendered incapable of leaving the system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sorcerer also revealed the most important piece of information: Calrissian would be given a key made by the Sharu that Gepta believed would help him unlock the Mindharp. Gepta explained that the key had been taken from a museum on a world outside the Rafa system. Though Calrissian assumed that there was likely a much longer story involving betrayal and adventure beyond what Gepta had told him about how he acquired the key, the sorcerer did not elaborate on how he gained possession of the object. After handing over the key to Calrissian, the sorcerer sent the gambler and Vuffi Raa away to begin their search for the Mindharp."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Human and his droid spent the next four months searching for the Mindharp, with the help of the Toka High Singer Mohs. Traveling to the Great Pyramid on Rafa V, Calrissian was able to enter with the key. Inside, he discovered the Mindharp, and took it with him. When he departed the pyramid, he found himself on Rafa IV. It was at this point that Calrissian was betrayed by Vuffi Raa, who alerted a local policeman to arrest Calrissian. The gambler was taken to the Governor, who took the Mindharp and sent him off to a nearby prison. Mer then contacted Gepta, who was in orbit in the Wennis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mer revealed the Mindharp and mocked the sorcerer, claiming that he was aware of its true power, and now that he had it, he would use it to gain control over the entire system. Frantic, Gepta boarded a small fighter craft carried by the Wennis and headed for Rafa IV, taking the vessel well beyond the recommended safety parameters. However, Mer had already begun to use the Mindharp in hopes of mastering its power before Gepta could and ruling the system without the sorcerer.

However, before he left the planet's atmosphere, his ship encountered the Millennium Falcon, Calrissian's freighter. The two exchanged laser fire, and Gepta's ship was saved only because it was knocked out of the way by debris. The Millennium Falcon then escaped by jumping to hyperspace, much to Gepta's chagrin.

By warning the authorities that the Millennium Falcon was a smuggler's ship, he forced Calrissian to pay large bribes at the various spaceports at which he touched down. He was able to manipulate the prices of items Calrissian intended to sell, such as wintenberry jelly, preventing the gambler from making money. The Croke also had his men plant a bomb on the Millennium Falcon when it stopped at Dilonexa XXIII, although it detonated early and failed to kill Calrissian. This unsuccessful assassination attempt only increased Gepta's desire to make the gambler suffer. Following this, the Wennis set course for the Oseon system, where Calrissian was headed. Gepta made his way to the asteroid Oseon 5792, the home of Bohhuah Mutdah, the wealthiest being in the galaxy. As part of his intricate plan to capture Calrissian, the Croke killed Mutdah and then took his form, being careful to prevent anyone from learning of the deception."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gepta threatened Lob Doluff, Administrator Senior of the Oseon system, warning him that he would kill his family unless Doluff cooperated in the sorcerer's plans.

On Gepta's orders, Doluff then offered the gambler an out\u2014if Calrissian would participate in a drug bust by delivering a shipment of the drug lesai to Oseon 5792 while also taking the security officers Waywa Fybot and Bassi Vobah with him to arrest Mutdah in the middle of the delivery, he would be freed.

Fybot then revealed his true allegiance by killing Vobah. Gepta praised the officer for executing his orders before suddenly shooting and killing him, much to Calrissian's surprise. Gepta then trained his gun on Calrissian and ordered him to take a pair of handcuffs from a nearby drawer and put them on. When the gambler questioned why he had not simply killed him outright, the trillionaire revealed his true form\u2014that of Rokur Gepta. He would now, the sorcerer proclaimed, torture Calrissian to death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gepta knocked Calrissian unconscious, took him outside, and strapped him down in preparation for what he planned to be a torture session that would last for weeks until the gambler died. Utilizing the technique of torture by chagrin, as well as a special machine, Gepta was able to make Calrissian relive his worst memories, and even alter the memories to make them worse. Though Gepta would have to suffer through all of these memories and feel the pain that Calrissian felt, the sorcerer was willing to do so to make his enemy know pain and misery. Gepta even taunted Calrissian with the twenty million credits that the gambler had possessed for mere minutes. He took great pleasure in causing the Human anguish. However, Gepta was interrupted after torturing Calrissian for less than an hour when Oseon 5792 came under attack by a group of Renatasians who mistakenly believed Vuffi Raa to be responsible for the destruction of their civilization and had followed the Millennium Falcon to the asteroid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Flying in starfighters, the Renatasians managed to damage the asteroid's habitable dome containing Mutdah's mansion, exposing it to vacuum. Gepta was distracted by the explosion that resulted from the breaching of the dome, allowing Calrissian to stab him in the eye with a piece of tinklewood that he wore as a splint. The gambler was then able to slip out of the restraints holding him down, and flee back to his ship, with Gepta in pain and unable to catch up to him. On board the Millennium Falcon, the gambler absconded, while Gepta headed to his personal one-man craft that he had stored on the asteroid.

The Renatasians hoped to gain Gepta's aid in their search for Vuffi Raa, the individual they believed to be the destroyer of the Renatasia system. Believing that an allegiance would be mutually beneficial, Gepta arranged to meet the Renatasians on Tund. Shanga and his men then met with the sorcerer in a darkened cave, where they discussed the prospect of becoming accomplices. When Shanga questioned why Gepta was so interested in Calrissian, the sorcerer replied simply that the gambler had offended him with his boldness, also subtly warning Shanga to beware of overstepping his bounds. Shanga then revealed to Gepta that Calrissian could be found in the ThonBoka nebula, which was currently the subject of an Imperial blockade. The two sides agreed to ally in hopes of capturing their targets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following their meeting, Gepta hurried to the ThonBoka. When he arrived, he was greeted by the news that the Millennium Falcon had apparently been destroyed by an Imperial vessel when trying to run the blockade of the nebula. Gepta was furious at this news, and had the officer who brought him the report killed. However, he did not give up his search for the gambler, believing that he could have survived the explosion. Thus, the Wennis remained in the system. Gepta was soon able to discern that the Millennium Falcon had not been destroyed as it appeared. He also learned that the ThonBoka was inhabited by a species known as the Oswaft, very large, manta-like sentients who lived in the vacuum of space. The Imperial Navy believed that the Oswaft potentially posed a threat, and thus, had surrounded the nebula in hopes of starving the species to death. Calrissian had coincidentally befriended one of the Oswaft, and sought to save them from destruction, leading to him escaping through the blockade. Gepta enlisted the help of Osuno Whett, planning to learn more about the species and then manipulate them into handing over Calrissian\u2014or, if they refused, destroy them.

After a heated argument which left Gepta steaming at Shanga, whom he saw as insubordinate, Gepta agreed to free Nuladeg for the upcoming battle. When the Human left, Gepta reflected on the fact that Shanga was the only person, aside from Calrissian, to stand up to him in millennia.

He then released a small particle of energy from his electromagnetic torpedo, sending the green energy toward a group of Oswaft and instantly vaporizing them. Gepta informed Calrissian that he would annihilate all life in the nebula with this substance. However, he gave the gambler an alternative\u2014a duel to the death in the vacuum of space.

Per Gepta's suggestion, he would have the aid of Vuffi Raa, as the gambler had no magic powers like Gepta. Before exiting through his vessel's airlock, Gepta ordered one of his officers to destroy all life in the ThonBoka regardless of the outcome of the battle. To ensure that the man followed his orders, he had a fighter sent to his homeworld, promising to kill the Captain's family if his orders were not followed. He also instructed his men to prevent interference from anyone, causing the Wennis to destroy one of the Renatasian fighters that attempted to attack Vuffi Raa and Calrissian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having issued his orders, Gepta stepped out into space, where he was met by the gambler and his droid.

Evading beams fired from the Wennis, the Rentasians pursued Whett, causing him to crash into the Wennis. With the cruiser's shields down, the Wennis was destroyed, as was Whett in his ship.

When the Imperial Navy moved to attack, they were suddenly assaulted by the Silentium, a sentient species of droids kilometers in size that had just come out of hyperspace. The droids were responsible for creating Vuffi Raa, and had come to reclaim him, arriving at the ThonBoka just in time.

He considered himself empty and devoid of warmth and life, and took no comfort in wealth or companionship; only authority and inflicting pain on others brought him pleasure.

Klyn Shanga noted that Gepta would not hesitate to kill even a highly competent assistant who had failed him once. Gepta believed that after seeing one of their own tortured or killed for his failure, the crew of the Wennis would perform better in hopes of avoiding a similar fate.
