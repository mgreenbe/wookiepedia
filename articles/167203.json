The deity was also often referred as the 'Cloaked One' or 'Cloaked Goddess'; it was she who oversaw escalations. She was known as the sister to Yun-Yammka, their God of War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though primarily worshiped by the Intendant caste, Yun-Harla often went hand in hand with Yun-Yammka, and promoted innovative strategies in combat; the pair was known as the Twin Gods. Yun-Harla actually had no incarnation in art, although her skeleton was widely believed to be made of yorik coral. It was also believed that she deceived her worshipers in matters related to her appearance, and that she cloaked herself in borrowed skin. Yun-Harla had a holy day devoted to her, known as the Festival of the Twin Gods. In this twenty-four hour period of time, the normally somber Yuuzhan Vong were allowed to play tricks and practical jokes on their superiors without the threat of punishment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Jaina Solo discovered a method to deceive Yuuzhan Vong sensors when they attempted to identify friends and foes. In the wake of the Mission to Myrkr, she stole a Yuuzhan Vong warship, the Ksstarr, and renamed it Trickster. These actions, along with disinformation from New Republic Intelligence, began to convince the horrified Yuuzhan Vong that Jaina actually was Yun-Harla, or at least the incarnation thereof."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later on, when the Yuuzhan Vong learned about the defection of Vergere and having never been \"one of them\" in the first place, Supreme Overlord Shimrra wondered about her possibly being an incarnation of Yun-Harla. Still, Jaina remained as the one who was referred to as the Trickster Goddess. During the final showdown between the Solo twins and Onimi, the real Supreme Overlord called Jaina Yun-Harla throughout, denouncing her as the cause of all of his problems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
