Salaktori assigned her a starship and an AD-series weapons maintenance droid, GSAD-43, to help her in her missions. During those, Relasi and the droid bonded intimately."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In one particular hunt, an enemy injured Relasi. The huntress managed to reach her ship and talked to GSAD-43. With her dying words, Relasi asked GSAD-43 to \"get them for me\". The droid took the words at heart and started tracking the people who had killed her. After capturing one of those, the droid, taking a literal meaning to the word \"them\" in Relasi's sentence, continued to track other culprits. In time, GSAD-43 obtained a reputation and Relasi was mentioned in the droid's background."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
