Some law enforcement agencies also served as a military for their local governments, however they simply kept the peace and were not armed for full scale war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Law enforcement was generally conducted on a local or planetary level but their size, functions, and training could vary greatly. They could be a local security force, they could be responsible to protect a whole, densely urbanized planet such as the Coruscant Security Force. Some served primarily as bodyguards and elite security forces, such as the Senate Guard, others were volunteer security and policing corps such as the Royal Security Forces on the planet Naboo. During the Invasion of Naboo, several hundred Royal Guards and police formed an underground resistance effort against the Trade Federation Droid Army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Order had policing authority under the Galactic Republic and could conduct criminal investigations and make arrests.

Most wore uniforms of some kind and held ranks that were military in nature. Lower ranking officers would perform tasks such as patrolling their areas, responding to incidents, and conducting preliminary investigations. Higher ranking officers would supervise a group of officers, provide field reports, conduct investigations, and answered to government leaders. Serious crimes would be investigated by specialized officers such as detectives. Generally, they were experienced police officers in dealing with in depth investigations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While flesh and blood officers were common, police droids were used extensively either on dense urban planets such as Coruscant or in spaceports that found it more financially feasible to use droids. Generally, droids were programed not to cause harm unless it was in protection of others, in which case they were authorized to use force, even deadly force. Droids were also useful in that they enforced the law without prejudice and/or corruption."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
