A mass spectral record would be taken of the vehicle, and once the arming button was pressed the missile would launch after the target. Care was required to avoid getting caught in the missile's exhaust after arming the missile. Failure to keep the targeting sensor free from dirt and other contaminants would result in an improper arming sequence and not leave enough time for the firer to run free of the weapon before launch."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
