In about 31 BBY, Hurgen was hired by two Caarites that represented a rival firm of the company Mothven Star Trading, and they tasked him with arranging for a package that contained some drugs and an explosive device to be delivered to Mothven's headquarters on Cularin. With the aid of some documentation that was supplied to him by the Caarites, Hurgen assumed the identity of Frome Eubarus, an employee of Mothven Star Trading who was away on vacation, and hired some freelance agents to transport the device to Mothven. A short time later, the agents deduced that they had been misled and confronted Hurgen in his apartment on Cularin, and he confessed to them the role that he had played in the deception. Hurgen subsequently died several days later in a speeder accident, under mysterious circumstances."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
