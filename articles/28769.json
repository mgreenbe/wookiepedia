These buildings would construct units such as droid and organic laborers, and medics. In addition, these buildings also researched technology for unit upgrades. They also served as drop-off points for resources such as food, carbon, nova, and ore. It cost 300 units of carbon and 100 units of ore to construct a command center. Units were able to garrison inside the structures for healing and repair, and could fire at hostile units. Gungans and the Royal Naboo Security Forces on the planet Naboo build command centers, as did the Trade Federation. The two sides of the Clone Wars, the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems had their own versions, as did the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. Later, during the Galactic Civil War, the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance both used command centers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Command center types"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The command centers used by the Galactic Empire were gray and blue on the outside, with a sphere on top and a manning tower on the leftmost corner.

In addition, it usually necessitated ladders and had multiple wiring to the southern corner of the base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Further construction eventually led to a more stable appearance, having some ramps as well as the top of the base being covered with and bar windows for the northern portion of the Command Center. In addition, bridges were constructed connecting the Northern corner with the Eastern and Western corners, with the latter having a higher tower, and some barrels underneath its bridge. The generator also necessitated less need for wires connecting across the base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Command Centers, upon further refurbishments, allowed for some walls to be constructed. In addition, the northern portion was improved, allowing for a small circular window and some stairs. The southern portion of the base also included some barriers, and the bridges were now full-scale platforms. Portions of the East and West towers were also completed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the Command Centers, upon completion, possessed full blast gates for entry within the premises. The stairs were also replaced with a turbolift elevator, and the design for the top portion of the northern area was also radically changed to be spherical in nature.

However, it overall possessed trace amounts of brownish-yellow and gray colors. It was manned by droids including the IM-6 battlefield medical droids and Kaminoan droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Command Centers were first constructed, their design was primarily simple, containing simply a two-way open-door garage that were accessible via ramps with a landing platform at the top. Some external generators were also located nearby."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Further construction eventually led to a more complex appearance, having the landing platform largely covered by a large trapezoid building, and its edges having circular supports added on. The external generators are also removed, alongside the ramps leading down to the garages. The foundation was also somewhat more stable and expanded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Command Centers, upon further refurbishments, made most of the base into a trapezoid-like structure, with circular dais at the corners.

The circular supports were also expanded, indicating an intention to connect the two parts of the Command Center together."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the Command Centers, upon completion, had its entire base converted into a trapezoid, with actual blast doors sealing off the garage areas. In addition, the dais were converted into towers, the upper half of the building was made almost cube-shaped, and the circular supports now hang as pill-shaped objects at each corner."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Confederacy of Independent Systems"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the Geonosians playing a key role in the Confederacy of Independent Systems' makeup and leadership, the CIS's command centers were made of Geonosian stone, and resembled a building, with a circular arena-like area in the center. It was manned by ADK-25-MED medical droids and Geonosian workers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Command Centers are first constructed, they simply resembled a dome with some curved/conish buildings.

Two orbs were also nearby."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Further construction eventually led to a more polished appearance, with the curved/conish buildings strongly resembling pills. In addition, braces were also placed on the domed building, and the plowed area also became a crevasse of sorts surrounding the arena. Supports were also implemented between the domed building and the rightmost pill building."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Command Centers, upon further refurbishments, allowed for two additional buildings to be constructed. Many of these buildings were also significantly taller and were almost spire-like in nature. In addition, the domed building underwent a significant redesign, featuring a sloped base as well as thorny outgrowths at the top, as well as a much larger door. At least one additional support was also constructed, and the crevasse was much deeper, with the arena base being narrower. An additional orb was also constructed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the Command Centers, upon completion, possessed multiple supports for the buildings. The main building was also castle-like, with significantly larger thorny outgrowths than before, and was more pillar like. The arena also ended up having its base completely removed.

Similar to the Wookiees, their command centers aren't manned by droids. Instead, Gungan doctors and Glurrgs manned the buildings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Command Centers are first constructed, the primary (and by this point, only) electrostasis bubble building required constant support, with at least three support struts on top. It also possessed three arches. There were also multiple platforms, some of which required scaling to reach the main gate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Further construction eventually led to a more stable appearance, thus not needing any support struts directly on the bubble generator. Two more electrostatic bubbles were also developed, which were tiny especially compared to the primary bubble. A lot of the tiny platforms were also removed, and its gate made more elegant with a ramp."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Command Centers, upon further refurbishments, created 16 additional bubble generators, while the two earlier bubble generator additions grew larger and more egg-shaped, although still not as large as the primary bubble. The support struts also became a bit more complex as they hugged the main building. In addition, the ramp was done away altogether in favor of a two-way path leading to the gate, with the gate itself being more elegant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the Command Centers, upon completion, was nearly completely covered, with the two secondary bubble generators being moved to indoors and the tertiary bubble generators being replaced with stands.

The main platform was also tiny, and a square-shaped satellite dish was nearby."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Further construction eventually led to a more stable appearance, with the circular roof being somewhat more stable and nearly complete. The floor area was also expanded and its holoscreen was upgraded to be more towering. The supports were also covered with armor. More powerful external generators were connected to the left and right of the base. The command center also replaced its satellite with a circular dish."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Command Centers, upon further refurbishments, managed to have its roof base to not have holes in it. The supports also ended up letting loose some of the armor and placing additional struts. The holoscreen was replaced with a holoprojector with various holoscreens moved to the opposite side of the base. Containers were also found nearby as well as a generator. A ramp was also included."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the Command Centers, upon completion, possessed a holoprojector pod that removed the starry features when displaying information, and removed most holoscreen terminals in favor of an amphitheater design. The roof also was fully complete, featuring curves. The Command Center also had a pit within the interior, and the interior itself is accessible via three ramps. The generator was also left armored, and the containers became additional power generators."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Royal Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Command Centers generally resembled a Naboo villa, with a water fountain and an interior circular garden.

In addition, the main stairwell was eliminated and replaced with an edge. The remaining stairs are kept intact, and the main stairs are instead located around the larger fountain, for easier access. Ivy was also growing on top of the rooftops."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Command Centers, upon further refurbishments, allowed for some more pillars to be constructed, tightening the defenses. The roof was also for the most part replaced with the typical domes of the Naboo architecture. The stairs are also made more elegant, and the pools of water near the other stairs were also expanded to have an arch underneath to allow for more water flow. The stairs also returned to the front of the Command Center. Naboo statues were also added to the front of the building."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the Command Centers, upon completion, possessed full gates for entry within the premises to the main building from all three sides, with the building interior being completely enclosed.

The Wookiees, upon arriving at Alaris Prime, then proceeded under Qui-Gon Jinn's guidance, to create a command center on the colonized planet. Jinn then proceeded to guide five Wookiee workers to gain various resources and food. Afterwards, they then conducted a drill of defending the base in case Gundarks attacked the command center. Shortly after Chewbacca's arrival at the command center, the base was attacked by the Gundarks for real, and the Wookiees then proceeded to defend the command center for real from the drill they had earlier conducted. Afterwards, they sustained the base from ore and nova crystal deposits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Command centers appear in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its 2002 expansion pack.
