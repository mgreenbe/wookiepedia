When Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi infiltrated the ship, trying to rescue Palpatine, they took an elevator at one point. R2-D2 accidentally sent the elevator down instead of up. Obi-Wan ordered the droid to send it the other way, but Anakin would not wait. He used his lightsaber to cut a hole in the top of the elevator and clung to the bottom of a doorway. This battle droid and another pointed E-5 blaster rifles at Anakin, but the elevator came up seconds later and crushed the two droids, the two only realizing the danger seconds before it happened. Some of their pieces were on top of the elevator when it arrived at its destination."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
