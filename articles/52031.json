In addition, the term High Republic denoted the era in which the Republic reached the zenith of its power from 300 BBY to 82 BBY. The Republic was founded many millennia before the Battle of Yavin, approximately 25,000 BBY, around the same time as the Jedi Order. The Galactic Senate governed the Republic under the Galactic Constitution, and comprised thousands of senators representing the Republic's member worlds. The Supreme Chancellor was the title of the Republic head of state, elected from ranks of the Senate to lead the government on Coruscant.

The Jedi Order, a religious group of Force-sensitives dedicated to the light side of the Force, was sworn to the service of the Senate, and as such the Jedi Knights were hailed as the guardians of peace and justice within the Republic. After centuries of conflict, culminating in the fall of the Old Republic, the last war between the ancient Jedi and Sith concluded with the restoration and rise of the modern Galactic Republic, ushering in the Republic Era which was an age of peace that lasted for a thousand years.

The Zygerrian Empire, which was built upon slavery, refused to comply, forcing both the Old Republic and the Jedi to intervene. After joining together, the Old Republic and Jedi Order sent their armies against the empire after the Zygerrians refused.

The San Tekka clan had made a fortune locating new hyperspace routes, but their fortune was secretly a result of Mari San Tekka's special ability to locate and map out the routes herself. Concurrent to its outreach program, the Republic was in the midst of an era where all voices were listened to, creating governance from consensus and a society of culture, inclusion, ambition, and Soh's many Great Works. Among the earliest of these works\u2014which encompassed everything from infrastructure projects to cultural affairs\u2014 was the Panacea, a Salvation-class Republic medical frigate that was deployed to help citizens after various crises; therefore, the frigate became a symbol of Republic's dedication to help its citizens."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another of the Great Works was Starlight Beacon, which was considered the greatest of the projects.

Additionally, Soh wanted the people of the Republic to know that they all were part of the government, and the Republic began construction of Starlight Beacon to help with its expansion into the Outer Rim.

Beyond wanting revenge on the Jedi for secretive reasons, Ro had made his move to ensure the Nihil raiders could grow beyond what they were currently.

She helped lead the effort to rescue the system's refugees and everyone aboard the fragments until she detected a large container of liquid tibanna threatening the system's R-class star. Kriss and the other Jedi used their combined focus to move the container with the Force, while the RDC continued to focus on evacuating the remaining refugees. The Jedi's effort to move the container was broadcast across the Outer Rim and into the inner Republic worlds by technician Keven Tarr; while he had at first only sent the signal to Chancellor Soh, he did not want his star system to be destroyed without being acknowledged, so the people of the Republic watched the Jedi effort.

Additionally, the Republic was faced with the Emergences; these were when remaining fragments of the Legacy Run, which were all continuing to travel throughout hyperspace, exited in an Outer Rim system, resulting in pieces raining down and destroying whatever they hit. The First Emergence was at the Ab Dalis system, which was further along the same hyperspace route the Run had been traveling on, and these Emergences continued to spread. Thus, Soh feared the Republic could have to cease hyperspace travel, which would separate worlds and effectively end the galactic government. Additionally, the Nihil took advantage of the First Emergence, launching a raid on a convoy of ships carrying refugees.

The blockade would ultimately be forced to grow as more systems were effected by the Emergences. As predicted by Senator Izzet Noor, who served as the spokesperson in the Senate for the majority of the Outer Rim, the blockade brought strife, as many Rim worlds were not self-sufficient and depended on hyperspace for trade. During a meeting on Coruscant, Soh had pledged to send supply ships into hyperspace if a food crisis grew too dire, although the halting of the trade still had major negative effects for the Rim. During that same meeting, she noted she was unwilling to postpone the dedication of the Starlight Beacon, knowing it was nearly finished and wanting to use the event to showcase a triumph over adversity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Starlight due to open in thirty days, Soh gave that as the timeline to solve the Emergence crisis; she did not want to open the way station while the blockade was still ongoing, knowing it would appear as if the Republic could not protect its own people.

Meanwhile with the Republic, technician Tarr, having tracked the previous Emergences to form a pattern, began to construct a system of thousands of navigation droids, hoping it could be used to predict where future Emergences would be and find the Legacy Run's black box."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the High Republic Era drew to a close around 82 BBY, Jedi Padawan Sean remembered that the Nihil had launched an invasion of the Republic."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Expansion and stagnation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For centuries, the Galactic Republic expanded not through force but by quietly exerting a strong magnetic pull towards neighboring systems. The promise of trade with Core World markets held many systems in sway, inexorably luring non-member worlds into tighter cooperation with the state body. Despite this, the Republic remained slow to invite new systems into its fold, as the addition of new territories diminished the political power of existing senators. New member states invariably aligned themselves with local galactic power blocs, while most senators who gave the invitations represented systems in the Core. As a result, the Galactic Center represented the beating heart of the Republic that habitually drew wealth and power from the hinterlands, with most senators dismaying at the extension of services and protection to outlying worlds.

The Core, revitalized from the destructive conflicts of the past and ravenous for new resources to exploit, embarked on an aggressive colonization policy, exploring, mapping, and settling untouched planets within the Outer Systems, striking deals with or simply overrunning the indigenous populations that stood in their path. Adventurous pioneers found themselves granted permission by Coruscant to settle new territories and establish trading colonies to feed the Core with the goods and raw materials for its continual self-enrichment. Many new systems, finding themselves lacking the funds to mine, process, and ship their products to market, were forced to secure high-interest loans from the InterGalactic Banking Clan, whereupon many, unable to repay their debts, found themselves as mere client worlds to the Muun bankers.

The Boonta Eve Classic, while based on the independent Outer Rim world of Tatooine, beyond the Republic frontier, received coverage and attention as far as the Core Worlds. Prior to the Clone Wars, the Republic's twilight years became an era of escapism as citizens of all classes sought entertaining distractions from their daily lives. Professional podrace circuits and other circuses diverted the people's attention from the growing corruption that permeated the Galactic Senate. Nevertheless, the general public's fascination with various forms of entertainment was driven by an innate desire for stories about good versus evil and situations of escalating danger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Whereas the Republic evolved through the centuries of its existence, the Jedi Order remained rooted in its ancient traditions, effectively putting the Jedi Code at odds with a galactic society that strongly favored the future over the past. The inhabitants of the Core Worlds became fixated on notions of fame and fashion, and had little interest in Jedi principles like faith and tradition. The Order maintained its place in the Republic by relying on historic precedent, serving as keepers of peace and justice. Unlike corporate institutions that marketed their services to the greater galaxy, the Order had little desire to promote itself through image-building. Aside from those who witnessed the Jedi's heroics and were awed by their Force powers, the Order and its ways were forever mysterious to the majority of the Republic citizenry. The Jedi were seen by the public as an order of mystics at best and, at worst, regarded as a zealous sect of warmongers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result of territorial expansion, the Republic developed a sense of manifest destiny. This cultural belief was cultivated by Republic propagandists who sought to foster civic pride among the populace so that they would ultimately feel duty-bound to support the Republic's expansion from rim to rim. There was an exponential growth in Republic patriotism due to the Clone Wars and the accompanying propaganda that promoted loyalty to the state. Patriotic messages stirred an entire generation into action; however, they could not enlist in the Grand Army as its ranks were exclusive to clone troopers. Nevertheless, Republic citizens felt obliged to do their part by purchasing war bonds, reporting acts of treason, and making sacrifices to support the war effort.

As the galaxy's largest region, the Outer Rim featured a myriad of diversity through its various planets and species. The Republic government had little oversight over the Outer Rim due to the region's distance from the Core, and as such the Outer Rim remained known for its lawless, sparsely populated, and primitive worlds.

Although the Republic officially promoted unity among its member worlds and outlawed the enslavement of sentient species, some people were subjected to racial stereotypes. Neimoidians, for example, were considered obese, duplicitous and avaricious by some, including those who harbored anti-corporate views.

Rather than reporting on Amedda's effort to showcase Republic diversity, HoloNet News outlets focused on the Vice Chancellor's self-inclusion as the sole Chagrian in an assembly of various aliens.

Droids had long become commonplace in galactic society, and though machines had always been the property of organics, the war cemented the view that droids were an existential threat to biological life. The Republic capitalized on this sentiment, using propaganda to illustrate droids as ruthless and dangerous tools of destruction. While the the concept of \"droid terror\" was embodied by battlefield machines, such as the B1-series battle droid, B2-series super battle droid and the droideka, administrative aide droids were viewed as a different kind of \"droid threat\" to Republic security.

The Order fought hard to bring a swift and decisive end to the conflict, but many citizens believed that the Jedi were warmongers. This perception was able to grow due in part to the Jedi's reluctance to accept accolades or embrace the fame of their status.
