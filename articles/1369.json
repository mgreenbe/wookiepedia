As a criminal 4-LOM was known for specializing in anticipating the moves of its targets. The Droid Gotra used 4-LOM's story as proof that a droids original programmed function did not determine its future. Industrial Automaton however, tried to bury the droids story, fearing that the public might learn their protocol droids could potentially turn into lethal killers. 4-LOM often worked together with the tracker Zuckuss, one of the first traditional Gand findsmen to leave his homeworld, the planet Gand, and claimed several high profile bounties for the Hutt Clan. Working with his partner, 4-LOM would provide analysis and information to help Zuckuss's mysterious ways."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Between 19 BBY and 5 ABY, 4-LOM was among the 5 bounty hunters investigating a jailbreak on Kalarassi Five."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Capturing Beris Ford"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 9 BBY, Zuckuss and 4-LOM captured the small-time criminal Beris Ford, keeping him imprisoned aboard their ship and hoping to use the reward for his capture to pay for tractor beam repairs. Weeks later, the hunters took up a bounty placed by Rekias Nodo on Han Solo, and confronted him at Valtos space port. Zuckuss incapacitated the smuggler inside a stun net fired from his snare rifle, and he and 4-LOM loaded Han's cargo into the Mist Hunter, where they imprisoned him along with Ford. Sensing a disturbance in the Force, Zuckuss checked on the stolen cargo only to be attacked by Chewbacca bursting from one of the containers, and was hit with a stun net from his own rifle. Zuckuss was left tied up while the Wookiee rescued Solo and Ford, and the scoundrels fled with their cargo back to the Millennium Falcon.

Zuckuss was trapped in the wreckage, and called out to Solo for help in freeing his legs, though slapped stuncuffs on Solo when he was in reach. However, the planet's technology-negating effects caused the cuffs to release Solo, who left Zuckuss in his predicament. After Solo and Chewbacca found an energy projector transmitting an immobilizer beam, Zuckuss attacked them with native spears as they climbed the tall mast. Chewbacca dislodged the projection sphere from the top, causing it to crash on the beach below, which caused mechanical drones to erupt from the sand and attacked all three interlopers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The hunt for the Millennium Falcon"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the Battle of Hoth, both 4-LOM and Zuckuss assembled, along with fellow bounty hunters Boba Fett, Dengar, Bossk, and IG-88, aboard the Super Star Destroyer Executor, and were hired by Darth Vader to locate the Millennium Falcon.
