The toast was served warm as a breakfast dish on the planet Coruscant in the eatery known as Dex's Diner, where it was prepared using a robo-griddle. Dexter Jettster, the diner's Besalisk chef and owner, enjoyed and served the dish, which included three slices of toast, with bantha butter and carbosyrup, for 4.7 credits. The price also included a breakfast side of the customer's choice, and for an additional charge of 1 credit, the toast would be served with ettel nuts or zoochberries. The toast was served at Dex's at some point prior to the eatery's destruction during the first two years of the Galactic Empire's rule. Iktotch was a moon of the planet Iktotchon in the Expansion Region and home to the Iktotchi species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Iktotch toast was first mentioned in the 2009 StarWars.com Hyperspace exclusive article, \"Dining at Dex's,\" which was written by Gregory Walker as an in-universe menu for Dex's Diner.
