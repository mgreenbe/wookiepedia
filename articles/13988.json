During their campaign to cut off the Corellian Run, Falleen was among those worlds conquered with others being Druckenwell, Rodia, Kalarba and Nal Hutta. Since the Falleen had not joined the New Republic, the vast majority of the species lived on the planet and they could expect no New Republic reinforcements. Following the battle, the Yuuzhan Vong terraformed the planet and sent the population into reeducation camps. The planet would be used as an outpost by the Yuuzhan Vong to monitor the defunct Corellian Run."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
