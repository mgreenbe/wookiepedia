Three gunships were deployed to assist and evacuate Secura's cruiser, the Liberty, one of them co-piloted by the clone pilot. Rocket droids landing on Secura's cruiser took notice of the incoming gunships, and one such droid ripped off the cockpit hatch of the pilot's gunship and began to fire. Fortunately for the pilot, he managed to escape and land back in the gunships with Ahsoka, Captain Rex and the clone troopers, but with damaged controls, the gunship crash-landed into the cruiser."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
