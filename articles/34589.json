Zannah is horrified by the feelings emanating from the orb, while Bane indoctrinates her with his Rule of Two. In the cave, they encounter Darovit, who is revealed to be Zannah's cousin. Darovit attacks Bane, believing her to be Bane's captive. Knowing that her new master would kill Darovit in an instant, Zannah instead stops Darovit by destroying his right hand with the Force, telling Bane that the boy's death would serve no purpose. After leaving the cave, Bane informs Zannah that he will meet her on Onderon in ten days, and that she will have to find her own way there as her first test.

Despite the damage Bane is able to crash land on Dxun and enter the tomb of Freedon Nadd. As Bane attempts to retrieve a holocron from the burial chamber, he is attacked by orbalisks, parasitic creatures native to Dxun. Two of the creatures attach themselves to his body before he can escape and Bane quickly realizes that he cannot remove them. Nadd's holocron described his own experiences with the orbalisks: they feed on the dark side, release enzymes that increase physical strength and the power to draw on the dark side, grant incredible regenerative powers, and their shells offer protection against any weapon, including lightsabers. The holocron also warns they cause constant pain, multiply and spread over the entire body, and if one died, it would release a lethal poison that would kill him within days. Using his increased power to drive the phantoms of Kaan and Qordis from his mind permanently, Bane mentally dominates a drexl, a flying reptile, and uses the Force to encase it and himself in a cocoon of dark side energy and fly the few hundred kilometers through open space to Onderon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zannah lands her stolen shuttle on Onderon, and is confronted by a group of threatening Onderon Beast Riders.
