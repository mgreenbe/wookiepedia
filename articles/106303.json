Following the Battle of Hoth, Plumestriker and Durpin commanded the Imperial Blockade above the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk. While the Imperial Navy blockaded the planet, the Empire's Trandoshan proxies enforced order among the Wookiees. To keep the Wookiees subdued, the Trandoshans imprisoned Chief Attabura's son Tantarra in an island fortress as a hostage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When a scavenging family called the Freemakers managed to travel past the blockade in their freighter StarScavenger, Plumestriker and Durpin gave orders for their men to pretend the intrusion never happened. However, they themselves ventured down to Kashyyyk's surface to catch them. The two officers flew on their shuttle to the Trandoshan island fortress and asked if they had seen anything unusual. When the Trandoshans reported that a group of humans had delivered a wroshyr wood panel, Plumestriker recognized the intruders were around while Durpin sounded the alarm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their efforts, the Freemakers managed to free Tantarra and alert Attabura; whose forces then attacked the fortress. The Freemakers also managed to obtain the third Kyber Saber crystal. Plumestriker and Durpin managed to trap Zander Freemaker and his younger brother Rowan at the StarScavenger. While Durpin made a speech about what they were going to do with the rebels, Plumestriker realized that one more was missing. At that point, Kordi Freemaker resurfaced with the wroshyr wood panel and knocked the two Imperials on the head."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Lieutenant Commander Durpin attempted to shift some of the blame to Plumestriker during his report to Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader. However, the Emperor blamed the debacle on the Trandoshans and promoted Durpin to the rank of general. He also gave him more more and resources to get the job done.

He and General Durpin were reassigned to a plush posting: the Emperor Palpatine Museum on Naboo. The Museum had once been the Theed Royal Palace but was now repurposed as a museum dedicated to the Emperor. The two generals were tasked with guarding the exhibits. One day, they encountered Zander who was wheeling in the B1-series battle droid Roger as a disguised museum exhibit. The two men failed to recognize the Freemakers due to Zander's mustache and joked about the stupidity of breaking into the Museum."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unknown to Plumestriker and Durpin, the Freemakers were planning to break into the Museum and steal the sixth Kyber Saber crystal. Later that night, Roger exited his display cabinet and let the Freemakers inside the Museum. While all this was happening, Plumestriker and Durpin were playing holochess.

While Plumestriker regarded the reassignment as a punishment and sought to get back in the Empire's favor, Durpin was happy that they were away from the galaxy's problems and strife. When the Freemakers and Roger arrived on a makeshift snowspeeder sledge drawn by two tauntauns, Plumestriker wanted to alert Imperial High Command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Durpin did not want anything to disturb their quiet exile and tried to drive the Freemakers away with his blaster. However, the baby wampa that the Freemakers befriended grabbed his leg. Durpin called for Plumestriker to shoot at the wampa but he missed. This provoked the wampa's mother who attacked and pursued the two Imperials. Despite the scuffle, Plumestriker managed to send a distress signal that was picked up by Naare and her ally Graballa, who were hunting the Freemakers and the seventh Kyber Saber crystal. Later, a fleeing Plumestriker and Durpin ran over Naare while being pursued by the mother wampa and her child."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Manning the blockade"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plumestrike and Durpin were later reassigned to command a Gozanti-class cruiser which blockaded a planet where the rebel agents Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca were stranded.

Durpin was convinced but Plumestriker realized that humans could not contract the Gamorrean flu. He ordered his stormtroopers to arrest the Freemakers and confiscate their cargo. The Freemakers were thrown into the brig but managed to escape with the help of their droid Roger. The Freemakers then stole a fuel intermixer and detached their ship from the Gozanti cruiser. Plumestriker tried to alert Durpin but found that his superior was fretting about contracting Gamorrean flu.

The Imperials traveled on a Gozanti cruiser to a Lurmen village and landed a detachment of stormtroopers. The Imperial forces managed to capture most of the Lurmen villagers as well as Zander, Kordi, and Roger. When a Lurmen villager named Elan called Durpin a \"scum weasel\", Plumestriker tried to reassure his commanding officer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperials found few kyber crystals apart from the kyber crystal necklaces belonging to villagers. Plumestriker and his Imperial comrades were forced to retreat when Rowan and the young Lurmen girl Maynar counter-attacked with the StarScavenger's firepower.

After comforting Durpin over Elan's insult, the two were visited by Kordi and Zander, who disguised themselves as Imperial weapons technicians. Kordi managed to convince Plumestriker of their credentials by citing Zander's Imperial designation TK-42987156.

Plumestriker was suspicious but his superior was convinced."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This enabled Rowan and Maynar to recover the kyber crystals from the Gozanti cruiser. However, Rowan was attacked by the Imperial hunter droid M-OC. Maynar managed to escape with the kyber crystals but was spotted by Plumestriker. Plumestriker and Durpin cornered Maynar at a boulder but the two were knocked out by Kordi and Zander.

When Zander and Roger tried to recover the activator by charging at them, Plumestriker and Durpin took them captive at gunpoint. Plumestriker was hopeful of using Zander and Roger to lead them to the fugitive Rowan in the hopes of securing a promotion. However, Durpin opposed this idea since he did not like the responsibility that came with the job and feared being Force choked by Lord Vader for failure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This led to an argument between Plumestriker and Durpin then went on into the night. Later that night, Kordi disguised herself as Darth Vader and contacted Plumestriker and Durpin. Plumestriker saw through her ruse and took Kordi prisoner.

Unlike his complacent superior Durpin, Plumestriker was actually interested in fulfilling his duties as an Imperial officer.
