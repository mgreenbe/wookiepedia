In the year 21 BBY, the Protectors assisted Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi in rounding up all the people who were present at or near the Death Watch bombing of the Memorial Shrine in Sundari's Peace Park. They later escorted the Duchess, Master Kenobi, and the bomber's body to Mandalore's moon of Concordia. The Mandalorian Protectors continued protecting the Duchess and her entourage aboard the Coronet, where they defended her and several senators from assassin probes.

Satine made a speech to the crowds gathered outside her palace, with the Protectors standing behind her. Death Watch leader Pre Vizsla arrived to confront Satine, and the Protectors raised their weapons to defend the Duchess, though she had them lower their defenses so she could speak with Vizsla. The Death Watch and their criminal armies overpowered the New Mandalorian forces, and Vizsla later entered the throne room to again confront Satine. The Protectors prepared to fight, but Satine had them stand down as she was not willing to have her or her forces be provoked to violence. The Duchess surrendered to Death Watch, and she, the New Mandalorian Ruling Council, and her Protectors were arrested and brought to prison.
