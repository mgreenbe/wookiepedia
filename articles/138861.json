The tank had great maneuverability in tight quarters, such as the streets of occupied cities. Its laser cannons could devastate enemy troops, and the powerful engines could transport heavy payloads."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rothana Heavy Engineering's TX-225 GAVw assault tank was the Imperial Army's premier light urban combat vehicle. These rugged vehicles could be found in mechanized infantry divisions and the Galactic Empire's Stormtrooper Corps, where they filled a much-needed support and patrol role in the Empire's order of battle. The tank was typically deployed in occupied cities and within Imperial military facilities rather than on the front lines, and were a common sight in urban centers with high amounts of unrest. Remarkably versatile, Occupiers were capable of fighting, providing support fire, and carrying troops and cargo with equal ease."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Small and simple, the Occupier was 7.30 meters long and 1.82 meters tall, and was roughly the same size of a heavy speeder truck. They had an armored, wedge-shaped forward crew compartment that held the three-person crew\u2014a vehicle commander, a driver and a gunner\u2014in cramped conditions. As a result of their tracks and responsive drivetrain, the Occupier was capable of stopping, turning, and maneuvering in incredibly tight quarters. They were heavily armed for vehicles of similar class, equipped with three Dymek manufactured MK 2e/w medium laser cannons, two elevating and one forward-locked, a pair of light blaster cannons mounted forward in the reinforced bow, and a light repeating blaster that could be mounted on a pintle near the main access hatch for anti-infantry and light anti-vehicle use in tight quarters. In addition to its armament, the GAVw had a depleted duranium composite armor, and was equipped with a Rothana Heavy Engineering manufactured ADGT-1500 engine that boasted a maximum speed of 72 kilometers per hour on the road and 45 kilometers per hour off the road, as well as close-range sensors. The cost of the GAVw was 40,000 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, Imperial combat assault tanks were deployed to the Holy City of Jedha during the Empire's occupation of the desert moon to transport kyber crystals.
