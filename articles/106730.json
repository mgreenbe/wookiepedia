It contained many roleplaying articles, including a rules supplement for the West End Games Star Wars D6 system. The article was called The New Rogues Gallery: Unsung Heroes of the Rebellion and was written by Joe Littrell. Like all supplements printed in Polyhedron prior to 2002, the article is considered ambiguously canon."}]}
