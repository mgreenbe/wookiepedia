Their rebellion was ended when Imperials, including Captain Strayit and Lieutenant Zertik Strom of the Imperial Navy vessel Marshall Awe, came to prevent resistance. Strom took a blaster bolt meant for Strayit from one of the rebels, before pushing a thermal detonator down the pants of the leader of the merchants and throwing him off a cliff into the rest of the group. The explosion killed the majority of merchants and destroyed their stalls, with those left to scared to show further defiance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Poporov merchants were first mentioned in the second part of Viva Space Vegas!
