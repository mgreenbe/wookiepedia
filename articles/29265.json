To assist Th'er, the Jedi Order sent Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi to the planet. The leader of the Metal Clan attempted to capture Th'er so that either her word or her blood could be used to destroy her trees. Surrounded by forces of the Metal Clan, Jinn chose to escape with Mistress Th'er in an Eta-class shuttle and return to Coruscant. After seeking guidance from the Force, Jinn met with Th'er, suggesting that she recruit allies to her cause to help fight against the Metal Clan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
