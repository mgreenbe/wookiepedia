The air in the lowlands was unbreathable by Humans due to the toxic contaminants and volcanic ash, but the native Qieg had no trouble. Much of the life in the lowlands was microscopic, but some small insects and reptiles survived in the conditions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were many mines located in the lowlands, usually operated by Qieg miners living in settlements around the mine.
