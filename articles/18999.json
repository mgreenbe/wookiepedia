The attack was planned by Count Dooku to disrupt the peace initiative occurring between the Republic and the Separatist Alliance. Under orders from General Grievous, six Infiltrator demolition droids infiltrated the power generator, killing the engineers and setting themselves to self-destruct. As they did so, they caused the generator to detonate, setting off fires across Coruscant and cutting power to large sections of the city-planet. After it was confirmed to the Republic Senate the attack was committed by the Separatists, the peace process fell apart."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 21 BBY, the Repubulic Senator Gume Saam proposed a bill that would open up new lines of credit with the InterGalactic Banking Clan in order produce more troopers for the Republic's Grand Army.

Saam suggests they take out Amidala, but Card knew that the Senate would not de-regulate the banks. Thus, they agreed to bring the war to Coruscant, knowing that it has not been attacked in over a thousand years. Thus, they contacted the Confederacy's leader, Count Dooku. Dooku, at the behest of Lord Sidious, tasked General Grievous with planning the attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this time, Senator Amidala and Padawan Ahsoka Tano then went to the Confederacy's capital, Raxus Secundus. There, they met Onderon's Senator Mina Bonteri, who told them that the Separatist Senate was debating the same thing. At a session of the senate at Senate Building in Raxulon, the Senate, despite the Corporate Alliance's Senator Voe Atell's objections voted yes to open negotiations with the Republic with Dooku's support."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amidala and Tano then returned to Coruscant and informed Chancellor Palpatine of the Confederacy's peace proposal.

Soon, Senator Saam announced that the attack had been confirmed as a Separatist one, and Kamino Senator Halle Burtoni proposed to vote on the bill to deregulate the banks. Amidala attempted to stop the process, but to no avail, as more and more Senators began to support Burtoni's proposal.
