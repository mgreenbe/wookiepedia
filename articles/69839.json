When Den does win and Xanatos presents the prize to him, the recorded images are played for all the Telosians to see. However, Xanatos deceives the crowd and the Jedi are captured once more. But Den, addressing the crowd, tells the people how the lottery was rigged and how the Telosians were robbed of their money.

But Xanatos, not willing to be defeated, commits suicide by throwing himself into the acid pools."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This is a gallery of the different cover variations of Jedi Apprentice: The Day of Reckoning."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
