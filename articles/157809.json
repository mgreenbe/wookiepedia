He grabbed her and she stabbed him in the eye with a syringe filled with the recently-engineered vaccine to the virus. This caused him to scream loudly, as the vaccine restored a tiny amount of his former awareness, during which he proceeded to attempt to communicate with her, first by attempting speech, which came out as gibberish, before attempting to write on the floor with a syringe. Within minutes however, the vaccine's effectiveness diminished, reverting him back to his feral zombie condition. He attacked her afterwards, but was killed for good when a nearby 2-1B surgical droid rammed a surgical bone saw in to the top of his head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
