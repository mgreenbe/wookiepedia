Clingwire was made out of high tensile material, which could support massive amounts of weight and stress. Additionally, the wire was coated in a material designed for superior gripping power when ensnaring a target, as a result the wire tightened whenever the target moved."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
