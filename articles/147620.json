During the Clone Wars around 21 BBY, there was a mine located in the town that delivered raw damotite for Lok Durd's damotite bioweapon. On a mission to destroy the bioweapon, The Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi arrived in the village on the run from Separatist forces, and posed as farmers looking for a new home in Torbel.
