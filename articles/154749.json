He was normally stationed on Coruscant until Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala managed to capture Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray on Rodia. This guard, along with Captain Faro Argyus and three other guards, was assigned to the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tranquility to escort the captured viceroy to Coruscant alongside Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and Padawan Ahsoka Tano. After the attack of Asajj Ventress, Argyus, who was a spy for the Confederacy of Independent Systems, had been contacted by Ventress. The guard heard the beeping from the captain's comlink and asked what it was. Argyus said it was nothing and blasted the two guards, killing both of them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This guard was voiced in the Clone Wars episode \"Cloak of Darkness\" by Corey Burton, who also voiced Dooku in the same episode."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
