The sets could be combined with other sets of a similar theme (Death Star, Cloud City, Hoth) to create a larger playset. A number of other playsets (including a Dagobah set) reached the prototype stage before the line was cancelled after one year."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
