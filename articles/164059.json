Wicket's first name was that of a brave and inquisitive nature spirit of Ewok legend and his surname, \"Warrick\", was reserved for the greatest of warriors to honor another legendary figure who bore the name. Early on, Wicket exhibited a sense of adventure; though his father, Deej, didn't understand where it came from, Wicket's mother, Shodu, knew that he was simply taking after his father. Wicket grew up with two older brothers, Weechee and Willy, and he developed close friendships with Teebo, Princess Kneesaa, and Latara. Wicket and Teebo played games, like seeing who could hit a burr ball the farthest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One spring morning, Wicket joined his older brother Weechee as he went off into the woods for archery practice. But when Wicket lost Weechee's arrows and broke his new bow, Weechee castigated his young brother. Wicket fled to the base of his Soul Tree and sulked all day, deciding that if he ever had a younger sibling, he would not be mean to him. (He eventually did gain a baby sister, Winda.) Eager to grow up, Wicket was continually saddened when he wasn't allowed to go on expeditions with the older Ewoks. He was thrilled to no longer be considered a wokling when he officially gained his hood at the Festival of Hoods."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On one occasion, when Wicket and Kneesaa were picking berries in the forest, they stumbled upon two creatures attempting to cut down the forest's trees. When the two got back to their village, they told Chief Chirpa of the giants, which they learned were called Phlogs. Wicket later recounted the story before the Council of Elders, an opportunity he had never had before. Unsatisfied with the Council's decision to send a scouting party the next morning, the young Ewoks turned to the shaman Logray, who told them the history of the Phlogs of Simoom and what a threat they posed. Logray gave them a white powder, which they were able to use on the Phlogs to make them run back to their own land and leave the Ewoks' forest alone. During the celebration that day, both Wicket and Kneesaa were made honorary members of the Council of Elders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the day of the Harvest Moon Feast arrived, Wicket invited Kneesaa and the woklings Nippet and Wiley she was babysitting, to join him for a picnic in the woods. Along the way, Wicket kept an eye out for rainbow berries, which had been particularly hard to find that summer. When the Ewoks arrived at their place by the river, Wicket decided to teach the woklings all about fishing. As Wicket caught the fish, he handed them off to the woklings to place them in a basket. Wicket later found that the baby Ewoks had been dumping the fish back into the river. Just when Wicket began to think that babysitting wasn't so hard, the woklings had another mishap involving bees and honey, forcing the four Ewoks to jump into the river. As they dried off later, Wicket and Kneesaa decided to hang out in a tree and left the woklings to play hide-and-seek. When Wicket and Kneesaa got down, they saw that the woklings were covered in berry juice, for they had discovered some rainbow berry bushes. The Ewoks then gathered berries which were later made into rainbow berry pies for the Harvest Moon Feast and the woklings' mother thanked Wicket and Kneesaa for making the event so special."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The annual midsummer festival was another special time for the Ewoks, as they would participate in contests to show what they could do best. Wicket encouraged Kneesaa to enter the basket-weaving contest, but she felt that she would rather enter a competition in which she wasn't so experienced. When she expressed interest in the archery contest, an event which Wicket intended to win, he revealed to Kneesaa his sexist views on females in athletics. When Kneesaa entered the contest anyway, Wicket continued to put her down and promote his chauvinistic viewpoint. Still determined, Kneesaa entered the vine-swinging contest and then inadvertently got herself into the dangerous Log Ride Contest\u2014and won. This impressed Wicket, so much so that he apologized to Kneesaa, realizing that girls could, in fact, be good at sports. Kneesaa then suggested that Wicket might perhaps win the next year's basket-weaving contest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One fall season, as the Harvest Festival approached, Wicket and Teebo put off their chores and decided to go hang-gliding. As they traveled far away from home, the two got caught in a storm and were separated. After Wicket was blown to the ground, he took refuge from the storm in a cave and was soon joined by Teebo. Lost, afraid and hungry, the two young Ewoks waited out the storm inside the cave. Once it cleared, Wicket tried to determine where they were; when Teebo spotted smoke in the distance, he feared their village was on fire, but Wicket recognized it as a smoke signal, beckoning the Ewoks back home. Upon their return to the village, they thanked Kneesaa for signaling them. She promised not to tell anyone the boys had been playing as long as they would complete her chores for her in return. After Wicket reluctantly agreed, the three sat and shared a meal of bread and jam."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Village scout"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At a young age, Wicket became a scout for Bright Tree Village, as did his friend Teebo.

Unwilling to accept Kneesaa's fate, Wicket and Teebo sneaked into the Council Hut and stole the Bridge crystal that created the forbidden Rainbow Bridge, which they used to cross over the Gorge of Fire into the land of Zandor to attempt to take the Sunnydew nectar from the cave of Gantu, the Ogre. A confrontation with Gantu ensued and the Ogre's bowl of nectar was spilled and the rainbow crystal destroyed, their passage home along with it. However, the spilled nectar immediately caused new nectar-producing sunnydew flowers to sprout from the ground. The local Zandor Rockers, grateful to the Ewoks for their allowing the plants to flourish again, dug an underground tunnel for the Ewoks to travel back to the village. There, Wicket gave Kneesaa a sunnydew flower which instantly brought her back to health."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Early scouting missions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wicket and Teebo spent several weeks training a baby bordok as a gift for Kneesaa's birthday, but they ended up being stuck with scouting duty on the day of her party.

While Teebo was captured, Wicket escaped, although he was knocked from his post high in the tree and had to struggle his way back to the village to warn the Ewoks. Injured and exhausted, Wicket was bedridden while Kneesaa and the women of the tribe saved the village from the Zorbians. Wicket recovered soon enough, although he kept his right arm in a sling for a while."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chief Chirpa later declared Wicket, Kneesaa, and Teebo the guests of honor for the harvest ceremony. The distinction allowed them journey to a location on Endor where the mountains and the forest met, a location Wicket had scouted before, to harvest the special light wood the Ewoks used to make their hang gliders. Upon their arrival, they discovered that the trees had already been harvested by the Quorks. Upon trying to escape, Wicket was captured by a devil beast. The Quarks then presented Wicket and the harvested wood as gifts to their king, Marlox. The king ordered Wicket to build a glider for him, but Wicket refused and insulted the king. Wicket was then sentenced to solitary confinement in a cell with no food or water. Before Wicket was even put into his cell, his two friends attempted to rescue him, but they failed and were instead imprisoned along with Wicket. Marlox later forced the Ewok boys to build him a glider by threatening Kneesaa's life if they didn't. The Ewoks outsmarted the king by building a him a glider that would not fly and they rescued Kneesaa and returned home with the sacred wood for the harvest ceremony."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wicket and Teebo were soon sent on another scouting mission, several days' journey away from the village. When Teebo suggested a shortcut for their return trip, the two were captured by Joddar and the Lizard Warriors. When Wicket heard the name of the warriors' Ewok leader, Graak, he knew they were in trouble, for Graak had been banished from Bright Tree Village by Chirpa many years earlier. The scouts tried to sneak out, but Graak would not let them get away so easily. Instead, he made the two participate in a most dangerous game: he would allow them to go home through the valley if they could escape the Lizard Warriors, who would be hunting them as prey. But Wicket and Teebo managed to outsmart the warriors at every turn and even saved Joddar from an Endorian swamp beast. However, after they escaped the valley, Graak went back on his word and refused to let the Ewoks leave. When Graak began to strangle Teebo with a whip, Wicket took matters into his own hands by grabbing a forked stick and pinning Graak to the ground. When it seemed Wicket had the upper hand, Graak threw dirt into Wicket's eyes and lifted a giant boulder, intending to crush the blinded scout to death. But Wicket was saved by Joddar, returning the compassion the young scouts had shown him. As the scouts headed back home, Wicket remarked that while the shortcut had taken days off of their journey, he felt as if it had taken years off of his life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In between scouting assignments, Wicket was out with Kneesaa in the forest one day when they were encountered by Dooni, a baby foonar who had been separated from his mother. As they went to search for the missing mother, Wicket fell into a large hole in the ground and injured his ankle. The hole, he surmised, was intended for foonars; they soon found further evidence with a prodding rod, although Wicket was able to use the rod as a crutch to relieve his injured ankle. The Ewoks soon discovered the ship of the foonar-capturing invaders and Wicket quickly climbed up the outside of the ship and observed the goings on inside. But the ship's thin viewport was not only unable to block sound waves, but it also could not withstand the weight of a small Ewok, for Wicket shattered the window and fell though it and into the ship. After a quick skirmish with the aliens, Wicket was able to escape through the window from which he came. The aliens decided that one Ewok was no threat to them, but they had underestimated Wicket Warrick. He knew all about the aliens' plans to utilize the foonars to power their \"harvester\" to cut down the trees of the forest. Wicket and Kneesaa wasted no time in hijacking the harvester machine, and Wicket demonstrated his technological prowess by engaging the blade and pointing the machine towards the invaders' own ship. As the aliens fled the moon, Dooni's mother destroyed the harvester and was reunited with her child and Wicket's heroism was celebrated once again."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The sorcerer's apprentice"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During one winter season, Wicket spent much of his time at Logray's hut. One night, he asked Logray if he would take Wicket on as an apprentice so that he could one day become a medicine man. But Logray dismissed the idea, for he didn't feel that Wicket was ready for such things. Later in the night, Wicket passed by the hut of his friend, Latara, and saw Logray rushing in. Wicket learned that Latara was ill, and he overheard Logray and Warok saying that they needed a fuzzynettle plant to make more medicine for her, although they would wait until the next morning to retrieve it. Knowing exactly where the fuzzynettles grew on the far side of the forest, Wicket retrieved Baga, the bordok he had trained, and headed out into the frozen forest, using the stars as his guide. Wicket found the fuzzynettles and returned to the village with the plants the next morning at dawn. Logray used the plants to create a healing powder, giving Latara a quick recovery. Logray decided that Wicket was indeed very brave and that he would make a good medicine man, so the next day, he began to teach Wicket as his apprentice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One day, as Wicket began to learn Logray's magic, he once stole the sorcerer's staff to show off to his friends. Unbeknownst to Wicket, the Ice Demon, Stagorr, was watching the young Ewoks via his magical ice mirror. Stagorr tricked Wicket into summoning a wind tunnel from Ice Mountain and inadvertently transporting himself into the heart of the mountain. There, Wicket learned that Stagorr intended to steal Logray's staff to seek revenge on the sorcerer, who confined him to the palace of ice long ago. Stagorr put Wicket under a spell and sent him to use Logray's own staff as a weapon against him. While the spell took over Wicket's body, his mind remained intact, and he was able to warn Logray when he arrived at Ice Mountain. His plan failing, Stagorr reclaimed the staff from Wicket and prepared to battle Logray again. But with some help from Logray, Wicket was able to recall some magic his master had taught him before. He used fire crystals to melt a portion of the icy ceiling onto the Ice Demon; the water hit Stagorr and froze on contact, trapping him by his own power. On their journey home, Wicket apologized to Logray for stealing his staff and decided not to pursue studying sorcery."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "A tale of Sorrow"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taking a break from harvesting Honey Melons, Wicket and Kneesaa decided to take a dip in their favorite swimming hole while Teebo opted to wander off and write poetry. Ready to head back to the village after their swim, Wicket and Kneesaa looked for Teebo, but were unable to find him. This was particularly upsetting, since they had to carry back Teebo's basket of melons in addition to their own. They found Teebo soon enough when the aspiring poet bowled a Honey Melon at them, spilling all their baskets and knocking the Ewoks over. Wicket determined that Teebo was under a spell and hurried off to the village for the sake of his friend. Wicket found Teebo in the Council Hut, already affecting the elders with his spatially contagious spell. Even Wicket was affected when he tried to stop Teebo. Then Logray told of a possible cure: a being at the top of Mount Sorrow whose tears could reverse the spell. Wicket and Kneesaa did not give it a second thought; they took Teebo and headed to the top of the mountain. Once there, Wicket humbly approached the being, which was, in fact, the tip of the mountain itself, and began to plead for some tears for his friend. But when Teebo approached, his spell began to affect the mountain, who became offended and exhaled a wind which would blow Wicket and Kneesaa of the mountain and to their doom. But Teebo grabbed a rope and saved the lives of his friends. When Teebo told the two that he would rather live with the spell for the rest of his life than risk losing his closest friends again, Mount Sorrow was so moved that he wept for Teebo and cried him a plethora of healing tears."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The rise of Morag"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As if their mountaintop wind-blown flight was not enough, Wicket and Kneesaa were soon blown about the air in their own village in a storm summoned by Morag, the Tulgah witch who was once the slave master of Logray. And it was Logray who saved the two Ewoks from again nearly falling to their demise. Then Morag created a sort of Force-apparition of herself and spoke to the Ewoks while her thieves sneaked into the village and stole the crystal eye of the kreegon, a beast which Chirpa's father has slain many years before. With the eye in her possession, Morag had the power to bring the beast back to life; it was for this reason Chirpa chose to journey to Morag's lair at Mount Thunderstone to try and stop her. After his departure, Logray's crystal image spinner revealed that Morag was already resurrecting the kreegon beast. Kneesaa decided to go after her father, and Wicket insisted on joining her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they journeyed to Mount Thunderstorm, Wicket spotted the chief's bordok and became concerned that Chirpa was nowhere near. They feared even more when they saw a path of cleared trees leading back toward their village. When they reached the mountain, they found Chirpa and freed him for Morag's restraints. Heading back to the village with the kreegon hot on their trail, Wicket proposed that the Ewoks make a stand against the beast. Though their attempt to kill the beast in the Molten Sulfur Pits did not go as planned, they were able to fool Morag into using her own magic to bring down the beast.

Wicket spotted a flying Dragon-bird, and felt that it was surely a bad omen. As Teebo return from a dive with a rare blue pearl, Wicket's fears were realized when the two were attack by a devil serpent and forced from their boat and into waters. When Teebo never surfaced, Wicket swam underwater to find his unconscious friend, but Wicket also blacked out before he reached Teebo. They would have likely perished, had they not been retrieved by an Underwater dweller and taken to their Underwater Kingdom. Back to a conscious state, Wicket and Teebo met Squik and the others of his species. The Ewoks were taken aback by the plethora of pearls among the dwellers' kingdom. The pearls, the Ewoks learned, were the primary food source for the creatures, and it was their prized red pearl which gave off a glowing light that caused the other pearls to grow. The dwellers kept this red pearl hidden, and the Ewoks soon saw firsthand just why: Orcon, an underwater dweller roughly twice the size of the others, arrived mounted upon his devil serpent to steal food pearls, as he often did. Wicket and Teebo, unafraid of Orcon, stood up to the so-called \"evil tyrant\" but ended up only further enraging the bandit and causing him to unleash the wrath of his devil serpent via his controlling trident. Orcon then discovered the red pearl and, believing it would make him invincible, stole it and fled the cave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unwilling to accept such an injustice, especially one for which he felt responsible, Wicket devised a plan to take back the pearl from Orcon. Intending to travel underwater, Wicket found a nearby patch of bubble plants which produced hard, spherical \"bubbles\" which were conveniently just big enough to encase the head of a young Ewok and provide a small air supply but not so large that would let in any water around the neck. Donning their newfound natural scuba gear, Wicket and Teebo set off on a pair of water wallocks to Orcon's stronghold, their new friend Squik accompanying them. As the squeaked past the sleeping devil serpent, they entered Orcon's lair. With a quick attack, the trio retrieved the pearl from Orcon, but he soon grabbed his trident and summoned the devil beast. Wicket then was able to outsmart Orcon and take his trident, turning Orcon's own creature against him. However, the red pearl, which was used as a decoy in their counterattack, was destroyed in the process. This caused Wicket to feel remorse, but all was soon made well: on their way back to the underwater dwelling, Teebo found the blue pearl he had discovered when the whole incident began. He gave it to the dweller, who discovered that it was even more powerful than the red pearl they had before."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Star Child and the Dulok treaty"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The morning of the day upon which the Ewoks were to seal a peace treaty with their longtime foes the Duloks, Wicket spotted a blazing object falling from the sky.

Wicket was among the party who ventured to the swamp where the object had crashed. The other Ewoks began to flee when the object, an escape pod, started to move, but Wicket stayed behind when the alien \"Star Child\" emerged from the pod.

The group was saved, however, when R2-D2 extended his third tread to stand on and used his other two legs to catch the boulder over their heads and toss it aside. When C-3PO explained to Wicket and Kneesaa in their own language that their \"Star Child,\" Prince Plooz, was not a good omen for the Ewok/Dulok treaty but rather a rebellious prince and the key to preventing war between Sooma and Alzar, Wicket surmised that the trap they had just escaped meant the Duloks were not actually sincere about the proposed peace treaty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wicket and the others returned to Bright Tree Village warn the tribe, only to learn that the Peace Council had already left with Prince Plooz to meet with the Duloks.
