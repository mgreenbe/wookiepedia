Their plumage was speckled with browns and grays, allowing them to naturally blend into the mountainous regions in which they hunted. Common prey included small mammals, reptiles, and their fellow brethren. Huge, grotesque talons enabled the cliff hawk to hang upside down, an arcane ability for a bird of such size. Cliff hawks seldom flew, instead preferring to scurry about on two legs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
