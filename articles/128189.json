Solanus was home to a sentient ocean that covered it, a murky sea so rich in chemicals that it could perform billions of thought processes within its depths, which classified it as a super-brain. However, like other super-brains, the ocean was too large to move around independently and kept to itself, often contemplating its own existence. It refrained from participating in galactic affairs, instead spending its time playing with itself by shaping and reforming intricate crystal structures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 0 BBY, Luke Skywalker, a young man from the planet Tatooine, had seen pictures of the \"thinking\" ocean that existed on Solanus, believing it to be one of the strangest examples of the large and complex brains known as super-brains."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solanus and its thinking ocean were created by John Chesterman for \"Cantina Communications,\" a one-page vignette included in Star Wars Official Poster Monthly 16, published in 1979 by Paradise Press.
