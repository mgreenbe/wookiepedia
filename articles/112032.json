Ravilan and his followers, known as the Fifty\u2013seven, secretly and purposefully caused a plague there by adding the toxic cyanogen silicate to the water in an attempt to scare the Sith on Kesh into focusing their efforts on leaving the planet. Ravilan's aide was killed by the substance, along with approximately eighteen\u2013thousand Keshiri natives. When her body was found by Sith who came to investigate the crisis, Seelah Korsin\u2014the wife of the leader and Grand Lord Yaru Korsin\u2014identified the swollen, blue features of her tongue as a result of the cyanogen silicate.
