Otherwise, he would just pass other participants, focused on reaching the finish line first rather than destroying other racers' pods (a method favored by Sebulba). Gasgano's custom-built Ord Pedrovia placed a heavy emphasis on acceleration, helping him take the lead in the critical early seconds of a Podrace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Xexto had little patience for Humans and often condemned lesser pilot Anakin Skywalker as a rookie wannabe, while at the same time being impressed that the Human boy had ever dared to strap himself into a Pod in the first place. Gasgano was championed by Gardulla Besadii the Elder, although she was far from the only spectator who bet on him; many predicted Gasgano would overtake Sebulba in the Boonta Eve Classic. Placed prominently on the grid, the Xexto took a good start when Jabba the Hutt gave the kickoff, and managed to stay in the front runners throughout the race. While Gasgano placed second behind Anakin in this race, Sebulba's defeat and subsequent temporary loss of dignity provided the Xexto with an excellent chance to further his own career as a Podracer. Although Gasgano has a reputation as an intellectual, he got drunk in the nearest cantina to celebrate his victory. However, not bothering to rest from his partial victory in the Boonta, the competitive Gasgano quickly moved on to other races, and soon became the favorite pilot on the barren Podracing moon of Oovo IV."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Games of 26 BBY, and among several other contestants of an illegal Caves race on the planet Euceron (including Ody Mandrell, Aldar Beedo, Elan Mak, Will Neluenf, and 14-year-old Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker), Gasgano unfortunately got tangled up with \"Scorch\" Zanales, and the two racers crashed their pods. Skywalker won the race on behalf of the children of Ratts Tyerell\u2014Deland and Doby, whose podracer Anakin piloted to free their sister-slave Djulla from the clutches of her master, Sebulba (whose son, Hekula, took second place)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gasgano's appearance in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace marked the introduction of the Xexto species to the saga.
