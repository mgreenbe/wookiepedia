The ship and her commander became notorious for committing a number of atrocities during their battles against the Rebel Alliance. In the months following the Rebels' evacuation of Yavin, the Red Wind was stopped near planet Plooriod IV, undergoing repairs. Support ships surrounded it with a mine field to protect it. Corellian Corvette crews urged an attack to seek out retribution by destroying the ship. A-wing fighters led by Keyan Farlander made a path through the mine field for nine corvettes during the attack. After a long battle, the frigate was destroyed, presumably along with its commander."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
