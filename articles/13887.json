The Rogues split up to inspect the running freighters, but encountered a nasty surprise when they targeted the cargo vessels: before her capture, or at her prior instruction, Ilay had equipped one-shot warhead launchers to the freighters that would automatically lock and fire at any incoming starfighter that targeted one of the ships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The booby-trap nearly bought the freighters enough time to run to the safety of the Star Destroyer's guns, but Rogue Squadron managed to disable the freighters transporting conscripts while Green Squadron wreaked havoc on the warhead-carrying freighters. Though the clever gimmick likely cost the lives (or at least the spacecraft) of at least a couple Rebel pilots, it ultimately failed to prevent the convoy's neutralization."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "But the sheer scope of the Airam convoy taxed the Rebel starfighters, each of them tasked with inspecting, disabling, and destroying the appropriate freighters. More and more bulk freighters dropped out of hyperspace, eventually numbering around twenty ships.

The multitasking Rebel pilots also succeeded in protecting the rescue shuttles sent by the Alliance to take aboard the conscripts from the disabled freighters. Once the last freighter was destroyed and all the conscripts possible rescued, the Alliance forces withdrew."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The dire supply situation of Task Force Vengeance became evident after the Battle of Dega. During questioning, the Airam conscripts reported that they were to undergo basic flight training aboard the Vengeance, then undertake suicide missions against the Alliance forces in the Airam sector\u2014the large supply of warheads in the accompanying freighters would have proven lethal to the Rebels if such attacks materialized."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Senn's options were now cut down to very few possibilities: either withdraw the remainders of the task force and face the wrath of his superiors, or to continue his mission at all costs\u2014an option he chose to pursue with his following attack on the Alliance shipyard in the Nocto system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
