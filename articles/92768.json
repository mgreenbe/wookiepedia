They were believed to be somehow related to the Atzerrian Meek. They lived in dens with populations in the thousands, all birthed by a single queen. This queen was extremely intelligent, but birthed offspring that were comparably unintelligent. Often, the queen would expel Moochers she was displeased with, and they would branch off to form their own dens, or turn to a life of panhandling in the planet's spaceports, the latter being considered a nuisance by most inhabitants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moochers were also susceptible to the Veizen fever, which could drive them mad. When an outbreak seemed possible, the Tundei regime allowed the extermination of nearly all the Moochers, to prevent it from spreading to the Gado."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
