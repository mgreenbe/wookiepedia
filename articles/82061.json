Circa 1 ABY, they harassed the small-time thug Lilith Laughlin because they suspected her to be an informant for the Corellian Security Force. In fact, they were right and Laughlin was actually working for the CorSec. During the CorSec investigation against the criminal organization known as the Chirq Council, Captain Vitala Baize needed information from Lilith Laughlin. She therefore dispatched an agent to deal with her Ragtag problem. The CorSec agent fought the Ragtag cudgels who bothered the informant and killed some of them, including Lilea Norith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lilea Norith was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
