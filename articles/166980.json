Sinis thus recruited a spacer to investigate the ship crash site and retrieve some equipment. The spacer fought several Deflarian scavengers around the wreck and recovered the flight recorder from the Deflarians. Sinis then requested Yorick to analyze the flight recorder and the slicer discovered that it was modified by the Deflarians. This eventually led to the discovery that the Deflarians hijacked the ship to stole its cargo and then crashed a ship of the same model to cover the theft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yorick was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
