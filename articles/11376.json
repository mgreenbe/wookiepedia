The B69 changes appearances in the actual comic, where it is shown as a more boxy craft; however, in a retelling featured in the StarWars.com article Viva Space Vegas! The History of the Marvelous Wheel, the speeder shown is the similar-looking model featured on the cover of Republic 47."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
