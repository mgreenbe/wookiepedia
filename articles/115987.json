Rook used his BD-1 Cutter vibro-ax to force Skywalker off, but the Jedi caught the edge of the plank as he dropped and then sprung over Rook's head back onto the skiff.

It describes Pagetti Rook as the first guard to be knocked from the skiff by Luke Skywalker, followed by a \"rodent-like\" guard and then Rintel Aren, who has been enraged by Rook's death. Aren is also described as crumpling to the deck upon his death. In the film, Rook's death is not shown, but he is still clearly visible and alive on the skiff when Kithaba and Velken Tezeri are knocked overboard. Aren is then shown being knocked over the edge of the skiff by Skywalker. As such, this article assumes that the events depicted in the film are the canonical ones, while still treating Rook as dying prior to Aren in order for the latter to become enraged."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
