By the time the Clone Wars broke out across the galaxy, Kerr had been elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight. As the Great Jedi Purge was underway, Kerr was tracked down by Darth Vader and the Emperor, but the two Sith realized that Kerr was already slipping toward the dark side of the Force and let him live. As with other Dark Jedi, Palpatine saw their mere existence as serving the dark side, and therefore ultimately serving him as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the fall of the Galactic Empire, Kerr settled on the planet of Rannon. Circa 7 ABY, Kerr began to sense stirrings in the dark side and believed that Palpatine had managed to survive. He then began to terrorize the people of Rannon and recruit and train new Force-sensitives in the ways of the dark side. It seemed that after his detection of the change in the dark side, Kerr's power grew, as the Valley of Ternaax, where he made his home, began to become corrupted, turning to rot in his presence. Word of his depredations spread throughout the Bitrose, Hunnoverrs and Instrop sectors. These rumors of an \"insane dark magician\" reached General Airen Cracken, who composed a file on him along with a bounty of 15,000 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kerr was a very skilled individual, capable in both lightsaber combat and many Force powers.
