By the time Empress Vaylin took the Eternal Throne, Frem was a Captain in the ranks of the Knights of Zakuul. During the Grand Festival of Empress Vaylin in 3630 BBY he was present in the Palace of the Eternal Dragon barracks where he told several Knights, including an initiate named Alus, the story of Watcher Izax. Vaylin's speech was interrupted by the arrival of first Alliance Commander and then former Emperor Arcann. In an effort to kill them both, Vaylin ordered the Eternal Fleet to bomb the Palace into rubble, regardless of her supporters still inside. Later, during the final confrontation with Tenebrae, Frem was among the spirits witnessing his final death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Captain Frem appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne during \"Chapter VI: The Dragon's Maw.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
