Wertram worked as a tailor in the city of Tahv. He had a wife, and a daughter. Eventually, he placed his daughter under the tutelage of a prominent teacher and geologist, Adari Vaal, a neighbor of Wertram. There, his daughter learned controversial theories about the formation of Kesh's continents, contradicting the prevalent Keshiri religion. In 5000 BBY, Vaal was called up to testify about her findings by the planet's ruling elite, the Neshtovar; while defending herself, Vaal spotted Wertram in the crowd, and mentioned his daughter as one of her students."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wertram has first appeared in Lost Tribe of the Sith: Skyborn, a 2009 eBook by John Jackson Miller.
