The Sith managed to avoid the few Jedi on Ilum, leaving the Jedi largely unaware of their presence as the strike team began to quietly harvest crystals. However, in 3640 BBY, the Empire's scientists discovered that Adegan crystals could be used in the development of stealth technology, and they launched an invasion of the planet to take advantage of the crystal deposits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
