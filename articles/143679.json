Though Obi-Wan manages to disarm him easily, the Raider then howls, which alerts all the other males in the camp that they have an intruder. They all attack him, and Obi-Wan slowly starts to hate them, causing him to slip to the dark side slightly before he hears the voice of Qui-Gon Jinn, which brings him back to the light. Instead of murdering the entire clan as Anakin had done in the past, Obi-Wan instead chooses to cut their clothes off to reveal their skin\u2014a taboo to the Sand People, which would usually result in the others of their tribe murdering them.
