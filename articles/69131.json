Relasi lived long enough to contact her droid, GSAD-43, and ordered the droid to \"get them for me.\" GSAD-43 used the onboard computer of Janna Relasi's ship and through her research, found enough clues to discover the identity of one of the culprits \u2014 although GSAD-43 assumed that there were other involved co-conspirators. GSAD-43 upgraded her weaponry, tracked the murderer, and took that individual to justice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
