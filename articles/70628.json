Jeridel and her brother Jenson both worked in an illegal lab on Corellia, a lab specialized in bio-engineering creatures through dangerous genetic experiments. Circa 1 ABY, Jenson was promoted as lead creature handler. However, Jeridel's brother failed to return back after three days. When a spacer working for Lieutenant Joth of the Corellian Security Force arrived to investigate the lab, Jeridel hired the spacer to search the laboratory where Jenson worked, to find out what had happened to him.
