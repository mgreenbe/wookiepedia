The actor seemed to hold having played the species in high regard though why that was is unknown. Little is known about the Tholians, their culture, or even what they looked like. Considering Chuff's short stature, they were probably a diminuitive race if Chuff effectively portrayed one of them. They presumably originated from the Tholian system in the Meram sector of the Outer Rim Territories."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tholians are also a species from Star Trek, and like their Trek counterparts, are somewhat hard to understand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
