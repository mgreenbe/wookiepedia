They were created by the Trade Federation during their invasion on the planet of Naboo. Armadillos were covered with overlapping metallic shell-like plates that allowed them to twist and turn flexibly towards their targets yet remain protected. They were strategically placed throughout the streets of Theed, Naboo, after the Rebellion in Theed, prepared to shoot down escaping transport ships or retaliatory N-1 starfighters. However, because of the little amount of aerial resistance during the Invasion of Naboo, they were never put to good use and their production was ended after the Naboo crisis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
