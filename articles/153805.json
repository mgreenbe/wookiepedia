That year, he gathered with a number of other chieftains, clan leaders, and Mandalorian company CEOs at a meeting of the clans held in Mandalore's capital city of Keldabe, at MandalMotors Hall. There, in addition to the other clan leaders and numerous other Mandalorian mercenaries, bounty hunters, and any other Mandalorian who had been interested in attending, he questioned reigning Mand'alor Boba Fett as to what role the Mandalorians would take in the growing conflict between the Galactic Alliance and the Confederation. The chieftain believed that the Mandalorians should be involved, fighting on one side or the other\u2014though he asserted no preference for either government\u2014if for no other reason than because they always had some part in galactic warfare throughout history. When Fett suggested that Mandalore stay out of the war, the chieftain warned that the war may end up coming unwillingly to them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The chieftain was later drawn into a discussion with the gathered clan leaders and soldiers when Neth Bralor suggested Mandalore look after itself and focus on rebuilding in the wake of the Yuuzhan Vong attack on the planet during the Yuuzhan Vong War. Minutes later, when the Mandalorian known as Graad\u2014an avid supporter of the kadikla movement\u2014suggested that Fett should recall a number of Mandalorians from diaspora throughout the galaxy, the chieftain and nearly all of the assembled Mandalorians looked to Fett for his response, one that would come in favor of Graad's suggestion. Soon after, the meeting broke up and the chieftain departed MandalMotors hall with the other assembled clan leaders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mandalorian chieftain believed that the Mandalorians' place was fighting in the galaxy's wars, and he appeared to be proud of their legacy of being a presence in every major war in history.
