It depicted the face of General Grievous, the cyborg Supreme Commander of the Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. A copy was rewarded to a spacer after the individual killed a ferocious rancor from the planet Dathomir on the challenge of the Rodian hunter Qakkee. Ysith, a Trandoshan slaver on the planet Kashyyyk, also rewarded a copy of the painting to a spacer who helped her kill her rival, a fellow Trandoshan named Myssith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The painting of Grievous appears in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies by Sony Online Entertainment. It was added to the game in 2005 as part of the Rage of the Wookiees expansion pack as one of the many new quest rewards. The painting is specifically a reward from a part of the long chain of quests known collectively as the \"Clone Relics\" and part of the \"Trandoshan Slavers\" quest chain. It is named simply \"Clone Wars Painting\" in the game, a name it shares with a similar painting of a clone trooper."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
