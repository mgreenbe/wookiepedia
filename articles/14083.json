Fortunately for the New Republic, Wurth Skidder helped defend the planet. Despite a valiant two-day campaign on the part of the new Republic forces, the Yuuzhan Vong were still able to burn the planet's forests and boil its lakes using Fire Breathers, which was the first time the New Republic encountered those weapons. A large number of New Republic refugee ships were destroyed in the initial wave of the Yuuzhan Vong attack - along with passengers - and the New Republic was forced to abandon the planet, its inhabitants, and the refugees."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the battle ended the Yuuzhan Vong began to gradually terraform the planet, slowly killing off the refugees trapped on Gyndine. The New Republic was able to evacuate 5,000 civilians from the world, many of them having been relocated to Gyndine from worlds already conquered by the Yuuzhan Vong. Because the vast majority of the evacuees were from worlds that had been early members of the Rebel Alliance, many saw it as discrimination against former Imperials."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the battle, Klin-Fa Gi was presumed killed, but in actuality, she used her 'death' as a means of secretly going to Wayland to spy on Yuuzhan Vong activities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Admiral Traest Kre'fey would win a New Republic victory at Gyndine later, during the lead-up to a major battle.
