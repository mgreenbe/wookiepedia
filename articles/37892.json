She worked aboard the command bridge and answered directly to General Hera Syndulla. She interrupted Wyl Lark talking to Chass na Chadic after a skirmish at the Circus of Mortal Appetites to inform him that they had opened a long-range comms channel for him as he had requested beforehand, but that it would probably not stay open for long, leading Lark to leave Chadic prematurely. During the chase after the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing, she tried to follow the frequency of comm bursts put out by Yrica Quell from the bulk freighter Yadeez. She served during the Battle at Chadawa and the Battle of Jakku, during which she tried to send a warning to the New Republic Starhawk-class Battleship Mark I Concord about Shadow Wing's upcoming attack, but was unsure whether the message got through the particle field created by the Yadeez. Afterwards, she helped evacuate the Deliverance following Syndulla's orders after the ship had taken critical damage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dhina was at most eighteen years old by 5 ABY, had her mane neatly knotted around the fur of her face and was missing three fingers on her left hand.
