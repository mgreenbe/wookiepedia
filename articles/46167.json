V was a model of exploration droid created by Smitroo Industries. 1.8 meters tall, loyal, and very resilient, only 500 of the droids were produced. Smitroo sent the droids out with its scouts to find worlds the company could exploit. After Smitroo went bankrupt, the droids sought new masters, scouts (such as in the New Republic Scout Service) who would assist them in achieving their original mission. The droids hoped to find the Smitroo Board of Directors and report their findings to them. The model's large size tended to intimidate those unfamiliar with the model."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
