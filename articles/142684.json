In a series of three consecutive games, each with a wager of 500, Surik was the winner in all three. The Champ admitted defeat and rewarded Surik with a rare tie-breaker pazaak card.

Goto had been capturing Vogga's freighters before they could leave the system and being sold to the Hutt allowed T3 to obtain the transponder codes for Vogga's ships and use them on Surik's ship, the Ebon Hawk, to ensure it was captured by Goto and allow her companions to launch a rescue attempt aboard the yacht."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Champ was cocky and sure in his ability to play and win at the game of pazaak.

When Surik managed to beat him three times in a row, he told her to take his \"golden card\" and never come back.
