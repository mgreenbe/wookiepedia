A \"Red Leader in Red 1\" and a \"Gold Leader in Gold 1\" card make up the set. These two cards were available from Decipher's Rebel Leader ambassadors through their appearances at card game tournaments, sci-fi conventions, and assorted hobby shops around the world. The cards were also available through occasional special promotions as well as a mail-in offer by Decipher. They were first produced in the summer of 1996."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The basic play advantage is they give players \"card economy\": when properly used, Rebel Leader cards let players deploy a piloted starship immediately, enabling them to begin exercising in-game strategies much sooner in a match."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
