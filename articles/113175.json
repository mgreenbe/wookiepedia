They were considered an elite team of the Alliance Special Forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reekeene's Roughnecks performed hit-and-run attacks against Imperial assents in the Fakir sector.

The Roughnecks were divided in \"squads\" of four to ten soldiers, one medical droid or officer, and one transport including pilot, co-pilot and ship, with the transport commonly being shared by different squads. Each squad was identified with a color, with the members wearing armpatches of that shade to identify their affiliation (except for support personnel and commanding officers, who wore white armpatches or none). Examples of squads included Blue squad, Green squad and Red squad."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The main headquarters of the Roughnecks was the heavily modified Tsukkian water hauler Home, which was also one of their few ships.

As such, she kept an almost paranoid, while justified, policy of secrecy. The Home was constantly in the move with only Reekeene and her husband and main advisor Mikka knowing the route. Pick-ups were requested by sending a message to one communication satellite, which would then re-send it to five other satellites before the Home could receive it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "General Reekeene herself briefed any squad for any mission, sometimes through a hologram and sometimes assisted by one of her advisors, Santhou Lazith'chika.

Both Lens and Mikka Reekeene had been framed by the Empire with false accusations, but they eventually got free and joined the Rebel Alliance, with Lens, a former mercenary officer, particularly anxious to get revenge; Mikka, an engineer, had less aggressive goals. Along with their alien friend Santhou Lazith'chika, the Reekeenes created the Roughnecks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their main headquarters, Home, had been the property of an Imperial admiral until the Rebels stole it.

The Alliance wanted to deal with the native Anointed People. This mission was so successful that the Anointed People joined the Alliance. At the same time, Reekeene had also assigned at least one special agent, Tay Vanis to perform several recruitment missions, with the goal of increasing the files of the Roughnecks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this point, the Alliance bough a CEC HT-2200 medium freighter and, christening it Reekeene's Retribution, assigned the ship to the Roughnecks. As the Roughnecks wanted a more military-oriented ship, they replaced the ship's cargo bays with more useful rooms such as a medical suite, weapons lockers, and a tactical briefing room complete with a holotank and a direct communications link with Special Forces Command. They also added more sublight drives, retractile short-range missile racks and a rear-mounted hatch so that commandos could leave the ship while still under the cover of the ship's weapons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "General Reekeene then organized \"Operation Retribution\", a military action in which she would distribute the scarce resources of the Roughnecks to attack several Imperial targets at the same time in a strong guerrilla event that would cause, if correctly done, a great damage in little time with the less possible risk for her forces. Her intelligence told her that the Empire had just built a repair and refueling outpost on planet Mycroft, Repair Station M13, with several TIE/LN starfighters protecting it. As a part of Retribution, she ordered some of the Roughnecks to attack a station in a nearby system attracting the fighters, and another team, at the same time, would try to sabotage or damage M13."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once Retribution was over, Reekeene sent a team to the planet Iyuta onboard the Long Shot. The Empire had a communication center there and Reekeene want a listening device on it.

Fortunately, the Empire was outwitted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after this event, General Reekeene was captured by a Imperial scout while she was en route to a meeting of Alliance sectorial commanding officers. The scout took Reekeene to an abandoned garrison on Flankers, where the local sun was going to go nova, and asked for a rescue. The Long Shot discovered Reekeene's plight and hurried to rescue General Reekeene. As the scout and the defenses identified the Long Shot as a Rebel ship, conflict was unavoidable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At a later point, Reekeene's Rougnecks modified the Long Shot to increase the ship's sublight speed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Roughnecks in Thuris sector"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the Roughnecks waged a campaign in Thuris sector against its Imperial commander, Moff Sakai.

Once the raid was complete, one of the Roughneck ships, Reekeene's Retribution, detected intruders onboard.
