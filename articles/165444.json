The droids were used to repair the damage that had been caused to Cato Neimoidia by the Clone Wars and they were fitted with climbing claws and magnetic feet, which allowed them to operate from the undersite of the planet's bridge cities. The Devaronian criminal Warrick Raden obtained two XK-V8 droids and he had them reprogramed to make them serve him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
