Fortuna and the Weequay were thrown into the brig while Jabba and Scuppa were brought before Nampi herself, who deserved the treasure trove aboard Jabba's ship. When Jabba refused to give her the deactivation code for the ship's security system, she had him thrown into the brig as well.

This failed to go as planned, and Nampi ordered Scuppa killed. To Nampi's surprise, Scuppa asked for a warrior's death so he wouldn't disappoint the princess. Smitten, Nampi fell in love with Scuppa and decided to marry him. Seeing a chance for greatness, Scuppa accepted, little knowing that Nampi's species consumed their husbands on their wedding night, a fact Nampi's guards, helping Scuppa prepare for the wedding, failed to mention."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the wedding night, Nampi devoured Scuppa alive.
