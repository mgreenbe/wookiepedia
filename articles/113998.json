The poster depicted the the hands of a Rodian, a protocol droid and a Jawa all pointing toward a Kubaz holding a comlink. Vens' campaign ultimately created such an atmosphere of paranoia and distrust in the sector that inspectors sent by the New Republic attempted to temper her zealousness. Shortly after the Hosnian Cataclysm in the year 34 ABY, Report Imperial Holdouts was one of many pieces of propaganda included in the book A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, although the book was not able to identify who was responsible for the piece's creation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Report Imperial Holdouts was created by Joe Corroney for the reference book Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released on October 25, 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
