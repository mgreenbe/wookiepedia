Also known as the year 11 after the Treaty of Coruscant (ATC), it marked the end of the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire and the renewal of hostilities in the form of the Galactic War. A galaxy-spanning conflict similar to the first, the second war's origins could be traced back to numerous events and proxy wars between the two galactic powers during the previous decade and the early months of the year. Conflicts from the year before such as the Desolator crisis, Plan Zero, and the defection of the Republic's Havoc Squad served to increase the tensions between the Empire and Republic, and open warfare soon broke out in when the planet Balmorra was liberated from Imperial control and the Empire conquered the world of Taris. The freeing of the ancient Jedi Master Revan was the event that finally sparked the Empire into action, marking the end of the Cold War and a return to open conflict."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Events"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Deaths"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
