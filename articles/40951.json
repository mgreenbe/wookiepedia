The work they contracted was generally irregular and for varying cargos to differing destinations, but many spacers considered it better than hauling cargo for the Hutts. The runs called for spacers to transport goods to a specific destination known as a drop point for a set fee and within a set time limit.  Drop point agents commonly worked for other individuals higher up the economic chain, and paid fees based on the tonnage of the cargo, the time in transit and the spacers' hyperdrive rating. Agents typically paid half the fee up front, then issued a voucher to be redeemed at the other end of the run. Vowluss was a Whiphid drop point agent during the Galactic Civil War, working in the Off-Worlders' Quarter on Ropagi II."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
