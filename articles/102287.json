Unaware of exactly who he was working for, Sopil tried to skim some cargo during his runs; when Black Sun found out he was taken to a remote bunker complex on Endor to await a decision on his fate by the local Vigo. News of Sopil's capture soon reached his brother, Reik, who recruited Lando Calrissian and Dash Rendar to assist in a rescue. The rescuers arrived on Endor shortly after the local Vigo and Prince Xizor's assistant, the Human replica droid Guri, traveled to the moon to deal with Sopil and other matters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
