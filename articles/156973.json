During the chase, Vaxx was shot by the Millennium Falcon, piloted by Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo. Vaxx was flung forward into the command cab, where this pilot was flying the vehicle. Smoke began pouring from the cab, and the hauler went into a shallow dive, forcing the hunters to give up the chase."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
