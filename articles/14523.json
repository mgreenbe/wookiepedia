When open conflict between the two organizations became unavoidable, the Legions of Lettow, led by General Xendor and his lover, Arden Lyn, decided to take the fight to Ossus, the remote headquarters of the Jedi, in order to prevent the worlds of the Galactic Republic from being drawn into a potentially bloody war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi, however, repulsed the Lettow attack and pursued the Legionnaires to the Republic-controlled Core Worlds, which was followed by engagements at Chandrila, Brentaal IV, Coruscant, and Metellos. Lyn was eventually placed into a state of stasis that lasted until 4 BBY. In that year, she was awakened by agents of the Galactic Empire, and she mentioned the battle on Ossus in a debriefing, selections of which were filed by Grand Inquisitor Laddinare Torbin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle on Ossus was first mentioned in the 2009 reference book The Essential Atlas, which was authored by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
