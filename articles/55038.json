Shortly after the Battle of Yavin that marked the beginning of 0 ABY, the bounty hunter Takvax and the swoop racer Kuru discovered that the rebel smuggler Han Solo was participating in a swoop race on the planet Rion in the Outer Rim Territories. Takvax enlisted the aid of Glunge and the swoop racer Makta to try and claim the large Imperial bounty on Solo's head, devising a plan that would cause Solo to be sent to a medical center during the race, intending to transport him to the planet Coruscant from there in order to claim the bounty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kuru and Makta initially attempted to force Solo into crashing, but they were unsuccessful. After Makta herself crashed, and Kuru used a turbo-booster to move ahead of Solo in the race, Glunge prepared to shoot the smuggler using a laser-sniper from a nearby roof top. Before he could fire, the Jedi Luke Skywalker\u2014an ally of Solo who had forced Takvax to reveal Glunge's location\u2014interrupted him and destroyed the sniper rifle using his lightsaber. Glunge then attempted to flee, running to a swoop that he had parked nearby, but was knocked out by Skywalker after the Jedi realized he would need the vehicle to save Solo.
