Initially, it was known only to a dozen officials who possessed the very highest clearances. Furthermore, a veil of secrecy covered the body which meant that it did not appear in any government or military data records. This body also did not possess any identification cards and no insignia while performing their duties. They made use of special datacards when possessing information of a sensitive nature. These datacards contained a non-standard encoding which made the cards appear blank when used by a normal datapad. The special datacards were even capable of being erased and reformatted without destroying the special information contained within them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within the agency was a research division known as Alpha Red. The head of the organization took the position of Director. The body also made use of special analysis droids that were tasked with the study of intelligence data."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alpha Blue had its roots in Shadow Operations, a group of operatives overseen by Airen Cracken formed after the Battle of Endor. Shadow Operations performed sabotage, spread disinformation, and where necessary conducted assassinations to exacerbate the tensions between the feuding Imperial warlords, Moffs, Admirals and Advisors that had erupted after Emperor Palpatine's death. During the New Republic's liberation campaign from 4 to 6 ABY, Shadow Operations greatly eased the New Republic's advance to Coruscant by preventing an Imperial reunification."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After witnessing, during the reborn Emperor's campaign, how the New Republic's growing bureaucracy could prevent necessary actions during times of extreme crisis, Chief of State Mon Mothma ordered the creation of Alpha Blue to perform secret intelligence and special operations missions while avoiding the slow moving committees and ministries of government. Shadow Operations formed the core of this new agency, and Admiral Hiram Drayson was placed at the head of the organization and granted wide operational control. Few outside the highest echelons of the New Republic knew of Alpha Blue's existence, and even fewer knew the specifics of its work. The agency kept track of various potential threats and power-wielders, looking beyond the work of New Republic Intelligence to defuse threats before they developed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the onset of the Black Fleet Crisis, Admiral Drayson enlisted the aid of Lando Calrissian after Alpha Blue discovered a number of sightings of the mysterious ghostship known as the Teljkon Vagabond. After briefing him, Drayson dispatched the smuggler to further investigate the find. Alpha Blue was deeply involved in the secret analysis of the first meeting between Viceroy Nil Spaar of the Duskhan League and Chief of State Leia Organa Solo. They later played a key role in gathering intelligence on the Yevetha as well as their Great Purge of the Koornacht Cluster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the Yuuzhan Vong War, Drayson retired from his post and handed the reins to Jan Ors. During the war, Alpha Blue worked with New Republic Intelligence, Lurrian genetic engineers and Chiss scientists to develop Alpha Red."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
