She was one of the most important divinities of nature, and she was associated with rain. According to the legends, the goddess' actions were supervised by Oma-Oma, the chief divinity, and she lived with the rest of the gods in the beautiful underwater city of Ossorus. One of the gigantic stone head left by the long-vanished Elders was interpreted by the Gungans as a representation of Dobbis, and the famous Jar Jar Binks was known to have spent several afternoons sleeping next to that statue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dobbis was first mentioned in the 2000 novel Pirates from Beyond the Sea, the eleventh installment of Star Wars Episode I Adventures.
