ARCHIVE-H charged a variable fee, informed by an inexplicable ability to accurately judge what a client could afford. Low-priority information could typically be acquired for 10-100, while sensitive information, ARCHIVE-H's specialty, could cost as much as a million credits. These fees would be transferred through a maze of secured financial accounts. ARCHIVE-H's high prices were justified by the infochant's nearly perfect success rate in acquiring whatever information a client required."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
