Lomrokk became famous across the Outer Rim Territories for his talent for killing in pit fighting matches. This reputation secured him a position as Jabba's gladiator and personal executioner before the introduction of the rancor creature in Jabba's Palace on the planet Tatooine. According to most, the Gamorrean was responsible for the death of notorious Clantaani criminal Longo Two-Guns."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A former warlord, the Gamorrean male Lomrokk at one point was deposed of his position and turned to pit fighting, which earned him a reputation across the Outer Rim Territories for his killing prowess. His reputation was heightened after he slew a gundark, a large and semi-sentient four-armed anthropoid known for its incredible strength. The Gamorrean was then hired by Jabba Desilijic Tiure, one of the most notorious Hutt crime lords in the galaxy. Lomrokk joined Jabba's criminal empire as the Hutt's personal gladiator and main executioner at the Hutt Castle, which was located in the Northern Dune Sea of the desert planet Tatooine. The former warlord's employment in Jabba's castle occurred before the introduction of the rancor, a large Dathomiri reptomammal that the Hutt used to dispose of his enemies, which took place between 0 BBY and 4 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 32 BBY, Jabba placed a 50,000 bounty on the head of Clantaani criminal Longo Two-Guns, known to some as the \"fastest blaster on Tatooine.\" Bounty hunter Jango Fett then captured Longo and brought him to the Hutt. After that, the most accepted version of his death was that Jabba then threw Longo down the shaft that led to the fighting pit, where Lomrokk was expected to execute the gangster. The Gamorrean initially punched Longo Two-Guns, sending him flying across the pit, and then, under Jabba's command, Lomrokk axed and killed the Clantaani."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lomrokk was a ruthless, dark-green-skinned Gamorrean, more physically imposing and intelligent than most members of his species. He also stood two heads taller than the Gamorrean average of 1.8 meters and bore many battle scars, gashed across his fat and muscled body. Lomrokk wielded a giant battleaxe, with which he was made famous in the Outer Rim for his killing skills, exterminating every creature he had met in combat. Longo Two-Guns, one of his victims, noticed a particularly cruel intellect behind Lomrokk's eyes, something that Longo had never seen before. Lomrokk worked topless, wearing furred shorts and a belt, as well as shoulder pads and bracelets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lomrokk was created for a short story as Longo Two-Guns's executioner in the non-canon 2012 Star Wars Mythos project, an initiative of Sideshow Collectibles. The narrative was published online on Sideshow's website. Star Wars Mythos further elaborates on the story of Longo Two-Guns, which originated with the 2002 video game Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, while also introducing the Gamorrean character Lomrokk. The project also included the production of a nineteen-inch tall polystone statue of the executioner, the third in a series of five characters that were commissioned."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The general style and aesthetics of Lomrokk's illustration were inspired by forms often seen in the barbarian paintings of science-fiction artist Frank Frazetta. The tauntaun skull, featured in the concept art sketches and the final statue model, was added in order to allude to the Colosseum in Italy and its gladiatorial fights in Ancient Rome. Involved in the making of Lomrokk were artists Tom Gilliland and Seth Rinaldi, designer David Igo, sculptor Michael Norman, and painters Anthony Mestas, Steve Riojas, Jesse Lincoln, and Ian MacDonald."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lomrokk was mentioned again in the first part of The Official Star Wars Blog series \"So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in Star Wars,\" written by Ed Erdelac and released on September 19, 2013.
