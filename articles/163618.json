Janson first joined the Alliance prior to the Battle of Yavin, but contracted an illness that prevented him from flying in that engagement. He later served with Rogue Squadron, the Rebellion's most elite starfighter squadron. As a key member of the Rogues, he fought at the battles of Hoth and Endor, among others. After Endor, Janson flew in multiple engagements as part of Rogue Squadron, including covering the defection of Imperial Grand Vizier Sate Pestage. Following that mission, Rogue Squadron was temporarily disbanded and Janson, along with his good friend Derek Klivian, were assigned to train new pilots. He would later go on to serve with Wraith Squadron, the New Republic's pilot/commando unit. Janson was the first executive officer of the squadron and saw action both in space and on the ground during commando missions against Warlord Zsinj. After Zsinj was defeated, Janson transferred back to Rogue Squadron. Janson eventually reached the rank of Major after years of service fighting against the Galactic Empire, including in campaigns against Prince-Admiral Delak Krennel and Grand Admiral Thrawn, as well as a diplomatic mission to Adumar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Janson retired from active service after the end of the Galactic Civil War, but returned to serve the New Republic by leading a group of volunteers during the Yuuzhan Vong War. The Yellow Aces were heavily involved at the Battle of Borleias, garnering a reputation as an elite unit. After the Yuuzhan Vong surrender, Janson retired again, but peace was fleeting. He would once again return to combat in the Second Galactic Civil War, joining Rakehell Squadron in support of Luke Skywalker's insurgency against Jacen Solo, who had fallen to the dark side.

The group was based out of the Tierfon Rebel Base. The aim of the Yellow Aces was to engage pilots in technically \"active\" missions, but to avoid pitting them against too hazardous of a situation in preparation for more dangerous duties in the future."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a member of the Yellow Aces, Janson racked up an impressive kill record and earned a tremendous reputation. However, it was on one of his first missions with them that Janson was faced with a difficult decision. The Yellow Aces were tasked with ambushing an Imperial convoy carrying supplies that the Alliance needed badly. When the convoy arrived at their destination, its armed escort was larger than anticipated. One pilot, Kissek Doran, was suddenly struck with panic and tried to leave the group. With the prospect of compromising the entire ambush party if he was detected by the Imperials, Janson and Jek Tono Porkins were ordered to bring him back. Since using his ion cannon would give away their position, Janson was forced to use his lasers, destroying the fleeing pilot\u2014it was his first kill."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nevertheless, Janson's service with the Yellow Aces was considered exemplary. He was quickly promoted to Lieutenant and was awarded the rank of True Gunner for \"consistent excellence and superior performance as an officer and a gunner,\" according to General Jan Dodonna at a Tierfon Fighter Base awards ceremony. While with the Yellow Aces, Janson formed a strong friendship with Porkins, nicknamed \"Piggy.\" Coming out of the same training class, they quickly bonded. Janson would often recall some rather tall tales of their days together at Tierfon. He also met Tomer Darpen in the squadron, whom he would later encounter on Adumar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the destruction of Alderaan and the threat of the Death Star, the Yellow Aces were placed on \"full active\" duty. An emergency list was compiled of pilots who would be transferred to Yavin Base. Wes Janson was on that list. However, at the time of the transfer, Janson was stricken with Hesken Fever, having contracted it while on a scouting mission, and was unable to go. Even though the ailing Janson firmly insisted on his ability to fly, a replacement was named to fill his slot on the transfer list. That someone was Jek Porkins. Porkins never returned from the assault on the Death Star, and Janson often blamed himself for the death of his friend. From that point forward, he vowed to fly to honor his fallen friend. Future heroics would help alleviate some of the guilt and pain he carried with him."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Joining Rogue Squadron"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wes Janson was among the first crop of pilots to join the new Rogue Flight under the command of Rebel pilot and aspiring Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker after the destruction of the Death Star. With the Rogues, Janson was permanently assigned to the roving Alliance High Command group. He performed well in several skirmishes during the Thila evacuation, helping Rogue Flight prove their worth. Six months after Yavin, he participated in the campaign against Moff Kohl Seerdon, including action at the Raid on Balmorra, where he helped to cripple the Empire's production of AT-AT walkers for some time; and the Second Battle of Thyferra, which saw the death of Seerdon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a member of the Rogues, Janson became immediate friends with fellow pilot Wedge Antilles. The two would often fly as one another's wingman.

The two also shared numerous interests, including a mutual appreciation for both Corellian ale and sabacc."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On one mission, while scouting for a new Rebel base location, Janson and the rest of the Rogues were on Kwenn Space Station. After they observed the Empire taking over a freighter, the Stellar Manx, the Rogues decided to investigate. Three pilots, Wedge Antilles, Tycho Celchu, and Janson, disguised themselves and entered Hangar 872-H. While viewing the Stellar Manx, they were confronted by a group of stormtroopers. The three Rebel pilots evaded the troopers and eventually liberated the crew of the freighter from Imperial custody, as well as capturing the ship itself. During this operation, they discovered that the Stellar Manx was on a secret mission bound for Bonadan to meet with Frap Radicon to research gravity well technology. This plan was later disrupted by the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Janson also flew a T-47 airspeeder on a terrestrial mission alongside Antilles some time after the Battle of Yavin.

Due to his renowned gunnery abilities and the supplement of pilots serving with Rogue Group to operate their two-seated T-47 airspeeders, Janson was assigned to be Antilles' rear gunner. When the Empire located Echo Base and launched a subsequent assault in 3 ABY, Janson and Antilles were able to bring down the first AT-AT walker during the battle, employing a tactic that involved using the speeder's harpoon and tow cable to trip the walker's legs. Their snowspeeder was shot down during the battle, though Janson and Antilles suffered no major injuries. They abandoned their craft and made it safely back to the base where they prepared to evacuate. Janson then manned the rear gunner position of a BTL-S3 Y-wing starfighter, with fellow Rogue Derek \"Hobbie\" Klivian at the controls, for the run through the Imperial blockade of the planet. Along with Antilles and Skywalker in their X-wings, the three ships ingeniously used the Tallon split to help the GR-75 medium transport Thon's Orchard escape into hyperspace. From there, Janson regrouped with the rest of the Rogues at the secret rendezvous point.\nAntilles would later tell new recruits about him and Janson being stranded on Hoth for months, with Janson eventually being slain at the hands of scavengers, only to have Janson emerge, alive and well."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Helping the search for Solo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa's attempt to rescue Han Solo from the bounty hunter Boba Fett, Janson, as part of Rogue Squadron, was based on the moon of Kile at a temporary facility set up for them.

Recovering from the assault, the Rogues counter-attacked and pursued Imperial General Weir. Weir, however, escaped Corellia after capturing Numb. Janson, Antilles, and Skywalker pursued Weir on speeder bikes, but Weir managed to escape on a transport. Celchu and the R2 units brought the pilots their craft and the Rogues pursued the fleeing general. Distracted by a suicide fighter attack on a civilian convoy, Rogue Squadron was delayed long enough for Weir to flee to Tralus, but Skywalker, Janson, and the others followed them into Tralus's tunnels. With the aid of native Selonians, the Rogues tracked down Weir's base and attacked it in an attempt to save Numb. Janson and R2-D2, splitting up from the others, were able to find Numb, but the Sullustan pilot had already been killed.

Spending the first few days or so in a Mrlssti hospital, Janson was present when a warrant was issued for their arrest after they were implicated in stealing the datacards of the Phantom Project, an experimental weapon desired by both the Empire and Rebellion, though the datacard was actually a fake. Breaking out of the hospital on the repulsor bed and still clad in pajamas, Janson, accompanied by several other Rogue pilots, Groznik, and smuggler Mirax Terrik, made their way out of the city, chased by Imperials.

Janson's group went to a local cantina on Nep's recommendation, which Janson later reflected was a bad idea\u2014he thought the band was awful, Ilo got into a barfight, and the group was kicked out. Outside of the cantina, the group was hired by a Devaronian to cause some trouble at a local ranch, but without bloodshed, since his original employees had been beaten by Ilo. Janson agreed, for the price of eight hundred credits, over Ilo's objections, having noticed the man's military-grade blaster. Janson wanted to play along until he could determine what the Devaronian was actually planning, not knowing that the target was the Darklighter farm where Antilles, Celchu, Loro, and Winter were.

The defensive action at Borleias allowed the New Republic to reorganize itself after a series of defeats and a new government dubbed the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances was formed, unifying much of the galaxy to combat the Yuuzhan Vong."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At Selvaris, some four years into the war, Janson and the Yellow Aces helped the Galactic Alliance liberate captured troops from the turncoat Peace Brigade and the Yuuzhan Vong. Janson's squadron was tasked with destroying the forward gunships of the prisoner convoy. The prisoner transports were quickly secured and Janson's squad shifted to an escort role, protecting the transports as Yuuzhan Vong reinforcements arrived in the form of advanced stingcrawler fighters, which easily punched through the Galactic Alliance lines and inflicted heavy damage. The Aces suffered casualties from their assault, but managed to escape with most of the transports. Janson and the Aces went on to participate in the Recapture of Coruscant, with his squadron helping escort the initial wave of troop transports to touch down on the galactic capital. When one transport was attacked by grutchin creatures and went out of control, the Yellow Aces followed it down to the surface, using their lasers to pick off the grutchins, but were unsuccessful in saving it. The Galactic Alliance was ultimately successful in retaking the planet and forcing the capitulation of the Yuuzhan Vong, ending the war."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Second Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 40 ABY, war broke out again as numerous star systems seceded from the Galactic Alliance to form the Confederation, resulting in the Second Galactic Civil War. During the war, Jacen Solo fell to the dark side of the Force and seized power in the Galactic Alliance, resulting in a schism between the New Jedi Order and the Galactic Alliance. As the Jedi and their Hapan allies formulated plans to neutralize Solo, now styling himself \"Darth Caedus,\" Caedus responded by kidnapping the daughter of the Queen of Hapes. To prevent her from being held hostage, Luke Skywalker devised a mission that would both free the young Hapan princess Allana as well as neutralize the Centerpoint Station weapon, which the Galactic Alliance sought to seize."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Janson was one of many veteran pilots recruited by Wedge Antilles to support Luke Skywalker's combined mission, meeting with Skywalker on Endor and learning of the Jedi's intention to free Allana. Janson flew with the other pilots in Rakehell Squadron as Rakehell Twelve during the operation to destroy Centerpoint Station and rescue Allana. Upon arrival in the Corellia system, the Rakehells first flew cover for the infiltration team that boarded Solo's flagship by pretending to chase a shuttle containing the boarding party into its hangar bay."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rakehells then repeated their procedure on a second shuttle, faking a chase that led to the subsequent insertion of a second Jedi-led team onto Centerpoint Station. Galactic Alliance fighters rose to challenge the Rakehells at that point, leading to the Janson battling against his former unit of Rogue Squadron. Both squadrons inflicted casualties on each other, but as a Confederation assault force arrived to contest Centerpoint Station, the Rogues were called to respond, leaving the Rakehells unengaged. Once Allana was rescued, the Rakehells then flew cover for the Millennium Falcon extracting the boarding party from Solo's ship by distracting hostile gunners with their strafing runs. Furthermore, the other sabotage party was successful in destroying Centerpoint Station, resulting in a total success for the Jedi faction in the battle. The Rakehells and their accompanying transports then withdrew to a space station orbiting Gyndine. Janson survived the battle and the Jedi ultimately slew Caedus not long afterward to end the war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Janson had dark brown hair, brown eyes, and stood at a height of 1.7 meters. He was regarded as a joker, despite being a lethal opponent, being particularly accurate with blaster pistols and starfighter-grade weaponry. According to Skywalker, Janson was only truly happy when he was manning the guns of a Y-wing or an airspeeder. He was known for having a short temper, often having to be pulled out of cantina fights. Janson was described as observant, using what he noticed as fodder for his witty remarks, mockery, or jokes. He was generally cheerful and light-hearted, even in the face of opposition or boredom."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Janson also considered himself a ladies' man, frequently seeking the attention of women he considered attractive. His flirtatious nature was amplified by a dark side temple on Malrev IV, leading to his solicitation of a female Bothan. Janson's casual flirtations also led to him accidentally trying to attract the attention of Jaina Solo\u2014he was shocked when he learned of her identity and regretted his pursuit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He enjoyed playing pranks on his fellow squad mates. He believed in having fun today, because tomorrow might not come. During his time in Wraith Squadron, he developed the character Lieutenant Kettch, a fictional Ewok starfighter pilot. Kettch became a recurring theme in Janson's pranks. This originated when he claimed that a candidate for Wraith Squadron was an Ewok, and then it circulated among the Wraiths, including the time Wraith slicer Castin Donn reprogrammed Antilles' TIE Interceptor to make his voice sound like an Ewok. This led to Antilles being forced to fly into battle, against Imperial forces, while wearing a stuffed Ewok in his lap. When the stuffed Ewok doll started showing up everywhere and appeared to move on its own, Antilles attached a transponder to it, leading to the discovery that Janson was placing the doll in those places. The Wraiths got back at Janson by convincing him that the real Kettch had gotten loose and he had to strip naked and cover himself in Ewok food to find and recapture it. The joke only ended when Lara Notsil found a real Ewok that fit Kettch's description exactly. She found this hilarious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to his mischievous nature, Janson was not considered suitable to leave behind on the ground on Adumar to conduct sensitive diplomatic negotiations by Antilles. However, Janson was loyal to his friends and fellow pilots despite any good-natured grumbling or teasing he gave them when they needed his help. Janson was willing to keep watch all night long for Antilles during a covert rendezvous between Antilles and Iella Wessiri, and also placed his life at risk in order to save both Antilles and Cheriss ke Hanadi from possibly fatal injuries by engaging in a blastsword duel against an experienced duelist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Janson did have a serious side though, that exhibited itself through grim, angry determination. It didn't come out often, but Janson apparently was in this mood when fighting or flying against an enemy of his. Janson also abandoned his typical jesting nature when discussing the incident where he was forced to kill fellow Rebel pilot Kissek Doran. Janson likewise displayed his serious side in a series of interactions with Doran's son, Kell Tainer, which ultimately led to the resolution of the conflict between them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his career as a pilot and soldier, Janson was noted for his bravery, particularly during commando missions. Kell Tainer noted that Janson could probably make a fort out of all his bravery commendations. During ground combat, Janson was calm and controlled under fire, using his blaster skills to good effect or placing charges to destroy key facilities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Post-retirement, Janson developed a sense of responsibility and initiative when he found, trained, and commanded the volunteer fighter squadron Taanab Yellow Aces. Janson remained with the squadron for over two years of the Yuuzhan Vong War, ruefully citing his responsibility to them as reason enough to remain with the squadron instead of transferring back into Rogue Squadron. His light-hearted and playful side remained, but Janson was still a skilled-enough pilot and trainer that his squadron was considered an elite unit alongside Rogue and Twin Suns Squadrons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Janson only had a few moments of screen time in Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, his character received considerable attention in the Expanded Universe, as he was featured extensively in the X-Wing: Rogue Squadron comics, novels in the X-wing series, as well as several later EU novels.

In the latter two novels, Allston brought Janson's character into the New Jedi Order and Legacy eras with small cameos, while he played a larger role in the three Wraith Squadron books.

During filming of The Empire Strikes Back, a call was put out for an actor, not an extra, to play an AT-AT gunner. That was Liston's original role in the film, but he was later asked by an assistant director with whom Liston had previously worked to take the role of Janson since the original actor had fallen ill. Thus he ironically played both an Imperial and a Rebel, and in one sequence of the film is in effect trying to shoot himself down. Regarding his scenes as Janson with Wedge Antilles, Liston revealed in 2005 that the two actors were never actually on set together\u2014Liston's double took his place when the scene focused on Denis Lawson (Antilles) and vice versa.
