Early in her reign, Padm\u00e9 Amidala and her handmaidens used a short trip to and from the library as a test to see if the guards could be fooled by the queen switching places with one of the handmaidens as a decoy. Later, Amidala and Rab\u00e9 exited via the library window, using a grappling hook, when the queen and most of her handmaidens went to a Neurotransmitter Affection concert at the Theed Odeon incognito."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
