Elee was a small and hairy quadruped, and the gentlest creature Salju had ever met. She kept it as a pet on Batuu until Elee grew too big and was moved to live with a family of her own kind in the Surabat River Valley. When Salju ran Black Spire Station during the war between the First Order and the Resistance, she often visited Elee and they played as they did when they were young."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Elee was first mentioned in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, which opened to guests at Disneyland Park on May 31.
