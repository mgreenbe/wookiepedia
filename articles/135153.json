Prior to the Battle of Atraken during the Clone Wars, it served as the primary starport for the lunar mining operations. With the arrival of refugees from Atraken and the establishment of a larger Atrakenite civilization on Trilos, the spaceport fell into disuse, with only free-traders utilizing it. Two Atrakenite light freighters, Atraken Hope and Atraken Memory, were berthed at the port. Starport Touchdown was linked to New Atraken City via access paths."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
