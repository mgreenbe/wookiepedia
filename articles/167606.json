In 0 ABY, it was assigned to be the escort frigate of the Star Galleon-class frigate Emperor's Will as the treasure ship traveled to the planet Esseles. However, on the way there, both the Zaff Jendinpurg and its charge were suddenly brought out of hyperspace by asteroids that had been dragged in front of their course by the Far Orbit, a Nebulon-B privateer vessel serving the Rebel Alliance. The Far Orbit quickly dispatched the Zaff Jendinpurg before seizing the Emperor's Will's valuable cargo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Zaff Jendinpurg was an EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate produced by Kuat Drive Yards. Measuring 300 meters in length, the escort frigate was equipped with a hyperdrive, a deflector shield generator, and had an armament consisting of twelve turbolaser cannons, a dozen laser cannons, and a pair of tractor beam generators. The Zaff Jendinpurg also had a complement of twenty-four starfighters. Additionally, it had braking thrusters and multiple engines."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As of 0 ABY, when the Galactic Empire was fighting the Alliance to Restore the Republic in the Galactic Civil War, the Zaff Jendinpurg was a vessel owned by the Empire. That year, it was assigned to guard the treasure-bearing Star Galleon-class frigate Emperor's Will as it traveled from the Arkanis sector to the planet Esseles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, on the way to Esseles, both the Zaff Jendinpurg and its charge were abruptly pulled from hyperspace to realspace because a few asteroids had blocked their course. The Alliance Nebulon-B privateer frigate Far Orbit had dragged the asteroids there with the intention of capturing the Emperor's Will's cargo after an informant provided the privateers with the Star Galleon's route. The sudden departure from hyperspace damaged the Zaff Jendinpurg and caused it to veer wildly. The Far Orbit took both Imperial ships by surprise, allowing the privateers to gain an advantage as they moved to engage their targets. However, despite launching its complement of fighters and firing upon the Far Orbit with its cannons, the Zaff Jendinpurg succumbed to the privateering ship's fire, and it was destroyed. The Far Orbit proceeded to disable the Emperor's Will and steal its cargo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Zaff Jendinpurg was first mentioned in Raid on Brentaal, an adventure scenario in 1998's The Far Orbit Project, by Timothy S. O'Brien. The ship first appeared in The Grand Prize, another scenario published in The Far Orbit Project. The book was a supplement to West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game and had the same theme of the previous publication, Pirates & Privateers, as it followed the privateering vessel Far Orbit. In The Grand Prize, gamemasters can choose whether the Zaff Jendinpurg is heavily or lightly damaged by the reversion to realspace caused by the asteroids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
