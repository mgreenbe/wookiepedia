The Imperial base possessed strong anti-air defenses. A Rebel strike team was sent to the planet, but due to the team's large numbers, it was soon discovered and captured by the Empire. When the Alliance learned about the mission's failure, they organized a rescue operation to liberate the captured unit. This time, however, the Rebellion took heed of its mistake and dispatched a much smaller force, consisting only of Jedi Master Rahm Kota and the Force-sensitive clone X2. The two of them successfully liberated the prisoners, and the surviving members of the strike team were reorganized into Grey Squadron under X2's command."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This mission was alluded to in the Nintendo DS edition of the 2009 video game Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
