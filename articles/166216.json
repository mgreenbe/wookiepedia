The aleudrupe plant was introduced to the Great Jungle on the planet Varonat on the Ison Corridor sometime before 7 ABY. The Krish crime lord Gamgalon found that when the soil the plant was growing in was covered by the slime trail of the native Morodin, the pips of the plant's berries underwent a chemical change. These altered pips, when combined with rethan-K and promhassic triaxli, acted as a catalyst to create a blaster formulation as powered as spin-sealed Tibanna gas. All three components were perfectly legal and did not raise flags with customs officials, allowing them to be shipped to planets without arousing suspicions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gamgalon began growing the plants along the Morodin' slime trailss, marking the positions of the plantings with transpond markers for later harvesting. To cover their operation in Varonat's Great Jungle, Gamgalon established a safari hunting the Morodin, and bribed the local Imperial governor to turn a blind eye to his operations. The smuggler Talon Karrde uncovered Gamgalon's activities in 8 ABY, and during his encounter with the Krish, Gamgalon ended up dead, and Karrde left the operation in ruins."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yagaran aleudrupe plant first appeared in Timothy Zahn's First Contact, which was published in 1994's Star Wars Adventure Journal 1 by West End Games.
