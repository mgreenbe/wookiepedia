While this policy was carried out ostensibly to boost the planet's economy, it also sought to crack down on the activities of black market traders. This segment was accompanied by a hologram of the crime lord Cikatro Vizago and his two IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droids. Participating residents were also entitled to participate in the Galactic Farm Exchange, a new government program to compensate people for selling their lands to the Empire. Kastle then urged his listeners to contact their local government office for more details. He ended the report by signing off his name and telling his listeners that HoloNet News was the only news that mattered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
