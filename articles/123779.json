An astromech droid named T7-O1 served as the ship's navigator but, because he never entered the cargo hold where Shafu's \"goods\" were kept, the droid was unaware that Shafu was a slaver. Sometime before 3681 BBY, the Jedi Master Ven Zallow tracked down Shafu; however, instead of killing or arresting him, Zallow convinced Shafu to reform, and the smuggler became an undercover agent for the Jedi. Shafu used his ship in that capacity for decades until 3653 BBY, when Shafu's investigations into an Imperial spy network led the bounty hunter Terrin Sandafar to kill the Rodian. Sandafar sabotaged Shafu's ship over the moon Nar Shaddaa, causing it to explode and kill Shafu. Though his death was ruled accidental, years later, T7-O1 learned of Shafu's death and resumed his friend's investigation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shafu's ship was first mentioned in a number of conversations with the Jedi Knight class companion T7-O1 in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
