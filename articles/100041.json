They were sometimes mistaken for plants, such as the pom petal, which they ate. This was due to their large, flat heads that resembled the leaves of some aquatic plants, as well as their fur and a series of long, bloom-like hair tendrils. Their underside featured gnawing teeth, three pairs of clawed limbs that operated more as paddles, green fur, and a fluked tail. Their eyes were light brown, while their skin was pink and yellow with purple spots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime during the war between the First Order and the Resistance, the Ithorian collector Dok-Ondar kept a pet ollopom named Ollie in a small tank in his store, Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities, in Black Spire Outpost on the planet Batuu.
