The officers attempted to relay the information, but Gregg interfered by pointing his blaster at one of the officers, informing them that Vader had ordered him to ensure that no interferences were made to Vader's mission, not even to aid him. The officers then witnessed the blaze shortly thereafter, causing them to believe Vader had been killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
