Following the escape from Caamas, Stazi became the leader of the Galactic Alliance Remnant. He served as its Supreme Commander and led the Alliance from the bridge of his personal flagship, the Scythe-class battle cruiser Indomitable.

Following these victories, Stazi's forces continued to be active in numerous engagements, including a joint operation with Roan Fel's forces at Ralltiir and the massive evacuation of Dac.

Later, Admiral Stazi and the Imperial Knight Master Yalta Val led a Triumvirate task force to liberate enslaved Mon Calamari and Quarren refugees in the Mon Calamari Shipyards, who had come under the thralldom of another Sith Darth Luft and his pirate associates.

The group encountered a elderly Dimok matriarch, who was interviewed the Coruscant News Net journalists. At first, the old Dimok professed a desire for peace so that her grandchildren could have a brighter future. However, when pressed by the Tynnan diplomat as to whether she would give a small parcel of her land to the Ripoblus to settle an old dispute, the old Dimok woman went into a rage and proclaimed she would sooner die before giving up even a small piece of her land.

Enraged by the apparent Yuuzhan Vong betrayal and desirous of a return to the glory days of the old Empire, the Moff Council forced Galactic Emperor Roan Fel to declare war on the Galactic Alliance.

Stazi chose to directly represent the Alliance Remnant during a meeting held on the space station known as the Wheel.

Furthermore, Stazi pointed out that both the Alliance Remnant and Fel's forces were often competing for the same scarce resources. However, the revelation that Fel had captured Bastion convinced the admiral that discussions of an alliance were valuable.

It was while searching for Skywalker on the Wheel that Calixte discovered the meeting between Stazi and Bovark.

His experiences at Caamas and subsequent years-on-the-run had ingrained deep Imperial suspicion within his heart. Revealing a vibro-shiv he had managed to hide in his sleeve, Stazi thrust his blade at Bovark. However, the timely arrival of Bovark's bodyguard, Imperial Knight Antares Draco, prevented Stazi from seriously harming Fel's ambassador.

Rogue Squadron pilot Monia Gahan provided intelligence on the Imperious, courtesy of her uncle, former Triumvir and longtime friend of Stazi, Gial Gahan. Gahan had been supplying the Alliance with mat\u00e9riel ever since the end of the Sith-Imperial War. His plan was to access the central computer of the shipyard's defensive systems and shut them down, moments before Stazi's fleet appeared. This would allow Alliance commandos to board the Imperious, disable its skeleton crew, and flee the system before any Imperial forces could arrive.

With both fronts of Stazi's plan foiled, it appeared to Valan that Stazi and his fleet were trapped between the defensive systems on Mon Calamari and the Imperial fleet.

Angered by the audacity shown by Stazi, Valan ordered all of his forces to converge on the Indomitable.

Still lying wounded on the bridge, Yorub begged Stazi to escape, saying that the admiral was more than a typical officer\u2014he was a living symbol for the Alliance. The Duros refused to budge, however, arguing that his life was no more important than any other Alliance officer. Taking matters into his own hands, Bey knocked Stazi unconscious at Yorub's behest.

Realizing his obsession with Stazi cost the Empire the battle, Valan considered suicide his only option. Later, at the rendezvous point, Stazi confronted Bey on his actions during the battle, but instead of punishing him, he promoted him to his second-in-command.

Dare and fellow Knight Treis Sinde had sabotaged the Imperious prior to Stazi's capture of it, and during the massacre of New Coral City, they had rescued the Alliance pilots in an effort to reach Stazi and warn him of the explosives they had planted. The bombs were disarmed, and Monia Gahan broke up a tense moment between Stazi and Dare by pointing out the need to work together. Stazi realized that the Sith were the greatest threat to the safety of the galaxy.

Due to its strategic and financial importance, the Sith Empire had deployed the Coruscant Third Fleet to defend the world. The Third Fleet was also aided by extensive anti-ship ion cannon batteries deployed on several of Ralltiir's moons. The objective of the operation was twofold. First, the loss of a key battle fleet would force the Empire to redeploy another fleet, thereby stretching their naval forces even further. Second, that efforts would be taken to capture the bulk of the Third fleet intact, with the surviving ships being equally split between the GA and Fel.

The late arrival of Admiral Fenel and the Second Fleet was viewed poorly by Stazi. When questioned on the late arrival of the Second Fleet, Fenel attempted to goad Stazi into an argument by insinuating that the Alliance admiral's only claim to fame was retreating from battle.

When Fenel ordered his Predator squadrons to attack the Steadfast, the GA fleet unleashed a barrage of cover fire and forced the fighters to return to Bastion Second Fleet. On the bridge of the Alliance, Stazi received a communication from Roan Fel. The admiral confronted Fel over his decision to send Fenel to the battle, stating that it was nothing more than a move to \"test\" Stazi's commitment to an alliance.

Stazi learned that large numbers of Mon Cal refugees had secretly fled to Da Soocha, in the Cyax system of Hutt Space, as they had over a 130 years prior to during the World Devastator attacks on Dac. Alliance Intelligence had learned that the Sith had not yet attacked the system, which Stazi felt was intentional so that Imperial forces track the escaped refugees back to the Alliance fleet. Azzim Anjiliac Atirue, a Hutt ally of the GA, owned a high end spa on one of Da Soocha's moons, Napdu. Disgusted by the Sith genocide and sympathetic to the Alliance, Azzim allowed many Mon Cal refugees to secretly hide in Napdu's oceans. Stazi's second in command, Captain Jhoram Bey, dispatched Rogue Squadron to Napdu to assist the Mon Cal refugees to escape back to the safety of the Alliance fleet.
