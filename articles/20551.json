By standing at the edge of the Gorge of Fire and letting the suns rays shine through the crystal, one could form a Rainbow Bridge over it. Through unknown means, the rainbow managed to support people walking on it, making it usable as a bridge to the other end of the otherwise impenetrable Gorge. If the sun stopped shining, the rainbow would disappear."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chief Chirpa had stolen the crystal from the Ogre Gantu in his youth.
