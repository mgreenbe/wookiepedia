The position was created specifically in response to the violent and volatile civil war that had broken out on the Core World of Alderaan and was designed to ensure that the Republic's support of the noble House of Organa was handled with strategic and political professionalism. Around 3643 BBY, near the end of the Cold War, the role was filled by Republic Army colonel Jace Malcom, who had helped to defend Alderaan against a Sith invasion several decades prior."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
