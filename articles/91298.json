While his Padawan, Anakin Skywalker, was given an assignment by the Council to protect Amidala on Naboo, Kenobi went to see his old friend, the Besalisk Dexter Jettster who was nicknamed Dex\u2014in Dex's Diner in order to find more information about a toxic dart that was taken from the body of Zam Wesell, who had been shot with the dart and killed before she could release information about the assassination plot. Dex told Kenobi that the dart belonged to the Kaminoans, a species who lived beyond the Outer Rim Territories. After he left the diner, Kenobi, with the assistance of Librarian Jocasta Nu, used the Jedi Archives to find the planet of Kamino, which was missing from the archives for unknown reasons, suggesting that it didn't exist. Troubled, Kenobi decided to discuss the issue with Jedi Yoda."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Jedi Temple, Yoda was instructing a group of younglings, which one of them suggested that Kamino had been erased from the archives, and Yoda told Kenobi to travel to the coordinates. Kenobi found Kamino where the coordinates said it should be, near the Rishi Maze. He landed on the rainy, ocean planet and was greeted by Kaminoan Taun We, who took Kenobi to Lama Su, the Prime Minister of Kamino. Su told Kenobi about a clone army that they had created for the Galactic Republic and to tell the Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas that the order will be shipped on schedule, confusing Kenobi as the Jedi Master had been dead for a decade. The two Kaminoans revealed that the host was a bounty hunter named Jango Fett. Taun We took Kenobi to Fett's living quarters in the capital, Tipoca City. Fett's genetically unaltered clone child, Boba Fett, allowed Taun We and the Jedi to enter. Jango soon approached the group, and We introduced the Jedi. Kenobi subtly interrogated Fett about the plot to assassinate Amidala, but Fett did not reveal any information. Fett, however, told Boba to close a closet door which contained his Mandalorian armor before answering his questions. He also denied knowledge of Sifo-Dyas, stating that he had been recruited by a man named Tyranus. As We and Kenobi exited Fett's quarters, Fett and his son prepared to leave Kamino immediately. Kenobi contacted Yoda and Jedi Master Mace Windu, who asked if the Kaminoans were involved in the assassination attempts but Kenobi disregarded this after he reported his discoveries, including that Sifo-Dyas had somehow managed to order a clone army for the Republic despite being long dead. Yoda ordered that he bring Fett back to Coruscant for further investigation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Duel"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While loading cargo onto the Slave I, Kenobi ran out onto the landing platform where Slave I was docked. Kenobi's presence alerted young Boba, who shouted to his father that the Kenobi had found them. Kenobi ignited his lightsaber, which forced Fett to pull out his twin WESTAR-34 blaster pistols and open fire on the him who was able to deflected the blaster fire, forcing the bounty hunter to ignite his jetpack and hide himself on top of a lighting fixture who fired the jetpack's missile at the Jedi that exploded nearby, causing Kenobi to lose his lightsaber. Inside Slave I's; Boba activated the starship's heavy twin blaster cannons and fired towards Kenobi. The shots hit nearby, and Kenobi was thrown backwards across the platform. Jango reemerged from the fixture and flew towards Kenobi, who Force jumped and kicked Fett, knocking the bounty hunter to the ground, and causing him to loose both of his blasters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the two engaged in hand-to-hand combat, Jango tried to grab onto the Jedi. With a quick kick at the bounty hunter's helmet, Jango was forced to release Kenobi. Upon regaining his feet, Fett stood up and headbutted Kenobi with his helmet, causing Kenobi to fall back onto the platform. The Jedi noticed his lightsaber near the edge of the platform and tried to call it to him. Jango shot his whipcord launcher at the Jedi, and the cord wrapped around the Jedi's outstretched hand and yanked him away from his lightsaber, dragging him across the platform."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi tangled the whipcord around a lighting fixture, causing Jango to crash onto the platform. The jetpack was released from his armor and exploded nearby. Standing up, the bounty hunter grabbed onto one of his fallen blasters and fired at Kenobi, who was running towards Jango. Kenobi kicked Jango off the platform, and then realized that he was still connected to the whipcord around his hands. Kenobi was flipped onto the side of the platform and slid down towards Jango. Desperate to save his life, Jango activated a series of grappling tools on his arm and dug them into the platform to slow down his fall. Kenobi, however, slid past Jango and off over the edge of the platform, where he dangled, held by the whipcord. As Jango's grappling tools were failing due to the added weight, Jango released the whipcord, causing Kenobi to freefall down towards the ocean. Using the Force, Kenobi managed to throw the cord and attach it onto a structure below the platform. After making sure that the Jedi was nowhere to be seen, Jango used his grappling tools to crawl back to the top of the platform. Meanwhile, Kenobi flipped onto a ramp and reentered the city to catch up to Jango, who was boarding Slave I. Kenobi reemerged onto the platform and quickly recovered his lightsaber. Both Fetts, however, were aboard Slave I, which was now lifting off, and Kenobi to threw a homing beacon onto the side of the starship's hull."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Jango and Boba Fett left Kamino, Kenobi boarded his Delta-7 Jedi Starfighter and tracked Slave I in the Geonosis; the capital of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Once more, Kenobi engaged Fett over the asteroid field above the planet and would go on to learn more of the assassination attempt on Amidala on Geonosis when he intercepted Fett."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
