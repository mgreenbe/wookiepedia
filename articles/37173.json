In the meanwhile, Derg Prantis's fellow Bera Jeza was murdered in a street of Mos Eisley. As Jeza had ties with the Hutt Crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, Bib Fortuna hired a spacer to investigate the crime. The spacer discovered Prantis's corpse in the laboratory along with a data disk. The disk contained Derg Prantis's last words, with instructions to contact Slicer Cale Herron in Mos Taike. The investigation eventually led to the discovery of the Blackwing outbreak on Dathomir."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Derg Prantis was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts.
