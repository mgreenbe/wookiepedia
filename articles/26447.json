However, Choyd did not share his father's principles, and by 1 ABY he had instead fallen in with the Freelies, a delinquent youth gang led by a Human named Jax. Choyd and his crew were known to patrol the streets of Vorzyd V's capital city of Efavan, looking for things to steal: on one of these patrols they happened across a seemingly valuable pair of lost droids, the protocol droid C-3PO and the astromech droid R2-D2. Unbeknownst to them, the droids were owned by Luke Skywalker, a Rebel hero who was acquainted with Choyd's father. Choyd and his friends immediately tried to claim the droids for their own, only for R2-D2 to summon a police droid and send the Freelies scattering."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Still coveting the droids, the Freelies briefly encountered them again at a weapons shop, but were discouraged from taking them there when their targets inadvertently activated several automatic weapons. Instead, the youths followed them back to Skywalker's ship, where they wound up stealing something much more valuable. Choyd and his friends tricked C-3PO into allowing them aboard, where they kidnapped Rebel leader Princess Leia Organa, bringing her back to their hideout intending to ransom her to the Alliance for 5 million credits. Once Organa learned that Choyd was Falud's son, she passed on an important piece of information: she, Skywalker and Falud had only days earlier been in Imperial custody together, and Choyd's father had been killed helping them escape. Organa found herself appalled at Choyd's dispassionate response: the young Selonian did not seem to particularly care about his father's death, chalking it up to just being what Falud got for stirring things up against the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Organa wasn't in the Freelies' den long before the situation got hairy. Organa's friend Skywalker soon arrived with a Vorzydiak Freelie named Bemmie, whom Skywalker had rescued from an Imperial torture squad. Although Bemmie attempted to convince his compatriots that Skywalker was trustworthy, Jax refused to buy it, choosing instead to dispose of the Rebel leader. However, before he could do so, the Freelies' hideout was stormed by a team of stormtroopers who were after Organa and Skywalker. Choyd and his friends returned fire, although Jax planned to contact the leader of the Imperial troops and sell the two Rebels to them. But they failed to account for Bemmie, who still felt that he owed Skywalker his life. While Choyd and the other Freelies battled the Imperials, Bemmie led the Rebels to a secret escape tunnel and to safety, an act which cost him his life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Choyd's father Falud was a freedom fighter who was willing to give his life for the Rebel cause, he did not pass on those same principles to his son Choyd. Instead, the younger Selonian had the disaffected, nihilistic attitude characteristic of the Freelies, which extended even to the point where Choyd had little emotional response to his father's death. Choyd saw little point in attempting to oppose the Galactic Empire, and in his eyes, his father was gone and the Empire was still in power, so Falud's death was wasted. For Choyd, only one thing mattered: the Freelies, and as long as no one bothered his gang, what the Empire did was none of his concern. Choyd was extremely loyal to the group's leader, Jax, following his orders without question."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Choyd made his first and only appearance in the Star Wars Legends continuity in Gambler's World, a comic strip story arc written and illustrated by Russ Manning and released in 1979."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
