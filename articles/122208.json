Quarren leaders like Seggor Tels, on the other hand, preferred to stay in the oceans. Tels, in particular, derided the Mon Calamari's fixation on the stars, and considered them to be pompous dreamers who were ignorant of what life was like for the Quarren of the ocean depths."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An Imperial agent, acting as an advance scout for a planned Imperial invasion, approached Tels at this time. Seeing a chance to strike back at the hated Mon Calamari, the Quarren leader agreed to sabotage Dac's planetary shields. In the ensuing conquest of Dac, the Imperial forces overwhelmed the defenseless Mon Calamari. However, Tels' initial joy in seeing the Mon Calamari brought down soon turned bitter, as both the Quarren and the Mon Calamari were enslaved. No record exists of any special consideration given to Tels or any other Quarren collaborators by the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Blaming the Mon Calamari for forcing the Quarren to become involved in galactic affairs, Tels was nevertheless convinced that the Empire had to be forced off their shared homeworld. Over time, Tels convinced the Quarren to join the Mon Calamari-led resistance movement. Seggor Tels and others helped the Mon Cal rebel leader Ackbar in a mission in 1 BBY. When the long struggle finally ended with the liberation of Dac in 1 BBY, many of Tels' newly freed people left their homeworld, in search of a new life away from Mon Calamari, Empires, and Rebellions. Tels remained on Dac, however, to live a meditative life in the oceans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
