His government was responsible for growing the clone troopers that formed the Grand Army of the Republic in the Clone Wars. Lama Su worked with the Jedi Generals who commanded the clone army during the galaxy-wide conflict with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, although he was also in league with the Sith Lords who conspired to destroy the Jedi Order through Order 66."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The age of cloning"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "A request for an army"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the Clone Wars, the Kaminoan government led by Prime Minister Lama Su was commissioned by Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas to create a clone army for the Galactic Republic. Sifo-Dyas was killed soon afterwards by members of the Pyke Syndicate, and Lama Su found himself in league with the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus. From Tyranus, he received a genetic template for the clones: a bounty hunter named Jango Fett. He was also given an inhibitor chip that was to be implanted within each clone trooper as a safeguard against betrayal from rogue Jedi. However, the inhibitor chips were designed by the Sith, who programmed the clones to exterminate the Jedi under Order 66."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "A visit from a Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A decade after Sifo-Dyas' death, Lama Su was visited by the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had come to Kamino in pursuit of Jango Fett and had found his way in by identifying a Kaminoan poison dart. Taun We introduced him to Lama Su and they began chatting. The Prime Minister assumed Kenobi's purpose was to inspect the clone army, and he assured the Jedi it would be completed on schedule. He told Kenobi about Sifo-Dyas and learned of his death from Kenobi. Eager to impress his guest, Lama Su proceeded to show Obi-Wan the Kaminoan combat training and educational facilities of Tipoca City. He then told him about Jango Fett and said that the only thing he asked in return was for a son with no rapid aging."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A galactic war"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The loss of Fett"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the start of the Clone Wars, Halle Burtoni bartered her planet's role as the source of the Republic soldiers into a seat in the Galactic Senate and joined the Republic However the death of Jango Fett at the hands of Mace Windu left Lama Su with a limited supply of genetic material to use in the production of new clones. As such, the Kaminoan prime minister was forced to find new ways of resupplying the Grand Army of the Republic, including stretching Fett's genetic template."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lama Su was greatly disappointed in the troopers his alternative cloning methods produced. When Jedi Master Shaak Ti approached him to discuss with him the failure of Domino Squad in their final test, he suggested its members be terminated. He also talked about how they cloned troopers after Fett's death. Ti refused, saying that they were living beings, not objects. Lama Su expressed his opinion that the Jedi show too much compassion, but said that it was not his decision to make, as the Republic ordered them. Hoping to create more successful soldiers in the future, Lama Su requested a new genetic template be found for them."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "An attack on Kamino"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lama Su later went with Shaak Ti to welcome Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and the 501st Legion to Tipoca City. The Prime Minister was surprised to learn that the Confederacy of Independent Systems intended to attack Kamino, despite the Republic Military blockade that surrounded his homeworld. In preparation for the coming battle, Lama Su positioned himself within Tipoca City's central command center."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The conspiracy of Protocol 66"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Near the end of the Clone Wars, Su was approached by Nala Se, who informed him that Protocol 66 had activated prematurely in the clone trooper CT-5385. Su contacted Darth Tyranus to share this news with him and was ordered to terminate the defective clone so an autopsy could be performed on his body. He was also instructed to remove the clone's bio-chip and send it to Tyranus before the Jedi Order could discover the true nature of the chip."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rise of the Empire"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "A change of priorities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, following a duel against Mace Windu in his office, Chancellor Sheev Palpatine\u2014the public guise of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious\u2014seduced Skywalker to the dark side of the Force and issued Order 66, leading to most of the Jedi being betrayed or murdered by their clone troopers. Su's clone army was ultimately a pivotal factor not only in the Sith plot for revenge against the Jedi Order, but also in Palpatine's rise to power as Emperor of the first Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after, Su, accompanied by Taun We, hosted an inspection visit by Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin in Tipoca City. Tarkin's objective during the visit was to determine the Empire's need for clone troopers following the proclamation of the New Order by Emperor Palpatine at the end of the Clone Wars. When Su protested, arguing the Empire would need more clone troopers to maintain order across the galaxy, Tarkin countered that \"conscription soldiers\" could fulfill that service at half the cost of clones. Su insisted that no recruit could be as skilled or efficient at combat as clones, who were trained from birth to be effective, obedient soldiers. Unconvinced, Tarkin informed the Prime Minister that he would personally evaluate the clones' skillset to see if they were worth the added expenses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout the visit, Su worked on convincing Tarkin of the merits of his trained clones versus conscripted soldiers, utilizing Clone Force 99 to demonstrate clone superiority. Tarkin instructed Su to use live fire on the clone squad for a training exercise and though he eventually complied, he expressed reservations over using live for out of concern for the clones' safety as well as the facilities. Ultimately, the squad 99 managed to survive the exercise through improvisation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Su, accompanied by Se and her assistant Omega, spoke with Tarkin in one of the clone incubation chambers to discuss the Kaminoans' enhanced clones. Though the Prime Minister suggested that Clone Force 99 could be a potential asset to the Empire, Tarkin was more concerned with their tendency to disobey orders. Se explained that it was a side effect of their genetic mutation as Su asserted it had not impeded the success of their missions, leading Tarkin to question if they completed Order 66. Su assumed from their report that both Depa Billaba and Caleb Dume were reported dead on Kaller but Tarkin revealed that a counter-report from one of their own stated that the Padawan escaped."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Defection of Clone Force 99"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Clone Force 99 defected from the Empire and returned to Kamino to retrieve Omega, Se assisted in their escape by remotely preventing the bay doors from closing. After Clone Force 99 successfully escaped, Se informed Su of their escape as well as the loss of Omega. Under Su's instruction, she agreed to refrain from informing the Empire of what had occurred due to his concerns over the Empire's intentions."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Betrayed"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Empire soon terminated all its contracts with the Kaminoans, and mobilised its clone forces for departure from Kamino. Fearing that the Empire would destroy his people rather than allow them to offer their services to other parties, Lama Su sent Nala Se to gather key medical personnel and prepare to evacuate Kamino. However, Nala Se was caught in the act, and while the Chief Scientist was taken away by Rampart, the admiral had two of his Elite Squad troopers detain Lama Su in the Prime Minister's reception room."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the overseer of the Grand Army's creation, Lama Su was very proud of his clone troopers and regarded them as one of the finest achievements in his people's history. He also took great pride in his planet's combat training and educational facilities, both of which were instrumental in the development of the clone army. Despite his relationship with the Jedi who commanded the army, Lama Su was mystified by their methods. He regarded the Jedi Order as a cult and also failed to understand why they felt compassion for the clone troopers under their command. Despite being an ally of the Republic, he was primarily focused on the governing of Kamino, but he was also a secret ally to the Sith Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lama Su was a Kaminoan male who stood at 2.29 meters. He was a tall, lanky alien with white skin. His eyes were black and had white pupils. A unique crest topped the prime minister's head, and his nostrils were connected to his upper lip by a thin, \"U\"-shaped slit. Lama Su's hands had three fingers, and his feet were small and hoof-like."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He wore white armor that covered his chest and shoulders. A long collar protected his neck, as well as the back of his head. Lama Su's arms, legs, and torso were covered in black fabric, and a purple belt with an orange buckle that appeared around his waist. White, metallic cuffs shielded Lama Su's wrists, and long strips of black fabric with a silver lining and red interior hid his legs from view."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lama Su first appeared in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.
