The liner had a compact cylindrical shape, with two wide D-shaped wings on either side, housing expensive passenger suites. On one of the liner's voyages, carrying eight thousand passengers, the captain took the vessel too close to a gas giant, and the liner was caught in its gravity well. Senior Commander Thrawn of the patrol ship Boco attempted to save the vessel, shooting its luxury wings off once the passengers were gathered in the central cylinder. The reduction in weight allowed the Boco, alongside Senior Captain Ziara's Parala, to tow the liner away from the gas giant planet in a tractor beam, saving the passengers. The Boadil family were outraged at the situation, but their close alliance with the Ufsa meant they instead pinned the blame on Thrawn, whose military position was saved by the fact that several of the other Nine Ruling Families had representatives aboard the ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
