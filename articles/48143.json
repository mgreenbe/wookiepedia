Cilghal recognizes the sensations in the Force as similar to that of flow-walking, another Aing-Tii time-manipulation power, and assumes it to be flow-walking, having no experience with any other Aing-Tii time-manipulation techniques and no experience with fighting-sight. The power manifested by Horn, however, has no resemblance in its workings the previously established nature of flow-walking, and instead accords with the description of fighting-sight, suggesting Cilghal is mistaken in her identification."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
