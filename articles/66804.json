In 1 BBY, during a debriefing with Admiral Conan Antonio Motti, Dr. Bevel Lemelisk, and General Arhul Kurumenga from the Imperial Department of Military Research, Dr. Bowen presented a theory that strange occurrences in the galaxy, including a barrier to the west of the Core Worlds, were remnants of Celestial technology dating back to the Celestial-Rakata War. Admiral Motti, a staunch non-believer in the supernatural, refused to believe him, and frequently mocked him throughout the debriefing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dr. Insmot Bowen was created for the original prologue of The Essential Guide to Warfare. However, the character was cut because Erich Schoeneweiss, the editor at Del Rey, felt that the prologue would not get people involved in the book, and that a first-hand account of a battle would be more appropriate. Jason Fry, one of the authors, begrudgingly complied, replacing Bowen's conversation with an account of the Battle of Andalia by Grand Admiral Osvald Teshik."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character later appeared in the first part of the 12-part blog series Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare Author's Cut, \"The Celestials\", on Star Wars Blog.
