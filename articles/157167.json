In 4 ABY, shortly prior to the Battle of Endor, the protocol droid was in the workshop of a rebel technician for repairs. The technician was tasked with extracting Galactic Empire information from the ID10 seeker droid utilized by Commander Iden Versio of the Imperial special forces unit Inferno Squad. The protocol droid suggested various methods of extracting the data, but was silenced by the technician. From her cell aboard the Invincible Faith, Versio remotely activated the seeker droid, which electrocuted the technician with its electro-shock prod. As the seeker droid hacked into the vessel's computers, the protocol droid protested, but was unable to prevent the Imperial droid from rescuing Versio."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The protocol droid appeared, albeit unidentified, in the 2017 video game Star Wars Battlefront II.
