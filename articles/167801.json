The device was a contraption made up of several lenses which could harness the energy of a star. It was connected to a large circular contraption that an individual could be attached to. The device was intended to be used by Mother Talzin in order to harness the Living Force from the Queen of Bardotta, Julia. The Living Force from Julia would be transferred to the Bardottan Sphere, which would be combined with Talzin's magick in order to make her more powerful than any Jedi or Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Talzin's plan was foiled by the arrival of Jedi Master Mace Windu and his companion Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks. The living sphere was destroyed during the battle between Talzin's followers, the Frangawl Cult, and Binks, which unleashed a shockwave which also destroyed the lens device. Having failed, Talzin disappeared."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
