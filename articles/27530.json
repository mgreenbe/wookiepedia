The first objects to be discovered included broken century-old droid components, but nothing of any interest to non-academic individuals. During the early stages of the excavation, local pirates, including the Krypder Riders, caused difficulty for Clatriffe and her team, but stopped upon realizing that none of the artifacts being uncovered were worth any value to them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Clatriffe's team uncovered what they thought was a Jedi holocron. The pirates heard of the news, resuming their attacks on the excavation in an attempt to steal it. Clatriffe was forced to hire some of the planet's natives to guard the holocron, which was hidden among the other less valuable finds. The Jedi Council were alerted, and sent Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker to see for themselves. Clatriffe met the two Jedi when they arrived, giving the holocron to Kenobi. Before the Jedi could leave, the Krypder Riders, led by Hudso Shaku, blocked their path, demanding that the holocron be handed over to them. Kenobi defended himself by holding up his lightsaber, and Shaku decided to steal the weapon instead. The Jedi managed to disarm and incapacitate the Krypder Riders, leaving Dallenor with the holocron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clatriffe first appeared in Age of Republic - Obi-Wan Kenobi 1, a 2019 canon comic written by Jody Houser and illustrated by Wilton Santos and Cory Smith.
