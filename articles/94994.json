It was a  mist-covered swamp world with a hot, humid and fetid climate maintained by thick swampy rain that fell almost perpetually. The world was a hotbed of life and its environment was fairly representative of the sentient Hutt species that inhabited the world. The influence of the Hutts made the world an important location. The planet's surface was covered with numerous bogs with what little solid land there was claimed by the Hutts and used to support their homes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hutts built only a handful of spaceports on the surface of Nal Hutta in order to connect their towns, settlements, and palaces, as the planet received few visitors due to most business with offworlders being conducted on the planet's largest moon, Nar Shaddaa. The foremost of these spaceports was the planet's capital city, Bilbousa, a sprawling mess covered in arching roots that spread out from looming bulbous pods. Within sight of the city was the Palace of Gardulla Besadii the Elder, one of the largest buildings on Nal Hutta, which served as the occasional headquarters of the Grand Hutt Council, the ruling body of the Hutt Clan that controlled the planet. Under the Hutt's control, the planet shared a reputation with Nar Shaddaa for being polluted and dangerous, but played a leading role in the galaxy's shadow economy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After freeing Ziro the Hutt from prison on Coruscant, the bounty hunter Cad Bane brought the fugitive Hutt to the Grand Hutt Council on Nal Hutta.
