The man and the three Bender brothers founded the Meatlumps, a gang of technology-hating fanatics named after their favorite food. In response, Lucien Bender created the Bofa Treat Gang, named after bofa treats: sweet, dried, fruit based snackfood."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Yavin, the vindictive Lucien Bender placed a bounty on his three traitorous sons. However, he ignored that a much larger bounty was placed on him and his gang. Around 1 ABY, the Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk was considering to capture the three sons when he discovered that there was a much more lucrative bounty on Lucien's head. He therefore decided to use the three brothers to collect it. Shortly after he had captured the first brother, Louis Bender, near Kor Vella, a spacer affiliated with the Meatlump gang arrived at Bossk's little camp near the Bofa Treat Gang's hideout. Bossk forced the Meatlump to take down the Bofa Treat Gang and their leader for him in exchange of Louis Bender. The spacer entered the hideout and fought his way through the bunker until he finally met Lucien. The ensuing firefight resulted in Lucien's death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bofa Treat Gang appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
