As a young girl, she followed the slave Anakin Skywalker around, and in 32 BBY, she and several other children visited Skywalker in Slave Quarters Row in the spaceport of Mos Espa. He was working on his podracer in a courtyard and announced that he was taking part in the Boonta Eve Classic podrace the next day."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Melee was dubious that Skywalker's podracer would even run, and the other children present expressed similar doubts. The boy Seek then suggested that they go and play a ball game, and Melee left with him, Wald, and Amee, leaving only Kitster Banai behind with Skywalker. The latter ultimately won the race and left Tatooine. Melee had brown hair, light skin, and dark eyes. She wore a dark red dress when meeting Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Melee was portrayed by Megan Udall in the 1999 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.
