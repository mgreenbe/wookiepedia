Although the facilities prevented the planet from becoming entirely lethal to life, their primary function was to filter any valuable compounds from waste dumped into Hutta's swamps. Useless chemicals went right back into the swamps. The original Jiguuna Muckworks was replaced by new Muckworks several decades before the Cold War but this successor went into critical failure shortly after its installation. The Old Muckworks returned to use and the name remained."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
