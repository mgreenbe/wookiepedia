It primarily supplied various customers, including the Gungan Grand Army and Royal Naboo Security Forces, with starships and bongos. It also produced weapons. It was created by the Gungan Bullba Bari before the Battle of Naboo. Business became active during the last decades of the Old Republic, after the Gungans re-established relations with the Naboo.
