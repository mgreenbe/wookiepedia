The lieutenant, along with a force of Security troopers in an assault speeder, blocked the limousine's path and confronted Fel's driver, Baxton.

Around that time, several Jedi began to develop a psychosis that caused them to believe that everyone they knew had been replaced by impostors. When Jedi Knights Bazel Warv and Yaqeel Saav'etu were stricken with the psychosis, they were quickly captured outside of the Jedi Temple's speeder entrance by Han Solo; Leia Organa Solo; their daughter, Jaina Solo; and Imperial Remnant Head of State Jagged Fel. A nearby Security force under the command of Captain Atar attempted to apprehend the two Jedi, but Han, Jaina, and Fel had already taken Saav'etu and Warv to the Temple. Using Fel's diplomatic immunity, Jaina and Fel attempted to leave the scene in their limousine, and Atar, angered, ordered the Duros to prevent their departure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Duros lieutenant, along with a number of Security troopers, blocked the limousine's path in their Galactic Alliance Security assault speeder. In response, Fel sent his driver, Baxton, to ask the Security forces to move. The Duros lieutenant, whose orders to prevent Fel's and Solo's departure were very strict, confronted Baxton. He got into a heated argument with the driver and relentlessly refused to allow the speeder to pass. Journalist Javis Tyrr then arrived, and when it was discovered that he was using a cleaning droid to infiltrate the Jedi Temple for his show, Atar also arrived. The Captain reassured Solo that Tyrr wouldn't do anything illegal, but Fel requested that they be permitted to leave.
