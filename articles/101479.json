Sometime afterward, they had their only child, Roviden. Along with his wife and son, Orn sympathized with the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War, but unlike them, he took no steps to help them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thus, when the Galactic Empire occupied Bakura in 1 ABY, his son was executed and his wife slated to be so; however, he convinced Governor Wilek Nereus to save her life by giving up his voice box.

Of the handful of Bakuran senators who opposed the actions of the Imperial governor, Belden was the most vociferous. Along with Prime Minister Yeorg Captison, Belden secretly oversaw the existence of the underground resistance\u2014although they numbered only ten cells with around ten members each."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was the plan to activate these resistance cells against the occupation force during the Battle of Bakura that got Belden, Captison, and Rebel ambassador Leia Organa arrested. The shock was too much for the elderly Belden, and he died in captivity of an (otherwise easily preventable) cerebral hemorrhage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rebel cells rose anyways, under the leadership of the cured Eppie, and both Organa and Captison\u2014as well as the planet\u2014were free from Imperial control."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
