It was created before the rise of the Empire, however, and served the Galactic Republic's Army before the Clone Wars. It had a Science Service tower then, which was infiltrated by Bartokk assassins to capture Teela Panjarra for Frexton. After Palpatine took power, the Academy was a branch of the Empire-wide military school. Among the known students at the academy was the man known as Starter, who was eventually expelled due to obnoxious and undisciplined behavior, and Juno Eclipse, a woman who went on to lead Black Eight Squadron then became the personal pilot of Galen Marek."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Academy trained members of both the Imperial Navy and the Army in undergraduate and graduate degrees.
