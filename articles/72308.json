While the peace conference made a shaky start, the two leaders were forced to put aside their differences to save Toda's daughter, the young Princess Gerin, who had been captured for ransom by the pirate Gir Kybo Ren-Cha. Following the rescue mission, Toda and Julpa ended up signing a treaty and uniting Tammuz-an. The king and the princess also became lovers, helping to strengthen ties between the two factions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 15 BBY, the crown prince of the planet Tammuz-an, Mon Julpa, ascended to the position of king after thwarting an attempted coup by Grand Vizier Ko Zatec-Cha. Despite bearing the title of \"King of Tammuz-an,\" Julpa only reigned over the purple-skinned members of his species. The blue-skinned inhabitants of the planet's Outer Territories formed a distinct and independent faction, led by Lord Malameu Toda. The latter was a warrior-chieftain with a surly and gruff personality, and the members of Julpa's faction regarded his tribesmen as barbarians. The two Tammuz-an societies had been rivals since ancient times, thus preventing their homeworld from achieving a much needed political unity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The negotiations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early months of his reign, King Julpa opened peace negotiations with Lord Toda, hoping to unite all Tammuz-an against their common enemies, such as the recently arrested and imprisoned pirate captain Gir Kybo Ren-Cha. For an initial meeting in his castle, Julpa requested the help of the Humans Jann Tosh and Jessica Meade, who acted as his advisors, while the droid partners C-3PO and R2-D2 were to perform stewardship duties. Toda, who had come with a few soldiers and his children, Princess Gerin and Prince Coby, proved more than reluctant to sign Julpa's charter. The chieftain thought the king had already too many things under control, especially now that Ren-Cha had been put behind bars. That attitude prompted Sollag Den, Julpa's most faithful servant, to verbally spar with Toda in defense of his king. Despite his daughter's attempts to convince him otherwise, Toda left the meeting without signing the treaty. Yet Gerin\u2014who was infatuated with Julpa\u2014promised she would make him change his mind by the next day."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Ren-Cha managed to escape from the king's jail. He kidnapped Toda's daughter and took her aboard a stolen R-22 Spearhead to the swamp world of Bogden. Surprisingly, the pirate offered to release Gerin in exchange for his imprisoned men. As arrangements were made, Meade, Tosh, and the droids were sent to Bogden in secret so they could rescue the princess. Simultaneously, the Tammuz-an leaders raided Ren-Cha's makeshift prison on Bogden with a squadron of soldiers, bringing an end to his pirate operation. In the wake of their successful collaboration, Julpa and Toda ended up signing the proposed peace treaty, effectively joining all of Tammuz-an under a single rule. King Julpa and Princess Gerin also became lovers, further strengthening the new bond between the two factions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The peace negotiations between Mon Julpa and Lord Toda appeared in \"The Revenge of Kybo Ren,\" the eighth episode in the Star Wars: Droids animated television series, which aired on ABC on October 26, 1985. However, they were first mentioned in the ending segment of the previous episode, \"The Pirates of Tarnoonga,\" which aired on on October 19 of the same year and announced the plot of the next installment. The negotiations were later mentioned in passing in the StarWars.com Databank entries for Mon Julpa, Kybo Ren, and Tammuz-an. In 2013, Part 2 of The Droids Re-Animated, a series of reference articles written by Abel G. Pe\u00f1a and Rich Handley for the Star Wars Blog, included a summary of the events."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
