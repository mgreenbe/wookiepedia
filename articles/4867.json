They were the most tenacious of many cult colonists who ventured to the scorched Sith world after Vader's demise to venerate his power. They also venerated Lady Corvax and planted irontrees in the bog of Corvax Fen, thought to be drenched in her tears, in a vain attempt to reinvigorate Mustafar's once lush ecosystems. The Alazmec colonists were cut down on the grounds of Fortress Vader by Supreme Leader Kylo Ren and his stormtroopers, during his search for the hidden Sith world of Exegol, as the Alazmec of Winsit possessed the Sith wayfinder that once belonged to Darth Vader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
