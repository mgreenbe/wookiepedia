He met Norun Gep, his partner, in jail when they were street urchins. They remained friends even since. Usually the two Whiphids got the meat for their business from hunters, but when the hunts went bad, the local stables were known to get a visit from two Whiphids. Besides running their grill, the Whiphids also ran a small smuggling business that did not gain the attention of Jabba Desilijic Tiure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
