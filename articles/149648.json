Troop lines numbered two Evakmar-KDY transports and two escorts, typically Strike-class medium cruisers. As troop lines were intended to carry Imperial Army forces, the troop line varied less in composition than other naval lines. A single transport was designed to carry a corps, but often carried less as smaller units from the corps were assigned to other vessels. Army officers generally accused captains of the line with being worried more about the safety of their line than the troops themselves, leading to occasions where an admiral commanded important surface operations. Other transports were employed, most of them from the days of the Galactic Republic, such as the Delta-class troop transport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 6783rd Troop Line operated together with the 2391st Battle Squadron and the 1249th Mobile Corps during an invasion of the Kalinda system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
