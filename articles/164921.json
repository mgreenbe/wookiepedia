It was the homeworld of the aquatic Wrean species. During the Clone Wars, it hosted a comm tower. Wrea was notoriously difficult to reach, because of the Smuggler's Run asteroid belt nearby. It was for this reason that freedom fighter Saw Gerrera established a base for his Partisans insurgent group here during the reign of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
