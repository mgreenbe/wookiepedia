While in the cantina he sat near the door at a table with the Arcona Hem Dazon, the Advozse Bom Vimdin, the Siniteen Pons Limbic and the Stennes Shifter Braconnor Bakiska. During the time the group spent together in the cantina, the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and the former moisture farmer Luke Skywalker entered the establishment looking for a pilot to take them to the planet Alderaan. By the time Schous was present in the cantina, he was fairly elderly for a Defel and was beginning to lose his species' ability to bend light around their bodies in order to become practically invisible."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
