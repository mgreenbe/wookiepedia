The Star Destroyer would not only serve as the Fleet's flagship, but also as the flagship of Fleet Group Right to Rule, one of four temporary battlegroups created for the defense of the planet. During the battle that ensued, Right to Rule remained in the rear coordinating the movements of the other battlegroups, but would eventually be forced into the engagement when the starfleet withdrew below the minefield surrounding the planet. There it would remain to clean up the Yuuzhan Vong which had made it through the defenses. One day after the Battle of Borosk, Pellaeon held a meeting with the Moff Council, as well as numerous other high-ranking military officers, wherein he forced the Council to acquiescence to his intentions of allying with the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. Following this meeting, Right to Rule led the Starfleet's Coreward offensive against the Yuuzhan Vong."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pursuing Yuuzhan Vong forces under B'shith Vorrik, Right to Rule led an Imperial contingent to the planet Generis, but arrived too late to save the planet's long-range communications center. Determined to destroy the force, Grand Admiral Pellaeon continued to the pursuit, which led them to the Yuuzhan Vong attack on the Esfandia Long-Range Communications Base on the planet Esfandia. Assisted by the Galactic Alliance frigate Pride of Selonia and the Millennium Falcon, as well as the Star Destroyer Relentless, Right to Rule acted as flagship in the battle that ensued, forcibly placing itself between the Yuuzhan Vong and the planet in order to deter any further orbital bombardment and give time for the Falcon to evacuate the communication station's personnel. With the timely arrival of a fleet from the Ryn Network, Right to Rule successfully led the forces at Esfandia to victory, utterly destroying the Yuuzhan Vong force, and killing Vorrik in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Right to Rule was next confirmed to have engaged the enemy at the Defense of Mon Calamari, acting as flagship for the Imperial contingent of the massive fleet gathered for the planet's defense. The fleet, and by extension Right to Rule, operated subordinate to Admiral Traest Kre'fey in a support role for the Galactic Alliance's Second and Third Fleets. Right to Rule was subsequently assigned as the flagship of the coalition Fourth Fleet, carrying aboard it Vanguard Squadron and Twin Suns Squadron, as well as controlling Rogue and Wraith Squadrons. In the initial forays of the final battle, Right to Rule assisted the starfighter squadrons assigned her in escorting commando-laden troop transports through the dovin basal minefield surrounding Coruscant to descents planet-side. It would continue in the battle by leading the Fourth Fleet in engaging the Yuuzhan Vong home fleet protecting Coruscant and would end the war in that very place. Days after the official end of the war, Right to Rule was the place where Pellaeon returned Killik Twilight to Leia Organa Solo before returning to Imperial Space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As detailed in The New Jedi Order: The Final Prophecy, Grand Admiral Pellaeon was a part of the fleet gathered for the failed attack on Bilbringi, leading the contingent codenamed \"Beta\".
