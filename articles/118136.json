Though the complex's transmission antenna was damaged in the final assault, Tantor and his brother Dellis were able to string a series of remote relay beacons to a nearby broadcast facility from which records of the Rebels' transmissions were beamed to the orbiting Star Destroyer Inquisitor. There, Grand General Malcor Brashin analyzed the data and discovered that the Rebels had secretly taken energy collection facilities on Sarapin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
