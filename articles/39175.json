Before the senators drank from the bottle, however, it was seized by intruding Kaminoan Senator Halle Burtoni. Farr ushered Burtoni out of the meeting, and the senators resumed their celebration and consumed the Domaine de la Maison sur le Lac. Unfortunately for the senators in the celebration, the wine had been mixed with a poison that was engineered on Kamino to be lethal exclusively to Rodians, a species to which Farr and Purs belonged. Farr died as a result of drinking the Domaine de la Maison sur le Lac, while Purs had elected not to consume the beverage, and so survived."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Burtoni and her colleague, the Umbaran Senator Mee Deechi, also enjoyed a bottle of Domaine de la Maison sur le Lac during a meeting in Deechi's office.
