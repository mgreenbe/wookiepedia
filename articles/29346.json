The Vindicator was one of the Republic vessels assigned to accompany a fleet of prototype warships that was preparing for an assault on the Empire's capital world of Dromund Kaas in 3665 BBY. However, the fleet was attacked by the Imperial Navy while passing along a secret route in the Outer Rim Territories. The carrier took part in the resultant Battle of Hoth, which lasted several days and crossed several star systems before reaching its peak in the Hoth system, but at the end of the engagement the Vindicator was among the more than seventy-five vessels that crashed on the planet Hoth. Its wreckage was scattered over several kilometers on the surface of Hoth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Conraddis Vindicator was first mentioned in the 2012 reference guide Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia, in the guide's section on the planet Hoth.
