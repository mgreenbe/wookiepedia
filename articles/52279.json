After the fall of the empire in 25,100 BBY, it would eventually join the Galactic Republic. After centuries of Republic rule, Galidraan was the site of a battle between the Jedi Order and the True Mandalorians. Jedi Master Dooku, Padawan Komari Vosa, and an entire task force of Jedi later discovered they had been tricked into slaughtering the True Mandalorians by the governor, who had falsified the atrocities they had committed. From this battle, only two Mandalorians, Jango Fett, and Silas, survived. Fett returned to the planet two years later to reclaim his armor. After the Declaration of a New Order, Galidraan was soon absorbed into the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
