And although the GLX was short on lethality and was pricey, bounty hunters and law enforcement officers enjoyed its extended range, versatility, and dizzying rate of fire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The weapon was a short-barreled carbine with a barrel-integrated flash suppressor, which made it a maneuverable breach weapon for close-quarters combat. Its solid stock with built-in recoil compensators ensured control during sustained full-auto fire. Such performance-enhancing designs enabled shooters to engage targets anywhere from close quarters out to nearly half a kilometer without feeling ill-equipped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
