At some point, he also got an official job in Ral Mundi's Starship Emporium, a shipwright company in Coronet City. Circa 1 ABY, Jinsin used his position to allow the Ragtags to steal a large shipment of starship components. The robbery put the company on the verge of bankrupt, forcing Ral Mundi to requested intervention of the Corellian Security Force. CorSec Lieutenant Mack Jasper sent a spacer who finally discovered the truth about the missing shipment. Tomi Jinsin went into hiding in a bunker near Coronet but the spacer tracked him down there. Jinsin was killed while trying to resist to the spacer. From information found in Tomi Jinsin's datapad, the spacer was able to retrieve the missing shipment in the Coronet Capitol, along with a crate of illegal spice. Further investigation of the CorSec about the shipment robbery and the smuggled spice would led to the discovery of a plot of the Rogue CorSec to overthrow the Diktat Daclif Gallamby himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tomi Jinsin was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts.
