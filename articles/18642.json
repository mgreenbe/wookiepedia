Unbeknownst to his superiors, Manech has hired the legendary Boba Fett to deal with the planet's rebellious Royal Family. After destroying one of their fuel refineries and killing their crown prince, it is apparent they may soon have a war on their hands. Upon finding out about Manech's scheme, Buzk scrambles fighters in an attempt to make it to the Kyber Palace before Fett, but he is too late. Fett subdues the royals in time for the TIEs to arrive and finish the job. Afterward, an Imperial Admiral arrives to congratulate Manech with a promotion to Sector Commander, and to arrest Buzk for his abuse of Imperial authority. However Boba Fett warns Manech that with his new authority, he has made enemies who may one day call on Fett to kill him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
