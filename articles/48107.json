Twenty-five kilometers from the capital city, the village was known as the Jewel of the Scraplands, and was populated by scrap dealers and scavengers. The city's only attraction was an armored hovertrain station with service to Worlport; other places of note were a nameless cantina at the heart of town and a dusty marketplace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
