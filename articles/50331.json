The forces of Ranulph Tarkin's paramilitary were out of bacta and low on both food and ammunition, yet thanks to the help of the native Xexto Billibango (who had an intimate knowledge of the mine's structure) the forces of the Republic were able to repulse the invaders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic victory allowed the Jedi to contact the Jedi Council on Coruscant and establish a plan for a final battle, while the co-directors of the Combine nearly killed Stark for his failure to once again defeat the Republic military."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
