At least three members were dedicated soldiers\u2014Soontir Fel was one of the Empire's most decorated pilots and his son Jagged flew with distinction during the Yuuzhan Vong War. The family was also linked to one of the most famous Rebellion and later on New Republic families, the Antilles family of Corellia, by marriage through Syal Antilles Fel, though due to their different positions in the political fabric of the galaxy, they had little contact for much of the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the conclusion of the Second Galactic Civil War, the Fel family's ties to the Galactic Alliance were reinforced with the marriage of Jagged Fel to Jaina of the House of Solo.
