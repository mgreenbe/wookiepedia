Several months after the Battle of Yavin, he was part of the group which traveled to the rubble left behind after the destruction of the planet Alderaan in an effort to locate ores, stationed at Mining Outpost 11. The Galactic Empire leaked rumors to the miners that a scouting unit had discovered the location of the Royal Palace of Alderaan in the debris field, then ordered all miners to leave the outpost. It was hoped that the information would be passed on to the Alliance, and lure Princess Leia Organa and the Heroes of Yavin into a trap. While the majority of the miners spread the rumors far and wide, Darr and another Alliance agent, Zaz Kamiroz, headed for the Ithorian Herdship Bazaar and made contact with a local agent, the Ithorian merchant, Poliss. Using the code phrase that they were looking for their \"cousins from Yavin,\" they waited for an audience with the Princess. Two days after arriving on the Bazaar, Darr was tracked down by the assassin droid XS3, who had been dispatched by the Empire to lend credence to their ruse. The droid chased Darr into the jungle outside Isttu Village and mortally wounded him, despite the intervention of a group of Alliance agents on unrelated business. Before dying, he passed on Kamiroz's name to the team of Alliance agents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
