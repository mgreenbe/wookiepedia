Buildings in these ancient cities were entirely submerged at high tide, and Chagrians swam between them. Some multi-story buildings were not equipped with staircases or elevators at all; inhabitants simply waited until high tide, then swam to higher floors. Once the Chagrians made contact with other species, they constructed starports and trade cities on high plateaus accessible by aircar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around five hundred years before the Battle of Naboo, a number of needy Chagrian locals were approached by recruiters sent by Hugo Bartyn.
