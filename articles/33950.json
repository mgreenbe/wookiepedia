In 22 BBY, elements of the Separatist Droid Army, led by the Techno Union Foreman Wat Tambor, invaded and blockaded the Twi'lek homeworld of Ryloth. Hoping to counter this threat, the Galactic Republic sent a task force under the command of Dao and Jedi General Ima-Gun Di to liberate the planet. While Dao oversaw several Republic Venator-class Star Destroyers, including his own flagship, Di and a battalion of clone troopers were sent to aid the embattled Twi'leks on the surface of Ryloth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Di and his forces fought the Separatist battle droid forces on Ryloth, Dao and his fleet engaged the warships that were part of the Confederate blockade orbiting the planet in space. The battle on and above Ryloth continued for days until the Republic's ammunition, food, and medical supplies on the ground began to run out. Dao was subsequently contacted by Di, who ordered the Admiral to request reinforcements from the Jedi High Council. With his own forces low on fuel and ammunition, Dao opened a transmission to Jedi Masters Yoda, Mace Windu, and Obi-Wan Kenobi at the Jedi Temple on the galactic capital of Coruscant via hologram, asking for assistance. However, during the conversation, the Confederate fleet disabled the shields of Dao's flagship, and a clone subordinate warned Dao about this development. Dao and the rest of his crew were instantly killed when their defenseless Star Destroyer fell to enemy turbolaser fire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dao had brown hair, blue eyes, and fair skin.

In the video, Series Director Dave Filoni stated that the inspiration for Dao's name was a rearrangement of the letters of the term D.O.A., or \"Dead On Arrival,\" signifying the character's imminent death in his first appearance in the series. Dao finally appeared in the episode \"Supply Lines,\" which aired on September 24, 2010. In the episode, Dao was portrayed by voice actor James Arnold Taylor, who also voiced Obi-Wan Kenobi in the series. His design was made to resemble actors who had played Imperial officers in the original trilogy of Star Wars films. His animation model was constructed from Admiral Wullf Yularen's body and the head of a Mandalorian citizen, which had both appeared in the series' second season. Additionally, his model was customized with a special hair-do."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
