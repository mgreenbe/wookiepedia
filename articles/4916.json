The moon had a rich ecosystem that provided a habitat for numerous non-sentient herbivorous species, as well as at least one predator. Among the former were the o'cerrys, which cooperated with thousands of other herbivores by warning them whenever a predator approached."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point by 990 BBY, Alchenaut was visited by the Jedi biologist Bowspritz, who studied the moon's animal life and named the o'cerrys in the process.
