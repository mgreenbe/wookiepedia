He was trained as a soldier by the rebel trooper Brand. Between 2 BBY and 0 BBY, during the Battle of Allst Prime, Anaraku decided to look for Brand. As an AT-ST approached his position, Brand appeared and tackled him to the ground, saving him from the barrage of laser fire. With the AT-ST no longer attacking them, the pair then exchanged words and Anaraku invited Brand to play lifters with him and the fellow recruit Briala. Brand ignored him and pushed past, crawling along a log to her target. Anaraku continued pleading to her but she stopped listening to him. Suddenly, Anaraku was attacked from behind by an Imperial. He called out to Brand but quickly fell unconscious. Brand, however, heard Anaraku calling to her and turned around, shooting the Imperial down before rushing in to his aid. She removed his head covering and found blood oozing from the back of his head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lylee Anaraku was a male Mirialan with green eyes and yellow-green skin.
