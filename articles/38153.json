It masqueraded as a monastery full of Dim-U monks, but only a few of its residents were actually devout. The majority of them were involved in a highly illegal venture, organized by the abbot, Drayk, to alter the transponder codes and emission signatures of ships to avoid identification. This service was typically used by smugglers or the new owners of stolen ships. The building was a former greenhouse and was chosen for its low rent and location near the Bureau of Ships and Services office. The pilot BoShek was employed to bring ships there for alterations, and several outlaw techs performed the actual modifications."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
