It was the flagship of Beta Group, led by Commander Lajaie. Beta Group was stationed at the Mako-Ta Space Docks, where their cruisers had been refitted for war. As they attempted to leave, however, their hyperdrives failed to work. The origin of this dilemma was soon to arrive in the form of Darth Vader and his personal fleet, Death Squadron. Vader's flagship, the Executor destroyed General Vanden Willard's cruiser, before firing on the rest. Lajaie discovered a possible way the rebels may be able to get their hyperdrives working again, but his cruiser was already too suppressed by the turbolaser fire. He ordered the crew to evacuate while the cruiser was torn apart."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lajaie's cruiser first appeared in the 2018 canon comic Star Wars 52, written by Kieron Gillen and illustrated by Salvador Larroca."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
