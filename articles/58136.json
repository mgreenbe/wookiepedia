Gungi traveled to Ilum on board the Crucible alongside his fellow younglings and Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who was their guide for the experience. Upon touching down, Gungi and the other younglings traveled to the Crystal Cave, where they and Ahsoka met with Grand Master Yoda for the beginnings of the trial."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yoda explained that the younglings would have to travel deep into the caverns of the cave to retrieve the crystal meant for them, and if they didn't make it back before the exit froze over they would most likely die. The younglings hastily traveled into the cave and split up to find their crystals. Gungi was able to find his crystal rather quickly, but it was located across a sea of icy water which could only be crossed once the water froze over. Eventually Gungi was able to cross the stream and obtain his crystal, escaping the Crystal Cave with little time to spare. When the other younglings also made it out, the group traveled back to the Crucible with Ahsoka to build their lightsabers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After leaving Ilum's atmosphere, Gungi and the other younglings were greeted by Huyang, a droid who had instructed Jedi for millennia on how to construct their lightsabers. Huyang told Gungi to reach his hand out and feel through the Force what his lightsaber should look like. After a moment's thought Gungi described his saber as being made of wood. Huyang gave Gungi a wood hilt from a Brylark tree, which he then used to begin constructing his lightsaber. Before he could finish, the Crucible came under attack by the Ohnaka Gang, a band of ruthless pirates led by the infamous Hondo Ohnaka."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After several altercations with the pirates, the younglings and Ahsoka were able to drive them off their ship, but Ahsoka was captured by the gang and taken to their stronghold on Florrum. After the attack, the younglings contacted Master Kenobi and told him what had happened. He instructed the younglings to stay put until he could assist them and Ahsoka. While waiting for Master Kenobi's arrival, Gungi finished building his lightsaber, alongside fellow younglings Petro and Byph."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Usage during the Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the last year of the Clone Wars, Gungi was present for a lightsaber training exercise instructed by Jedi Master Tera Sinube in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.
