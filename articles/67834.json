The male's caste was also integral in regulating any political alliances between the families involved, which was important, as all breedings were negotiated for political purposes. A Whoon-cha was an intra-caste breeding where two members of the nobility breed to strengthen both family's standing within the ruling caste. A Whoon-li was an inter-caste breeding in one realm involving a noble and a more common caste. A Vuin-cha was a breeding of nobles from different realms.
