At the time of the Invasion of Naboo, Mushroom Mesa was part of the Boonta Eve Classic podracing circuit, forcing racers such as Anakin Skywalker to maneuver around the obstacles.

Certain experienced racers believed that the faces that could be discerned in the stones of the mesa could change expressions depending on the angle of view."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tusken Raiders were believed by some to know the secret of the Mesa.
