Shortly thereafter, he learns of a major Rebel supply base on the planet D'rinba IV and diverts its course to the planet, intending to use the battlestation's superlaser to destroy it. Intercepting this information, the Alliance assembles a team of Force-sensitive individuals to sneak onboard and disable the station. However, Vader soon learns of their presence and has the station put on alert. The situation becomes a race against time for the members of the infiltration party, as they must attempt to succeed in their mission while avoiding the station's stormtrooper contingent and, late in the mission, a party member's fall to the Dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Contents"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The game is based on cards and die, and requires the assembly of various three-dimensional components."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The game contains a VHS tape that is played on a television screen as the players play the game.

Prowse wore an original Vader costume from the Lucasfilm Archives.
