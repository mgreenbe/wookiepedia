Its blade was resistant to the shut-down effect of cortosis, which partially addressed a problem that had vexed lightsaber duelists for millennia. The lightsaber was laid to rest with Master Lodaka following her death, within a chamber of the Lothal Jedi Temple."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
