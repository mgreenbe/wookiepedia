Isolated in its star system, the world attracted Jedi Master An'ya Kuro due to its peaceful vistas and quiet retreats. Sporting no notable colony or civilization, the planet remained out of galactic affairs and played little part in the many wars and conflicts which engulfed the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Flora and fauna"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Home to no notable sentient races, Cophrigin V was inhabited by a species of simian-like and goat-like beasts which inhabited the forested hills and grassy plains respectively.

Entering into a lightsaber duel, the Sith and Jedi fought fiercely, despite Kuro's age. While the Jedi Master was an advanced swordsman, Vader was able to maintain his energy while Kuro slowed down. Crushing the woman under a tree, Vader was able to land a killing blow, but was ultimately robbed of a true victory. Through her mastery of the Force, Kuro was able to transcend death and maintain her consciousness while her physical body disappeared. Returning as a shadow of herself, Kuro reminded Vader that the light side of the Force was stronger than the Sith and that the Order would return, despite the current darkness in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
