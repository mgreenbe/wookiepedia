The planet-wide invasion culminated in the Second Battle of Geonosis, with units of the 212th Recon Division, 501st Legion, and special ops clone troopers launching an assault on the primary droid foundry. Commander Cody devised a plan for a three-pronged attack, with General Ki-Adi-Mundi's special ops troopers coming from the north, the 7th Sky Corps' units, consisting almost entirely of ARF troopers and AT-TEs, approaching from the middle, and Skywalker's 501st Legion coming from the south, all landing at Point Rain before moving to destroy the foundry's deflector shield generator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 7th Sky Corps' 212th Recon Division was the first unit to launch from their assault ship, and the force consisted of LAAT/i gunships and LAAT carriers transporting AT-TEs.

Engaged by J-1 proton cannons, LR1K sonic cannons, and Nantex-class territorial defense starfighters, the Republic forces suffered heavy casualties, with only the 212th Recon Division reaching the rendezvous at Point Rain. Commander Cody established a perimeter with LAAT/i gunships and AT-TEs to hold their position against overwhelming Geonosian forces. During the battle, Kenobi's gunship was shot down, with Kenobi and clone trooper Trapper being the only survivors. They were eventually rescued by troopers Boil and Waxer. As the battle progressed, the 212th became more and more overwhelmed until Red Squadron \u2014 a squadron of BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bombers \u2014 arrived for air support and Skywalker and Mundi's units arrived at Point Rain. With surviving Republic forces now linked up, another assault was launched, this time to destroy the deflector shield generator. Skywalker and a small group of his men penetrated through the shield and jammed Geonosian scanners, allowing a team of AT-TEs to move in and destroy the generator.
