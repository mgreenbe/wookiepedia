After the second Death Star's destruction during the Battle of Endor, the remaining crew of this outpost, under the command of Lieutenant Jeres Moridon, attempted to jury-rig a HoloNet transceiver to cut through the interference caused by the destruction of the Death Star and notify the rest of the Imperial fleet about the Empire's defeat. They were thwarted by a group of Rebel operatives and the facility was destroyed when the volcano erupted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
