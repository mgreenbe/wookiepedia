During the Cold War Master Jarro was listed as the final Great Hunt target for bounty hunters vying for the prize. The first bounty hunter who tried to kill her Master was a Mandalorian named Tarro Blood, who was quickly subdued by a mind trick. Held under questioning, Blood claimed that another Hunter was his accomplice and was en route and Jarro believed him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon enough, a D5-Mantis Patrol Craft emerged from hyperspace and was caught by the Aurora's tractor beam. The security teams attempted to arrest the hunter for terrorism but the hunter simply fought through the entire ship before reaching Noori and her Master on the bridge. Jarro demanded that the hunter surrender, before attempting another mind trick, only to discover that his opponent had a much stronger will than the weak-minded Blood. He then attempted reasoning, acknowledging that the Mandalorians wanted him dead but there is no profit in revenge. The hunter refused to care and attacked Jarro. Noori watched helplessly as her Master was slain and, stricken by grief, urged the hunter to kill her so as to spare her the shame of failing her master. Her Master's killer was happy to oblige her and slew the girl."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Gameplay alternatives"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The player can either choose to spare Noori (light side points) or kill her (dark side points)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the former is chosen, Noori sends a message to the Grand Champion, informing them of having been calmed down by the Jedi and encouraged the bounty hunter to abandon their career.
