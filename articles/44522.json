They differed from their first-degree counterparts, the biological science droids and physical science droids, in that engineering droids worked in applied sciences, using their knowledge to solve real-world engineering and technical problems. Engineering droids worked in a variety of applied sciences, but performed poorly if forced to undertake a different job than the one they were programmed for."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
