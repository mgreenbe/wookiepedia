While Princess Leia Organa and Tardi were traveling along a highway in New Escrow, the Rigellian porter jumped in front of their vehicle from an overpass, causing them to stop, and proceeded to rip their vehicle apart. He threatened to kill the Viscount when Leia produced a gravitational field disruptor and activated it on the porter, causing his weight to increase to the seventh power. The ground could then no longer support him, and he disappeared far beneath the planet's surface, leaving behind a deep hole."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
