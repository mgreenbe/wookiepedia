Features of their anatomy which distinguished them from baseline humans included neck wattles, spanchons, four stomachs, generative nodes, six-chambered hearts, nose tusks, long hairs which grew behind their ears, and horns. They were capable of living up to 110 years old; children were between 1-5 whilst they went through adolescence between 6-12 and were considered full adults by 13-40.

The truth was eventually discovered, and Eloms were granted the same rights as other sentient species. Despite their newly bestowed suffrage, Eloms did not seem to be interested in politics, and continued to live in their burrows. The Elomin continued to govern the world of Elom and represented the planet offworld. When the Galactic Empire came to power, they enslaved the Elomin to work in their own lommite mines. The Eloms staged raids and rescued numerous Elomin from slavery. After their planet was liberated by the Republic, the two species began integrating their societies together."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 9 ABY, an Elomin task force was engaged and destroyed by Grand Admiral Thrawn.
