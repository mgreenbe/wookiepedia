The three usually served on tours of duty together. During a tour of duty aboard the Nebulon-B Frigate Fogger, the group met a new recruit named Maarek Stele, who would later go on to become a legendary pilot and one of the Empire's most infamous figures. Alimet took an instant liking to Maarek and the four pilots would often spend their off-duty hours together. The four would later be reunited during a tour of duty under Vice Admiral Thrawn in the Pakuuni system aboard the Nebulon-B2 frigate Ludwick. Some time between the tour of duty aboard the Fogger and the tour of duty aboard the Ludwick, Alimet lost a ship during combat, but was able to eject in time and escape serious harm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alimet's third and final meeting with Stele would be on a notably more sober note.
