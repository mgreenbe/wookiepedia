The Freemakers traveled with the Mon Calamari ship engineer Quarrie and the Rebel Alliance pilot Valeria to the planet Jakku to assemble the Arrowhead, a powerful ship capable of changing the tide of the Galactic Civil War. Despite facing opposition from Imperial officers Durpin and Plumestriker, the Freemakers managed to build the ship and use it to save the Alliance Fleet from the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the Force-sensitive Rowan Freemaker received a Force vision telling him to build a powerful starship called the Arrowhead that could turn the tide of the war. Rowan and his family subsequently embarked on quest to build the Arrowhead, which led them to undertake a series of adventures to obtain its various components including embersteel blades, a proton suspension housing, and a giant kyber crystal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having obtained these parts, the Freemakers returned to the Alliance Fleet only to find it under attack by the Imperial Navy. Fighting through Imperial laser fire and TIE fighters, the Freemakers managed to land in the Home One's hangar. Since it was too dangerous to install the kyber crystal onto the Arrowhead in the middle of the battle, the Mon Calamari engineer Quarrie convinced the Freemakers that they had to assemble the ship elsewhere. Together with the seasoned Rebel Alliance pilot Lieutenant Valeria, they departed on the StarScavenger and Arrowhead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Test flight on Jakku"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After dodging TIE fighters, the Arrowhead and StarScavenger traveled to the deserted planet of Jakku in order to avoid drawing Imperial attention. The two starships landed safely on the desert world. However, the Arrowhead sank beneath the sands and exploded. The Freemakers, Quarrie and Valeria managed to find the components of the Arrowhead with the exception of the energy matrix activator; which had fallen into the hands of the Imperial officers Durpin and Plumestriker, who had been reassigned to Jakku as punishment for their repeated failures. With the Alliance fleet under fire, Admiral Gial Ackbar tasked Quarrie and the Freemakers with assembling the Arrowhead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zander Freemaker and Roger attempted to recover the energy matrix activator but were captured by Durpin and Plumestriker.

Meanwhile, Rowan and Quarrie had almost finished reassembling the Arrowhead. Valeria and the other Freemakers arrived with the Imperial AT-ST walker hot on their tail.

While it did not destroy the walker, it delayed the Imperials long enough for the Freemakers to finish powering up the ship.

With the capital ships defenseless, the Empire dispatched TIE bombers to destroy them. Shortly later, the StarScavenger and Arrowhead returned and shot down the bombers. At Kordi's suggestion, Zander used the Arrowhead's Embersteel Blade to slice through an Imperial Star Destroyer approaching the Home One, destroying the ship. The surviving Imperial Star Destroyers retreated into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the battle, the Freemakers received a hero's welcome from the Rebel Alliance for saving the Alliance fleet.
