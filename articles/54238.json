An adaptive being sometimes mistaken for a pest, mollusk-like Ghoel often glued himself to the palace's walls and arches, and used his prehensile tongue to lick other occupants of the court. He was present in the palace audience chamber in 4 ABY when Luke Skywalker delivered a message to Jabba the Hutt, and later licked C-3PO as the protocol droid translated Jabba's condemnation of Skywalker and his Rebel friends."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
