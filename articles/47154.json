He worked with Rose Tico and other engineers to learn how to use her baffler on the U-55 orbital loadlifters in order to mask their engine emissions. This would later prove instrumental in avoiding First Order detection when attempting to evade them during an attack on the Resistance's fleet, but would eventually prove futile when the First Order discovered the Resistance's escape plan.
