The squadron emerged from hyperspace to find the freighter as it was boarded by First Order troops. They engaged the TIE fighters and shuttles nearby, managing to destroy all eight of the TIEs and one shuttle before the remaining shuttle and the Yissira Zyde jumped into hyperspace. Lieutenant Muran, Rapier Four, was killed when his vessel was caught too close to the Yissira Zyde as it went into hyperspace and the X-wing exploded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Rapier Squadron's next patrol, Dameron embarked on a solo mission to search for the Yissira Zyde, forbidding the others to assist him.

Kun wore a bulky EVA suit and flew a Z-95 Headhunter for this mission in the Uvoss system. When the Hevurion Grace arrived in the system, Dameron disabled the ship with modified concussion missiles. He boarded the ship and forced the passengers and crew to evacuate into escape pods. While he was restarting the ships engines, a First Order fleet emerged out of hyperspace and attacked the pilots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ignoring Dameron's orders to escape, Kun and Arana stayed nearby to fight off the TIE fighters swarming the yacht. They destroyed nine of the eighteen TIEs before the Resistance pilots were trapped between a gas giant and the First Order fleet.

When L'ampar commented on the secrecy of the mission, Kun countered that he should be lucky that the Resistance allowed \"old-timers\" like him and Wexley near a starfighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Black Squadron traveled to the planet Ovanis, which was covered in mountains and ravines. While Dameron and BB-8 explored the Cave of the Cr\u00e8che, Kun and her fellow pilots circled above in their T-70 X-wing starfighters and L'ampar's A-wing starfighter. After establishing contact with the Cr\u00e8che cultists, Dameron informed L'ampar that he had found a tracker on his starfighter and warned that the First Order was on its way.

After studying the situation, Wexley proposed that they take control of the First Order platform since there was nowhere else to land on the mountainous planet. When Pava proposed drawing away the starfighters, Kun warned that the new TIE/sf space superiority fighters were faster and more maneuverable than X-wings. L'ampar then agreed to attack the TIE fighters, leading to a dogfight. Black Squadron managed to shoot down several TIE fighters but L'ampar accidentally downed the First Order platform, causing it to crash."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the First Order Agent Terex had kept the Maxima-A class heavy cruiser Ravenous in reserve.

Though Pava managed to destroy several pursuing TIE fighters, her astromech droid was hit. Under fire, Wexley realized that their plan was not working and ordered them to regroup for a head-on assault. Prior to the assault, Wexley confided that he had feelings for Kun. She responded that he would propose to her back at the Resistance base on D'Qar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the dogfight, Black Squadron managed to shoot down several TIE fighters.

After Dameron and the Cr\u00e8che cultists had subdued Terex and his men, Kun and her comrades refueled their starfighters at the Cave of the Cr\u00e9che. After the cultists departed on the back of the black winged creature, Black Squadron departed Ovanis. Before leaving, they radioed the Ravenous to pick up the stranded Terex.

Dameron had learned from the Cr\u00e8che leader that Tekka had spoke with Grakkus the Hutt, who was imprisoned at Megalox. The planet was a high gravity world and the prison was surrounded by a gravity field that was projected by an orbiting space station that served as the prison's control center.

After arriving at Grakkus' fortress, Kun and her fellow pilots were accosted by Grakkus and his Hutt posse. While Dameron met with Grakkus, Kun and the other pilots waited outside in the compound.

Grakkus then offered to reveal the information to whoever helped him escape Megalox."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Terex exited the building, Kun and her fellow pilots expressed surprise that the First Order agent had beaten them to Grakkus. Dameron then rejoined Black Squadron and told them that they were locked in a race with Terex to help Grakkus escape the prison. Dameron got BB-8 and the other astromech droids to embark on a mission to disable the prison's gravity shield in order to gain leverage over Grakkus and Terex. Meanwhile, Terex managed to convince the crime bosses Kan Be, Papa Toren, and Isin to organize them gangs for an attack on Grakkus' fortress in return for helping them escape offworld. Kun and her Black Squadron comrades were forced to fight off the gangsters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kun managed to obtain a blaster during the fight and helped hold off the assault long enough for BB-8 and the other droids to complete their mission. While Megalox Beta's high gravity overwhelmed the gangsters, Kun and her comrades were unaffected because they wore gravity belts. After rescuing Grakkus, Dameron contacted Luta and managed to convince her to let them escape with Grakkus in return for restoring the prison's gravity field. Having completed their mission, Black Squadron departed on their starfighters with Grakkus' ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Terex attacked the space station and several fleeing shuttles, Kun and her fellow pilots turned back at Temmin's urging and attacked Terex's ship Carrion Spike.

Instead, he brought BB-8, the technician Oddy Muva, and Organa's spymaster C-3PO."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the course of the mission, Dameron realized that Kun, Pava, and Wexley were innocent and that Muva was the true spy.

Muva reprogramming the Carrion Spike's battle computers to attack the \"Uglies.\" Muva then contacted Kun and her squadron mates and told her that he had sabotaged the Carrion Spike's computers and was evacuating his wife and Terex's slaves in escape pods.

Kun and the rest of Black Squadron then flew against the Ranc fighters for a final sortie. Shortly later, they witnessed a First Order Maxima-A class heavy cruiser and its TIE fighters destroying the Carrion Spike and the Ranc fleet. Kun and her comrades expressed shock that the First Order was targeting one of their own, not knowing that Terex was in trouble with his First Order superiors. After the escape pods had safely landed on the desert planet, Kun and her fellow pilots flew over Dameron as he was confronting Commander Malarus and a First Order landing party.
