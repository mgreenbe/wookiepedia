In ancient history, users of the dark side of the Force captured a Tirra'Taka and corrupted it to use in battle. The people of Serenno fought back, and the Tirra'Taka broke free, becoming trapped underneath the surface of the planet, becoming a Serennian legend, in which it supposedly held Serenno together. When the young Jedi initiate Dooku visited Serenno, the Tirra'Taka sensed the Force within him and awoke, causing groundquakes. Many years later, Dooku controlled the Tirra'Taka to help overthrow his brother Count Ramil, but was forced to kill it when the creature became uncontrollable."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tirra'Taka first appeared in the audiobook Dooku: Jedi Lost, written by Cavan Scott and published in 2019.
