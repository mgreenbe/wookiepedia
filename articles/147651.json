He was hired by General Emir to kill Princess Leia on Challon. The first attempt on her life came from the Holopix News photographer assassin. He was killed by Giles Durane and his partner Gimlet. After the attempt on her life, they began to train her. Emir became upset with the failure, but agreed to pay the Assassins Guild even more, now that Giles had become involved. Torgas then sent three more of his top assassins to kill Leia, but once again they failed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Emir became even more upset at the guild, and Torgas decided he would go himself to kill Leia, though Emir realized that Durane was the only person who had a chance to kill Leia.

When Gimlet attempted to warn Leia of the danger, he was killed by Torgas.
