Although such devices were considered ancient by the time of the First Order/Resistance War, bomber pilots kept describing the relative direction of objects using the analogy of a 12-hour mechanical clock. For example, a starfighter coming from directly in front and above the bomber pilot would be coming from \"12 high,\" while \"6 low\" referred to a fighter coming from the ground and behind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
