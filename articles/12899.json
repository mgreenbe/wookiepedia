The division was under the command of Imperial officer Colonel Barokki, though, according to Emperor Palpatine, demonstrated poor performance. Barokki was summoned before Palpatine and his enforcer, Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, to provide his report, but was Force choked by Vader due to his unit's performance. Palpatine ordered Vader to eventually release him, and thanked Barokki for the report, hoping that his division's performance would improve in the weeks to follow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Colonel Barokki eventually became embroiled in failed assassination attempts on Darth Vader. After Vader meditated, he remembered Barokki's audience with Palpatine, and later spoke to the Emperor about the conspiracy within the Imperial Officer Corps.
