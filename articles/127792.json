Solo had been speaking with the smuggler Jarril at the planet Coruscant's Crystal Jewel casino, and as Solo grew impatient with Jarril's meandering talk of investigating the faraway Smuggler's Run asteroid field, he noted that he had to return to his nearby home and make the pie. Solo eventually returned home and tended to his wife who, to Solo's surprise, had been injured during the bombing of the Senate Hall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Smuggler's Pie was mentioned in the 1996 novel The New Rebellion, written by Kristine Kathryn Rusch."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
