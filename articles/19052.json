Able to escape into the shadows when the clones attacked, Bon and several of his peers, including Initiate Nia, were rescued by a junk salvager named Hurd Coyle. Aboard his salvage ship, the Initiates remained together as Coyle promised to take them to a safe location."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During their travel, Coyle's ship picked up a damaged V-19 Torrent starfighter, hoping to salvage some of the ships parts. Coyle was surprised to learn that clone pilot HOB-147 was still alive. When the clone woke up and started to destroy Coyle's reprogrammed B1-Series battle droids Coyle shot the clone with an electro-dart and locked the pilot in a room. When the clone escaped he found the Jedi Initiates hiding in the junk ship's hold. Thinking that the clone was going to kill him and his peers, Bon and the other Initiates knocked the man unconscious. When he awoke, the clone was convinced by Initiate Nia to spare her peers' lives. Later, when Coyle's ship was boarded by stormtroopers of the newly christened Galactic Empire, who were looking for escaped Jedi, clone HOB-147 lied and said there weren't any Jedi aboard the ship, allowing Bon and his fellow Jedi to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
