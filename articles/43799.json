A combined effort of the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order headed by Jedi Master Avar Kriss managed to prevent a majority of the damage at Hetzal. However, further fragments of the wreckage continued to emerge from hyperspace across the Outer Rim Territories. The first Emergence occurred in the Ab Dalis system, with approximately twenty million people killed when a fragment struck the planet Ab Dalis. As a result of the disasters, Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh enacted closures of hyperspace routes throughout the Outer Rim. With a navidroid array created by Keven Tarr, the Republic was able to predict the locations of future Emergences, recovering the flight recorder of the Legacy Run to determine what had caused the initial disaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Emergences were created for the Star Wars: The High Republic publishing initiative.
