Zoologists theorized that voroos, which were immobile, reproduced through palaks, with the beetles exchanging genetic information with the large animals and then carrying the fertilized gametes to new environments. Voroos could be found on many planets across the galaxy in almost any environment, meaning if the theory was correct, palaks would be found in each of these areas as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Palaks first appeared in Creatures of the Galaxy, a sourcebook for West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game released in 1994.
