Together, the War Trust devised a new technology called Siantide, believing that it would outclass anything the Imperials could come up with. He was later targeted by the Empire, along with the rest of the War Trust, by Darth Baras' Plan Zero. Generals Minst and Frelka were the first to be hunted down and killed by Darth Baras' apprentice, a cunning and powerful Sith Warrior. When the Warrior infiltrated Durant's base, the General flaunted his prototype blaster powered by Siantide technology. Deciding it was time for a demonstration, Durant ordered his men to attack. However, they underestimated the Sith, who slaughtered them all. Mortally wounded, Durant promised that the Warrior would not defeat General Faraire. The Warrior mocked him, saying that he had died for nothing and promised to destroy everything he had built. Durant then expired."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
