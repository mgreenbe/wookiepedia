Though these plants could survive solely on water and sunlight like a normal plant, tooke-traps also preyed on small rodents and small arthropods (especially insects). Their main prey was the tooke, from which the species derived its common name. Because the fragrance it emitted was identical to that of tooke mating pheromones, tookes found it irresistible. Gungans found the carnivorous plants to be excellent house plants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tooke-trap plants would sometimes form a symbiotic relationship with shiros, where the reptiles rolled in mud and collected dirt and seeds between shell ridges. From this, tooke-traps grew and flourished in these \"soil pockets\" creating a symbiotic relationship nicknamed a \"shiro-trap\": tooke-traps provided camouflage for shiros against enemies like saw-toothed granks, and in return the shiros provided locomotion for their tooke-trap passengers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tooke-traps themselves were food for clodhoppers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
