There, Kestis overheard Mirienne speaking about how the situation in Kashyyyk was worse than on Zeffo. When Kestis questioned further, Mirienne elaborated that she used to live on Zeffo before the Empire arrived and they weren't able to fight back, but that on Kashyyyk there was a chance now that they had Wookiees with them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 201st Squadron was first mentioned in the 2019 video game by Respawn Entertainment Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order as the second of ten items in the Zeffo databank."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
