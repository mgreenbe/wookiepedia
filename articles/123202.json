The events of the book are concurrent with the events of the animated television series Star Wars Rebels but take place prior to the first episode involving Zare Leonis, the main character of the book.

Before submitting his application on his fifteenth birthday, he must spend one year preparing at the nearby Junior Academy of Applied Sciences preparatory school. A man named Janus Fhurek controls everything at the school, despite only being the athletic director, and he is not fond of the alien races being accepted at the school."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At AppSci, Zare befriends a girl named Merei Spanjaf, and the two join the school's grav-ball team, the SaberCats. Zare is made captain and placed in charge of the team. One of the other team members is Beck Ollet, the human son of local jogan fruit farmers. When the Imperials arrived on the planet, they bought up all the farms in the area with the stated goal of managing and improving production. Beck, Zare, and Merei decide to visit the farms one day, only to learn that the harvest of the delicate fruits is being handled by clumsy droids which are destroying the plants and the harvest. They report the incident to the Imperials, but nothing is done to rectify the situation. Zare shares his worries with his older sister Dhara who has already entered the Academy. They communicate via datapad and she sympathizes with his plight, but tells him he should keep his head down as he only needs to get through the one year at AppSci."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Months later, Beck and Zare head back to the farm only to see that it is no longer a farm and instead the area has been turned into strip mines. To make matters worse, the Imperials are using old equipment and not repairing the earth which will cause long-term ecological destruction. Near the mines are displaced farmers awaiting a meeting with the Imperials to protest their treatment. Beck and Zare watch from afar as the Imperials arrive, but rather than hearing the refugees' problems the Imperials open fire on them. The two race back home, and the next morning Zare hears on the HoloNet reports that the refugees instigated a fight forcing the Imperials to respond in kind."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The SaberCats make it through the season to the grand finals.
