Hextrophon has just heard about the Imperial attack on Coruscant and expresses his shock. Hextrophon was injured on Caprioril and is now resting at Mon Mothma's dacha by Lake Sah'Ot on Chandrila. He believes it is a dark time for the galaxy but it is much better off than it was ten years ago. Hextrophon mentions that though the Imperials are gaining victories, they can't seem to cooperate with each other. He then asks Voren to forward the recordings of the fighting on Coruscant to some of the more skeptical members of his staff and reassures Voren about Rivoche Tarkin's safety."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
