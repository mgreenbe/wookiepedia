Long before the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, some Jedi Padawans would travel to Zoph in order to seek Zophis crystals for use in the construction of their lightsabers, which would produce a devastating but unstable blade due to the crystals' unique resonance. Lightsabers made using Zophis crystals could carve through durasteel plating with ease, but suffered from vulnerability to fluctuations in power from their crystal core."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the planet Ilum and its crystals increased in prominence within the Jedi Order, the use of Zophis crystals declined. By the time of the Clone Wars, Zophis crystals were extremely rare and valued at 11,000 credits. Records still existed of the crystals' use in lightsabers, but with Zoph under the control of the Confederacy, any attempts by Jedi to retrieve them would be met with hostility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zophis crystals were mentioned in Rise of the Separatists, a roleplaying supplementary sourcebook for the Star Wars Roleplaying series that was published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
