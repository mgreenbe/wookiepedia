Acting on information that the sublight drive of the Victory-class Star Destroyer The Chariot was faulty\u2014which meant that the weapons and shields of the vessel could not be fully-powered\u2014the Alliance's Cluster Navy of nearly one hundred small starships engaged the Star Destroyer in an attempt to destroy it. However, the information was faulty; the original sublight drive was inoperable but a newer one had been secretly installed, allowing the weapons to function. Fortunately for the Alliance, the hull plating removed to install the drive had not been fully replaced, allowing a single ship to attack its weak point and destroy it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
