They came in a variety of shapes, from spherical to pancake-like. Whatever their shape, all Greethka had three long pseudopods, which they could extrude from any section of their body, to grab food. Greethka preferred to live in large ponds that were fed by underground streams, although they sometimes chose to live in fast-moving rivers. Greethka ate almost anything and if their diets were not regulated, they would grow uncontrollable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Greethka could sense heat through sensors just under the surface of their outer membranes.
