It was located around the Tower of Eyes, Fortress Mountain Arena and the Clutter Junkyard. The rainforest world was home to the Gamorreans, who had made it impossible to visit their planet in the past. But since the Hutts hired the Gamorreans as guards and soldiers, the Podracing community created racecourses there. Watchtower Run was the first of Gamorr's three Podraces, and the last course of the Galactic Trials. The Glymphid Podracer Aldar Beedo was the track favorite, and helmed most of the course's speed and knockout records during 22 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
