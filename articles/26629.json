The crystalline planet was invaded by the battle droid armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems but were repelled by the Jedi and Clone troopers dispatched by the Galactic Republic. Later, the planet was the site of a second battle between the Republic and the Separatists. After the transformation of the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire, the planet was placed under Imperial control, but nevertheless hosted rebellious elements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Christophsis's surface was covered in forests of naturally occurring, turquoise crystal spires, making a dramatic and beautiful landscape.

Alderaanian Senator Bail Organa visited the world to undertake relief work. However, he and his relief mission was trapped by a Separatist fleet led by Admiral Trench. A Republic fleet led by Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Admiral Wullf Yularen clashed with Trench's fleet and managed to defeat it following a lengthy battle. This enabled the Republic to deliver vital supplies to Organa and his men."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic then established a military base on Christophsis and began a campaign to retake the planet from Separatist forces under General Whorm Loathsom and Count Dooku's Sith assassin Asajj Ventress. During the fighting, Kenobi and Skywalker hatched a plan to trap Separatist droid forces advancing from two towers. However, their plan failed due to the presence of a traitor within the ranks of the clone trooper forces: Clone Sergeant Slick. Working together, the clone officers Cody and Rex managed to capture Slick. Meanwhile, Kenobi and Skywalker narrowly escaped a trap at the Separatist base set by Ventress."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before Slick's capture, the rogue clone trooper managed to damage most of the Republic's weapons, except for their heavy cannons, which were saved by the clones. The Republic forces' problems were further complicated by the advance of Loathsom's Retail Caucus droid forces. Despite being outgunned and outnumbered, the Jedi and Republic were relieved by a young Padawan named Ahsoka Tano, who had been sent by Jedi Master Yoda to be Skywalker's apprentice. Working together, Skywalker and Tano managed to infiltrate the Separatist lines and shut down their deflector shield generator while Kenobi stalled the Separatist forces by \"negotiating\" with Loathsom. This tactic paid off and the Republic succeeded in turning the tables on the Separatist forces and capturing Loathsom. Newsreels at Kamino's military complex carried reports of the Christophsis campaign."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "About two years after the Christophsis campaign, the Confederacy still maintained a military base on the planet that was largely manned by B1-series battle droids. After fleeing the Republic Venator-class Star Destroyer Vigilance, the Separatist leader Count Dooku, the turncoat Jedi Master Quinlan Vos, and Ventress crash-landed on Christophsis' surface. By this stage, Ventress had been cast out by Dooku and had struck an alliance with the Jedi in return for helping Vos to kill Dooku. Dooku and Vos were subsequently pursued by a Republic landing force led by Kenobi and Skywalker. Unknown to everyone, Vos secretly planned to get Dooku to lead him to his master Darth Sidious so that he could destroy the Sith once and for all."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After trudging through Christophsis' crystalline landscape, the three travelers reached the Separatist military base. There, Dooku contacted his master Darth Sidious to secure safe passage from Christophsis. Shortly later, the Republic bombarded the Separatist base. In the midst of the bombardment, Dooku attempted to kill Vos with Force lightning but hit Ventress instead. Ventress' death brought Vos back to the light side and he refused to strike down Dooku; realizing that it would only lead him to the dark side. Dooku managed to escape offworld with the help of Sidious while Kenobi and Skywalker took a penitent Vos into custody."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the transformation of the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire, a rebel cell known as the Spectres raided an Imperial convoy en route to Christophsis in space. This was the second in a string of raids that had snared an Imperial convoy to Ryloth. The rebels then went to raid convoys near Kashyyyk and Toydaria before settling down on the Outer Rim world of Lothal. The Empire also stole the kyber crystals that were holy to the natives and used them for the Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rebellious elements traced by the Galactic Empire to the planet Christophsis were found to be responsible for the theft of one of the Empire's medical frigates. The Empire conducted a series of arrests, executed the planet's prime minister for treason and \"pacified\" the city of Tophen as an example to the populace, in the hope of quelling radical elements."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the time of the Battle of Jakku, five pilgrims from the Church of the Force\u2014the MA-B0 cargo lifter droid Mabo, Addar the human, Jumon the Iakaru, Madrammagath the Elomin, and Uggorda the Duros\u2014undertook a mission to Christophsis to return several stolen kyber crystals. They had been dispatched by the pastor and philanthropist Brin Izisca. Over a thirteen day period, the pilgrims navigated through Christophsis' dangerous terrain. Maddrammagath, Uggorda, and Jumon were killed by several fearsome Force-sensitive creatures called Kyaddak. Despite the deaths of their companions, Mabo and Addar manged to return the crystals to a broken crystal wall.
