Their language used pulses and contours in magnetic fields as its basic units. It was also versatile enough to produce their culture's equivalent of singing. Wol Cabasshite communication had an effective range of 25 meters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Certain Wol Cabasshites used their magnetic abilities to directly manipulate the neurons of non-Wol Cabasshites for communication, an ability which was seemed to be a form of telepathy. Members of other species also made devices which Wol Cabasshites could magnetically manipulate to communicate non-magnetically."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
