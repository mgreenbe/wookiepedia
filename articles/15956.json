The pair acted as picket vessels and attempted to stop the launch of the YT-1300 light freighter Limping Lady from Docking Bay 35 at the spaceport in Mos Eisley, as the vessel was believed to be carrying crates of stolen Imperial-issue heavy blasters. The two vessels transmitted orders for the ship to return to port.

Despite the fracturing of the Empire into warlord states following the Battle of Endor two years previously, Kermen had stayed loyal to the Imperial Advisors ruling the remnants of the Empire. Kermen took Belligerent to the planet Kaal, in the Yushan sector of the Mid Rim. Tirgee Benyalle had ruled the world since the Empire withdrew from the planet following the defeat at Endor and was accepting bids from various delegations over the right to harvest food from Kaal's oceans for their own purposes. Kermen was charged by the Imperial Advisors to secure the planet's bounty for the Empire.

The crew were on full alert, prepared to counter any move that Prentioch's ship made. On the surface, Kermen made his move during the negotiations; the Admiral had no intention of peacefully negotiating for the rights to Kaal's aquaculture industry, preferring to settle the matter by force. Over the course of a month, he had infiltrated his own agents into the crew of Benyalle's sail barge, aboard which the final negotiations were to take place. He attacked Benyalle and the assembled delegations, but Benyalle was rescued by the New Republic representatives. Kermen's agents clashed with reinforcements summoned by Prentioch from orbit aboard the sail barge, and eventually, Syndic Pandis Hart\u2014who was in reality the smuggler Talon Karrde\u2014rescued Benyalle and the New Republic delegation, blowing up the sail barge at the same time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In orbit, Belligerent and Prentioch began to attack one another, trading turbolaser fire that was visible from the surface of the planet.
