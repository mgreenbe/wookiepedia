In order to evade Imperial stormtroopers on the streets of Mos Eisley, among other things, the two droids posed as employees of a fictional company\u2014Skywalker Technical Maintenance Service."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker Technical Maintenance Service was an extremely small business. Its labor pool consisted entirely of one astromech droid and one protocol droid.

He directed the two droids to service an energy lathe that was running out of synch.

They closed and locked the door and waited for the stormtroopers to pass by. The two droids opened the door once again and spotted Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi heading for Docking Bay 94. Reunited with their new master, the two employees of Skywalker Technical Maintenance Service abandoned the task that they had promised to take care of without even beginning to ameliorate the energy lathe's unsatisfactory condition, likely sullying the reputation of the fake company to which they allegedly belonged."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
