On a mission to recapture Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, Fisto came face to face with General Grievous, nearly defeating the Jedi killer. However, the tide of the battle changed when Grievous activated his personal droid bodyguards and then slew Fisto's newly Knighted former Padawan, Nahdar Vebb. At the height of the Clone Wars, he assisted Obi-Wan Kenobi on Ord Cestus and subsequently dueled with Asajj Ventress in order to stop the manufacturing of the Jedi Killer droids.

Upon Anakin Skywalker's revelation that Palpatine was in fact Darth Sidious, Fisto, along with Mace Windu, Agen Kolar, and Saesee Tiin, attempted to arrest the Supreme Chancellor, but failed.

Trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, his distinctive head tentacles contained highly sensitive olfactory receptors that allowed him to detect pheromonal expressions of emotion and other changes in body chemistry. This was indeed a unique attribute not afforded to any other species of Jedi, either naturally or through the Force.

Training Eerin to knighthood, Jedi Fisto was in no hurry to take another Padawan, preferring to attend to his duties at the Temple. However, another Padawan would be in Fisto's future shortly after being raised to the rank of Jedi Master. Nahdar Vebb, a Mon Calamari male entered into an apprenticeship with Fisto, learning the ways of the Force from the quiet Nautolan Jedi.\nIn 23 BBY, Masters Mace Windu and Kit Fisto responded to an emergency call by Obi-Wan Kenobi to provide backup for the liberation of the Fondor system from the machinations of Groodo the Hutt and Fondorian Senator Rodd.

After visiting Master Cloner Sayn Ta, the Jedi pair deduced that there was a Kaminoan traitor in the facility. Fisto and Secura traced the traitor and faced off against a group of super battle droids, which were given to the traitor by her allies in the Confederacy. In the resulting skirmish, Secura was thrown off a platform and dragged down into the water by one of the destroyed battle droids. Fisto quickly jumped after her and, being amphibious, breathed for the both of them by locking lips with the Twi'lek. Secura was then able to climb up the platform only to be grabbed by the traitor, with the nano-virus injector pointed to her arm.

Chancellor Palpatine, not wanting Ord Cestus to produce an army of these droids, sends Fisto to the planet to investigate the source. Accompanying Fisto to Ord Cestus was Obi-Wan Kenobi, ARC trooper \"Nate,\" four clone troopers, and barrister Doolb Snoil, who was a representative of the Galactic Senate. They traveled to the planet Ord Cestus in order to negotiate an agreement that would sell the \"bio-droids\" to the Republic; however, the plan soon became to recruit guerrillas to fight in a possible coup against the government. This attracted many farmers and miners whose lives were destroyed by the Five Families and wanted revenge against the government. Fisto went by the false name of \"Nemonus\", a Dark Jedi, to trick the Five Families, whom the Jedi discovered to have complete control over the planet. However, the plot was discovered and both Jedi and the clone troopers were forced to retreat to the mountains west of the capital."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Near the end of the operation, he dueled with Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress.

They soon realized that they had entered the sanctuary of General Grievous, who happened to be approaching the citadel they were infiltrating.

However, Vebb, feeling a strong urge to defeat the Jedi killer once and for all, disputed with Fisto from the other side of the threshold. Vebb's fate was decided when Grievous' doctor, EV-A4-D, remotely sealed the door between the two Jedi and alerted Grievous. After taking care of the medical droid, Fisto could only watch in despair as Vebb was shot down by Grievous' hidden blaster, drawn via one of the General's free appendages.

It wouldn't last long however: Fisto retaliated by locking Grievous' numerous blades. Fisto told Grievous that he may have once been a glorious warrior, but he was now just Dooku's pawn. Grievous responded by saying he wielded great power, then attempted to strike him down. Fisto ducked under the blade then severed one of Grievous' hands, reclaiming Vebb's lightsaber in the process. Warning that such power would only consume him, Fisto then switched to Jar'Kai and evened the odds against his ailing opponent. As he was about to pin Grievous to the cliff's wall, Grievous' IG-100 MagnaGuards suddenly appeared and surrounded him. Ignoring Grievous taunts and offer of a quick death, Fisto jumped toward his starfighter with the aid of the Force and departed, leaving a fuming Grievous behind.
