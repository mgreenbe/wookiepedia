Around 34 ABY, the waitress took orders from the crew of the smuggler Ana Tolla, though their orders came back to them incorrect. Shortly afterward, the cantina was raided by a gang of bounty hunters, who intended to kidnap the waitress over a debt that she owed. The waitress attempted to escape, grabbing onto Izal Garsea, a member of Tolla's crew, but the bounty hunters seized the Trandoshan, retreating from the cantina with their captive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Trandoshan waitress appeared in the novel A Crash of Fate, written by Zoraida C\u00f3rdova and published in 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
