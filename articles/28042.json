Located in the Red Light Sector of Nar Shaddaa's underground, Club Ufora was one of the more seedier establishments on the moon. In the year 3643 BBY, it was discovered by a Republic allied individual that the back area of Club Ufora had several slave crates. After investigating further, the hero found out that the Republic's Lieutenant Rale was being held captive. He informed the hero that several other officers had been taken captive as well. He thought that it was possible that the other captive officers could have been held in the Quarantine Zone. His theory proved right, and Club Ufora's operation was shut down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
