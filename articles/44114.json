Jenkins is also a biographer of Harrison Ford. His interview subjects include Sir Alec Guinness, John Dykstra, David Prowse, Charles Lippincott, Peter Mayhew, Kenny Baker, Howard G. Kazanjian and Gary Kurtz, who is a likely source of the book's behind-the-scenes photos. (Pictures from the Tunisia filming of Episode IV feature Kurtz's young daughters on the set, sometimes wearing Jawa costumes.)"}]}
