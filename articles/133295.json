Organa wasn't comfortable being very high up from the ground, instead wishing they were doing this on Alderaan. Holod then took off, flying down through the streets and making reckless turns. Organa then asked Holdo to turned on the autopilot so they can enter a skylane. But instead Holdo wanted to do something dangerous. She drove the speeder straight down, soaring to the lower levels of Coruscant. Holdo wanted to see something down in Level 4. Organa tried to get Holdo to stop as they reached the lower levels.

She said it would cost them five credits to do so. But Organa's credits were stolen so she couldn't pay Forzaa. Holdo came up with a plan and told Forzaa that Organa was the Princess of Alderaan. In order to determine if this was true Forzaa requested that Organa place her hands on her Liga crystal. She reluctantly agreed and placed her hands on the crystal. The crystal determined that she was telling but Forzaa still requested the credits. Organa told her she didn't have them she searched her pockets and found the five credits that were needed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they continued on, Organa's hands also glowed after she touched the crystal. They realized that if they followed how strongly her hands were glowing in different directions it would lead them to the museum. They returned the speeder and headed off deeper into the levels of Coruscant. The glow on Organa's hands started to dimmer.
