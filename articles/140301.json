The term Tarisian was used to describe people and products from the planet, which took over a millennium to build, after being settled by Human colonists from unknown origins. Eventually Alien species settled or visited the city and before long the Republic took notice of the world and the planet's ecumenopolis quickly developed over a century of prosperity, and as a result the planet suffered from massive overpopulation. Once a galactic nexus that earned great wealth from its strategic position on hyperspace routes, Taris' importance declined with the discovery of improved trade routes, and the planet rapidly fell into decay with a slow mass migration of its residents across the galaxy. The remainder of the planet's history was wrought with civil disorder and social unrest. As it turned to industry as a means of compensation for its economic troubles, its oceans became polluted, eliminating the planet's main food source. After a century of the planet's ecosystem dying off, famine spread among the lower classes while the rich hoarded what few supplies remained. The resulting strife led to the Tarisian Civil War, the start of lasting prejudices between the Humanocentric Tarisian nobles and the largely alien underclass. The city became segmented, the lower classes were banned from living in the upper levels of Taris and the planet became the poster child of a economically dying world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Mandalorian Wars, Taris served as a crucial rallying point for dissident Jedi who had decided to fight against the invading Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders. As the lower classes were crushed beneath the rich, crime became rampant, and the Tarisian government did little in response. This caused Lhosan Industries, a mining company which employed half of the planet's lower class in its operation, to leave Taris. The millions left unemployed rioted against the government, even spreading up to the middle levels and kidnapping the planet's senator in the Galactic Senate as well as the local constable. This caused the local Jedi to leave Taris as well, leaving the planet in a state of chaos, as the war raged on around it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Jedi Civil War, order had been restored, but swoop gangs and crime still held sway over the Lower City. During the war, Taris was conquered by Darth Revan's Sith Empire, which quarantined the planet in an attempt to capture Jedi Bastila Shan. As the search continued fruitlessly, the Sith leader Darth Malak ordered the bombardment of Taris, killing countless civilians. This act had huge political repercussions for the Sith and changed the tone of the rest of the war, showing Malak and the Sith's true colors, the desire to achieve victory at any cost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next few millennia the planet managed to rebuild and recover from its devastation, though never reaching the extent of its former glory.

The towers of the city were tall and gleaming, possessing a unique, universally-rounded appearance not found on other ecumenopolies. However, beneath the planet's initial pristine exterior lay the result of many years of lawlessness and oppression. In the Lower City of Taris, the largely non-human population lived in total poverty and desperation, prevented from entering the safer Upper City, which was almost exclusively inhabited by rich Humans. Following the bombardment of Taris at the hands of Darth Revan's Sith Empire, the city was left in ruins.

In 5100 BBY, the whole surface of the landmass was covered in a giant city which would become the Undercity, which housed the sewers, which existed between the Promised Land and the Undercity and was built sometime after. In 4600 BBY, as the population spread another city was built on top of it which would become the Lower City and then another in 4400 BBY, the Middle City above that and finally in 4300 BBY, the Upper City was constructed and the Promised Land was abandoned and was eventually lost and forgotten.

The city's grandeur was once said to rival the galactic capital, Coruscant, for 144 years. However, the planet wasn't truly a planet-wide city, as unlike other city-planets such as Coruscant and Nar Shaddaa, it contained an ocean.

By this point, the Promised Land had been rediscovered. To maintain the planet's economy, Taris turned to industry, where the Tarisian industrialists switched to a new, cheaper power source, that produced toxic waste as a byproduct, which began to slowly pollute the once-pristine ocean, in a century of destruction of the kelp farms and most of the marine life. While the issue of of its overpopulation had been lifted, the city was slowly dying, which was an economical urban decay that would last for 200 years. When the Republic had abandoned the planet in 4156 BBY, Taris's population had likely numbered in the tens of billions, but by the time of the Sith occupation in 3956 BBY, the city's inhabitants had dwindled to just six billion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4086 BBY Taris received an extremely harsh review in Trampeta's Star Guide, as it was given the lowest possible recommendation.

While probably not having any influence on the development of the planet itself, it was nonetheless a reflection of the decay that Taris was undergoing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually the rakghoul disease ended up in the Tarisian Undercity by unknown means. This caused the city to be abandoned and the sewer system was left to disrepair and was eventually overrun by rakghouls and Gamorrean slavers but it still served as the planet's infrastructure.

Panicking, the greedy Tarisian nobles hoarded the remaining kelp and marine life for themselves. Around 4056 BBY, a century before the Jedi Civil War, the starving lower-class engaged the nobles in a massive civil war, where millions of innocents died and large sections of Taris were destroyed or abandoned. The Promised Land was lost once more and became a legend amongst the lower class faction. Ultimately, the nobles emerged victorious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tarisian prisons couldn't hold all the rebels, so the nobles began the tradition of banishing criminals and their descendants to the Undercity, unable to return to the surface under pain of death. These people became the Outcasts. They built a village, but suffered from starvation, rakghoul attacks, and rakghoul infections; all hope for them was lost save for the legendary Promised Land. The remaining kelp along with the remaining oceanic fauna was consumed to extinction by the Tarisian nobles in which they were then forced to rely on imported food. Also, because many of the rebels were aliens, the human nobles became prejudiced against non-humans, and banished them from the Upper City to the Lower City, punishing any that dared to enter the upper levels without a permit. Thus began the long oppression by the Humanocentric Tarisian nobility of the non-human lower class. The Lower City's conflicts with the rakghouls continued but the locals continued to emerge victorious. Their hope for improving their lives was to save up until they could leave the world. Naturally, this gave the planet a very bad reputation to off-worlders both human and alien.

Many gangs oppressed the common Lower City citizens. It was here that swoop racing captured the imagination of the galaxy around 4000 BBY. Using an intricate system of hyperspace beacons, Tarisian race organizers broadcast the results of their swoop races throughout the galaxy, which eventually gave rise to a huge and profitable gambling operation and was funded by Czerka Corporation. The planet also began to export Tarisian ale that was made from a gland from a tach. Taris remained a hub for swoop racing for decades, becoming the center of the Galactic Swoop Racing Circuit. It was at this time that the Exchange based itself on Taris and the Taris Civil Authority only accepted bribes to keep quiet or collaborate in their operations.

The planet served as a staging point for dissident Jedi who where led by Revan and his apprentice Malak and their allies for campaigns against the Mandalorians who based themselves in the Jedi Academy. Many Exchange members sold their slaves to the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders; among them was the slaver Xor and the slave Juhani in the Lower City.

The local authorities assured Lhosan Industries that they had the swoop gangs fully under control, and would take care of them with the assistance from the local Jedi.

The riots soon spilled up into the Middle City. Crime began to envelop Taris.

Jervo Thalien, head of Lhosan, became frantic since it was Goravvus who had installed Lhosan on the planet and Jervo had arranged a Senate seat in the Grand Convocation Chamber of the Senate Building on Coruscant for him in return. He hired Marn Hierogryph and the Moomo Brothers to retrieve the Senator. He promised Hierogryph a reprieve of the Massacre charges and most of the bounties on him lifted, but also secretly ordered the Moomo Brothers to kill Goravvus, as he had become a liability. Haydel Goravvus the Senator that represented the planet in the Galactic Senate disappeared, and the constable's family was kidnapped. Due to the political anarchy, the Jedi based on Taris were recalled to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, abandoning the Tarisians to their fates.
