During the Clone Wars, a three year long galactic power struggle between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, Elsbeth's people were slaughtered, and this massacre greatly angered Elsbeth, convincing her to help build up the Imperial Navy by plundering entire worlds of their resources. Circa 9 ABY, the former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano recounted the story of Elsbeth's people to the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin. By that time, Elsbeth, by now a servant of Grand Admiral Thrawn, had taken control of the city of Calodan on the forest planet Corvus, and Djarin speculated she was plundering the planet like she had done to many others for the Empire. Working together, Djarin and Tano liberated the city, and Tano asked her where Thrawn was located."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The people appeared in the fifth episode of the second season of The Mandalorian, where they were represented by Morgan Elsbeth, portrayed by Diana Lee Inosanto.
