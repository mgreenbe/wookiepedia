After landing their TIE fighter on the rocky, oceanic world, the two track Rivas' TIE/fo space superiority fighter to the east.

To avoid revealing their First Order identities, Captain Phasma tells TN-3465 to identify herself as Pilot while Phasma calls herself Captain.

Regarding technology as an evil that spoiled that former homeworld, they destroyed their starships and adopted a primitive lifestyle based on fishing and farming. However, Luprora's climate deteriorated with rising sea levels and unpredictable waves eliminating much of the land they had settled and farmed. The Lupr'or also came under attack from Tsw'ells and a race of creatures known as the R'ora.
