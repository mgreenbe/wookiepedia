It also had the secondary effect of filling the blast area with a temporary smokescreen. Some gas grenades were more lethal, such as the FEX-M3 nerve gas grenade and poison grenade. Droids were immune to the grenades' effects as they did not breathe. Some beings, such as the Gand, were likewise immune due to the fact that they wore breath masks. Some Jedi were able to use the Force to rid themselves of the poison."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to concussion grenades and stun grenades, all Zero-gravity stormtrooper armor incorporated shoulder-mounted grenade launchers that were loaded with gas grenades."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
