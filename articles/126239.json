Abeloth deployed several Sith shadow-ghouls against the New Jedi Order when the Jedi assaulted the Sith in the New Jedi Temple on the capital planet Coruscant in 44 ABY. Jedi Master Saba Sebatyne, Jedi Knight Tahiri Veila and survivors of Void Jumpers led by Sergeant Major Gef Olazon fought some on their way to destroy Abeloth inside Jedi Temple Computer Core room. The only way to stop constantly emerging shadow-ghouls, were to close eyes of their animated host bodies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
