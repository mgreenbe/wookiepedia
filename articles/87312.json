The hideout was located sixty meters above the surface of a canyon and it consisted of a network of caves, the largest of which was just big enough to land a small freighter in. The nook was sizable enough to house about a dozen people and over the years, it served as a residence to various criminals, hermits, outlaws and refugees."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
