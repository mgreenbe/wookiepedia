The rogue clone Wrecker used the patches when suffering from frequent headaches at the beginning of the Imperial Era, which, unbeknownst to him or his squad, were caused by his frequent head injuries aggravating his implanted inhibitor chip, a mind-control device implanted in all of the clones to make them carry out Order 66.
