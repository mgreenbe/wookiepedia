The building's entrance hallway was in the shape of a rectangular loop, with a wall between the building's entrance and the entrance to the museum proper. The main room was dominated by the skeleton of a krayt dragon from the desert world of Tatooine, and the museum had at least two side rooms that branched off the main chamber. When the Republic Military occupied the museum, one of the side rooms and part of the main room was occupied by scientific equipment for Doctor Nasan Godera's work."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3640 BBY, during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, the Empire invaded the Core World of Corellia and instigated the Battle of Corellia. During the later stages of the lengthy conflict, the Republic Military secured the Science Museum and established a command post there under Colonel Brint of the Eighty-third Battalion. Doctor Nasan Godera, scientific adviser to the Republic's General Var Suthra, set up a lab there, and, on Suthra's orders, he dispatched probe droids to search for Tol Braga, a Jedi Master who had been corrupted by the Sith Emperor and put to work furthering the Emperor's plans to kill thousands in order to start a dark-side ritual."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Godera's efforts met with success around the same time the unit of Jedi under the leadership of the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython arrived at the museum. Senator Jol Zackin soon arrived at the museum to request Brint's aid in rescuing imprisoned Corellian citizens, but Brint and Zackin were still arguing over the subject when the Hero of Tython arrived. The Knight settled the disagreement, dispatching the Outer Rim Jedi to rescue the civilians despite Brint's attempts to bribe the Knight into using the Jedi to attack Imperial medical camps. The Hero of Tython then met with Godera, who sent the Knight to take out the Empire's Firestorm Turbolasers that Braga's Sith subordinates were setting up in buildings around Axial Park. Godera himself continued his work to locate the source of the transmissions to the Sith in those buildings in hopes of locating Braga himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, while the Jedi was gone, the Science Museum was attacked by Imperial forces. Brint was among the few survivors and contacted Suthra for aid, though by the time Suthra arrived with reinforcements and eliminated the Imperial invaders, most of the Republic forces stationed there\u2014including Godera\u2014had been killed in the fighting. Suthra's forces largely abandoned the museum after the attack, moving into Coronet's Government District as the Republic continued to gain ground against the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Corellian Science Museum appears as a class-restricted phase for the Jedi Knight-class mission \"Firestorm\" in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011.
