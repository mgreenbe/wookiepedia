It consisted primarily of Imperial Patrol Frigates such as the Bloodprice commanded by Captain Ors Dogot. These were equipped with powerful sensor equipment to enable them to track ships in hyperspace and provide advance warning of any attack on Prakith, but they were also expected to locate, attack and capture any New Republic warships or enemy freighters that strayed into Prakith territory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
