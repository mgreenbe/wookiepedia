The staff had two handles of metal.  One end of the staff was capped with an enclosure for a kyber crystal sliver, offering a symbolic source of inner illumination and allowing \u00cemwe to better gauge where the end of the staff was through the sound of the battery and crystal harmonic. During the Imperial occupation of Jedha's Holy City, \u00cemwe used the staff as a weapon against the Empire's stormtroopers, misleading his victims into believing the staff was merely a blind man's walking stick. \u00cemwe later went on to use the staff in the Battle of Scarif, where he was instrumental in the Rebel Alliance's successful theft of the Death Star plans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
