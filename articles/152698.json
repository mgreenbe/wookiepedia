After Sy Snootles learned of Ziro's whereabouts, she went to the prison and, in order to get past the guards, convinced this guard and the other one that Gardulla the Hutt requested to see which one of them is the stronger, so they started fighting. Snootles then told a third guard to break up the fight between these two, and all three guards fought to the death. Their bodies were later found by the Hutt Grand Council."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
