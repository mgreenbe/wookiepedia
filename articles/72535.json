Around 3956 BBY the cantina was operated by Junix Nard, who was also the bartender. He employed two Jawa servers, and the establishment featured two Bith musicians and a Twi'lek dancer, as well as a Bith hologram. Nard also ran a small store, but had limited selection as Czerka only worried about keeping their own stores full."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Revan and Bastila Shan stopped by the cantina in 3956 BBY during their search for the Tatooine Star Map. There Bastila encountered her mother, Helena, whom she had not seen in many years. Also in the cantina at the time was a swoop racing veteran named Gandroff, a pazaak player named Furko Nellis, and two Czerka officers, as well as a handful of other patrons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It seemed that the bar was a place favored by Czerka officers to relax and worry about their job issues when not working at the Czerka office. Several local people were worrying about issues with the war at the time Revan visited, fearing that if Darth Malak would demolish Taris-a valuable world with billions of people- to defeat the Republic, what grim fate would come to Tatooine if he arrived. However, their fears were unfounded as the Sith Lord was infinitely more concerned with capturing Bastila Shan and conquering the Core Worlds than seizing a remote planet with nothing to offer but sand, savage natives and worthless ore."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the early days of the Galactic Empire, the cantina, by this point known as Junix's Joint, was staffed by a Duros bartender and his wife, Yoona."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Junix's Joint first appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic under the ownership of Junix Nard.
