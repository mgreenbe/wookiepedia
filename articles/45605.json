In 130 ABY, at the end of the war, the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Krayt seized the Imperial throne from Fel. Adare continued to serve the Imperial Mission as a part of Krayt's Empire, and by 137 ABY, he was assigned to the Imperial Mission's station on the Outer Rim planet Tatooine in the city of Mos Eisley."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In that same year, Adare met the Zeltron Deliah Blue\u2014who was pretending to be an Imperial Missionary in order to find a trivalve assembly needed to fix her crew's ship, the Mynock\u2014in Mos Eisley. She introduced herself to him as Astraal Vao and asked where the local mission house was. Adare offered to take her there as she told him that a farmer who had helped her needed a new trivalve assembly for his transport. After they arrived at the mission house, Adare shared his views on the local Imperial Mission and the organization's role in the galaxy with Blue, who reminded Adare that the farmer needed the trivalve assembly. Adare retrieved the part and traveled with Blue to Mos Eisley's spaceport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving at the Mynock's location in the spaceport, Adare was held at gunpoint by Blue, who instructed him to give her the trivalve assembly and leave the spaceport. However, he insinuated that he would alert the local authorities and suggested that she kill him in order to ensure his silence. Blue grew frustrated, and Adare revealed that he knew that she was not really Astraal Vao, since he had met the Imperial Missionary before. She revealed her true identity to him and began weeping over the fact that her inability to install the trivalve assembly would lead to the Black Sun crime syndicate finding and killing Cade Skywalker and Jariah Syn, two of her friends. After hearing this, Adare gave her the part for the Mynock, stating that she should have asked for assistance in the beginning. He then offered his help in installing the trivalve assembly on the Mynock, much to Blue's surprise. With Adare's assistance, Blue was able to successfully repair the Mynock and leave Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As an Imperial Missionary, Ethan Adare believed in the principles of the organization, which operated on Emperor Roan Fel's \"Victory Without War\" initiative.

Despite knowing that Deliah Blue was lying to him about her identity, Adare still assisted her in locating a trivalve assembly. After she revealed her true identity and began degrading herself, he made it a point to tell her that she was not worthless and offered further assistance in installing the trivalve assembly aboard the Mynock, despite having been held at gunpoint by Blue moments before.
