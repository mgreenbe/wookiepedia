An ecumenopolis, its surface was covered entirely in urban sprawl. Its city lights were visible from space. The capital of Nar Shaddaa was Hutta Town, which was made up of huge tower blocks with a patchwork of shanty town structures called skyslums filling every available space between the towers. It was ruled by Grakkus the Hutt. Other settlements included Wormstew Town, and the Corellian Sector. Some known locations on Nar Shaddaa including the Palace of Grakkus the Hutt, which hosted a gladiatorial arena, a seedy bar owned by an unscrupulous Zabrak bartender, and Wormstew Town hospital."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Nar Shaddaa had a reputation as a haven for pirates and outlaws. Seen as a negative version of the ecumenopolis Coruscant, Nar Shaddaa was known for being polluted and possibly one of the most dangerous places in the galaxy, as its inhabitants embraced almost every sort of illegal activity with almost no interference from law enforcement or officials of any galactic government. The Rebel Alliance considered the moon so dangerous that they regarded even sending a covert team there as suicide."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hutt Clan controlled Nar Shaddaa, but maintained only the lightest touch in governing the residence, ensuring only that they got a cut from a deal or transaction on the moon. The majority of beings on the moon understood that staying on the good side of the Hutts was essential to surviving on Nar Shaddaa, although it far from guaranteed safety. Unofficially, the different territories on the moon were divided between various Hutt crime lords as well as other criminal cartels or gangs. The Hutts of Nal Hutta conducted almost all of their offworld dealings on Nar Shaddaa, meaning there were few visitors to the planet itself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gangs of droids also roamed the streets of Nar Shaddaa, accosting other droids such as C-3PO for scrap metal.
