Valance's payment is a collection of rebuilt droids, which he melts into slag with several blasts from his weapon. Forced to live as a cyborg due to injuries sustained from an aerial torpedo, Valance has an irrational hatred of all droids and he hunts them down wherever he can find them. Valance's next mission is to find Luke Skywalker. Not only is Luke a droid-owner, but he also apparently treats them as equals, which Valance finds repulsive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Luke has taken C-3PO with him in a blockade runner and is mapping out the perimeter of the Galactic Empire's most recent blockade. He deftly maneuvers the runner out of the way of an oncoming Imperial cruiser before making the jump to hyperspace. Now Luke has to find a trading post so that he can find parts needed to make repairs to the disabled R2-D2. He lands the blockade runner on Junction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Valance discovers that an Imperial spy has been trying to alert the Empire as to Valance's presence on Junction.

They acquire the parts they need, but before long Valance returns and finds them. He tries firing at Luke with his blaster, but Luke deflects the shot with his lightsaber. The blast arcs back, striking Valance in the face. Part of his flesh is melted away to reveal cybernetic parts beneath. Valance manages to get Luke's blaster and saber away from him and is prepared to kill him. In a moment of bravery, C-3PO stands between Luke and Valance, declaring that he is ready to sacrifice himself for his master. Moved by behavior which is typically uncharacteristic for a droid, Valance decides to let them go."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
