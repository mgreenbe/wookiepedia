One month after the declaration of the New Order, he held the rank of Admiral in the Imperial Navy and had been put in command of the elimination of all officers suspected of disloyalty. He carried out the task with ruthless efficiency and had executed a huge number of detractors within a few months of the Battle of Utapau, one of the final battles in the Clone Wars. Once Mulleen had completed the executions, he reported it to the Galactic Emperor Palpatine's aide, Sate Pestage, who in turn reported it to the Emperor himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mulleen was first mentioned in the comic book series Star Wars: Dark Times in the first issue of the The Path to Nowhere story arc published on November 8, 2006.
