The cycle of violence would end somewhere during that time when Human colonists crash-landed on the planet. They lorded over the two primitive species with their blasters. After a few generations, the Humans' power packs faded and, without their technological weaponry, were forced to take up bows to defend themselves. The three-sided conflict was equalized. Eventually, the three groups would achieve peace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
