As a wedding gift to Organa, Solo reconfigured the crew quarters of his starship, the Millennium Falcon, to include a galley. The two eventually had a son, whom they named Ben Solo. After losing their son to the dark side of the Force both spouses went separate ways. Although they still loved each other and remained husband and wife, Organa and Solo did not see each other for many years, until the Cold War briefly reunited them on D'Qar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It's rumored that Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi originally ended with the wedding.
