During the plot to destroy the Chiss Ascendancy, the Saltbarrel sent out a distress call to Senior Captain Thrawn of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet. The Saltbarrel claimed to be under attack from  Vagaari pirates, but was in reality under false attack by gunboats remotely piloted from aboard itself. This skirmish was meant to delay the Chiss officer from discovering the plot against the Ascendancy. Thrawn did not fall for the ruse, and ended up arresting Fsir and commandeering the Watith gunboats and the Saltbarrel. Thrawn later employed the commandeered starships at the skirmish above Hoxim."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
