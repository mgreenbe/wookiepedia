An only child, he kept himself amused by imitating voices from radio and TV, making acting a logical progression. At university, he was accepted into both the Fine Arts and Drama departments, opting for the latter. While a student, he was persuaded to audition for a professional theatre production, where he was discovered by lauded stage actor Bill Flynn. This led to his signing with a top agent and his career was started.
