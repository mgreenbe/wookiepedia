Benjo was anxious to participate in some action, but followed orders and led the rest of the squadron into a bracket formation, holding back while his squadron commander went ahead to attempt communication with the stolen ship's pilot. When the RLH-1's pilot refused to return the stolen craft and instead began to engage the squad leader, Benjo witnessed his commander outmaneuver and destroy the shuttle. Having not seen any action except drills since being assigned to the Steel Talon, Benjo displayed his satisfaction by congratulating his commander on a good hit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
