The plot involved killing all the 73 living Arakyd employees on the planet, while concurrently assuming control of the company, continuing to fill the standard droid orders with every droid manufactured by the foundry being modified to be similarly self-aware like IG-88 and ready to rebel against the 'biologicals' when triggered."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the final IG-88's destruction with the second Death Star ended their potential rebellion and organic life returned to planet and restored its proper droid manufacturing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years after IG-88's defeat, Tyko Thul purchased the droid factory and restored it to peak manufacturing operations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
