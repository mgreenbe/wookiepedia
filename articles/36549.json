Unlike Corellia StarDrive's Coruscant-class Heavy Courier, most of the ship was habitable. The complex automatic systems integrated into the craft allowed it to be operated by a single person."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This aerodynamic starship had an insectoid appearance and featured 21 HKD ion engines. These engines were set in blocks of three on servo-controlled mountings to negate the need for maneuvering thrusters. The courier was also lightly armed with only 2 rotating laser cannons and 1 proton torpedo launcher. For further agility, a computer system controlled multiple layers of extendable vanes and aerofoils . This ensured that the courier had a good aerodynamic shape during atmospheric travel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known ships"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
