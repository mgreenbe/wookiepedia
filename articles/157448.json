In 8 ABY, the controller was on duty when the New Republic CR90 corvette FarStar entered the Ott system and requested permission to land. The ship, in pursuit of the rogue Imperial warlord Moff Kentor Sarne, had learned that their quarry had been at Gandle Ott days before, and were seeking leads to continue their mission. As per standard procedure, the FarStar's request was handled by the spaceport traffic control computer. However, the computer had been influenced by Montrol City's resident BRT supercomputer, CUTH-BRT-92-X3. Moff Sarne, aware of the New Republic pursuit, had arranged for CUTH-BRT-92-X3's control systems to be overridden, and instructed the computer to delay any ship following him by any means necessary."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To that end, CUTH-BRT-92-X3 interfered with the traffic control computer and kept suggesting to it that the FarStar had only just arrived in orbit, and was a low-priority vessel. This caused the traffic control computer to bump the FarStar to the back of the landing queue every ten minutes. Eventually, the command crew of the FarStar tired of the delay, and bypassed the automated beacon to speak directly to the controller. The Human could not explain the reason for the delay, noting that they rarely had problems with the landing software. Despite the malfunction, the controller worked swiftly, clearing the FarStar for landing in a VIP berth space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The controller was a diligent individual, able to adapt to situations that were rarely encountered in their line of work and able to recognize the importance of letting the FarStar land on Gandle Ott unhindered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The controller appeared in Death Is Remotely Possible, the third RPG adventure in The DarkStryder Campaign published by West End Games in 1995."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
