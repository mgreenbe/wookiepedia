Cilpar was an Imperial world with a resistance movement unaligned with the New Republic in 4 ABY. A New Republic representative, Targeter, had established contact with the Cilpar underground, led by Elscol Loro."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arrival in Cilpar airspace, the Rogues were attacked by a dozen of TIE fighters. Wes Janson was shot down, so Tycho Celchu landed to recover Janson. The rest of the squadron headed to their temporary base just west of the city of Kiidan. They soon learned that the food convoy never arrived in the first place because someone tipped off the Imperial forces on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Elsewhere, Tycho found Janson and they hide out in a cave. A group of underground forces led by Elscol Loro arrived at the New Republic encampment and captured the Rogues. Loro was pursued a traitor among the pilots betrayed them. The Rebels take the group to the devastated city of Tamarack to show them what Moff Boren Tascl has done to the local populace in his hunting of Rebels. They were later attacked by Tascl's Imperial forces but managed to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the same time, Tycho and Janson were surprised to meet a woman they believed at first to be Princess Leia Organa. Winter, who was Cilpar's \"Targeter\", convinced Tycho to make his way to the local Imperial base to infiltrate their ranks as a TIE pilot. Shortly thereafter, he was forced to join the local TIE squadron in attacking the fleeing Rogues and underground. In the ensuing battle, Winter surprised the Imperials by engaging them with Tycho's X-wing that join her piloted by Tycho's astromech, shooting down many TIEs, including Tycho's one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after Winter's arrival at the cave, Vance Rego, a member of the underground, arrived with a handful of stormtroopers and took Janson and Winter (whom he believes to be Leia) prisoner.

They decide to both hit the Imperial base and save \"Leia\", the underground by ground and the Rogues with their X-wings. In the ensuing battle, Tycho once again flies with the Imperials, but soon turns on them. Vance was discovered as a spy and knocked by Groznik, Loro's Wookiee companion. He was then devoured by a ronk in the jungle. Groznik nearly killed Moff Tascl for the death of Throm Loro, Elscol's husband, but she instead decided to take him into custody."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the local Imperials dealt a major blow, the Rogues left for Mrlsst, with Elscol as their newest squadron member."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
