According to Rey, they stole it from Gannis Ducain, who had stolen it from Han Solo. They later had the freighter stolen from them by the junk dealer Unkar Plutt. The Kubaz banker Rikard Lovas owed debts to the Irving Boys at one point. Being unable to repay them properly, Lovas simulated the robbery of his own ship in an attempt to heist the money inside his computer core without anyone realizing who the culprit was. The plot was foiled, and the Irving Boys were neglected their dues. In 34 ABY, after Solo and his First Mate Chewbacca recovered the Falcon, Chewbacca started to fix the unadvised modifications made by the Irving Boys whilst Rey was trained by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker on Ahch-To."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
