G0-T0 decided to commission the prototype of the Starscape-class yacht, which became known as the Visionary, and outfitted it with many internal and external defenses at the Nar Shaddaa shipyards. Among these was a Stygium crystal cloaking device. The Visionary would eventually be destroyed above the skies of Nar Shaddaa after the cloak was disabled by the Exile. Nevertheless, Eleaor Propulsion continued to make a successful, if expensive, line of luxury yachts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
