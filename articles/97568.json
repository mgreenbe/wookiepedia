After this, Lucas decided that, if an actor portraying a Jedi was unavailable for Episode III, that Jedi would be replaced with a new character. Stass Allie's actress, Lily Nyamwasa, returned to replay her role, but she was unavailable for pick-up shots. Lucas thus replaced Nyamwasa with Tace Bayliss for the Council scenes, and with visual effects coordinator Nina Fallon for her death scene on Saleucami (although Nyamwasa is still the canon representation of the character, appearing in reference books and action figures)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fallon had continued her career as visual effects coordinator with Mission: Impossible III (2006, J.J.
