Boran and his group appear only if players choose the Light Side option during their conversation with Captain Orzik, keeping him alive. Community consensus reflects that Imperial players chose only the dark side option and therefore Boran's attack did not occur. It is unknown what happened to Boran and his team, or if they even existed, according to the canonical scenario. Since Sylas orders the shuttles to be shot down, it is possible Boran and his squad were shot down and perished before they could even reach the Black Talon in the dark side option."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
