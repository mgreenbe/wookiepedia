To that aim, enlightened monks had their brains transplanted into nutrient-filled jars. Whenever they wanted to move, those bottled-brains used spider-like droid walkers. Older monks using four-legged walkers, while more recent ones using a six-legged variant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The order possessed multiple regeneration gems, which at the time of Jabba the Hutt were stored underground behind triple doors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The order built monasteries in the galaxy, including a monastery on the jungle world of Teth in Wild Space. Some of their temples were taken over by smugglers, who turned them into their personal retreats. The B'omarr monks were also present on Tatooine, but Jabba the Hutt assumed control of their monastery, turning it into his personal palace. Despite that, Jabba allowed the monks to still roam around his appropriated palace, as he enjoyed the gruesome sight of them. In 4 ABY, B'omarr monks were present at Jabba's Palace when Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker came to rescue the Corellian smuggler Han Solo from captivity. Shortly after Jabba's death, the monks took over the palace and allowed the Whiphid bounty hunter J'Quille to join them after he found himself unable to leave the planet. By 9 ABY, Bib Fortuna had taken over the palace before he was killed by Boba Fett."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The B'omarr Order first appeared in Star Wars canon in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, in the form of brains attached to spider droids.
