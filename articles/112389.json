Known to be a cocky and arrogant in general, SpecForce often took the Rebellion more seriously than most ground troops, and disdained on those who shirked from duty. All SpecForce personnel were required to pass training which consisted of four months of intense, physical and mental training, including learning the use of antique slugthrowers, disarming proximity mines and rappelling off a ray shield."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Founding"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alliance Special Forces was founded as a detachment of the Alliance Army following the founding of the Alliance to Restore the Republic.

During Operation Fracture, Rebel Alliance Intelligence Service confirmed the existence of the Death Star and the location of it's plans. The Alliance High Command, however, failed to act upon the growing threat fearing utter defeat. Captain Cassian Jeron Andor however believed in obtaining the plans and he put together a team of rebel troopers\u2014including members of the Rebel Marines, Pathfinders and 4th Specforce regiment such as Mefran and Sergeant Melshi. Led by Cassian and Jyn Erso, the team named themselves Rogue One and took a stolen shuttle to the Imperial garrison on Scarif where the data vault containing the Death Star plans was."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The troopers dispatched into the shrubbery of Scarif's beaches and began planting explosives to create a distraction whilst Cassian and Jyn went up to the data vault in the Citadel Tower to find the plans. Mefran and several others guarded the shuttle in the meantime. The troopers held at first but were soon forced to retreat from incoming AT-ACTs. Luckily, the Alliance Fleet had reached Scarif and the X-wing starfighters of Blue Squadron saved them from the walkers. Blue Squadron's U-wing dispatched more Alliance Special Forces soldiers to assist Rogue One and the battle stretched on until death troopers landed on the beach and gunned down the entire force excluding Melshi, Lieutenant Taidu Sefla, Baze Malbus and Chirrut \u00cemwe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Selfa was gunned down by death troopers trying to reach a master switch on a nearby console. Melshi soon joined the Lieutenant leaving Baze and Chirrut trapped by the death troopers. Chirrut sacrificed himself to turn the master switch and Baze was killed when facing off with the death troopers. At the same time, Mefran and a few others were under fire defending the shuttle and a grenade thrown by a Coastal defender stormtrooper blew up the shuttle killing any surviving troopers. Despite the loss of all the Special Forces soldiers, Cassian and Jyn managed to obtain the Death Star plans and transmit it to the MC75 Star Cruiser Profundity. The Battle of Scarif was the first major Alliance victory against the Empire."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "At Hoth"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Mid Rim Retreat, a Gigoran Alliance Special Forces Corporal named Purpruff was scouting for a new location for the Alliance High Command and soon traveled to the ice planet Hoth. There she noted her initial impressions and hiked the terrain on the surface. Purpruff soon found a cave where a herd of Tauntauns lived. The High Command took Purpruff's report into account and eventually, in 3 ABY, their base was built on Hoth. The base was named Echo Base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over a third of the personnel there were Alliance Special Forces, one of them being a young man named Kryndal. Kryndal\u2014like most of the personnel there\u2014was very passionate about the Alliance cause but he was soon challenged by First Sergeant Hazram Namir, a soldier from Twilight Company who disagreed with his view of the war. Kryndal and Namir got into a fight and Namir was taken away by the other Special Forces soldiers. A few days later, the Empire discovered Echo Base and Darth Vader launched an attack.

Luckily for them, the native Ewoks attacked the stormtroopers and a skirmish broke out. Several Pathfinders were killed in the ground battle but when they managed to destroy the shield generator, the Alliance Fleet above could send starfighters inside the Death Star and destroy it.
