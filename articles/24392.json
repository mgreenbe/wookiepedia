Qel-Droma's first mission came in 4000 BBY, when, along with his brother and fellow trainee Tott Doneeta, he was sent to Onderon to put down an uprising of the Beast Riders from the planet's wilderness against the walled city of Iziz. The Jedi succeeded, but Qel-Droma's career on the fields of battle had just begun."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He helped quell the Naddist Uprising started by a dark side cult on Onderon, and later fought in the Great Sith War, a galaxy-spanning conflict that started when the dark side organization known as the Krath took control of the Empress Teta system. During the war, Ulic turned to the dark side, becoming a Sith, and second-in-command under Dark Lord Exar Kun. Though Kun attempted to lure Qel-Droma to the dark side as well, he could not be tempted, and remained a Jedi, a proud defender of the Galactic Republic. Qel-Droma fought opposite his brother in battles such as the Battle of Coruscant. In 3996 BBY Qel-Droma finally came face-to-face with Ulic, dueling him on Ossus. Ulic killed his brother, though he regretted the act enough to abandon the dark side.

Together with Ulic, Cay Qel-Droma was sent to Arca Jeth's Jedi training center on Arkania for further instruction. Even at a young age, the two boys were the best of friends. Alongside the Twi'lek Tott Doneeta, the two learned the ways of the Force from the venerated Jedi Master. The three young Jedi learned much from the respected Master, such as lightsaber combat and different Force skills. Cay Qel-Droma also advanced his love for machines by frequently repairing any droids or other machines that had bugs. During their training, Cay began to grow concerned for Ulic as his older brother grew frustrated when he failed at something.

Instead, he sent his three apprentices on their first real test\u2014a mission with lives hanging in the balance. Onderon was home to many savage beasts, some of which had been tamed by outlaws known as Beast Riders. These beasts had forced the other citizens of Onderon into one giant walled city, Iziz, which was constantly under attack from the Beast Riders, who had been at war with the monarchy of the city for centuries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the three Jedi arrived in the Qel-Dromas' ship, the Nebulon Ranger, they were attacked by a group of Beast Riders on their drexl mounts. However, due to the expert piloting skills of Doneeta and the Qel-Droma brothers, the ship was able to land in Iziz intact. Once in the city, they introduced themselves to a group of security officers sent to welcome them, only to see Tott Doneeta nearly arrested, as the city had a policy against any alien species. Furious, the brothers drew their lightsabers, and the guards reluctantly released Doneeta. The three were then led to the throne room of Queen Amanoa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi were introduced to the queen and her daughter, Princess Galia.

Once there, they crashed in, interrupting the wedding between Galia and the Beast Riders' second-in-command, Oron Kira, son of chief Modon Kira.

The two had fallen in love, but since the queen would never permit her daughter to marry a Beast Rider, Galia had arranged to be \"kidnapped.\" She told the Jedi that she wished to escape her parents, who were practitioners of the dark side. Kira explained that four hundred years before, a rogue Jedi named Freedon Nadd had brought knowledge of the dark side to Onderon. A Sith Lord, Nadd had ruled the planet for years before his death. The rulers after him learned his teachings, and Sith artifacts were passed down from generation to generation between the kings and queens, who continued Nadd's legacy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Encounter with the dark side"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kira pleaded that the Jedi help them defeat Amanoa and her husband, King Ommin, a fellow darksider.

The ship landed in the city, and the Jedi headed to the palace with Galia. However, Amanoa did not give them a chance to talk, cursing her daughter for her betrayal. Then, claiming the darkness inside her would destroy the Jedi, she called for Freedon Nadd, unleashing her rage and creating a blanket of darkness in the palace.

Ommin was empowered by Freedon Nadd, whose spirit had survived for centuries, spreading the dark side on Onderon. The old man unleashed a wave of dark side energy, paralyzing Jeth. Ulic and Galia were forced to flee, while Jeth was taken prisoner by Ommin and Nadd's spirit. Above, the three Jedi had lost the palace, and, along with Ulic, Galia, and Kira, had to abscond.

Ulic and his companions made their way to Iziz, where they confronted Ommin in his underground lair. Ommin had hung Jeth on the wall as a trophy, and though he still lived, he suffered greatly. During the skirmish, Qel-Droma lost his droid arm to a Sith War Droid, though he kept fighting, and would later build another replacement limb for himself. Ulic, determined to rescue his Master from the clutches of Freedon Nadd and his puppet Ommin, fought through the droid ranks before confronting and slicing through the King's body. In his dying moments, Ommin called for Nadd, but the spirit announced that he was abandoning Ommin.

He informed the Jedi that two youths, Satal and Aleema Keto had taken control of the system. More to the point, they had somehow learned the ways of the dark side, forming a secret dark side society known as the Krath. Dace Diath, Oss Wilum, Qrrrl Toq, and Shoaneb Culu would travel to Ossus and attempt to recruit more Jedi, while the others would stay on Onderon.

Angered, Kun insisted he be allowed to see the relics, but he was confronted by Jeth, who told Kun he knew he was no archaeologist, and ordered he leave.

On Deneba, Qel-Droma saw his brother again, and was surprised to see him wounded. Ulic explained what had happened to him as the meeting got underway. Jedi Master Odan-Urr presided over the meeting, explaining the conclave's purpose\u2014to discuss the recent failure of the task force in the Empress Teta system and what the Jedi could do to defeat the Krath. Odan-Urr then welcomed Ulic, newly appointed Watchman of the Empress Teta system, to the stand. Ulic informed the audience of his plan\u2014to destroy the Krath from within. As he went into detail about his scheme, he was met with resistance from the crowd. Many Jedi, most notably Jeth, opposed Ulic joining the Krath.

At that moment, a group of ships jumped out of hyperspace above Deneba. A flurry of escape pods rained down on the planet.

Attacked from behind by a droid, Arca Jeth, the beloved master of Cay and Ulic Qel-Droma, was killed. Though the Jedi eventually won the day, it was not a complete victory.

Using a secret passage discovered by Sunrider, they made their way into the royal quarters. There, they confronted Satal. However, before he could attack them, Ulic appeared, and lunged for Satal, engaging him in combat. The two dueled, with Ulic, empowered by rage, emerging victorious. Qel-Droma encouraged Ulic to flee with them, but he refused. When Qel-Droma persisted, Ulic flattened his friends with a blast of dark side energy. Despite Sunrider's misgivings, the Jedi retreated.

Diath had not died but instead ejected at the last moment and used Force Levitation to save himself after the destruction of his fighter. The Jedi were planning another rescue mission, this time with the help of the Riders and their drexl mounts. However, before they could leave, the Masters wished to speak with them. Vodo-Siosk Baas and Thon informed the young Jedi that Ulic had to be the one to see the error of his ways, and turn from the dark side under his own volition. If he did not, he would destroy himself, as was the way of the Force. And so, with that fateful message, the Jedi prepared for departure. Flying Star Sabers and Stingers, they headed for Cinnagar, hoping to succeed where Cay Qel-Droma's crew had failed earlier.
