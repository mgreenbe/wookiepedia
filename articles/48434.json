Alliance Admiral Gar Stazi ordered the creation of the squadron after the end of the Sith\u2013Imperial War, which saw the Alliance defeated by the Sith-allied Galactic Empire. The squadron was formed specifically to carry out missions to subdue and capture enemy starships. To complete their missions, Fireblue Squadron flew I4 Ionizer starfighters, and the unit took its name from the intense blue-colored ion energy of the fighter's primary weapon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the civil war, the squadron was regularly tasked with disabling large freighters, allowing the Alliance to capture the ship and take its cargo. Fireblue Squadron was also deployed to capture high-value targets, as well as against civilian vessels that the Alliance did not want to destroy, but needed to disable."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To meet the squadron's main mission profile to seize and immobilize enemy ships, Fireblue Squadron utilized I4 Ionizer starfighters. The fighter carried a single pilot with an astromech droid and was armed with multiple ion cannons, a pair of wing mounted disruptor torpedoes, and underpowered laser cannons. Defensively, it was well armored, but only carried light shielding due to interference caused by the fighter's extensive ion weaponry. The hyperspace-capable craft were the best small fighters of the time when it came to disabling ships while leaving their target's superstructure undamaged. A squadron of I4 Ionizers, such as Fireblue Squadron, was capable of immobilizing a small freighter in a single pass and larger ships with multiple attacks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fireblue Squadron was first mentioned in the 2009 Wizards of the Coast roleplaying game sourcebook the Legacy Era Campaign Guide."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
