Cam ended up fighting for Nem'ro against rival Hutt Voontara Fa'athra in an industrial town on Nal Hutta named Jiguuna, which Nem'ro ruled. When Brell learned of his brother's choice, he attempted to rescue him from work in the gang. Brell tried to contact Rex Geer, who was the captain of Nem'ro's street gang, and persuade him to release Cam from service. Due the gang war raging in Jiguuna between Fa'athra and Nem'ro, Brell could not reach his old acquaintance and so began searching for an individual who could."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brell found an Imperial-aligned individual in the Poison Pit cantina who was willing to help him save Cam. Brell offered the individual his knowledge of Nal Hutta's gang wars in return for help but was also willing to pay in credits. The individual successfully fought through Fa'athra's men and reached Geer's safe house in Jiguuna, where he and Cam were believed to be. The individual discovered that Rex had, in fact, imprisoned Cam within a cage, along with three other prisoners, as the younger Brell had attempted to flee from the battlefield during a gun fight and join Fa'athra's side. Rex intended to take him before Nem'ro for questioning, and when the individual requested Cam's release, the captain offered the Imperial credits to leave Cam in his custody instead of bringing him back to Brell."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The individual agreed, much to Cam's horror, and left Geer's house, returning to Brell at the cantina.

His location was also marked in the accompanying Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide. Brell is involved in the quest \"Gang Warfare,\" in which he asks the player to rescue his brother, Cam. The player has a choice, upon finding Cam, to either leave him to his fate in exchange for credits (dark side) or to save him (light side). This article assumes that players choose the dark-side option and leave Cam, as only Imperial Agents and Bounty Hunters may take this mission. If the player leaves Cam, the player, upon returning to Brell, may choose to tell him the truth about leaving Cam or claim he was already dead upon arrival. Neither of these options corresponds with a specific alignment, so this article makes no assumption about which was chosen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
