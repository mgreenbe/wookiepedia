A warrant officer did not have a specific task as other ranks such as Admiral did, but instead specialized in a particular field that other crew members had little or no knowledge of. An example of this would be a warrant officer who specialized in monitoring the ship's functions, or a warrant officer who specialized in operating the ship's tractor beam."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In some militaries, the next rank after Warrant Officer was Chief Warrant Officer, which was ascended by Master Warrant Officer (typically the highest noncommissioned officer rank in a given military). In other militaries (such as the Grand Army of the Republic and subsequently the Imperial Army), there were two Warrant Officer ranks: Junior Warrant Officer and Senior Warrant Officer"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable Warrant Officers"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ranks Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) and Master Warrant Officer (MWO) from the Canadian Military Forces and Singapore Armed Forces, where CWO outranks MWO.

Galaxy at War supports this as well (see above). Yet the Junior Warrant Officer and Senior Warrant Officer ranks are listed elsewhere in Galaxy at War as being the first commissioned officer ranks in both the Grand Army of the Republic and the Imperial Army. This may be in accord with how Warrant Officers are considered to be a form of commissioned officer in the United States military, unlike most other real world militaries."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
