Around 42 BBY, Kimania became the Mother, or spiritual leader, of the Rinajaa irstat, a Tarasin tribe that resided at village in the Cularin jungles. She dwelled within a hut in the Rinajaa settlement and subsequently led the irstat for twelve years, reaching an old age."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 20 BBY, the village of the Rinajaa irstat was struck in a surprise nighttime raid by the Wyrd, a coven of Tarasin dark side Force witches hostile to other Tarasin groups. Kimania observed as the witches killed several of the villagers and was then herself murdered by a Wyrd witch, who snapped Kimania's throat with the Force. The Wyrd attackers then floated the deceased matriarch's corpse into the air and held Kimania's body up above a group of captive Rinajaa villagers to serve as a warning of the fate that would befall any who defied the witches."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents assigned to combat the Wyrd, arrived at the Rinajaa village and liberated the villagers from their Wyrd oppressors. Around two hours after the operatives arrival, the surviving Rinajaa Tarasin placed Kimania's body into the hut that had been her home. They then forced several captive Wyrd witches into the structure as well, planning to set the hut alight with the Wyrd sisters inside so as to honor Kimania and avenge her demise. However, heroes of Cularin persuaded the villagers to spare the witches. As Kimania's hut was at aflame, she briefly appeared within the burning structure as Force ghost and smiled and nodded at the operatives to acknowledge their saving of the prisoners, before fading from view."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following her death and transformation into a Force ghost, Kimania opposed the killing of the Wyrd witches that had harried her village.

In the adventure, the player characters roleplay as the freelance agents that free the Rinajaa irstat from the Wyrd and the players can decide whether to prevent the Rinajaa villagers from torching the captive Wyrd witches. If the player characters intervene to save the prisoners, Kimania appears as a ghost as her hut burns and smiles and nods at the player characters. If the players allow the witches to be incinerated, Kimania's ghost manifests within the blazing hut displaying a deeply saddened demeanor and shakes her head at the freelance agents to lament their failure to save the prisoners."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
