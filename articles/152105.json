When he saw two Jedi in the bar of Ziro's Palace he ran off to alert a palace guard. He managed to find an IG-100 MagnaGuard, but the Magnaguard could not understand the Huttese the Bith was speaking. The Magnaguard found the Protocol droid, C-3PO, and ordered Threepio to translate for the Bith. Since Threepio did not want the Jedi to be killed, he told the guard false translations. The guard lost his temper and killed the Bith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
