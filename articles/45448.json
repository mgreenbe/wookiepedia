The repulsorlift did not propel the mortar, but did allow an operator to push or pull the mortar into position. The mortar was capable of firing any type of grenade up to a distance of a kilometer, and had an ammunition capacity of a hundred grenades."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Corporate Sector Authority armed their Security Police with the mortar.
