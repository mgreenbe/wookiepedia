Some members of this branch set up a base on the rogue planetoid Tembora, known as Tembora Research Station. It is here that they tried to develop the KLR-series combat droid. Unfortunately, the software programming in the droids was unstable, allowing them to overwrite their failsafes. KLR-B1 injured two technicians and killed a third before they decided to shut down the droids and start the programming from scratch. Somehow KLR-B1 was not shut down, and instead went on a psychopathic rampage, killing all members of the research station and any crewmembers of ships which crashed on the planetoid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
