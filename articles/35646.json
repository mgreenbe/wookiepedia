The planet was represented by the Centrists in the New Republic, but in contrast to typical Centrist doctrine, was mostly self-reliant and limited offplanet commerce. Daxam IV was near the planet Pamarthe, and many Pamarthen pilots were recruited to work there. The planet revolved around two suns but orbited at the edge of its system, making for an extremely cold climate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
