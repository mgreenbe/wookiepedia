Scores on the test were composed of a number between 1 and 10 signifying the subject's intelligence rating, followed by three letters with various meanings. Mentor, a droid consciousness that attempted to lead a droid revolution, scored a 10-NCM on the scale and the droid G0-T9 received a 8-HSM rating. An application of the test on the droid SCORPIO resulted in a 9-NIX rating\u2014level 9 intelligence, non-Human, independent, unknown\u2014with an accuracy rating of 22%. The score signified similarities to Mentor and G0-T9, and the results matched anecdotal experiences: SCORPIO did not consider any biological or cybernetic lifeform to be of interest or value, and was primarily interested in evolving herself. She valued others who shared her traits, such as intelligence, curiosity, and amoral self-interest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wreyn-Tsatke Scale was first mentioned in the Codex entry for the droid SCORPIO in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011, though the significance of some of the rating components was not explained."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
