However, Nez Peron remained an Imperial world despite its starving population. Jahren sought reform and justice and was elected to speak on behalf of Nez Peron's farmers. Jahren decided not to hand over their produce to the Empire. This was a doomed plan, as Darth Vader came to Nez Peron and smashed the blossoming resistance.

Sinn soon discovered Feena D'Asta and uncovered a Black Sun plot to replace Council members with clones. However, Sinn was found out by Grappa by a former subordinate of hers, Massimo.
