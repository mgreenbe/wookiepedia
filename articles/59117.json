His body was transferred to a coffin by a Coruscant funeral firm so that it could be cremated at the Jedi Temple. However, a trio of Separatist Weequay agents, posing as workers at the firm, attempted to sabotage his funeral to kill the Jedi who would be attending the service. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi learned of the plot and arrived on the Temple steps just as Grand Master Yoda was about to ignite Halsey's funeral pyre.
