When he came across the ship drifting in space, he was the only person to recognize the symbol of the Silver Jedi on the hull. Immediately, he ordered the ship to dock and proceeded to board the cruiser. Almost half an hour later, the two ships were connected and he, along with a group including his Force-sensitive medic Kara, went aboard. Kara soon warned him that she felt darkness aboard and immediately the Force Vampire barreled through the group, latching onto Kara and killing her. Korsu managed to draw his blaster only to be killed one minute later, never knowing what exactly it was that killed him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
