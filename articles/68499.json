By the time the Empire was shattered in 4 ABY, during the Battle of Endor, the young Syndulla was already considered a member of his mother's crew on the starship Ghost and was given the callsign Spectre 7. Although Syndulla grew up never knowing his father, he was nonetheless surrounded by love from the people he considered family, including the droid C1-10P or \"Chopper.\" Chopper, who was a companion to his mother since her childhood, became a close and constant companion to Syndulla. Despite the aged astromech's usually cantankerous personality, being around the young boy brought out his playful side."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jacen Syndulla was a male hybrid, born to a human father and a Twi'lek mother.

Filoni deliberately chose the name Jacen as a way of honoring the character of Jacen Solo and his importance in the stories of Star Wars Legends.
