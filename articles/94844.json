According to native Crys Taanzer, who was present at the time of the attack, Nadiem was caught in the middle. With no real military value for either side, it was attacked mainly because the Galactic Republic chose to defend it. Civilian casualties were heavy, the Jedi helping the civilians there was killed, and the defenses crumpled. The survivors, and the planet itself, were forgotten about afterward as far as Crys could tell."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Republic was eventually able to take back the planet with a group of clone troopers led by Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and her Padawan Barriss Offee.
