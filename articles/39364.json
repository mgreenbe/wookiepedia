It was one of the worst prisons the Galactic Empire had to offer. It had extremely high security and a factory where prisoners were forced to work everyday. Prisoners were given the bare minimum to survive, were woken up early every day, and, when they were at the end of their strength, executed. In 19 BBY, two prisoners, Ferus Olin and Clive Flax, managed to escape. It generally held either political prisoners, or criminals who had broken the rules of so many prisons that they had finally been sent there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known prisoners"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
