The Separatist Droid Army sought control of the base, and so the two Jedi were there to protect it. As the battle began, Knox and Halsey made short work of the incoming battle droids, however, the tide of the battle was turned when Savage Opress, Count Dooku's newly appointed apprentice was deployed in order to assist the failing droids in the battle. Halsey ordered Knox to stay back as he ran to engage Savage by himself, but he proved no match for the Zabrak and was subsequently killed. Knox, witnessing his master's death, charged towards Opress seeking revenge, but the much stronger warrior swiftly threw him headfirst into the door of the temple, ending his life."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the massacre, hologram footage of the battle surfaced and Delta Squad, an elite squad of Clone commandos, were sent out in order to retrieve the two fallen Jedi's bodies.

Soon after he arrived, he was greeted by beings known as Force Priestesses who put him through difficult trials to test him. During the final trial on the Sith homeworld of Moraband, Yoda faced a vision of a peaceful Jedi Temple where the Clone Wars never occurred. Many fallen Jedi were present such as Knox, which lead Yoda to realize that it was a vision, causing him to wake up. Yoda was told by the Priestesses that he still had more test to overcome. Knox later appeared in a dream to Luke Skywalker during his mission to Devaron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Knox's body re-used Bolla Ropal's geometry, but updated with newly textured finishes.
