During the Galactic Empire's blockade of the planet Ibaar, Transport One was stocked with various supplies and attempted to run through the Imperial blockade and deliver food to the famished people of Ibaar. Despite protection from the starship Ghost and the rest of Phoenix Squadron, Transport One became the focus of Imperial fire and was subsequently destroyed. The ship's allies quickly retreated afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
