Situated in the heart of Coronet City on a two-hundred acre plot of land, Corona House was a four-story building several thousands years old by the time of the Galactic Civil War. It was common for each successive administration to renovate the facility, and very little of the original structure remained intact. The grounds of the facility had been converted into a vast public park and was used for weddings and public events."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the reign of the Galactic Empire, Corona House was occupied by Diktat Daclif Gallamby. The state-of-the-art interior of the facility was masked by the antique exterior and the two grand ball rooms that recalled an earlier age in Corellian history. During Governor-General Micamberlecto's occupancy of the facility, the inexpensive stresscrete exterior was covered over with an attractive front of polished wood. In 18 ABY, Corellian hero Han Solo and his family stayed at the House during a visit to Corellia. It was the target of rocket attacks by the Human League during the Corellian Crisis in that very same year. Leia Organa Solo was held prisoner by the Human League at Corona House, but escaped with the assistance of Mara Jade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
