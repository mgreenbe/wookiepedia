During the Yuuzhan Vong War, the New Republic and the Jedi used the asteroids in the Froz system as communications bases, monitoring the Yuuzhan Vong presence in the Corellian sector. However, the planet fell to the extra-galactic invaders and its inhabitants were enslaved. Though the Yuuzhan Vong left Froz alone, they took many Frozians and experimented on them, trying to \"shape\" them into a slave species like they had done to the Rodians. Frozians from across the galaxy returned home and fought back against the alien invaders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
