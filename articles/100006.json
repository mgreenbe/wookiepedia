Olis was to be cast out to the wild outside Iziz as punishment. Before Queen Amanoa finalized the punishment, Olis foretold that Iziz would fall due to its suffering from the darkness for three centuries. He might be a Force-sensitive, as he claimed to be able to sense the dark side in the Queen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Olis's words enraged the Queen, and Amanoa executed the prisoner with a glowing sphere of energy in green.
