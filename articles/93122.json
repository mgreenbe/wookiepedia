Within one of the four new pyramids, the atrium's ceiling could retract, and a channel that ran to the peak of the structure allowed for fresh air and sunlight to pour into the room. The floor was carpeted with living sturdimoss and the chamber served as a junction between surrounding halls, leading to small classrooms. In 40 ABY, the funeral of Mara Jade Skywalker was held there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The court had a sunken floor and steps leading up to the halls out of the room. In the center of the sunken floor, a bier was erected for Mara Jade Skywalker's funeral, though it may have been a permanent fixture in the room. A speaker's podium also stood at the top of a set of stairs where announcements could be made."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Behind the podium was a door that led out into a circular antechamber that had served as the funeral staging area. It led out into the larger hall that encircled the rest of the pyramid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Above the Court, hallways wrapped around the entire chamber, a transparisteel wall allowed those in the second through the fifth floor corridors to see into the atrium.
