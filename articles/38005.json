The Diathim were reputed for their beauty, and the way in which they appeared would vary depending on the beholder. They shared their habitat with the Maelibi, who lived below the ground. When the young Anakin Skywalker first met his future wife Padm\u00e9 Amidala, he compared her natural beauty to that of the Diathim."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mysterious species whom the University of Sanbra xenobiologists called \"the Diathim,\" otherwise known as \"the Angels,\" seemed to be made of blazing white light tinged with a yellow aura, which suggested they were beings of pure energy. At any rate, their intense radiance made it difficult to make out their biological details. Most accounts depicted them as slender, 2 to 3 meters tall feminine anthropoids with six blade-shaped wings protruding from their backs. One particular individual appeared in front of Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, two Human Jedi, as a tall woman of their species with wings, milky white skin, blond hair, light blue eyes, a tiny nose and long limbs. Some other witnesses described the Angels as more androgynous, while many non-Human observers portrayed them as mysterious and fascinating variants of their own species. Whether their wings were physical or not, the Diathim could fly and glide freely. They could even fly in the vacuum of interplanetary space without the assistance of a protective suit or life support. They also had natural hypnotic abilities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Diathim gave off an aura of kindness, and they were consistently described as benevolent by those spacers who propagated the legend of the Angels. They described themselves as a peaceful people. However, the Diathim were fascinated by spacecrafts, which often prompted them to mob any ships that found themselves in the vicinity of their homeworlds, Iego and Millius Prime. Because of their hypnotic abilities, those curious Diathim had a tendency to provoke accidents, causing the mesmerized observers to plunge their vessels into violent crash-landings. For those reasons, they were still regarded as dangerous entities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since the Diathim were only seen when they gathered in flocks to welcome arriving ships, knowledge of what their habitat looked like remained hidden to outsiders. Although they had no apparent language of their own, at least some of them were capable of speaking Galactic Basic Standard, the common language of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Diathim evolved in the Outer Rim Territories, on the planet of Iego and the largest of its forty-two moons, Millius Prime. They shared those worlds with the Maelibi, a species of three-meter tall burrowing beings who fed on castaways. They were known in the wider galaxy as early as 25,793 BBY, more than seven centuries before the founding of the Galactic Republic. At the time, the Basic idiom \"space angel\" referred to a selfless, innocent person."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Millennia later, during the Clone Wars, some Diathim were driven from their home on Millius Prime when a laser grid system was installed there by the Separatists to keep people from leaving. The Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker travelled to Iego with his master Obi-Wan Kenobi while on a mission to uncover a root said to contain the antidote to the Blue Shadow Virus. The two encountered one of the Diathim refugees, and the Jedi eventually managed to deactivate the laser field, thus freeing the inhabitants of Iego."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Angels in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When a young Anakin Skywalker lived on the desert world of Tatooine, he first heard of the Diathim's proverbial beauty while listening to all the pilots and traders who stopped there. Those tales influenced Skywalker's first words to his future wife Padm\u00e9 Amidala, questioning whether or not she was indeed one of those legendary beings. The boy believed Amidala's beauty unmatched, and seemed to think this led to some connections with the famed Diathim of Iego. When Amidala answered that she had never heard of Angels before, Skywalker objected she just might be unaware of her true nature."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Angels were first mentioned by Anakin Skywalker in the 1999 movie Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, the first installment of the prequel trilogy of Star Wars. Skywalker's line \"Are you an Angel?\" (Listen\u00a0(help\u00b7info)) was later spoofed in the 2004 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords as an easter egg. In a conversation that only appears after the player has completed the game at least once as a lightsider and once as a darksider, Atton Rand repeats Skywalker's line from The Phantom Menace upon seeing Meetra Surik for the first time, in her undergarments. Rand then promptly recants, stating that it was \"the worst line [he's] ever used\" and hoping that \"some poor kid doesn't start using it.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Abrahamic religions, angels are spiritual beings that act as messengers from God and as guardians of human beings.
