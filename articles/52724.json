The Porporites, a newly discovered species, quickly became addicted to ryll, whipping them into a homicidal frenzy. The Galactic Republic attempted to stop the Porporites by sending the Jedi Knights and conventional military, but they withstood everything the Republic used. Terrified for their safety (and their product), the Neimoidians hired several Gank mercenaries to protect them. Sadly, the Ganks decided that the best course of action was to exterminate the Porporites. After that, the Ganks embarked on a full scale war against the Republic. Supreme Chancellor Vocatara was forced to commission the building of Juggernaut war droids to end the fighting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The massacres also saw the first use of the modern lightsabers, independent of the power packs used during the Great Hyperspace War some two centuries earlier.
