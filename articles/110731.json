The plague, caused by a bio-weapon toxin released by Galen, first struck the city-state of Aubendo. The city-state of Aubendo was called the Isolation Sector because no one could exit Aubendo once they entered. Tacto was called the Clear Sector because there weren't any plague cases there. The ministers of Tacto fled, creating a panic among the healthy Radnoran populace, followed by widespread looting and unrest. An eight-member Jedi team that included Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Siri Tachi, and their Padawans, were sent ahead of Galactic Senate-provided evacuation transports by the Jedi High Council to attempt to bring calm and relief to the populace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Senator Bail Organa, in his persuasive pleas that lucidly communicated the dire position of \"a planet overcome by a toxic disaster,\" was directly responsible for the quick action of the Senate to provide immediate relief vessels for the world's survivors.
