The gang, known as the Laser Flits, shared a name with the flit, an aggressive species of flying reptiles native to the world of Lok. From their hangout in Mos Espa, the Laser Flits were known to engage in general mayhem."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 1 ABY, the Laser Flits ambushed a delivery of swoop parts from Watto's Shop, a Mos Espa junk shop under the ownership the Toydarian of Watto. This resulted in a considerable amount of woe for the Rodian W. Wald, an employee working for Watto. When Wald learned of the theft of his shipment, he tasked a spacer under his employ with entering the Laser Flit Hangout, and forcibly recovering all ten of the stolen swoop parts. The spacer succeeded in recovering the parts, but not without killing at least ten gang members during a violent blaster fight. Nevertheless, with the parts recovered, the delivery was finally completed when the spacer brought the shipment to Qord D'Baelor, a Human customer who frequented the bar inside Mos Espa Starport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Members"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Laser Flits primarily comprised of teenagers, including a mix of male and female Humans, female Aqualish, and male Ishi Tib. All members of the gang wore some form of purple colored clothing, sometimes mixed with shades of blue or gray. Different styles of their clothing included tactical skinsuits worn beneath sleeveless or rugged jackets, muscle shirts worn with reinforced pants and cold weather jackets, or transport flight suits. Others wore more military-like garments, including basic camouflage pants and flex-form shirts worn beneath casual jackets with cargo pockets. Stylish dress uniform jackets worn with large pocket pants were another common dress combination. For protection, Laser Flits would often make use of padded armor boots and composite armor or Mabari armorweave gloves. The majority of the Human Laser Flit gang members sported avant-garde hairstyles, with most dyeing their hair purple. Members of the gang were armed with multiple types of blaster pistols and slugthrowers, including DL-18 Blaster Pistols, FWG-5 Flechette Smart Pistols, Striker projectile pistols, and SE-14 blaster pistols."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Laser Flits appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. They were added to the game as part of a quest titled \"Wald's Woes\" with the release of \"Chapter 2: The Talus Incident\", on August 1, 2006. Players who performed the quest were tasked with entering the Laser Flit Hangout and killing Laser Flit gang members until recovering ten stolen swoop parts. While W. Wald referred to the gang as \"Laser Flits\" with a space between the two words, there were instances within the game where the gang was referred to as \"Laserflits\" without the space. For example, targeting or examining non-player character members of the gang identified them as \"Laserflit gang members.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
