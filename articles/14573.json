Hapes reinforcement took up the northern pole of Qoribu, Chiss the southern, and around a hundred and fifty thousand Colony dartships in the center. The Chiss fleet was outnumbered two to one compared to the Hapes fleet, and the situation at Qoribu became a staredown until the both forces detected the presence of the Millennium Falcon.

Taat hive members were too far away to access their new found knowledge through the hive mind. Unu tried to order the pair away, feared they would betray the Colony again.
