However, the Naboo had no need for such a bomber, and the original prototype was stolen by the Feeorin pirate Nym, who later named it Havoc. Several other prototypes were produced with only minor improvements, but the price tag on the starfighter dissuaded a number of potential buyers from investing in it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
