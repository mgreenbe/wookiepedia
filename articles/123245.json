They were also used in replacement limbs for beings. Some vehicles such as Imperial Aquatic Terrain Armored Transports, also used servomotors without which the vehicle could not properly function. A pelvic servomotor was required in most humanoid droids to allow them to mimic human movement."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A 'Swimmer' AT-AT stationed on the planet Sedri during the Galactic Civil War in the Sedri aquatic Imperial garrison needed a replacement servo motor for use during the Sedri civil war. The base's commander, Aban, ordered a new motor which was delivered by shuttle along with stormtrooper reinforcements for the base, after which it was installed by technicians.
