An experienced commander, Hague took the young girl Nan as his student and ward after her parents, friends of Hague's, were killed in a raid. During the Great Hyperspace Disaster, Hague and Nan were stranded at the Amaxine station with eleven other starships, including one with Jedi passengers, and concealed their identities as Nihil in order to take sanctuary. After the other starships had departed when hyperspace travel was being reopened, Hague and Nan stayed at the space station and summoned reinforcements in order to investigate a hyperspace relay transportation system in its lower levels. The Jedi eventually returned to the station, and Hague was killed during a skirmish between the Nihil, the Jedi and their allies, and Drengir which had been imprisoned on the station. Hague was blown out into the vacuum of space, killing him, after Reath Silas opened an airlock on the station near where the skirmish was occurring."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
