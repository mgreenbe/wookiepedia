Each droid was armed with a vibroblade, blaster carbine, and heavy grasping arm in one arm and a repeating blaster in the other. Unfortunately the very programming that it was designed to have also caused the first prototype, KLR-B1, to turn into a psychopath. Because of this, the technicians attempted to shut down all of the prototypes. They successfully shut down KLR-B2, KLR-B3, and KLR-B4, but somehow KLR-B1 managed to escape this and murdered everyone on the stations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
