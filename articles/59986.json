At some point prior to the Battle of Endor, he was enslaved by the Galactic Empire and sent to the spice mines of Sevarcos. The mine was run by the Empire and Zygerrian slavers. During his time there, he sustained a facial scar. In the months following the Battle of Endor, their spice mine on Sevarcos was the site of a battle between the Empire and the New Republic, the successor to the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Imperials appeared to gain the upper hand, Hatchet proposed to his fellow slaves, the Wookiee Greybok and the Quarren Palabar, that they use the battle as an opportunity to escape Sevarcos. The Wookiee and Quarren however suggested that they help the New Republic with Greybok ignoring Hatchet's protests and charging into the battle.

After the soldier had moved away, Hatchet laughed that nobody knew what they would do now that they were free.

After being recruited by the Zabrak bounty hunter Jas Emari, Hatchet and his companions traveled to the Wookiee homeworld Kashyyyk to help Han Solo and Chewbacca liberate the planet from the Empire. At the suggestion of Palabar, Hatchet, Greybok and Solo's team used pneumo-hammers to hammer eyebolts into the wood and to thread jump cables. This allowed Solo's team to take up position and shoot the deflector shield generator at Camp Sardo, the Imperial headquarters on Kashyyyk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Hatchet panicked and began muttering that he did not want to be there, Greybok silenced him with a violent, one-armed shaking. After Solo's team had taken out the shield generator and the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus had disabled the inhibitor chips controlling the Wookiee slaves, the Wookiees rose up in revolt enmasse. During the battle, Hatchet and his companions manned the guns on Jas Emari's gunship Halo and bombarded Imperial forces.

However, Greybok and Palabar convinced him to help their New Republic liberators. During the fighting, he mustered enough courage to kill a Zygerrian slaver who was attacking Greybok.
