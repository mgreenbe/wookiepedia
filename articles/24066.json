He was often seen as unintelligent. Along with Thandeka, the queen consort of E'ronoh's twin planet, Eiram, Cassel was kidnapped by the Directorate in a plot to destabilize the governments of the area. When Lord Isamer, a Directorate leader, became angered at his lieutenants after discovering they had kidnapped Thandeka over the true queen of Eiram, Dima, Cassel spoke up, claiming Dima would still wish for her consort's return. Thandeka accused Cassel of attempting to ally with their kidnappers, and Cassel claimed to be arguing against Isamer's view of Thandeka being useless."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
