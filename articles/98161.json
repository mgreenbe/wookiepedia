Sometime between 34 and 35 ABY, when the Resistance members Finn and Poe Dameron were sent on a mission to gather supplies, Norik, along with Oron, accompanied them to the Wayward Comet refueling station. While Dameron met with a contact, Norik and Oron waited at the station's supply depot. After Dameron learned from his contact that a cache of weapons could be found in Base 354-23X, an abandoned New Republic impound on the moon of Avedot, Dameron met up with Finn, who went to collect Norik and Oron before heading to the moon. They were followed by the Kendoh Gang, a criminal gang led by Kendoh Voss, who wished to collect a bounty on Finn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Norik was first mentioned in Allegiance 1, a comic written by Ethan Sacks and published by Marvel Comics on October 9, 2019.
