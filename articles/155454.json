As with many other citizens of the Arkadianate, she had been rotated through several different jobs throughout his life due to the Sith Lord Arkadia Calimondra's policy of exposing her subjects to different types of work. In 1032 BBY, she was present at Embarkation Station 7 where Arkadia had prepared a modified shuttle to carry her younger brother Quillan and the Bothan spy Narsk Ka'hane to Vilia Calimondra's secret location. There, she planned to used Narsk to assassinate Vilia by using a nerve toxin gas canister implanted in Quillan's hoverchair."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Howerver, Narsk was secretly working for Vilia. Arkadia ordered the Wookiee Guard to bring the Bothan into his hidden engine compartment. However, Narsk overpowered and knocked the Wookiee conscious after tricking her with his stealth suit. He then escaped Syned on the shuttle with Quillan after swapping his hoverchair. He left the hoverchair with the deadly nerve toxin canister behind and activated it, killing the ground crew before they could stop his escape. The female Wookiee Guard was killed by the nerve toxin and her body was later found by Arkadia following the Siege of Calimondretta."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
