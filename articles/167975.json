He was a member of Lourna Dee's Tempest but was eventually given his own after the death of Kassav Milliko and his Tempest after the Battle of Kur. Zeetar gained a reputation for being cantankerous, especially to his fellow Tempest Runners. Despite being hard to work with, Zeetar was a skilled engineer and was responsible for improving the Nihil's Path engines, the scav droids that the Nihil used in raids, as well as finding them a new base in an abandoned prison complex on the planet Grizal."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A shocking meeting"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zeetar met with his fellow Runners, Dee and Pan Eyta, after a disastrous defeat at the hands of the Galactic Republic during the Attack on Cyclor. Zeetar equipped a newly built powersuit and assaulted Eyta, who he now dominated in size and strength, after insulting the Dowutin for his failure. The Eye of the Nihil, Marchion Ro, broke up the fight but humiliated Eyta and gave him his helmet. To the surprise of the Runners, the helmet was designed to electrocute Eyta to death.

The Jedi Order infiltrated the camp and attacked it. Zeetar fought the Jedi Bell Zettifar and Indeera Stokes with Lourna Dee alongside him.

He is fearless in the face of spiting Pan Eyta, who was much more intimidating than he was, for the failure of one of his Clouds, Sarn Starbreaker.
