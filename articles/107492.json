Some such bases were armed with point-defense cannons, but it was more practical to have turbolasers as their main defense. The shield generator was the main defense of some such bases, although not all had them, and any hostile being or object could walk through the shield. The Galactic Empire addressed this weakness with the IM-8005 shield projector garrison. Its shield could expand to 2,600 kilometers and retract when needed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
