Prior to the Battle of Scarif, Corporal Pao carried out a demolitions job on Foerost where he took out a communications tower similar to the one on Scarif.

He studied structural dynamics and wished to become an engineer, but he gave up his possible career to join the Alliance to Restore the Republic after Imperial occupation began. He eventually joined the Rebellion and became a corporal. At some point, Pao undertook a demolition job to destroy a communications tower on Foerost. In 0 BBY, Pao joined Rogue One on a mission to steal the Death Star plans from Scarif. After Blue Squadron entered the atmosphere, Pao was killed before the death troopers arrived on the shore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pao was a short, green-gray member of the amphibious Drabatan species and a fierce commando.

He was portrayed by actor Derek Arnold, with physical expressions on Pao's face performed by Phil Woodvine, using radio-controlled animatronics. Arnold's costume rendered him nearly blind, and he relied on choreographer Paul Kasey to guide him on set using an earpiece."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Jake Lunt Davies, Pao originated from a sketch for a character in the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens who never made it into the final cut. He was originally designed with long spiky hair and a large mouth. When it was decided to use the character for Rogue One, it was concluded that his look didn't fit with the military angle, so Davies replaced Pao's hair with a kind of kepi but he opted to keep his big mouth. Eventually, director Gareth Edwards agreed to use Pao in the Battle of Scarif."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
