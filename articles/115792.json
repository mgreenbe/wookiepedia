Rikard spent his youth on the planet Coruscant, exploring the seedier districts of the world's undercity with his brother Matwe, and he later entered the service of the Pyke Syndicate as a smuggler. After Rikard failed to complete an assignment for the Pykes, the cartel demanded that he compensate them for their losses, resulting in Rikard being forced to continue serving the Pykes for the foreseeable future until he could pay off his debt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
