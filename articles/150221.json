However, the power was so great that its pulsor could fire only once every minute. The pulsor also produced a terrifying roar when firing. To prevent critical meltdowns in combat, four rows of cooling chambers fitted with cryogenic cylinders swept the power core, energy capacitors and the pulsor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
