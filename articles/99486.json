Odair fought Sinjir hand-to-hand while Tolruck's followers watched and cheered, and bested the New Republic agent with a choke hold. However, Rath Velus was able to disrupt the Imperial control module, resulting in a prison break. Odair attempted to kill Sinjir, but was attacked by an escaped Wookiee who struck him across the head with a saw blade.
