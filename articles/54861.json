During the High Republic Era, she was already renowned as a scientist and professor, working out of a provisional lab in Port Haileap, on Haileap in the Dalnan sector of the Outer Rim Territories. Galactic Republic senator Ghirra Starros decided to send her daughter Avon, an aspiring inventor and scientist herself, to be mentored by Professor Kip, as the two shared some of the same questions about the Force and life in general.
