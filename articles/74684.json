She was charged with the overall security of the Belsavis prison and reported only to the Senate Security Committee. She was in command of the prison wardens who directed the daily activities of various sections including the minimum security, high security, and maximum security areas. When the Sith Empire sent an attack force to invade the prison, Cavarat did her best to keep control of the prison. Many of her top wardens were killed and the guards had a hard time keeping control with prisoners staging continual riots. Cavarat requested help and Republic troopers with the Republic Special Forces Division were sent to restore order and fight off an Imperial invasion. She also helped the smuggler known as the Voidhound track down the escaped Rattataki crime lord Ivory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Marshall Cavarat was known to be a tough cop and ran the prison with brutal efficiency.
