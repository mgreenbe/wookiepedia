The sudden arrival of notorious extremist Saw Gerrera and his lieutenant Edrio in their UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft further complicated things, as Gerrera had already made plans to destroy the relay, tossing proton bombs onto the station's dish.

Hera and Kanan Jarrus, conducting a long-distance reconnaissance of Lothal City, discovered evidence that the Empire intended to put the highly advanced fighter into mass production. When Ryder took several members of the Spectres to spy on a test flight of the Defender Elite, Sabine had the idea to steal the prototype starfighter's flight data recorder, and she and Ezra snuck down to the airfield to do so. The arrival of Thrawn and Governor Arihnda Pryce complicated things, and led to the two Rebels stealing the entire prototype.

Hera told the leaders of the Rebellion, including Mothma, Organa and Dodonna, that this meant the Rebels had to prevent the Defender Elites from being mass produced in the first place, and they had to destroy Lothal's factories. She added that there were people on Lothal who would be able to help, were an attack authorized. Mothma asked Hera and Chopper to step out of the room while the Alliance leaders debated. Eventually, Mothma came out to tell Hera that they had discovered the Empire was enacting Protocol 13, the evacuation of all its personnel, on Lothal. This gave Hera the impetus to barge back into the briefing, and she stressed that this news meant the Rebels did not have any more time to waste, as Lothal needed their help now.

Hera ordered the X-wings to protect the slower Y-wing bombers. During the fighting, as the Rebels shot down many TIEs, Cleat and Duke were themselves shot down by Imperial ace Vult Skerris. In response, Hera lured him into a trap which disabled his personal Defender Elite's deflector shields and allowed her to shoot him down. He crashed into a light cruiser, which crashed into a Star Destroyer and sheared off its bridge superstructure, giving Hera's force an opening to Lothal's surface.

Rukh captured Daree before tracking down Hera, Mart and Chopper, who were attempting to flee the city. Eventually, the three Rebels reached a sewer hatch, which was guarded by Imperial troops. In the process of luring away the guards and getting the hatch open, Rukh caught up to them, and fought Hera. She ordered Mart and Chopper into the sewers before she was captured.

While this was going on, Rebel Command back on Yavin 4 eventually received word that there was fighting on Scarif, and immediately sent reinforcements. The fleet was led by Admiral Raddus from his flagship, the Profundity. Docked to the capital ship was the corvette Tantive IV, Princess Leia Organa's ship, which had been undergoing repairs.
