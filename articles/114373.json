In the lead-up to the war, the planet Argazda lay beyond the borders of the Republic. Thus the Argazdans petitioned for membership in the galactic government to legitimate a Republic intervention. Argazda and the neighboring space were admitted to the Republic as the Kanz sector, and Republic forces stopped the Ereesi's despoliation of Argazda. In the aftermath of the war, the Argazdans came to despise outsiders, whom they viewed as immoral. The Republic departed the planet once they deemed the Argazdans capable of handling their own affairs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
