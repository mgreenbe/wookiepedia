Behind the toxin reservoir, the dart contained a tiny explosive charge. When the dart hit its target, sensors in its tip detonated the charge, forcing the toxin out of the dart in a matter of milliseconds. This agent could then be injected into the subject via a sharp central tine, allowing direct access into the target's bloodstream. Common toxins deployed with these saberdarts included Malkite themfar, Fex-M3, and Sennari. Three hooked barbs surrounded the central cylinder. The dart could be identified by small cuts on its side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Poison darts were preferable over more direct assassination means for several reasons. First, with an appropriate toxin, the victim's death could be nearly-instantaneous, and essentially guaranteed. Secondly, the use of lethal toxins often incapacitated the target before he even realized what was happening, protecting the identity of the attacker and allowing time for escape. Because of these reasons, these exotic weapons were used by various bounty hunters and criminals across the galaxy, most notably Jango Fett and Jodo Kast. In particular, members of the Assassin's Guild and Malkite Poisoners were known to favor these darts to administer lethal toxins."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, Jango Fett used a saberdart to kill Zam Wesell, preventing her from identifying him to Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker. Although the analysis droids in the Jedi Temple were unable to determine the origin of the dart, Dexter Jettster was able to identify it and direct Kenobi to Kamino, as Jettster had previously seen one while prospecting on Subterrel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The shooting script for Attack of the Clones identifies the saberdart as a \"Kamino kyberdart,\" a name that was later changed. \"Kyber\" originally comes from the name of the Kiber Crystal, an item in early drafts of the script for A New Hope."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the board game Star Wars: Epic Duels, Boba Fett, not Jango Fett, is able to attack with this dart.
