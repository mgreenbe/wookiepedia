In about 31 BBY, a rival firm of the company Mothven Star Trading sabotaged a package that was due to be delivered to Mothven's headquarters on the planet Cularin. They filled the parcel with an explosive device and a quantity of banthazolate with a street value of 50,000, and the saboteurs hoped that the device would detonate and scatter banthazolate throughout Mothven's headquarters. However, before the package could be delivered, the couriers hired to transport it were arrested by the Office of Peace and Security\u2014a local law enforcement agency\u2014which confiscated the banthazolate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
