He was subsequently picked up by the American DC Comics, and as \"the first comics writer living in Britain to do prominent work in America,\" he worked on big-name characters such as Batman, writing Batman: The Killing Joke, and Superman with \"Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\" In his work at DC he also markedly developed the character Swamp Thing, and penned original titles such as the highly revered Watchmen. During that decade, Moore had a tremendous effect on bringing about greater social respectability for the medium in the United States and United Kingdom. In the late 1980s and early 1990s he left the comic industry mainstream and went independent for a long while, working on experimental work such as the epic From Hell, the pornographic\u2014or, as Moore says, \"intelligently pornographic\"\u2014Lost Girls, and the prose novel Voice of the Fire. He subsequently made a return to the mainstream during the late 1990s, before developing America's Best Comics, an imprint through which he published other renowned works such as The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and the occult-based Promethea."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moore is an occultist, ceremonial magician, and anarchist, and has featured such or similar themes in works including Promethea, From Hell, and V for Vendetta, as well as performing avant-garde spoken word occult \"workings,\" some of which have been released on CD.
