The droids managed to purchase four jogan fruits, though they were swindled out of 32 credits by a Khramboan vender, Droogan. Soon after, they were droidnapped by the bounty hunter Cad Bane and his droid team. Bane wanted to get informations about the Senate Building's layout from Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala's droids. After the bounty hunter obtained the valuable informations from R2-D2's memory bank, he had the two droids mind-wiped, and ordered Todo 360 and HELIOS-3E to dump them back on the streets of the lower market districts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
