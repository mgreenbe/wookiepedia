Unlike previous assaults, the natives came in greater numbers and were more organized, but under the leadership of Warden Derrin Weller the Jedi Knights and Masters stationed at the outpost were able to wipe out the Flesh Raider assault with minor casualties on their side. During the battle, a young Jedi who had been sent by Weller to seal off the attackers' tunnel was successful in defeating Callef, before the Jedi Master Orgus Din collapsed the tunnel with the Force. As a result of the attack, that same young apprentice was later sent to the nearby Twi'lek village of Kalikori in order to learn what the settlers knew of the natives' recent activities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack on the Gnarls Outpost first appeared in the 2011 BioWare massively multiplayer online role-playing video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, as the first event of the Jedi Knight class in the mission \"Attack of the Flesh Raiders.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
