Specifically, they discussed the rare opportunity Palpatine unintentionally presented to them to have Anakin keep tabs on the Supreme Chancellor to see his doings. Obi-Wan is shown to explicitly be against the decision, because he knows Anakin is not the type to simply do what he's told (due to his own personal experience with Anakin), and because Anakin's not the type to hide his emotions (also citing this is exactly the same reason why the Council ruled against having him promoted to Jedi Master), which consequentially also made Anakin very honest and fiercely loyal, also citing that it carried the risk of utterly destroying his and Palpatine's friendship throughout the years, which would have been too great especially if it turned out the Supreme Chancellor was confirmed innocent. However, Obi-Wan ended up out-voted and reluctantly submitted to the decision. The scene also implies that the Jedi Council had ulterior motives to their having Anakin specifically spy on the Supreme Chancellor besides simply concern for the Republic's well being, as Mace Windu cited that trying to sabotage Anakin's friendship with Palpatine to ensure Anakin remained distant from the Supreme Chancellor was the best reason for making Anakin their spy. The sequence also revealed that, at least during Obi-Wan's brief time among the Council, the Jedi Council's more prone to entering arguments over what to do than actually entering communion with the Force to reach a decision as various Jedi Masters have reportedly done since before the return of the Sith."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The departure of the Separatist Council"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the film, Obi-Wan overhears Grievous briefing the Separatist Council about their new hideaway on Mustafar before they depart in front of Kenobi's eyes.

Palpatine asks if this is all he wishes, and the 'game' escalates until Corellia is mentioned. Sidious asks him if he wishes only the planet or the entire system. Anakin told him he wanted the whole system. The point of this game is to strengthen Palpatine's assertion that the Jedi hold Anakin back, and that he must choose for himself (a Sith idea, as it focuses only on what he wants) what he desires, \"letting himself out,\" as Palpatine puts it. It also represents the length to which Palpatine is willing to go for his future apprentice; it is clear that he would, in fact, have given Anakin the entire Corellian sector had he so desired."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The arrest of the Chancellor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the novelization, Mace Windu contacted Yoda once more after learning the truth of Palpatine's identity, sanctioning his upcoming decision and action with the approval of the Grand Master of the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The novelization stated that Darth Sidious could indeed sense the approach of the four Jedi Masters, as well as the emotional turmoil of Anakin Skywalker, who was still waiting in the Council Chamber.

When his green blade flickered out, Skywalker smashed the window to Palpatine's private office and leaped through. There, he found the dead body of Kolar and the heads of Saesee Tiin and Kit Fisto (who was also only slashed in the movie).

Mace confessed, however, that Vaapad could not overpower the Sith Lord, and it was his shatterpoint ability which allowed him to gain the upper hand. In the book, Mace Windu did not kick Sidious's jaw, and he sliced the Chancellor's weapon in half rather than knocking it from his grasp.
