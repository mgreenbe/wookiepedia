Trials of Obi-Wan includes more than 50 new quests, from rescue missions to the exploration of a crashed Republic cruiser. Many quests also revolve around the return of HK-47 from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, whom players can kill for a quest. The expansion also allows players to interact with the ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi to help him \"correct an imbalance in the Force\" present on Mustafar. High-level quest rewards include the ability to find a fiery red crystal found only on the volcanic planet that creates a lava-like lightsaber. No new space sector was added with this expansion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Boxed Set"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trials of Obi-Wan is also available in the The Complete Online Adventures compilation pack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
