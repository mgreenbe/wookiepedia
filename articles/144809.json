While conversing Revan asked the Chieftain to tell the story of their tribe. However, he refused, stating that only the Storyteller was permitted to tell the history, and that only warriors were permitted to hear it. After the Jedi defeated a Krayt dragon and returned its pearl to the Chieftain as proof, he deemed Revan worthy and permitted him to hear the history, with a warning that speaking it in error would be considered blasphemy punishable by death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Revan then met the Storyteller, who began telling their history, with HK-47 translating. He stated that Tatooine had once been a green and lush world, but with the arrival of the Rakata and their Infinite Empire, his people had been suppressed. Many were kidnapped while other were forced to hide in caves. After the Rakata suffered a plague, however, the Sand People rose up against their invaders. Eventually the Rakata would leave and destroy the planet's surface, turning it into a desert."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sand People then became nomads, and new outsiders arrived to mine the ores in Tatooine's ground.
