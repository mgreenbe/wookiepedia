She began training in the ways of the Force at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, the capital planet of the Galactic Republic. Honi was sorted into a clan with nine other Initiates under the stewardship of Jedi Master Ali-Alann. In 44 BBY, when Honi was nearly three years old, her clan got into an accident as Ali-Alann was escorting them in a turbolift that connected the nursery to the dining halls. During the ride, all save one of the turbolift car's repulsorlifts failed and the horizontal shaft collapsed, leaving the car teetering over the Lake Level several hundred meters below. In order to keep the children calm while waiting for rescue, Ali-Alann told them stories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The accident was witnessed by Jedi Initiate Bant Eerin and Obi-Wan Kenobi, a former Padawan hoping to re-enter the Jedi Order. Recognizing the danger the students were in, Eerin rushed to call for help. Meanwhile, Kenobi climbed up to the shattered shaft and assisted Ali-Alann in removing the Initiates from the car, Honi being the first to be taken out. By then, members of the Jedi High Council had arrived to the scene, as had Master Qui-Gon Jinn. The Council members used the Force to hold the car steady while Kenobi took out the younglings one by one and handed them to Jinn. When all of the children were safe, Master Mace Windu commended them on doing well in the scary situation, saying that the Force had been with them\u2014to which Honi earnestly replied that Ali-Alann had been there as well. The Jedi later found out that the accident had been arranged by the Dark Jedi Xanatos, the failed former apprentice of Jinn who had planned to bring down the Jedi Temple."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Honi had brown eyes and red hair that she wore in braids coiled around her head at the time of the accident.
