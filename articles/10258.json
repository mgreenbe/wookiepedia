By tis time, the system was home to the strategic Bilbringi Shipyards that were constructing hundreds of starships to the New Republic. The attack took place in 27 ABY and the Vong reached the system by traveling down the Namadii Corridor hyperlane from a previous battle in the Vortex system. After the attack the Vong continued down the same hyperlane and attacked the Borleias system. Two years later, the Galactic Alliance and Imperial Remnant attempted to reclaim the Bilbringi system in a combined attack known as Operation Trinity. However, the operation failed, due to the Vong bringing down the HoloNet relay stations and preventing the coordination of the attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack on the Bilbringi system was first mentioned in The Final Prophecy when the Galactic Alliance attempted to reclaim Bilbringi. The exact dating of the capture of Bilbringi by the Vong was not stated in the books of the New Jedi Order series. In The Essential Atlas, a reference book released in 2009 and written by Jason Fry and Daniel Wallace, the attack is not mentioned in the text of the book but is shown on a map detailing conflicts. The reference book put this attack between the attack on Vortex and Borleias that both appeared in Star by Star. Thus the attack on the Bilbringi system must occur during the event of Star by Star, in 27 ABY (62:4)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
