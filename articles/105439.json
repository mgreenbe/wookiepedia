Small, cylindrical machines, the droids were simple yet effective operatives who used their multifaceted tools to assist in dangerous medical emergencies. Around the year 232 BBY, the Hetzal system fell victim to a Great Hyperspace Disaster, in which debris from the freighter Legacy Run exited hyperspace on collision courses for the various inhabited parts of the system. During a rescue operation on Solar Array 22-X, the Republic Defense Coalition Captain Finial Bright utilized one pill droid in gathering survivors from the wrecked space station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pill droids were also used aboard the Panacea, a Salvation-class Republic medical frigate that catered to victims of the Disaster and the subsequent Emergences that followed. Later, the Hetzalian resident Keven Tarr developed a complex array made up of navidroids to calculate where fragments of the Legacy Run would emerge next. The system generated an immense amount of heat, so Tarr employed pill droids to use suppressor foam on the machine to prevent it from tearing itself apart."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
