In 32 BBY, the Inferno Turret defended several Revenant scouts and transports when the base was attacked by the Trade Federation megacorporation. Once the turret was fully online its firepower was enough to dissuade even heavily-shielded Trade Federation Dropships from moving within its line of fire. In the end the Inferno Turret was scuttled, alongside the rest of the base, as part of a trap to destroy a Trade Federation C-9979 landing craft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
