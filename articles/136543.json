There were two main components to the comlink: a sensitive microphone that was placed near the throat, and a tiny speaker that was implanted near the ear. Developed especially for espionage agents, this device allowed the user to communicate with a remote individual by barely speaking above a whisper. Although the communications link to the remote being is encrypted, a compromised frequency required that the implant be temporarily removed to switch channels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
