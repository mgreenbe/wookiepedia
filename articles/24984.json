About one quarter of the way up the the cord from the main handle, was a second grip for another hand, which allowed the wielder to swing the chain-sickle with accuracy and force. The last half of the cords leading to the bludgeon was studded with small spikes which could still inflict damage even if a target evaded the primary blades. The most lethal section of the weapon was a large scythe-shaped blade covering half of the bludgeon with two smaller blades protruding opposite the main blade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Master Thame Cerulian once fought against three chain-sickle-wielding assassins on the planet Filve, and barely made it out of the encounter alive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Count Dooku had betrayed her, and presumed her dead, Asajj Ventress returned to her Nightsister clan on Dathomir to seek a means of exacting vengeance against her former master. She traveled to the Nightbrother village to find a suitable warrior to be given to Dooku as her replacement, who would then turn on the Sith Lord and kill him. She chose a group of Zabrak Nightbrothers to be tested. The one who survived the trials would become her champion. During the Test of Night, Ventress wielded a chain-sickle while using the Force to conceal herself from sight and move at accelerated speeds. Using the weapon, she dispatched two Nightbrothers in a matter of moments."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short time later, the Jedi Council sent Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to Dathomir to search out information on the mysterious assassin who had killed two Jedi on Devaron.
