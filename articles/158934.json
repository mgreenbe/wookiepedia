Additionally Hextrophon speculates on a connection between the Lady with the Locust Heart worshipped by the Cult of the Five. Rumors circulating at the time connected the Vain Goddess to the Goddess of the Pius Dea, as adherents on ancient Drogheda preformed a blood ritual in devotion to the Vain Goddess. He further draws connections between Onrai and the Scorekeeper, the Dancing Goddess, but admitted more studies would need to be conducted before conclusive evidence could be presented."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
