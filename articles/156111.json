The clone trooper pilot transported a number of clone troopers of the 332nd Company to the city of Sundari on the planet Mandalore to assist the Mandalore resistance in taking back the city from the former Sith Maul. Before the pilot's gunship could reach Sundari, it was hit and suffered damage, and the pilot was unable to eject. The former Jedi Ahsoka Tano, who was leading the forces of the 332nd, jumped onto the falling craft and rescued the pilot, who ejected from the ship after thanking her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
