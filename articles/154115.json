She was killed during the Battle of Dathomir in 20 BBY, becoming a spirit. When Maul and Jedi Padawan Ezra Bridger drank a potion to restart their force bond, the spell woke up a group of Nightsister spirits. She told the group to pay their dues of flesh and blood. The sister then possessed Kanan Jarrus, engaging into duel with Maul. Ezra and Maul ran out the Nightsister fortress. The spirit refused to go outside the structure, as their energy was drawn from the Nightsisters' altar. When Ezra entered the building, the spirit engaged in combat with Ezra. Overpowering Ezra, Ezra pushed the spirit in order to gain the upper hand. The padawan told the spirit that he was the one the spirit wanted, causing the spirit to leave Kanan's body.  The spirit charged at Ezra, but Ezra destroyed the Nightsister altar, causing the spirit to disenegrate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
