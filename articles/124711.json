She traveled from her homeworld of Alpheridies to seek out a Jedi who could train her in the ways of the Force, planning to return one day to her homeworld and establish a Jedi academy there. She wished to bring Jedi training to the already Force-sensitive Miraluka people, so that others of her kind would not have to travel from their homeworld to learn about the Force. Culu eventually found her way to the Jedi library world of Ossus where she trained under the Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas\u2014she would ultimately become a very knowledgeable student of the history of the Jedi Order. Following the completion of her training, she was selected to be one of the few Jedi who were sent as reinforcements to help Ulic Qel-Droma during the Freedon Nadd Uprising on Onderon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Naddist Revolt helped identify Culu as an aspiring and deserving Jedi. Shortly after its conclusion, she was one of a handful of Jedi who learned how to fly one of the local Beast Riders' war beasts. She later participated in a Jedi Convocation on Deneba, as well as fight against the Krath during the Great Sith War. Culu was an experienced and talented pilot, choosing to fly a S-100 Stinger-class starfighter in most conflicts; during the Great Sith War, she flew as Jedi Three against the Krath at Cinnagar. Later on in the war, Culu, along with fellow Jedi Qrrrl Toq and Dace Diath, was killed at Kemplex IX when Krath sorceress Aleema Keto used Sith powers to destroy a star in the Cron Drift."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shoaneb Culu, a female Miraluka, hailed from the planet Alpheridies. Like all members of her species, she lacked vision yet possessed natural Force-sensitivity, and throughout her childhood, she grew comfortable with how Alpheridies's environment affected her natural Force awareness. Against the wishes of her parents, she left her homeworld at an early age to seek out members of the Jedi Order. Before she left, she vowed to one day return and establish a Jedi training center there, in an effort to train the naturally Force-sensitive Miraluka. Culu looked at the lengthy journey that lay before her; she reasoned that founding a Jedi school on Alpheridies would provide other Miraluka the opportunity to have Jedi readily available to teach them the ways of the Force. To that end, she decided that, once she had begun her training as a Jedi, she would explore all the knowledge and lore available to her, so as to be better prepared for the teaching role she wished to pursue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Culu's travels became much more difficult than she had first anticipated. When she ventured outside of the comfortable boundaries of her homeworld, Culu experienced an exceptionally different feeling through the Force, given off by her new, and ever changing surroundings. The Force vibrations that she felt started to become increasingly difficult to endure, and at times she became unbalanced as she attempted to adjust to the new environments she found herself in. Eventually, Culu learned how to adjust to her new perceptions and managed to decrease the time it took her to reestablish her bearings from days, to hours, to seconds."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi training"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Culu's journey took more than a year before she finally reached the place where she could feel the Force calling her\u2014the Jedi library world of Ossus. Once on the planet, she found herself drawn to Master Vodo-Siosk Baas, who eventually agreed to take her on as his apprentice. Culu began her training immediately, and took an active interest in her studies of ancient Jedi lore. Due to her excitement about finally being able to train as a Jedi, and coupled with her naturally inquisitive nature, Culu found herself in the Great Jedi Library studying ancient lore for long hours. Oftentimes she could be found asking Baas and other Masters a great many deep, thought provoking questions. Culu's relentless line of questions troubled Master Baas, and he mistook her curiosity for a thirst for quick power. However, when Master Baas expressed his concerns to Culu, she told him of her desire to eventually return to Alpheridies and establish a Jedi training center there. She explained that it was not a lust for power, but a desire to help others; she hoped to learn all she could from the libraries and Jedi Masters, so that she could one day become a teacher herself. Hearing that, Master Baas was greatly relieved and dedicated many hours each day to Culu, helping her gain a deeper understanding of the Jedi Order, its history, and of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Culu excelled at the academic portion of her studies, surpassing her peers in understanding the Force and assimilating Jedi lore, but the level of her natural Force abilities eventually fell below that of the other apprentices. As a result, she continually fell behind in her Force technique. The next several months saw Culu become increasingly frustrated with her lack of progress\u2014as time continued to pass, she began to fear that her dream of bringing Jedi teachings to her homeworld would not come to pass."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Master Baas recognized the troubles that his young apprentice was going through, and decided to spend time with Culu, showing her that she need not worry about the future, and that she should only trust in the Force. After several private sessions with Master Baas, Culu began to understand what he was telling her\u2014that it was not her place to be concerned with things outside of her control, and that her expectations for her homeworld were hampering her training advancement. She began to see that what she planned may not be what the Force would produce, regardless of her actions. Following these sessions with Master Baas, Culu overcame her depression, and was able to continue her training with a different outlook on her future as a Jedi. Although she had developed a new attitude, Culu still experienced difficulty with her training in Jedi techniques, especially when it came to constructing her own lightsaber. Even though she still had problems, she did not allow herself to become anxious over them. Instead, she accepted the fact that she had not yet reached her full potential in these problem areas, and decided to dedicate more time toward her Force training."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Near the end of Culu's apprenticeship, fellow Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma sent a request to the both the Jedi assembled on Ossus and the Galactic Senate on the planet Coruscant for reinforcements while fighting in the Freedon Nadd Uprising. Culu, as with many other Jedi present on Ossus, volunteered for service on Onderon. Upon hearing Culu's request, Master Baas pulled her aside from the assembly and offered his counsel on her offer. Baas expressed that he did not feel Culu yet possessed enough confidence in her own abilities to be an effective member of the task force. Culu, however, did not become frustrated or agitated with her mentor's concerns\u2014instead, she calmly replied that she understood his reluctance, and that he had been a good teacher, but she had learned to place her trust completely in the Force. Culu confessed that it was not for glory that she sought Onderon but that the Force was pulling her toward something important. Baas was surprised by the calmness that he felt in her, and realized that he had misjudged his student. Baas gave Culu his blessing, and the morning following the assembly, Culu joined her fellow Jedi Qrrrl Toq, Dace Diath, Kith Kark, and Nomi Sunrider on the task force headed to Onderon."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Naddist Revolt"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ulic Qel-Droma and his brother Cay, Tott Doneeta, Oss Wilum, and Jedi Master Arca Jeth had originally been on Onderon tracking down and fighting the dark side energies that subdued the planet for centuries. Not long after defeating Queen Amanoa and driving back the spirit of the Sith Lord Freedon Nadd, Master Jeth and the other Jedi were confronted by a new dark side power: a Sith cult known as the Naddists attacked the funeral procession of Amanoa and managed to steal the sarcophagi of both the fallen Queen and Freedon Nadd. Following that event, Master Jeth was captured by the Sith sorcerer King Ommin, and subjected to prolonged torture. Culu and the rest of the task force were thereafter dispatched to Onderon to aid Qel-Droma and his companions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The five Jedi traveled to Onderon and made their way to the walled city of Iziz, the last reported location of Qel-Droma and his team of Jedi. However, when Culu and the others arrived at the city, they sensed through the Force that Qel-Droma was no longer in Iziz, but rather somewhere nearby. They realized that he was held up in the Beast-Lord Oron Kira's fortress not far from the city. Rushing to Qel-Droma's aid, Culu and the other Jedi charged the more numerous ranks of Dark Side Adepts, using the Force to project a shield around themselves, utilizing Force battle-techniques perfected by Jedi over many centuries. During the fight to reach Qel-Droma, Culu demonstrated a natural affinity with her lightsaber, often fighting separate from the other Jedi. Culu and her Jedi comrades finally reached Qel-Droma, and together, the combined Jedi force stormed Ommin's stronghold and managed to free the imprisoned Arca Jeth as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following King Ommin's defeat by the Jedi, the remains of Freedon Nadd, Ommin, and Amanoa were interred in a tomb on the jungle moon of Dxun, where it was hoped that Nadd's dark side taint would eventually fade.

Before long, Master Jeth informed Culu and the other gathered Jedi on Onderon about a coup that was recently staged in the Empress Teta system. Tott Doneeta also spoke of Aleema and Satal Keto, Tetan royals who were also recently on Onderon. Culu deduced these two cousins must have learned Sith magic from King Ommin and carried Sith teachings across the galaxy. That turn of events caused Master Jeth much concern, and he therefore ordered Culu, Dace Diath, Qrrrl Toq, and Oss Wilum to Ossus to report to the Jedi assembly what had transpired on Onderon. He also advised them to warn the Republic of the impending danger presented by the rise of the Ketos' Krath cult."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The information provided by Culu and her fellow Jedi allowed the Republic to organize a joint Republic-Jedi fleet and set out for the Empress Teta System\u2014more specifically to Koros Major. Culu flew as a pilot in the combined fleet, which arrived in the system just in time to lend aid to the last remaining holdouts which were fighting against the Krath. However, Satal and Aleema Keto used their Sith magic, conjuring illusions and causing the Krath forces to employ suicide tactics against the attacking Republic fleet. The Republic-Jedi fleet was severely defeated and forced to retreat to Republic space. Culu was among the few Jedi pilots to survive the attack on Koros Major."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The severity of the Krath coup, combined with their victory at Koros Major and subsequent incursions into Republic space, worried the Jedi leaders. As a result, a conclave was called on the planet of Deneba. The Conclave on Deneba was held on Mount Meru and saw thousands of Jedi Masters and Knights arrive to take part in the discussions\u2014among the many Jedi Knights present was Shoaneb Culu. During the assembly Ulic Qel-Droma presented a plan in which he would volunteer to infiltrate the Krath, and destroy the cult from within. However, Culu was one of many Jedi to openly speak out against Qel-Droma's plan. While the assembly was debating the proposed strategy, they were suddenly attacked by the Krath and an army of their war droids. Culu fought beside her fellow Jedi, and they were able to repel the attack, though Master Jeth was killed during the fighting. Qel-Droma was devastated by Jeth's death, and used it as justification for implementing his infiltration plan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Qel-Droma's plan was successful, and he quickly rose through Krath ranks while unwittingly walking the path of the dark side. After several months of no contact with Qel-Droma, the Jedi sent Nomi Sunrider to search for him. After an unsuccessful attempt by Sunrider to bring Qel-Droma back to Ossus, the Jedi felt it was time to extract Qel-Droma from the Krath, forcefully or otherwise. The Jedi planned an all-out assault against the Krath forces on Cinnagar, involving a fleet of warships and a strike team of Jedi. Attached to the Republic fleet was a squadron of Jedi starfighters, consisting of Oss Wilum and Dace Diath flying the new Star Saber XC-01 starfighters, and Culu flying her personal S-100 Stinger-class starfighter. During the attack, Culu's call sign was Jedi Three, while Wilum and Diath were Jedi One and Jedi Two, respectively. For the most part, the attack went according to plan, and Culu demonstrated her flying abilities by destroying several anti-aircraft emplacements.

While Culu and the other Jedi were on Coruscant, Qel-Droma, who by that time had become a Sith Lord, led the Krath in a massive attack against the Republic capital. Culu, along with Dace Diath and others, defended the city-world against the invading armies. The Krath were eventually repelled by the Republic and Jedi forces, and forced to retreat away from the planet. Due to the treachery of Aleema Keto, Qel-Droma was left by himself to fight the combined might of several Jedi, including Sunrider and Master Baas\u2014both of whom used a Force-blocking technique which had been taught by Master Odan-Urr.

His revenge was quick and decisive\u2014Qel-Droma organized an attack fleet to head for Kemplex IX, and placed Keto in command. Qel-Droma knew that Keto's attack on the Republic outpost would result in a deadly supernova, though he led her to believe that she would be perfectly safe.
