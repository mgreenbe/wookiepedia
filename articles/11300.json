Following the overthrowing of Imperial forces on the planet Seltos, and the established of a pro-New Republic government, the pair sought to return the planet to Imperial control. Going into hiding at a secret Imperial base west of Sommin City, Hensworth was still able to maintain contact with Deboora by promising her the Governorship if they regained control of the planet.
