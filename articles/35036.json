Her father was also called Darth Wyyrlok and was Krayt's top lieutenant and closest advisor as early as 41 ABY. His duties were eventually passed down to his daughter, who became Krayt's most trusted advisor and acted as the guardian of the One Sith while her Master rested in stasis. The Sith remained hidden on the planet Korriban for a century, and as Krayt's order and his plans to conquer the galaxy developed and grew, he often retired to stasis for years at a time. Like her father before her, Wyyrlok became Krayt's voice and the Regent of the One Sith during these periods. She had a son at some point, and he eventually assumed her name and responsibilities. The third Darth Wyyrlok was serving Darth Krayt by 130 ABY when Krayt seized control of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Wyyrlok was a Sith Master of the One Sith, an organization of Force-users deeply immersed in the dark side of the Force.

Her first direct mention occurred in 2007, when Legacy's fourteenth issue established that she was the mother of the third Darth Wyyrlok. 2010 brought her first visual depiction in a flashback scene in the first issue of Legacy's followup miniseries, Star Wars: Legacy\u2014War. While designing the character's look, Duursema consulted with fellow artist Douglas Wheatley, who was also penciling female Chagrian characters for the comic series Star Wars: Dark Times."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
