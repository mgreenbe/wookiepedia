It was established in the years of the Great Galactic War by Jawas who had restored a spaceport in the hopes of encouraging trade in the region. However, the Exchange took over the settlement and drove the Jawas back into the deserts. Not long after, the reconstituted Sith Empire arrived unannounced and claimed the settlement. In doing so, they deposed the Exchange and flushed out their opposition. This allowed a Sith garrison to be stationed in the region in order to explore the region of Anchorhead, a former Czerka Corporation outpost in order to find Czerka's abandoned Secret Weapons division laboratory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
