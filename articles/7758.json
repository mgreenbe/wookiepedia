Three days later, the two ships crossed paths with an Imperial reconnaissance squadron, leading to a short battle between the two opposing sides.

Thirty hours later, the two ships were ambushed in the Enrivi system by a light cruiser and a squadron of TIE fighters. The Thunderstrike and Promise proceeded to destroy their foe without much difficulty. Nineteen hours after that, the pair of ships entered the Chonsetta system, only to be attacked again by a squadron of TIE interceptors that had been hiding in a comet trail.

Therefore Micha Evon, the captain of Twilight Company, held a meeting with the bridge crew of both the Thunderstrike and Apailana's Promise as well as high ranking members of Twilight Company to discuss a solution to the matter. Two individuals from the Promise suggested heading into Baskron Pirate territory and bargaining for materials to make repairs to the Thunderstrike. Commander Paonu, the Thunderstrike's naval captain, suggested having Chalis and select personnel escape on the Promise to safety while the rest of Twilight Company faced obliteration. Chalis, on the other hand, suggested locating an Imperial cargo transport and boarding it.

They awaited an Imperial freighter to attack, hoping that Imperial forces would not arrive first to pursue them. An Imperial heavy freighter arrived just two hours into the wait, and Chalis contacted it, using her clearance codes, to make the vessel change course. Once it did, both the Promise and the Thunderstrike ambushed it from each side.

However, an Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser soon arrived at the Redhurne system and set a course for the battle. Captain Evon therefore gave the squads five minutes to return to their boarding pods and get back to the Thunderstrike. Once all the squads returned, the two ships jumped out of the system under heavy fire, dealing scars to both of them. The Promise had also lost its deflector shield generator trying to block fire onto the corvette.

The spies attacked the Thunderstrike's bridge and killed its leading officers, including Commander Paonu and Evon's second, Lieutenant Sairgon.

It involved the Thunderstrike and Promise flying through the atmosphere at close proximity, pursued by hundreds of TIE fighters.
