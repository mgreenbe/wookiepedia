Among the cave's occupants included important Darkwalker members, including Bloodlord Trienial and Chief of Science Flangolial. Circa 1 ABY, the Darkwalkers shot down a shuttle near Dee'ja Peak in order to steal a bio-scanner. The shuttle crashed in the Gallo Mountains and the Darkwalkers plundered the wreckage. A spacer working with the scientist Tanoa Vills then raided the Darkwalker Cave nearby to recover the stolen bio-scanner. Bloodlord Trienial and Chief of Science Flangolial were killed during the assault. A few time later, a spacer sent by Boss Rugor Nass entered the cave to retrieve one of the pieces of a broken Gungan artifact scattered by the Ultragungans in various areas of Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Darkwalker Cave was a location in the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
