Following the lead of nearby worlds after suffering the Mandalorian Wars, Alba-16 joined Darth Revan's Sith Empire during the Jedi Civil War. Remaining in Sith Space until the Republic retook the sector when the Army of Light vanquished the Brotherhood of Darkness, the planet would remain loyal to the Republic for the next several millennia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 44 BBY, the planet was in the midst of a violent civil war. Nuuta, one of the renewed Phindians, was sent to Alba as punishment for fighting against the Syndicat on Phindar. The use of the world as a penal camp was ended by the efforts of Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Seceding from the Republic during the Clone Wars, the planet joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems, only to return to the Republic, now the Galactic Empire, as the CIS was defeated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the rise of the Empire, the planet had little real Imperial presence, lacking a garrison. Ex-Jedi and fugitive Ferus Olin went to a cantina on Alba-16 following his escape from Dontamo's prison facility. Surviving the Galactic Civil War, the planet was located in the area controlled by Warlord Zsinj's empire during the years following Emperor Palpatine's demise. While Zsinj was ultimately killed, the planet would remain loyal to the infamous Grand Admiral Thrawn until he was assassinated. Remaining distant from the New Republic, the world would be cut off from the galaxy by the horrors of the Yuuzhan Vong War. As of 137 ABY the Belsmuth sector was located in space controlled by Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally mentioned in Jude Watson's Jedi Apprentice: The Hidden Past, Alba was noted as having been engaged in a civil war.
