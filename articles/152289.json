The captain was a Klatooinian man, and other crew included a Snivvian lieutenant, a Rodian, another alien, and a Human. The freighter was intercepted near Shipwrights' Trace by Dool Pundar's pirate ship, which disabled the two of the freighter's thrusters and the primary shield generator. Pundar ordered the crew to surrender and sent B1-Series battle droids to take control of the vessel. Pundar then allowed the crew to leave in an escape pod. After Pundar absconded with their vessel, the crew transmitted a distress signal to the planet Coruscant, home of the Galactic Republic. At the time of its capture, the ship was insured."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The freighter appears in 2011's The Clone Wars: Strange Allies, a comic tie-in to the Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Secret Missions young readers series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
