Julpa wants to put an end to their age-old rivalry and offers Toda a charter of peace. Toda is suspicious of anything that Mon Julpa has to say to him, but his daughter, Gerin, supports Julpa's charter. Julpa's advisor, Sollag, is insulted by Toda's inferences and calls him a barbarian. A fight nearly breaks out, but is quickly averted when they see C-3PO getting into a scuffle with a small animal named Ingey. Peals of laughter erupt from the throne room."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Jyn Obah, the first mate of the pirate Gir Kybo Ren-Cha, sneaks into the palace of Mon Julpa to rescue his captain. He uses a mini-stunner on the guards and breaks Ren free. They sneak past the remaining palace sentries by disguising themselves as natives of Tammuz-an and head for the docking bay. There they find Jann Tosh and Jessica Meade boarding their A-wing fighters. During a grueling fight, Mon Julpa returns just in time to witness the pirates' escape attempt. Jyn zaps Mon Julpa, Jann, and Gerin with the mini-stunner. Ren grabs Gerin and steals one of the A-wings. He leaves poor Jyn behind to fend for himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jyn Obah is placed into one of the palace dungeons. C-3PO and R2-D2 visit his cell and interrogate him. Fearing the feisty astromech droid, Jyn tells the two that Ren has taken Gerin to the swamp world known as the Bog moon of Bogden. The droids relay this information back to Jann and Jess who embark upon a rescue mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, Ren arrives on the moon and holes up inside of a shipwrecked star cruiser. He radios Mon Julpa and Toda, and informs them that he will release Gerin if they agree to free all of his crew mates. Toda blames Mon Julpa for his daughter's capture and agrees to Ren's demands. He arrests Mon Julpa with plans of sending him to the bog moon along with the pirate crew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back on the swamp world, Jann, Jess and the droids finally arrive. They split up and begin searching the various levels of the star cruiser. Jess and Artoo find Ren on the bridge of the ship, but he traps them inside of a force field. Ren then picks up what might be a Beam-tube and goes off to hunt the others. Jann and Threepio find Gerin in the lower depths; she is running away from a pack of vicious animals known as Sungwas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Ren's crew has been released from their prison cells. Jyn Obah pilots the Dianoga and travels to Bogden with Mon Julpa as a hostage. They arrive at the swamp moon and disembark from the ship. Ren tells Mon Julpa that he has no intention of setting Gerin free. The King of Tammuz-an, however, suspected such a betrayal. He opens the ship's cargo hold revealing Lord Toda and a full complement of Tammuz-an warriors. A fire-fight breaks out between the warriors and the pirates, but ultimately the good guys win. Ren and his crew are captured once again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Everyone returns to Tammuz-an where Mon Julpa and Lord Toda agree to sign the charter of peace.
