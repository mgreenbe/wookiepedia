They then crashed a ship of the same model than Donovan's to cover the theft of the cargo. Donovan himself was captured and imprisoned in the Deflarian bunker. CorSec Inspector Cora hired a spacer to investigate the situation. The spacer managed to find the location of the bunker, infiltrated the building and found the imprisoned Captain Donovan. The spacer therefore killed Vinros, several Deflarian henchmen and a Deflarian underboss to liberate Donovan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Deflarian bunker appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
