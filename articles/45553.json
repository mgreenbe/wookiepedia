In 25 BBY, Rex was framed for crimes that he did not commit by his friend and fellow Jedi Knight Alysun Celz, who had fallen to the dark side. As he was being taken back to the Jedi High Council on Coruscant to stand trial, the cruiser Radiant IX crashed on the Poison Moon asteroid in the Hoth system. Rex escaped to the asteroid's surface as Celz, now a Dark Jedi, proceeded to kill the ship's crew. When Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan, Anakin Skywalker, investigated the crash, Rex eventually met with Kenobi as Skywalker stayed aboard the Radiant IX with Celz. Rex persuaded the Knight that Celz had fallen to the dark side and helped Kenobi incapacitate Celz, who was torturing Skywalker with Force lightning.

In 25 BBY, Celz, who had fallen to the dark side of the Force, framed Rex for crimes that she committed.

When the Radiant IX did not arrive at the Jedi Temple, the High Council dispatched Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan, Anakin Skywalker, to search for and detain Rex. When they discovered the wrecked cruiser in the asteroid field, the Jedi searched the body-littered ship for signs of life and soon located Celz, who deceived Kenobi and Skywalker into believing that Rex had slain the ship's crew.
