Her decision to help the droid BB-8 would set Rey on a course to discovering the Force that awakened within her, leading her to seek out Jedi Master Luke Skywalker for training. Yet despite her commitment to the Jedi Order and the light side of the Force, Rey felt the pull to the dark side due to her anger and the adversarial relationship she had with Ben Solo, a fallen Jedi whom she knew as the dark warrior Kylo Ren. The unique Force-bond between them was a result of their nature as a dyad in the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rey was born in 15 ABY during the rise of the New Republic. Her father was a bioengineered Strand-Cast cloned from the genetic template of Darth Sidious, the Sith Lord who ruled the Galactic Empire as Emperor Palpatine.

After the deaths of her parents, Rey was forced to survive on her own in the Jakku desert, and became a skilled mechanic, pilot and combatant in the process. Her isolated life was disrupted shortly before war broke out across the galaxy in 34 ABY. Determined to help the Resistance, Rey gained several new allies including Finn, a renegade stormtrooper, as well as the veterans Han Solo and Chewbacca. In the course of their journey, she discovered her latent Force powers and sought guidance under Skywalker, who taught her the art of the Force despite his decision to end the Jedi legacy.

However, Rey was saved by Ben Solo after he renounced his dark alter ego. Aided by the spirits of all the Jedi, Rey died vanquishing her grandfather, causing Solo to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to bring Rey back to life.

Darth Plagueis tried to create a dyad with his apprentice, Darth Sidious, who, in turn, tried to create one with Solo's grandfather, Anakin Skywalker. Despite years of searching, the Sith never found a way to form a dyad on their own. The Rule of Two was a pale imitation of the power that the Sith coveted.

She heard local stories about what happened during the battle: that it was the last stand of the once-powerful Empire during the Galactic Civil War, that the Empire locked onto Republic ships during the fighting and dragged them down to the surface together, and more. The battle had left the ships trapped in the sand in varying conditions, and finding working parts became essential in order to earn food portions, the only thing that was up for trade in Niima Outpost. The trades were made by Plutt, who traded leftover Republic and Imperial rations in exchange for whatever Rey and other scavengers were able to recover. Rey learned that parts that could be repurposed were the most important; anything that could not be put into another ship was worthless to Plutt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some of the scavengers that Rey worked for were kind to her, such as Ivano Troade and Mashra.

She struck out on her own, utilizing the skills she had to scavenge and survive, but no one took her seriously at first. She was aided by Plutt himself, who told other scavengers to leave Rey alone and would send his thugs after those who did not. Rey did not want his help, and the help was not out of generosity. Rather, Rey was the best scavenger Plutt had and he wanted to continue utilizing her as a source of acquisitions.

When she inspected the walker, though, she found a small green spinebarrel flower growing out of a few millimeters of sand that had poured into the walker. Rey realized that if such a tiny flower could survive there, so could she, and that life always found a way to survive on Jakku. Rey would go on to collect flowers like that, as a reminder that beauty could be found anywhere, even on Jakku."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once she settled into the walker, Rey salvaged working parts of the AT-AT for trade. She mostly just used one room in the walker, for a variety of reasons. She would often bring her salvages to the walker before bringing them to Plutt, as Plutt deducted portions one could receive from a salvage if they used his washing and repair stations. The walker also contained scratches she made to mark the passage of time, to remind her how far she had come and to count down the days until her family returned for her. Outside of the walker was where she would go on to keep the speeder she built for herself, which gave her a degree of independence as she made her way back and forth from the Starship Graveyard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time Rey was ten years old, she had acquired a Rebel Alliance flight helmet that once belonged to Captain Dosmit R\u00e6h of the starfighter squadron Tierfon Yellow Aces, which she found while scavenging in the Starship Graveyard.

She often enjoyed wearing the helmet and playing with the doll, pretending she was helping R\u00e6h explore the AT-AT and the sands outside. Together, their pretend adventures saw them find lost Rebels and return them to their ships.

Her ability to understand alien languages, including the binary language of droids, helped her when off-worlders came to Niima Outpost. Two such off-worlders were Wookiees, who regaled her with the stories of the famed Wookiee smuggler-turned-Rebel fighter Chewbacca. She learned of Chewbacca's exploits, as well as those of his friend and fellow smuggler Han Solo. Studying schematics to learn how ships worked was also an important part of her survival on Jakku. She recognized almost all of the Republic and Imperial vessels that could be found in the Graveyard, including what roles they played in combat, the types of weapons they were armed with, their models and classes, and how many crew members each one had. She learned this not just through studying schematics on her computer, but also by climbing through and exploring the ships and tinkering with their systems. This let her know what each part was, what it could do, whether it worked, and, most importantly, whether it would carry any value in Niima Outpost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Growing up on Jakku meant Rey not only learned how the ships that littered its wastelands worked, but also about the dangers that lurked on Jakku itself. Rey saw firsthand the hardship it could inflict. Rumors of an Imperial base on Carbon Ridge once compelled Plutt to mount an expedition there. Knowing her skills as a mechanic, Plutt brought Rey a flyer to fix. She did so by unclogging one of its turbojets and rebuilding the other out of scrap from the front of an airspeeder. Plutt and six of his thugs used it to try to find the rumored base, but he only returned with a collection of stormtrooper armor\u2014and two of his men were killed. That led other scavengers to avoid Carbon Ridge. The creatures of Jakku were also dangerous. A fellow scavenger named Teng Malar once accidentally broke open a hatch on a ship beneath a colony of steelpeckers, ferocious avian creatures with razor-sharp beaks and strong talons. Within ten minutes, Teng was ripped to shreds and Rey watched helplessly as she was unable to do anything to stop the creatures. The Graveyard itself was also a reminder of the realities of war, with bodies and skeletons littering the sands. Rey once discovered a deceased TIE fighter pilot still in the cockpit of his TIE fighter ejector seat.

Upon attempting to detach it however, the room and the whole ship began to show signs of stress. She then opted to leave it but was cornered by Teedo who held Rey at gunpoint. He ordered her to turn over her stash, before noticing the valuable component attached to the ship. Rey attempted to warn him off but Teedo was not to be dissuaded. After successfully prying the component from the ship, the room began to destabilize, knocking out Teedo in the process.

Her worldview began to change when she encountered Han Solo, who confirmed that both the Jedi and the Force existed. At first, Rey was overwhelmed by the revelation that she was connected to the Force. Though she eventually opened herself to the Force, using it to defeat Kylo Ren, her understanding of it was limited due to her lack of training.

Until then, she had treated the Force as an instrument of her will. After allowing the Force to control her actions while fighting the Praetorian Guard, Rey saw herself and Ren as instruments of the Force, and consequently discarded an opportunity to take his life while he was unconscious. In Rey's mind, Ren's fate would be decided not by herself but by the will of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rey's faith in the Force grew stronger as she studied the Jedi sacred texts that she took from Skywalker.

Her skills as a scavenger saw her earn the respect of junk traders like Plutt, who ensured that his thugs did not steal from her\u2014unless her skills got in the way of his business. The need to survive against such beings, and the ability to traverse downed star cruisers and other war technology, necessitated that she remain in peak physical condition. She developed skills as a warrior, with the ability to expertly wield a quarterstaff against those who would threaten her. Her interactions with offworlders also allowed her to learn languages from other worlds, such as the Wookiee language of Shyriiwook and the binary language of droids.

She built her own speeder and salvaged an old computer that ran simulations flying a variety of different ships. She became a skilled pilot by constantly practicing these simulations, despite never wanting to leave Jakku. These skills proved ever-useful when she piloted the Millennium Falcon away from Jakku, and she displayed an understanding of its systems and functions with a familiarity that rivaled even that of Han Solo.

On one occasion, she was able to summon Skywalker's lightsaber to her hand and make it fling itself past Kylo.

According to Snoke, she grew more powerful in the light side of the Force as Ren grew stronger in the dark side. According to Luke Skywalker, Ren was far more powerful than Rey, but Rey's powers were quickly growing. In the few days since the Battle of Starkiller Base, she progressed from needing to attempt the mind trick several times before succeeding, to moving dozens of heavy rocks at once and she was able to match Ren in a Force-wrestle for a lightsaber.

Although after she had trained for a year, her prowess had greatly improved enough to challenge Ren in a fair fight, fighting him to a stalemate in their first duel. In their last prolonged intense duel, Rey ultimately proved to be incapable of truly matching him as she was able to compete against him for the majority of their duel. Ren eventually knocked her on the ground and disarmed her following a number of ferocious attacks. She was only able to end their fight by impaling him when he was distracted by his mother calling him through the Force. She previously struggled in fighting Snoke's Praetorian Guard, one of whom managed to wound her in the right shoulder, and though she managed to fight all of them off and kill one when fighting alongside Ren, she struggled against two of them at once and despite forcing back one of them, in both one-on-one fights she was nearly killed by a guard. She displayed creativity by side-stepping to avoid the lightwhip that nearly killed her and then slayed the first Guard.

Her telekinetic prowess had grew to the level where she could levitate both herself and large piles of stone into the air and was strong enough to slowly tug a prison transport that carried Chewbacca to the ground using the Force despite considerable effort, although Ren was able to hold her to a standstill using his own power. When she faced Ren, Rey blocked his lightsaber strike with the Force, which he would soon replicate on her own attack. During her fight with Palpatine's Sith Royal Guards, Rey was able to redirect some of the blaster bolts fired at her at another guard, killing them instantly, and knocked down and tossed him off the cliff with telekinesis. Additionally, Rey became capable of leaping across great distances, which she would use to avoid Ren's fighter and to avoid a tidal wave when fighting Ren for the last time. Using the Force, she was able to heal Kylo of a mortal wound, even causing the scars she had previously inflicted on him to vanish as well. Rey's lightsaber skills had vastly improved as well to the point that, bolstered by the strength of all the Jedi, she was able to block Palpatine's Force lightning with Leia Organa's lightsaber.

As an entrance and exit, she used a side hatch that Imperial stormtroopers only would have used in emergencies. In order to operate the solar panels that Rey used to power her home, she salvaged two self-charging fuel cells from the wreckage of speeder bikes in the vehicle bay.

Inside she had a workbench for working on salvage material, her computer terminal, and a hammock that she made herself when she was a girl. Being inside the walker gave her a degree of protection as well. Not only did Rey maintain the vehicle's weatherproofing, thereby keeping the daytime heat and frigid nights out of the craft, but she also set up traps around the walker in order to keep scavengers out of her home."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the AT-AT was her home, Rey's speeder was more important for her survival. Rey took great pride and joy from her speeder, a custom-built repulsorlift vehicle. It stood at 3.73 meters in length and carried no weapons, but its hauling capability, and the net used as a cargo bag on the side of the craft, allowed her to ferry items she salvaged from the Starship Graveyard to her AT-AT and Niima Outpost. Despite its ability to haul cargo, its space was limited; the craft valued speed over cargo capacity, so Rey often had to make return trips to carry her salvage into Niima Outpost. The craft was top heavy, making it difficult for other pilots to control it, but Rey was a skilled enough pilot to manage it. Its top heavy nature made her more confident that other scavengers would not steal it, as did her safety precautions: a fingerprint scanner that meant only she could power the speeder's engines, and a loose wire that she used to electrify the craft when she was not using it in the event that someone tried to hotwire the speeder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The speeder itself was built from supplies that Rey scavenged from the deserts.

It was further customized with racing-swoop afterburners, a customized combustion chamber, and repulsorlifts she scavenged from crashed X-wing starfighters, amongst many other modifications she made. When carrying a limited load, the speeder was even powerful enough to accelerate to the point that it could fly like an airspeeder. Rey enjoyed using the craft to hone her piloting abilities, sometimes taking it out for flights and performing maneuvers like barrel rolls. The speeder's capabilities, as well as its necessity for survival, gave Rey a sense of independence.

She even wore her hair in a simple style designed specifically for survival in the desert. Her boots were made for travelers and were created out of Govath-wool. Part of her gear included goggles from stormtrooper helmet lenses that Rey salvaged from a ship.

One such character was Rey, who, in the development process for Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, was known as Kira. She was conceived as the protagonist from the project's beginning, with the original screenwriter, Michael Arndt, agreeing to write the film when he was told it would be the origin story of a female Jedi. He described Kira as a \"loner hothead, gear-head, badass.\" J.J. Abrams, who was chosen as the film's director, quickly gravitated towards the idea of a female lead, and to the notion that the character, living thirty years after Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, would not know who Luke Skywalker was or even regard him as a myth.

John Doe was originally her partner, was briefly thought of as a Jedi, and then cast as a bounty hunter. He eventually evolved into a member of the Republic military, before evolving away from being part of Kira's story and becoming Poe Dameron. Kira was conceived as a scavenger in junkyards early on. At one point, an alien junk dealer was introduced into the story and Kira worked in a sort of used car lot that was run by a former Republic pilot, who was an elderly father figure for Kira.

The final design was approved in February 2014, including the goggles that she wore while scavenging. The genesis of the goggles came from the production team not wanting people to know who the character was at first, including whether she was male, female, or even human.
