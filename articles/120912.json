The craft featured six laser cannons, a proton torpedo launcher and a minelayer. Along with its deadly armament, the Scimitar was equipped with a cloaking device, powered by rare stygium crystals from the planet Aeten II, that allowed it to disappear from view and any pursuing ship's sensors. Owing to the craft's experimental ion engines, radiator fins on the ship's wings were required to be open during flight in order to expel excess heat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship carried three DRK-1 Dark Eye probe droids and the Bloodfin, a Sith speeder utilized by Darth Maul during his mission on Tatooine.

It was held in Imperial Facility 729-D, located somewhere in the Inner Rim, and curated by the droid O-66. At some point before the Battle of Hoth, the bounty hunter Chanath Cha was entrusted with the modified Star Courier in order to retrieve the stolen Imperialis, Palpatine's luxury pleasure craft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chanath and O-66 used the Scimitar's advanced tracking systems to find the Imperialis's location. While O-66 waited aboard the Scimitar, Chanath boarded the Imperialis. O-66 also transmitted the Imperial yacht's operational codes. After Chanath had set the ship to self-destruct, she ordered O-66 to dock the Scimitar so that she, Lando Calrissian, and Lobot could flee the doomed Imperialis. However, O-66 refused to obey her orders because his primary directive was to protect and honor the Scimitar. Despite Chanath's threats, O-66 revealed he had removed her pulse bomb and flew the Scimitar away."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Scimitar first appeared as Darth Maul's personal transport in The Phantom Menace movie.
