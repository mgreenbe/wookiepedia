The eyes were produced by Athakam Medtech, and considered one of their finest achievements as there were no errors visible to observers despite the eyes clearly being artificial, a feat incredibly hard to achieve with cybernetic eyes. The eyes cost 7500 to install and increased a user's visual acuity and recognition."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cybernetic eyes Mod III was first mentioned in the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2013 and written by Sterling Hershey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
