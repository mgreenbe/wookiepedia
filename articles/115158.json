As the troopers wait outside, Crosshair enters the room, where Admiral Rampart warns Prime Minister Lama Su that he expects to be apprised of all matters here. Crosshair reports that scrappers on Bracca have reported a power surge on a Jedi cruiser. Rampart suggests sending a scout team, but Crosshair replies that they will need more than that due to the presence of Clone Force 99, displaying a hologram of Hunter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lama Su advises Rampart that Clone Force 99 are highly skilled assets and that it will be beneficial to have them returned alive.

He explains that there are tons of ordnance in the junkyard. If she trips on one, she will have to know how to disable it. Omega thinks it seems simple enough. Wrecker gives her an improvised explosive to disable within ten seconds. Omega cuts one of the cables and also cuts a second yellow cable, which fails to disable the bomb. The two run and take cover."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Instead of exploding, the bomb releases smoke. Wrecker laughs that it is just a smoke bomb. He reassures her that he would not have trained her with a live explosive. Echo tells Wrecker and Omega that Hunter wants to see them. He asks how the test went. Omega doesn't want to talk about it.

Echo and Wrecker spot the scrappers with Echo telling them to stay casual. The clones pursue the scrappers and manage to stun two. One of them escapes on the repulsorlift, which Wrecker clings on to. Echo tells Hunter and Tech that they encountered three scrappers and that Wrecker is pursuing one of them. Tech remarks this is not comforting. Hunter tells Echo to keep his eyes on the target."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the scrapper attempts to shake Wrecker off by jerking the repulsorlift. Wrecker narrowly avoids a falling box of tools. The scrapper manages to shake him off by maneuvering through a tight corner but Echo stuns him, causing him to crash his repulsorlift into an obstacle. Omega asks Wrecker if he is alright. Wrecker says he was just waiting to make his move."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the clones gather with the captured scrapper. Echo says that Rex warned them about the scrapper patrols on and opines that they should leave. Hunter disagrees, saying that they need to make money and that Bracca offers them a lot of opportunities. Wrecker disagrees with Hunter. Hunter asks Tech about the potential haul inside the Venator-class Star Destroyer. Tech says that his scans indicate that the armory and artillery bay have not been fully offloaded.

Echo says they are soldiers and not smugglers. Hunter points out that there is no Galactic Republic for them to rely on anymore. He believes they should seize the opportunity. Tech adds that the intelligence from the bridge's central system has the potential to be worth far more than any weapon. Wrecker grumbles. Hunter sends Tech to the bridge to gather any intelligence they can find.

Omega asks what it was like but Tech says he just told her."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial hunters"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just then, the proximity sensor begins beeping.

When Hunter asks if it is more scrappers, Tech replies that it is the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back at Tipoca City, Nala Se meets with Prime Minister Lama Su, who tells them that they can no longer delay. He explains that the Empire's mission on Bracca poses a threat to their contingency plan. Lama Su fears that he will have to call on assistance.

Lama Su says that as long as one of the bounty hunters delivers the young clone intact, that should be all that concerns them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Bracca, the Bad Batch watch from the bridge as Crosshair disembarks from his ship with a contingent of clone troopers and Elite Squad Troopers.

ES-04 says that the cruiser was the source of the power surge detected. ES-02 asks if there were any life signs aboard.

Tech says this is part of their plan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Crosshair dismisses his former Bad Batch comrades for scavenging like rats. When Hunter asks why they are hunting them down, Crosshair replies that the Bad Batch are traitors. He and ES-04 order the regular clone troopers to move into position. As the clones surround the Hunter and Omega, Hunter appeals to Crosshair to wake up because he is being controlled by an inhibitor chip.
