This unit was owned by forces under Moff Caerbellak, but after Sconn stole a prototype weapon from Rythani Products, he hijacked the vehicle with Kalieva as a means of escape. Sconn accidentally piloted this unit during a royal parade in Rydonni Prime's capital city Ryell. Sconn engaged and defeated Caerbellak's Mistryl Shadow Guard Variise on the AT-AT's troop deck, and piloted the vehicle into the Rydonnian Imperial Consulate to serve as a distraction, destroying the walker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
