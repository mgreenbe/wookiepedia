They also manufactured combat gear, such as the ACH-14 advanced combat helmet. During these years, the company sponsored podraces in the Outer Rim Territories. Much like the sport itself, Czerka Arms had a sordid reputation, and was long suspected of laundering money into the Outer Rim by the Coruscant Security Force. Princess Fanry of the planet Pijal described the Czerka Corporation as being nearly as powerful as the Galactic Senate itself. Czerka Arms made heavy use of slave labor and employed extensive mechanisms to both prevent slave escapes and recapture those who did, as well as slave revolts. Czerka was thousands of years old, and rumored by some to be older than the Republic itself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Iron Blockade of the Anoat sector by the Galactic Empire, the local branch of Czerka Arms found itself cut off from its corporate masters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In exchange for fortifying their facility, the Czerka employees of the Anoat sector eventually agreed to join the cause of the Smuggler, a young scoundrel who led the resistance against the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Czerka Arms was first created for The Rebel Alliance Sourcebook, released by West End Games as a supplement for its Star Wars Legends Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.
