In their completed form, they were massive disks, slightly concave, with eight tall towers spaced around their circumference, each one large enough to land a Star Destroyer on. These served to direct immense energies, opening a passage into hyperspace for colony craft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally there were two launch gates, but during the days of the Old Republic, one of the launch gates was overloaded and destroyed when a Dark Jedi tried to conquer the system. The resulting energy surge, known as the Rift Disaster, created the Kathol Rift, and probably rendered the remaining launch gate inoperable; nevertheless, the second device remained largely intact in orbit around Kathol until after the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
