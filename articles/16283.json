The mines disabled any approaching starships. Due to the trade with other worlds, which was the main source of medical supplies for Berason, being cut off as a result, the Berason natives became ill and their resolve to oppose the Empire began to weaken."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In response, the Rebel Alliance placed Airen Cracken in command of a force tasked with running the blockade and delivering food and military supplies to Berason, followed by a strike against that world's Imperial base. Cracken's force circumvented the ion mines by sending out men equipped with environmental suits and jetpacks, with the sensors of the explosives not being able to detect anything smaller than four meters in diameter. Although the process was very slow, eventually Cracken's unit succeeded in clearing a path for a massive Alliance convoy to Berason, and the officer later recorded his experiences at that world in the Cracken's Rebel Field Guide, a datafile he had composed that documented various pieces of equipment used during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A low-tech mining world, Berason depended on other planets for food and medical supplies, merchant them minerals in return.
