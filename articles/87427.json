Made of a smooth, burnished meteoritic metal, it was peppered with tiny hammered divots and featured eyes of black glass, but no mouth or nose\u2014where the mouth should have been was a line of black rivets. According to Yupe Tashu, an adviser to Galactic Emperor Palpatine who ended up acquiring the artifact, Panshard's mask contained the screams of a hundred innocents who were once slaughtered for the viceroy's pleasure.
