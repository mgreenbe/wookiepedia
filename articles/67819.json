In 5 BBY, he was captured by the bounty hunter Boba Fett, who transported him to the planet Coruscant in his starship Slave I and handed him over to the Galactic Empire's Imperial Security Bureau. Agent Andressa Divo of the Bureau, which had put out a Notice of Imperial Remandation on Tors, was not expecting the delivery, but welcomed it. She and another bureau agent along with a pair of stormtroopers met with Fett and Tors on one of the bureau's Coruscant landing pads. Divo later wrote about the capture of Tors to her father, retired Coruscant Security Force Inspector Tanivos Divo, who had also previously been aware of Tors. The Quarren had orange skin and wore brown pants, boots and armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isquik Tors was first mentioned in the 2018 reference book Star Wars: Scum and Villainy: Case Files on the Galaxy's Most Notorious, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo with an illustration of Tors by Ronan Le Fur."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
