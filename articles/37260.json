The name of the system built upon the mention of the location Derso-4 in the 1993 book Monsters and Aliens from George Lucas, a publication that combines creature designs and photographs from various projects of George Lucas, creator of the Star Wars franchise, with original text by Bob Carrau. The book established that the Leisure Fields, in which the domestication of the creature known as Smapp was very popular, was located beyond Derso-4. Lucasfilm employee Leland Chee, who maintains the Holocron continuity database, has indicated that information contained in Monsters and Aliens from George Lucas is non-canonical with respect to the Star Wars Legends continuity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
