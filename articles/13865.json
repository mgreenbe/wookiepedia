The battle was fought between the Galactic Empire and the planet's civilians. During the engagement, a Star Destroyer bombardment caused a freak malfunction that cut of communications to Davaire Colmar's Imperial Army assault trooper unit from the Imperial Special Training Corps. A mob of citizens 2,000 strong attacked the elite army unit and odds of 50-to-1 and overwhelmed them. Colmar suffered a severe head wound and was left to die. Coming again to consciousness, Colmar wandered aimlessly across the landscape, contemplating the battle and the direction his life had taken. Realizing how the Empire had failed to protect its own people, he defected to the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
