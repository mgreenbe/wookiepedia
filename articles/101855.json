The moon was very dark, with its unique orbit keeping it in the shadow of Genarius most of the time. Its thick atmosphere prevented most of the light that the moon did receive from reaching down to the surface. Ostfrei was habitable at one time, but when Oblis was destroyed, Ostfrei was close enough to be affected. Asteroid impacts from the destruction started a seismic chain-reaction which left the moon uninhabitable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There was not much of note on Ostfrei, so it was ignored by most of the residents of the Cularin system. Ships of the Thaereian Navy were sometimes seen around the moon. The Thaereians had a secret military base on Ostfrei since around 31 BBY, but no ships were seen going down to the moon's surface by observers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
