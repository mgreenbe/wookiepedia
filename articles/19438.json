However, when the pilots tried to enter the hangar, the clone troopers guarding the Y-wings would not let them pass because the pair didn't have proper authorization. Broadside and Matchstick argued that since they had a Jedi with them, they outranked the guards, and should be allowed to pass. Meanwhile, R2-D2 gave the Gran worker falsified documents that said Skywalker could take the Y-wings. The Gran, however, still did not allow the Jedi access to the Y-wings, as it violated procedure: they were still under production, and the request for the starfighters to be cleared for use needed to come directly from the office of Ask Aak. When Tano threatened to call Palpatine and tell him that their mission had to be postponed because the Gran had delayed their efforts, the worker finally allowed the two Jedi to take a squadron of the starfighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Commanders and crew"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There was at least one Gran working at the testing facility, whose job was to help run the BTL-B Y-wing starfighter program.
