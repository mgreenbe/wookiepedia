The droid managed to disable the thief, identifying him as Venga Liss, son of the crime lord over the Gillanium Syndicate. Calculating the Aqualish to be worth nothing to it, IG-88 killed Liss by deploying a thermal detonator into the shuttle, destroying it, much to the captain's dismay."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
