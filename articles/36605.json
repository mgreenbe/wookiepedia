The planet's years were equal to about 1.5 standard years. The gravity was slightly stronger than standard, and the days were shorter than standard. The planet was also home to the Dellaltians, huge, sentient, lake dwelling reptiles. For a fee, they would ferry people and cargo across their lakes on rafts. Dellalt had two moons whose light reflected on its watery surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The southernmost continent was the site of Xim the Despot's vast treasure vaults, which were surrounded by an advanced city. According to legend, the treasure ship Queen of Ranroon, having escaped the Third Battle of Vontor, never arrived at Dellalt, and the vaults remained empty. However, the treasure was hidden in a different set of vaults, directly below the dummy vaults. When Xim died around 25,100 BBY, his empire crumbled, and the city regressed considerably. Defense installations, monorails, and even the water and sewage treatment plant all crumbled into ruin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the mountain to the east of the town, the inbred descendants of Xim's forces knew the truth about the treasure. Known as the Survivors, they maintained a thousand of Xim's still formidable war droids. In 2 BBY, the Survivors used these droids against a group of offworlders who started a semi-legal mining camp nearby."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Dellalt was allied with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Later during the Outer Rim Sieges of 19 BBY, a number of Jedi and clone troopers were deployed here in a confrontation against the Separatists. When Order 66 was issued, at least ten Jedi including Siadem Forte and Klossi Anno fought off their former legions to escape in a SX troop shuttle. Four Jedi were killed and several wounded in the stand-off and an attack by a Republic light cruiser and several flights of ARC-170 starfighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 BBY, Han Solo and Chewbacca discovered the mythical treasure of Xim the Despot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Battle of Yavin, the Galactic Empire used Dellalt as a staging point for supplies and equipment.
