It is possible that \"Princess of the Realm\" may be a title due to a (ranking) daughter of the Emperor, while \"Empress Apparent-Heir\" seems to be connected with a formal ceremony saluting her as rightful heiress, after which Plourr exercised sovereign authority on Eiattu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
