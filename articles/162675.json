The pilot flew under the call sign Black 11 and attained the 'Wampa' nickname for icy precision in battle. By 4 ABY, 'Wampa' was stationed aboard the Super Star Destroyer Executor, and often served as an escort to Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader's shuttle, the Lambda-class T-4a shuttle ST 321. The nickname 'Wampa' was shared with the wampa ice creature, a fearsome and carnivorous predator hailing from the planet Hoth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 'Wampa' nickname was established for the pilot of the Black 11 TIE/LN starfighter on a card for the 2000 Death Star II Limited expansion set of the Decipher, Inc. Star Wars Customizable Card Game. While the image depicts one of the TIE fighters escorting ST 321 during Darth Vader's visit to the Death Star II battlestation in the opening scene of 1983's Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, there was no confirmation that 'Wampa' was operating Black 11 in-universe during those events.
