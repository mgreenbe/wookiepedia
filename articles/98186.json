By the time following the Battle of Yavin, Bok was captured by the Corellian slavers and enslaved in the Corellian Slaver Bunker near Tyrena. Circa 1 ABY, a spacer infiltrated the bunker to find evidence of the slaver operations for the Corellian Security Force. Noro Bok agreed to help the spacer to access to the lower levels of the bunker. Thanks to Bok's assistance, the spacer was able to explore all the areas of the bunker and eventually broadcasted the slavers' records on the CorSec emergency request channels. Dozens of CorSec agents quickly moved to the slaver bunker and freed all the slaves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Noro Bok was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
