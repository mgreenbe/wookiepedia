During the Second Battle of Geonosis, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, and members of the 501st Legion including Clone Captain Rex encountered the barrier while fighting their way to the primary staging area at Point Rain after their gunships had been shot down. Tano had pointed the wall out to Skywalker during a pre-battle briefing, but the Jedi Knight had dismissed the possibility that they would be going anywhere near it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker and Tano ascended to the top of the wall carrying explosives to demolish it. After destroying all the battle droids defending it, with cover fire from the clone troopers below and after being joined by Rex, the two Jedi put the explosives inside the wall via a trapdoor opened by a battle droid, before using telekinesis to drop Rex off the wall and jumping off just before it exploded. Skywalker and Tano, after landing, telekinetically caught Rex before he hit the ground, and the group headed through the ruins of the eastern barrier en route to Point Rain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The eastern barrier first appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 2 episode \"Landing at Point Rain\", which aired in 2009."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
