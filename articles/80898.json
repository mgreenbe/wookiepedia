These survivors believe Zeb is the key to a prophecy that will lead to a new home for their kind\u2014but Zeb, conflicted and ashamed of his failure to save Lasan, has little faith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The future of the Lasat"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ezra Bridger receives a tip from one of his contacts and leads the crew of the Ghost to Nixus Hub 218, where his contact says that two refugees held prisoner by the Galactic Empire can be found and rescued. The rebels arrive to find the refugees being led out of a cargo container at gunpoint, and they realize who the refugees are: two Lasat who survived the fall of Lasan. Garazeb Orrelios is shocked, having believed himself to be the last of the Lasat, and the rebels quickly attack the stormtroopers and Imperial officer in order to free the Lasat prisoners. The rebels are soon greeted by Hondo Ohnaka, a pirate with whom Bridger has had dealings with before, and Bridger reveals Ohnaka was the contact for the mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the Lasat, Gron, introduces himself and his companion, Chava the Wise. They both recognize Orrelios as the former captain of the Lasan High Honor Guard, much to Orrelios' discomfort. Gron himself once served in the Honor Guard under Orrelios' command. The other rebels are surprised, as Orrelios had never told them that he was captain of the Honor Guard. Orrelios dismisses it, saying only that it was a long time and he had forgotten that life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With reinforcements bound to show up, the rebels begin the return trip back to the Ghost. Ohnaka asks for the payment he was promised, but Bridger refuses\u2014making the Weequay pirate very proud of his young friend. Just after the rebels leave, a squadron of stormtroopers spots Ohnaka. Always one to make a profit and double cross his friends if necessary, Ohnaka points the stormtroopers in the direction of the rebels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on their way back to the Ghost, Bridger asks Chava about where the two Lasat are headed. She tells him that they are on a journey to their new world, Lira San, a world described in prophecy as a safe system where the Lasat can begin a new life. Orrelios does not believe in prophecies, however, nor does he believe in a future for his people. As this is discussed, Ohnaka leads the troopers to the rebels, and the soldiers inform Agent Kallus, who tells them to capture the rebels alive and that he will be there soon. As the troopers move in to intercept the rebels, Ohnaka contacts Bridger and warns him about the impending threat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The stormtroopers then arrive and begin a firefight with the rebels, cornering them in the Nixus halls. To save his friend, Ohnaka quietly seals a few doors, cutting many of the stormtroopers off from the rebels. The rebels are able to fight their way back to the Ghost and take off, while Ohnaka is found and captured by other stormtroopers. The Ghost heads into space, where they find an Arquitens-class command cruiser under the command of Agent Kallus and Admiral Kassius Konstantine. Before they can be captured, the Ghost jumps into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Safely in hyperspace, Chava tells the rebels that she does not know the location of Lira San, as it is uncharted and from an ancient Lasat legend. In order to find it, Chava says that the \"child\" of prophecy must first save \"the warrior\" and \"the fool.\" Orrelios assumes that he is the warrior and that Bridger is the child, though he does not know who the fool would be. With Bridger's participation, Chava begins a ritual designed to guide them to their new world. Orrelios wants no part in it and returns to his quarters. Puzzled by his friend's reluctance, Bridger leaves the ritual preparations and talks to Orrelios, who explains that he feels guilty for failing to protect his people when the Empire destroyed them. He explained that, as captain of the Honor Guard, he was responsible for protecting the royal family and all the Lasat. Though he fought to the end, Lasan was lost to the Empire and most of the Lasat were killed. Despite his friend's guilt and shame, Bridger encourages Orrelios to protect his people again by helping Chava and Gron find Lira San."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The road to Lira San"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bridger's encouragement worked. Orrelios agrees to participate in the ritual and assembles his bo-rifle in the way the ancient Lasat once did, which allows it to interact with Chava's staff. Chopper activates a map of the galaxy, and the bo-rifle creates a surge of electricity that points to an uncharted world in Wild Space. Realizing that the prophecy could be true, the rebels plot a course beyond the Outer Rim Territories. As the ship nears the edge of the Outer Rim, Captain Hera Syndulla is forced to bring the ship out of hyperspace because of a large imploded star cluster in their path\u2014encountering unexpected phenomenon is a risk pilots take while in uncharted space. Any starship that approaches the maelstrom could be destroyed by the gravity field within the cluster. Chava recognizes it as the maze referenced in the prophecy, meaning Lira San is somewhere within or beyond the cluster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Agent Kallus' ship then emerges from hyperspace, thanks to Ohnaka's assistance\u2014he had a tracker in the communications device he used to talk to Bridger, and he was forced by the Empire to help them find the rebels. Agent Kallus gives the crew one minute to surrender, otherwise he will destroy their ship. Chava says that Kallus is a warrior doing his part, and Orrelios is perplexed by the notion that Kallus is the warrior that the prophecy spoke of. Chava explains that there are many warriors, fools, and children. A child sees things not as they are but how they can be, the fool denies his destiny, and the warrior creates his own destiny. Chava says that no one is ever just one of them, but rather, in time, becomes all of them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Realizing that Chava's wisdom meant that he has to help forge his destiny and the destiny of the Lasat, Orrelios uses the power generated from his bo-rifle to navigate the Ghost into the cluster, leading the way to Lira San. Noticing the rebels are attempting to escape, Kallus orders two TIE fighters to pursue them, but the starfighters are ripped apart by the gravitational forces of the star cluster\u2014while the Ghost makes it through unharmed. Kallus' ship opens fire, but each shot misses. He is forced to turn back when his own ship begins taking damage from the gravity field, but he takes pleasure in knowing that the rebels will be destroyed by the cluster. Against his expectations, however, the Ghost is able to safely make it through the gravity field, and the hyperdrive automatically kicks in and sends the Ghost into the middle of the star cluster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While in the jump to hyperspace, the rebels are surrounded by a blinding light and are knocked unconscious. They wake up to find themselves in unknown space, but they realize they have found the planet of Lira San, much to the joy of the three Lasat. Orrelios uses the Phantom to bring Chava and Gron to the surface, while the other rebels stay behind. They talk about whether Orrelios will stay with his people, but Kanan Jarrus suspects he will return. Once he does, he brings the happy news that Lira San is already inhabited by millions of Lasat, and that Lira San is the original homeworld of the Lasat. Orrelios is proud of what he helped accomplish, and Syndulla explains that, because the Ghost has made it through the maelstrom once, they now know the safe course to Lira San. With that, Orrelios resolves to guide any other surviving Lasat he finds to their new home."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
