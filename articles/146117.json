Wart-hornets had bloated, slimy bodies reminiscent of toads, and they had two pairs of multicolored wings akin to Gorsian dragonflies. Their backs were covered in pulsating warts that glowed aquamarine. The tongues of wart-hornets were covered in venom that caused pain and swelling in the area of the lick. When attacked, a wart-hornet would emit a high-pitched warning cry that summoned others of its kind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thunian wart-hornets first appeared in the junior novel Adventures in Wild Space: The Snare, which was written by Cavan Scott, illustrated by David M.
