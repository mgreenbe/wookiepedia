When the Frezhlix introduced a resolution in their sector assembly opposing the Bothans, the Sif'kries opposed it, this preventing their common senator from supporting the anti-Bothan Drashtine Initiative in the New Republic Senate. The Frezhlix responded by blockading the Sif'krie homeworld of Sif'kric, cutting them off from outside communications and threatening to destroy up to 20% of their economy, based in pommwomm export."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, a New Republic task force under General Garm Bel Iblis was nearby, and responded. When they attempted to search the Hoopster's Prank, a ship run by Booster Terrik, the Frezhlix fleet fired on the New Republic ships, allowing them to legally intervene and disperse the blockade. Shortly after the battle, the New Republic forces had to depart for Mengjini."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
