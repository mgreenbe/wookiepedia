The Mandalorians planned to take control of the Core World of Duro as a result of a campaign they called Mandalorian Triumph, which was an offensive push originating from their territory. Their first target was the planet of Eres III, which they devastated before moving to be victorious at Azure. Next, they attacked the planet of Contruum before moving further Coreward."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 24 ABY, Vilnau Teupt delivered the keynote address at the four-hundred-twelfth Proceedings of Galactic Anthropology and History, in which he spoke on the Mandalorian race's development, mentioning Mandalorian Triumph and the battle at Azure during his overview of the Mandalorian Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle was first referenced in The Essential Atlas (2009).
