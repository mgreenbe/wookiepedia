Illegal to own and difficult to obtain, mimetic suits were highly sought after by criminals, thieves, and assassins."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Made using highly advanced materials and applied sciences, mimetic suits were considered to be at the apex of stealth technology. Able to bend light around the wearer to render the user virtually invisible, the suits contained sound dampeners and electromagnetic and thermal shielding to fool scanners and sensors. In order to function the mimetic suit had to be energized, and required a small power pack; this pack could provide an hour of continuous use before needing to be replaced. This was in stark contrast to other stealth suits, which primarily relied on passive materials and camouflage instead of advanced energized technology."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A group of terrorists used several mimetic suits during their attempt to assassinate Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum on Eriadu.
