They sent two scouts, Smug and Krix, to hunt them down. Smug eventually found Ahsoka Tano and Chewbacca in the crash site of a Trandoshan prisoner transport. He nearly shot them both with a sniper rifle, but missed. He was later apprehended by the two other remaining Jedi, Jinx and O-Mer. They took him prisoner. The next morning, Jinx employed a Mind trick on him and had him call a speeder to pick them up. When Krix arrived, the prisoners managed to knock both Krix and Smug unconscious and then hijack the speeder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
