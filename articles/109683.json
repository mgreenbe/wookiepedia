During the time of the Galactic Civil War, Adeen dwelled on the jungle moon of Yavin 4, where she guarded an old Jedi statue near the Wayward Jungle region. As the Jedi dispatched by Khrahnn approached the old Jedi statue, the physical manifestation of Adeen appeared in a burst of red, fiery smoke, relishing the opportunity to defeat the individual in battle. However, despite her knowledge of the Force, which included an ability to use Force lightning, and her skill with a single-bladed red lightsaber, Adeen was bested by her Jedi adversary. As she succumbed to what appeared to be a mortal death, Adeen uttered her final words, expressing her disbelief at being defeated. However, she also commended the Jedi adversary for proving themselves, and encouraged the Jedi to continue feeding their passion.

A traditional Jedi weapon, Adeen's lightsaber consisted of a cylindrical handle in which sophisticated circuits channeled a beam of light through a series of crystals. These crystals modulated the blade's size and amplitude. During her time on Yavin 4, Adeen wore the Cloak of Hate, a black and red garment imbued with the dark side of the Force. Underneath the cloak, Adeen wore a black formal shirt, black and red lined shorts, and black and red Marauder Reconnaissance Armor boots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quillara Adeen was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.

Whether she was a mortal being, or some sort of spiritual entity was not explicitly described in any of the quest dialogue. When players interacted with the old Jedi statue on Yavin 4 to summon Adeen, she would suddenly appear in a burst of red smoke, and fight the player as a physical entity. Then, once defeated, she would briefly transform into a blue Force ghost, before disappearing altogether. Judging from this brief interaction, this article surmises that Adeen was a living physical being until her death at the hands of the player. Although the player could choose not to complete the collection, this article assumes 100% game completion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fact that Quillara Adeen, a Dark Jedi, was able to transform into a Force ghost, poses something of a continuity problem in the Star Wars Legends continuity. In both the novel and the comic book version of Revenge of the Sith, the spirit of Qui-Gon Jinn tells Yoda that only light-siders may live on as Force ghosts, and that this is something that dark-siders cannot learn. However, in Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader, Darth Sidious reveals that the ancient Sith Lords once had the ability to \"survive death,\" but this knowledge was somehow lost over time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
