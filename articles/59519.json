Marcy murdered her boyfriend, Nack Movers, in the apartment with the aide of her partner in crime, Cassie Cryar. They were discovered by Jedi Master Tera Sinube and Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano who notified the Coruscant Security Force which arrived at the apartment to investigate. There, they discovered Movers' body and Ione, who was apparently mourning him. She asked Sinube if the men who supposedly killed Nack had left. Sinube's response was yes, but Ahsoka still went to search the bedroom. There, she discovered Ione's partner-in-crime; Cassie Cryar, who had Ahsoka's lightsaber. She soon after escaped out the window, and Ahsoka followed her. Meanwhile Sinube worked out that Ione was in league with Cassie."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
