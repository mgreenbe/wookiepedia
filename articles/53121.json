While the battle for Coronet City\u2014the capital of Corellia\u2014raged on and Darth Baras's assassins coming after Vowrawn, the Sith pulled a bold plan by making their base of operations inside a Republic-aligned corporate building. Having secretly infiltrated the building, soldiers like Garrett put on Republic uniforms and made a show in front of the holocameras, so that Republic enemies had no reason so suspect something was awry.
