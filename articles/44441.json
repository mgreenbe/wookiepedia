The spheres could be durable, surviving for many years after the disappearance of the Zeffo, though several spheres were damaged and broken by the time that Cal Kestis discovered the Zeffo tombs. A faint rumbling could be constantly heard from within the spheres, amplified when they were moved. Some spheres consisted of several layers rotating in various directions around a central glowing blue energy core. On those without rotating portions, this blue energy could be seen emanating from their inscribed writing, and those located within Tomb Guardians were suspended inside their open chests by similar blue energy. It was possible to use the Force to temporarily remove the sphere from a Guardian, incapacitating it momentarily. So long as they were not destroyed, Zeffo energy spheres operated constantly and entirely self-sufficiently."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The smaller variety of sphere could be found powering Tomb Guardians in an ancient Zeffo temple on the planet Ontotho, as well as the Tomb of Miktrull and Tomb of Eilram on Zeffo.
