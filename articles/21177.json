By 15,000 BBY, the Hutt Empire had collapsed at the end of a series of calamities and conflicts known as the Hutt Cataclysms, which saw Varl, the species' once-lush homeworld, become barren and lifeless. In the aftermath of those catastrophes, a few of the surviving powerful Hutt clans gathered their remaining slave species to aid them in colonizing a new homeworld. Rediscovering Evocar\u2014a lush planet settled by the Hutts centuries earlier but left in the control of its natives, the peaceful Evocii\u2014the Hutt clans traveled en masse to Evocar aboard the remnants of the Hutt Empire's fleet. The Hutts and their Vippit servants then traded trinkets and useless pieces of high technology equipment to the Evocii in exchange for huge expanses of land, and soon, the arrivals controlled almost the entire planet, which was remade into a new Hutt homeworld and renamed \"Nal Hutta.\" The Evocii were subsequently enslaved and largely relocated to the planet's moon, Nar Shaddaa."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "\u2026and a new philosophy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the time of the Hutt settlement of Nal Hutta, Budhila Hestilic Amura served as the primary negotiator on the planet.

The name of the concept in Huttese literally meant \"the means by which we prosper,\" but it was also related by the Hutts to their saying, \"Someone's got to have it, why not us?\" Millennia later, Professor S. V. Skynx noted in the third edition of The Despotica Reader that it was believed Budhila was also inspired in the creation of the kajidic by the sabotage and subterfuge strategies employed by Hutt Clan-General Kossak Inijic Ar'durv, who had led the overall Hutt campaign against Xim."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kajidic called for the Hutts to favor aggressive but non-military internal rivalries, rejecting outright war and territorial conquest. The philosophy also taught the Hutts to dedicate themselves to gaining control over organizations and worlds, such as those of the Galactic Republic, through indirect methods in order to achieve rule from within. In order to enforce kadijic, govern the Hutt society, and prevent it from repeating the mistakes that had doomed the Hutt Empire, Budhila also established the body known as the Council of Elders, which consisted of five members of the oldest Hutt Clans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over time, kajidic became so ingrained in Hutt culture that the traditions of the Hutt Empire times became known as the Old Ways and relegated to myths.
