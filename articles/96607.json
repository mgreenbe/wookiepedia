It consisted of frozen cream and fruit and was served in a wide bowl. Dex's Diner on the planet of Coruscant served them for 2.7 credits where they consisted of two scoops of Denta bean ice cream and a choice of Trammistan chocolate or zoochberry topping as well as atomically-aerated cream and a zherry. They were also served on a Sooman starship through a food synthesizer, which the Alzarian prince Plooz took a liking too as he was being transported from Sooma to Alzar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
