It was established in the badlands of Dantooine some time before the Battle of Yavin. The base contained a vast enclosure that could house dozens of small starfighters, dozens of droid-charging ports, advanced communications technology, and dozens of bunks for several hundred troops. At one point, the Alliance troops planned to expand the base, starting to dig underground extensively. However, they were forced to abandon their Dantooine headquarters for reasons unknown, and established their new base on the fourth moon of Yavin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "General Antoc Merrick was in overall command of the starfighter squadrons on Dantooine.
