The X-30 was adequate in terms of its accuracy and rate of fire, and its energy output was light, even for a target blaster. However, competition shooters were fond of how easy the X-30 was to customize. Scopes, upgraded Galven-pattern barrels, hair triggers, and a slew of aftermarket kits were available from SoroSuub to custom fit an X-30 to any need."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The X-30 was popular among hunters and hikers for protection against aggressive wildlife, and SoroSuub was known to stock them in most of their escape pod models. The blaster even found use in the Rebel Alliance, whose engineers increased the weapon's range and stopping power by supercharging its actuating module with a volatile mix of blaster gas and upgrades to the Galven-pattern barrel. And while somewhat unstable, Rebel X-30s were capable of inflicting the same amount of force as a heavy blaster pistol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
