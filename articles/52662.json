After a short period, brake power was cut to zero and thrust was cut in half and spread across all engines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The result would send the fighter spinning wildly for a few seconds around its center of mass before shooting off on a new trajectory when the spin was stopped. Often, the maneuver was used as cover for a group of proton torpedoes fired at a target just before the spin begins."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
