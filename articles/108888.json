They were used to deliver detailed information, and incorporated an eight cubic meter cargo bay for delivering physical information or samples. The Q-Signal was a one shot unit, and had no communications array. Astrogation coordinates were loaded into the automated droid brain, and then the drone was launched towards its destination. Once the drone reached its target, it dropped to realspace. The drone had to be physically retrieved, and a proper password entered to retrieve the records and samples contained within."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Republic CR90 corvette FarStar employed six Q-Signal Messenger Drones to send reports back to Kal'Shebbol during its hunt for Moff Kentor Sarne."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
