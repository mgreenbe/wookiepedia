Despite interference from the Empire, the project was a success, and Metonae was reassigned back to the Tantive IV.

She served aboard the consular ship Tantive IV, a CR90 corvette under the command of her uncle, Captain Raymus Antilles. Metonae took on the role of bosun and petty officer, which placed her in charge of the ship's deck crew and craft, such as the escape pods. Following the Declaration of a New Order and the formation of the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, she oversaw a test launch of the Tantive IV's pods."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the pods were jettisoned, the ship was attacked by pirates from the Karthakk system, forcing the Tantive IV to depart the area hurriedly. Following the retreat, the ship's crew discovered that two of the Tantive IV's droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO, had been aboard the launched pods and were now stranded. Metonae was held responsible for the loss of the valuable automatons, and she was reassigned to Project: Another Chance. Meanwhile, Viceroy Bail Organa made the recovery of the droids a top priority for the crew of the Tantive IV."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Project: Another Chance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Metonae's reassignment, contrary to appearances, was not disciplinary. Her organizational skills were needed by Project: Another Chance, a flagship initiative to disarm Alderaan following the bloody and chaotic Clone Wars. The disarmament was voluntary, not enforced by the Empire at all, and Metonae was given a leadership role in organizing the project. A single war frigate, the Another Chance, was converted into an automated armory ship, in which all of Alderaan's weaponry would be stored indefinitely. The craft, escorted by three automated escort ships, would make perpetual hyperspace jumps until recalled home by the Alderaanian Council of Elders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She directly oversaw the launch of the Another Chance and its three escorts, although covert agents from the Galactic Empire attempted to sabotage the operation. An Imperial taskforce intended to intercept and take the Another Chance, with its contents, and put them to use in the service of the Empire, forcing Metonae to act quickly. She deployed a set of decoy craft carrying transponder signals that matched those of the Another Chance and its escort, which lured the Imperials away from their true targets."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Return to the Tantive IV"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Suitably impressed with Project: Another Chance, Organa reassigned Metonae back to the Tantive IV, where she was given the rank of Master Chief Petty Officer. The droids R2-D2 and C-3PO had been recovered by Antilles and given instructions to never enter an escape pod again. Metonae oversaw the expansive Vanguard c20 refit of the corvette Sundered Heart, which upgraded the ship's weapons, armor, and sensor capacity, effectively making it a CR90 corvette."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Metonae and the crew of the Tantive IV would continue to serve Organa and his daughter, Princess Leia Organa, over the years. In the service of the princess, the Tantive IV began to do the work of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, an illegal rebellion movement against Emperor Palpatine's New Order. In 0 BBY, the ship traveled to Toprawa, where it retrieved plans for the Empire's new battlestation, the Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tantive IV's actions attracted the attention of the Sith Lord Darth Vader, a powerful Imperial warrior who had been monitoring the Princess's actions. At Toprawa, while receiving the plans, the Tantive IV was hailed by Commander Nahdonnis Praji of the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator, Vader's ship, and ordered to heave to. Captain Antilles refused to comply, resulting in a chase that took the consular ship to the Tatoo system. There, the Princess hoped to give the plans to the former Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. However, the Devastator captured and boarded the Tantive IV. Vader, in a mad hunt for the plans, had the ship destroyed. Metonae, who was still on board, perished during the Tantive IV's destruction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Corla Metonae was a talented organizer, picked to oversee projects such as the Another Chance initiative and the refit of the Tantive IV. Though she was held responsible for the loss of R2-D2 and C-3PO, she was not truly disciplined, and was instead given control over a far more major enterprise than that of a single consular ship. She was able to avert disaster, and thwarted Imperial agents attempting to hamstring Project: Another Chance by commissioning decoys."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Corla Metonae was originally known as the \"Alderaanian Bosun,\" and was a character created for Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, although she does not appear in the final cut of the film.

At the end of Revenge of the Sith, the droids are shown to be serving aboard the Tantive IV, in the service of Captain Raymus Antilles, and at the start of A New Hope, they are in the same situation. This clashes with the Star Wars: Droids television series, the accompanying comic series from Star Comics and the Dark Horse Comics series of the same name, which all featured the pair of droids in miscellaneous adventures prior to A New Hope but after Revenge of the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Windham's book had mentioned that the droids had been lost by the Alderaanians due to a mistake, and so Buehler chose to elaborate on that by making Metonae the guilty party, thereby helping to resolve the discrepancy. In addition to that, Buehler connected Metonae's story to that of the Another Chance, which initially featured in the West End Games adventure supplement, Graveyard of Alderaan, published in 1991. One connection, to \"Master Devwi's\" Databank entry on the XJ-2 airspeeder concerning Bail Organa's alias of \"Org Banelli,\" was cut in the editorial process. Further references were made to the Star Wars: Starfighter series.
