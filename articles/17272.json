Its head of state was a ceremonial monarch referred to as the supreme governor. Birren was reputed for its rituals that invariably lasted for several weeks. When Lord Mellowyn died without an heir, the figurehead governorship of Birren should have passed to his closest living relative, Senator Leia Organa of Alderaan. However, since Organa had no interest in claiming the title, she gave the throne of Birren to Lady Carise Sindian of Arkanis. Days later, after discovering that Sindian had broken the royal seal by exposing the identity of Organa's true father, the senator managed to convince the Elder Houses to strip Sindian of all her titles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
