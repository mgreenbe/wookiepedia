They were highly intelligent, though their intelligence level is unknown, as they were too dangerous to observe by living subjects, and droids were destroyed within minutes. In fact, wyyyschokk held the distinction of being the most dangerous predator on Kashyyyk, signifying them as one of the most dangerous in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were intelligent enough to coordinate ambushes on unsuspecting creatures, and had the tenacity to track their prey for over a kilometer.

After he regrouped with two other troopers\u2014Milo Strander and Sterns Yennich\u2014the spider continued to track the trio as they made their way back to their drop zone. Yennich, unaware of the danger, stepped into a clearing lacking adequate protection from below, and was attacked by the spider. After slicing through the trooper's leg armor with one of its legs, causing a large amount of blood to flow, the wyyyschokk bit through the bark Yennich was standing on, piercing his chest. Curling into a ball due to the venom, he offered no resistance to the spider, which pulled him down for consumption."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "About 2 BBY, Sith Lord Darth Vader sent his secret apprentice, Starkiller, to raise an army to oppose the Galactic Emperor.

Making his way toward the Imperial skyhook anchor facility where she was being held, Marek encountered several giant weavers lying in wait for him.
