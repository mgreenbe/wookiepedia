The delegation included Senator Finis Valorum, and Jedi Tyvokka, Adi Gallia, Plo Koon, Qui-Gon Jinn, and Obi-Wan Kenobi. The negotiations ended abruptly when the Combine's leader Iaco Stark launched an attack on the delegation and the incoming Republic fleet led by Senator Ranulph Tarkin. Tyvokka was injured during the ambush, and the Republic delegates retreated to the Consular-class cruiser."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Valorum used the ship to send a transmission to coordinate a rendezvous with Tarkin, while the captain began preparing it for takeoff. After the shuttle of Trade Federation Senator Nute Gunray was destroyed by the Combine, Jinn told the captain to activate the ship's shields and head to the rendezvous, as their presence was clearly known to the Combine. The captain hoped they could escape, as the ship had suffered collateral damage. Once the ship took flight, Jinn spotted another vessel, Blue 9, that he deduced had destroyed the Trade Federation shuttle, and asked the captain if they could outrun it. The captain explained that their ship was too damaged to do so, and as they were only on a diplomatic vessel they had no weapons and their shields were failing. Jinn decided to see what the other Jedi had to suggest. Together, the Jedi used the Force to create the illusion to Blue 9's pilot that he was surrounded by enemy starfighters, causing him to cease pursuing the cruiser and eject."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The captain had blonde hair, blue eyes, and light skin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
