The office was established to look after and maintain the vast labyrinth of Xim the Despot's treasure chambers, located on the southernmost of the planet's three continents. The immense, empty structure housed the headquarters themselves, and was one of the few administrative offices occupying the vaults. Being a poor society, the Landmark Preservation office operated on almost no resources."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
