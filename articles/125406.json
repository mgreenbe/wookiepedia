For his part, Ranth is not known to be a physician or any kind of medical care provider. Nevertheless, some fans continue to support the fanon identification of the two, based on the perceived likelihood that the author of Nightsaber intended them to be the same person."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
