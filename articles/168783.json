A skilled tracker who often worked with 4-LOM, Zuckuss had a run-in with Han Solo that left his ship, the Mist Hunter, powered down on a strange planet. He was later among the hunters assembled by Darth Vader to find the Millennium Falcon following the Battle of Hoth, although Boba Fett ultimately earned the bounty by delivering Solo to Jabba Desilijic Tiure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life and career"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An insectoid being with compound eyes, Zuckuss was a male Gand born on his species' homeworld of Gand as one of the planet's traditional findsmen. Using the findsmen's mystic traditions, dating back centuries, Zuckuss operated as a tireless tracker until the planet's findsman traditions began dying out. He became one of the first such to leave the planet's thick and toxic atmosphere, and wore a respirator to breathe ammonia while operating in oxygen-rich atmospheres in the wider galaxy. He worked as a bounty hunter on lucrative jobs that made use of his particular talents as a highly sought-after hunter with renowned tracking skills, and he often paired up with 4-LOM on many occasions. Although Zuckuss's uncanny abilities made some uneasy, he and 4-LOM remained a formidable team. They flew aboard the Mist Hunter, which Zuckuss filled with gasses to remind him of his homeworld."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Capturing Beris Ford"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 9 BBY, Zuckuss and 4-LOM captured the small-time criminal Beris Ford, keeping him imprisoned aboard their ship and hoping to use the reward for his capture to pay for tractor beam repairs. Weeks later, the hunters took up a bounty placed by Rekias Nodo on Han Solo, and confronted him at Valtos Space Port. Zuckuss incapacitated the smuggler inside a stun net fired from his snare rifle, and he and 4-LOM loaded Han's cargo into the Mist Hunter, where they imprisoned him along with Ford. Sensing a disturbance in the Force, Zuckuss checked on the stolen cargo only to be attacked by Chewbacca bursting from one of the containers, and was hit with a stun net from his own rifle. Zuckuss was left tied up while the Wookiee rescued Han and Beris, and the scoundrels fled with their cargo back to the Millennium Falcon. However, the hunters pursued, and after a firefight Zuckuss chased the Falcon into space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Solo and Chewbacca to an unidentified planet, Zuckuss again sensed something was wrong, but 4-LOM continued the pursuit through a heavy cloud layer until their ship's systems\u2014and 4-LOM himself\u2014suddenly powered down, forcing them to drop out of the sky and crash-land on a beach. Zuckuss was trapped in the wreckage, and called out to Solo for help in freeing his legs, though slapped stuncuffs on Solo when he was in reach. However, the planet's technology-negating effects caused the cuffs to release Solo, who left Zuckuss in his predicament. After Solo and Chewbacca found an energy projector transmitting an immobilizer beam, Zuckuss attacked them with native spears as they climbed the tall mast. Chewbacca dislodged the projection sphere from the top, causing it to crash on the beach below, which caused mechanical drones to erupt from the sand and attack all three interlopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zukuss, Solo, and Chewbacca climbed the projector to evade the scorpion-droids. The three of them fought the droids until 4-LOM was reactivated. After 4-LOM destroyed several of the scorpion droids, the four made their way to the ocean and swam to the Falcon. Once the Falcon had taken flight, Zuckuss and 4-LOM demanded that Solo fly them to Nodo to collect on Solo's bounty. Han then bumped a lever on the Falcon, causing the ship to plummet back down to the planet below. This caused 4-LOM and Zuckuss to believe the Falcon had flown into another dampening field, and look for a means of escape. When Solo said there were only two Anti-grav chutes aboard, Zuckuss and 4-LOM stunned Solo and Chewbacca. The two of them jumped out of the Falcon, but Zuckuss realized that Solo tricked them again. The two bounty hunters were left on the planet at the mercy of the scorpion-droids."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Hunt for the Millennium Falcon"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Zuckuss, along with Black Krrsantan, IG-90, Dengar, Chanath Cha, Beebox and C-21 Highsinger, was hired by Darth Vader to find and return Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra, who had been captured by the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Hoth, he was once again hired by Vader, this time to hunt down the Millennium Falcon and capture the passengers alive.

Possessing a sixth sense, he claimed he could feel disturbances in the Force, which his partner 4-LOM dismissed as superstitious mumbo-jumbo. According to early testing by the Inquisitorius, Zuckuss did not register to have Force sensitivity on whatever they used to measure one's capability with it. However, the Inquisitors may have been wrong, as he still had extra-sensory abilities beyond Imperial science. Zuckuss spoke about himself in the third person.
