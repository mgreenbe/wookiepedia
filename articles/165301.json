Stackpole. It was published by Bantam Spectra in October 1996. Narration for the audio version was performed by Henry Thomas. The Alliance to Restore the Republic has just captured the planet Coruscant from the hands of imperial leader Ysanne Isard. But instead of a glorious victory the Rebels discover a horrible truth; The planet's non-Human population has been infected with a vicious disease called the Krytos virus. It can be cured by bacta, but the demand is too much for the planet to handle. Rogue Squadron is assigned to attack Warlord Zsinj and his space station that contained a healthy amount of bacta that had been stolen from a deep space convoy. The assignment is difficult, maybe impossible, but in the words of Corran Horn: \"Impossible is what the Rogues do best.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Publisher's summary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebels have taken Coruscant, but their problems are far from over. A killer virus called Krytos is wiping out the indigenous population, and a counter-revolution is exploding. At the center of the storm is the highly charged treason trial of Rebel hero Tycho Celchu. While agents provocateurs carry out their acts of terrorism, the fledging state can be defended only by the blood and courage of Rogue Squadron. As the X-wing fighters scramble to save the Rebellion, Corran Horn, given up for dead in Ysanne Isard's inescapable prison, discovers he alone holds the key to freeing Coruscant from the Empire!"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The plot focuses on three key events that happen mostly simultaneously. The first is the occupation of Coruscant and the trouble the Empire left behind with its crippling bio-attack on the planet. The virus used in the attack is the Krytos virus, a biological weapon developed by General Evir Derricote and released under the orders of Imperial leader Ysanne Isard. Humans are apparently immune, while all other species are vulnerable. This, combined with Imperial Intelligence officer Kirtan Loor's terrorist activities while taking orders from the Palpatine Counterinsurgency Front, leaves Coruscant and the New Republic in a state of emergency."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The second event is the treason trial of Rogue Squadron executive officer Tycho Celchu, who is suspected of murdering Rogue Squadron pilot Corran Horn, who was captured during the invasion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finally, Corran Horn is being held prisoner by Ysanne Isard in her Lusankya prison facility.
