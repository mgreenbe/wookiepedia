As its name suggested, it was armed with a metal chain. It had a blaster-resistant durasteel chassis, and it was programmed with an array of skills in martial arts, that it could execute at speeds slightly faster than those of Humans. It had been manufactured with an inhibitor that prevented it from killing its opponent after the droid was victorious, but this was removed by the Sith. In 32.5 BBY, Maul used his lightsaber to first cut off its legs at the knees and then vertically bisect it from between its legs to its head with a move called Rancor Rising as it fought against him with three other Duelist Elites, Cudgel, Hachete, and Rapier, damaging it beyond repair."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
