Amidala, who died after giving birth to twin children\u2014Luke and Leia\u2014was mourned by thousands of Naboo citizens during her funeral in the capital city of Theed. Her body was made to still look pregnant in order to keep Luke and Leia safe from their father, Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith formerly known as Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who fell to the dark side of the Force in a failed attempt to save his wife from dying."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the final days of the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo became pregnant with twin children; Amidala was unaware that she was pregnant with two children and was only expecting one. Her husband, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, had visions of Amidala dying in childbirth. Their marriage was a secret, as the Jedi Code forbade Jedi from marrying, preventing Skywalker from finding the guidance and help he felt he needed from the Jedi Order to save Amidala's life. He was instead seduced to the dark side of the Force by Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith publicly known as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who promised that he could help Skywalker save Amidala from death. Skywalker swore his allegiance to Sidious, who gave his new apprentice the name Darth Vader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader led the destruction of the Jedi Order, his first act as a Dark Lord of the Sith. With the Jedi destroyed, Sidious declared himself Emperor and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire, which Amidala bore witness to in a special session of the Galactic Senate. When Amidala learned of Vader's fall shortly thereafter, she refused to believe it and followed Vader to Mustafar, where he had been sent to kill the Separatist Council and end the Clone Wars. Unknown to the senator, however, was that Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, the former mentor and friend of Anakin Skywalker, had stowed away aboard her vessel. Once on Mustafar, Amidala attempted to reason with Vader and pleaded that he run away with her so they could live their lives in peace. Once Vader saw Kenobi, however, he used the Force to choke his wife into unconsciousness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following a lightsaber duel between Kenobi and Vader, in which Vader was left horribly burned on the bank of a lava river and in need of a cybernetic suit to survive, Kenobi took the unconscious Amidala to the asteroid colony of Polis Massa. The droid doctors found out that she was dying, having lost the will to live, but she survived long enough to give birth to her twins: Luke and Leia. She died moments after their birth, fulfilling Vader's visions, though she still believed that there was good in Darth Vader. In order to keep the children safe from Vader, who was unaware of their birth and was led to believe that he had killed Amidala, it was decided that Luke would be taken to live with his uncle and aunt, Owen and Beru Lars, on Tatooine; meanwhile Leia was taken to Alderaan as the adopted child of Amidala's friend and colleague, Senator Bail Organa, and his wife, Queen Breha Organa. Amidala's body was taken to Naboo aboard Organa's ship, the Tantive III, and was made to look as if she was still pregnant in order to keep the birth of the twins a secret. Her body was then prepared by mortician Commodex Tahn, making it seem as though she had died pregnant. Her death was blamed on the so-called Jedi Rebellion that had caused Order 66."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The funeral"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Padm\u00e9 Amidala's funeral took place in Theed, the capital of Naboo. The funeral was attended by thousands of mourners who paid their respects to their beloved senator. Among the attendees were Queen Apailana; Sio Bibble, the Governor of Theed who served as one of Amidala's advisers when she was Queen of Naboo; Mon Mothma, a close friend of Amidala and fellow senator who knew who was truly to blame for the death; Jar Jar Binks, the Gungan representative in the Galactic Senate; Nass, former Boss of the Gungans; and several members of Amidala's family, including Jobal, Ruwee, and Sola Naberrie. Amidala's funeral contained an open casket procession drawn through Theed, in which her hands clutched a japor snippet\u2014one meant to bring her good fortune\u2014that Skywalker had made for her shortly after they first met. She was laid to rest in a tomb."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fact that Amidala had given birth to twins was a secret known only to a few after her death. Nineteen years later, her children met for the first time\u2014they did not, however, know that they were siblings\u2014during the Galactic Civil War. Vader later learned that Luke was his son and that Amidala had indeed given birth, and he attempted to seduce Luke to the dark side of the Force. It was confirmed by rogue archaeologist Doctor Aphra, whose droid companion 0-0-0 tortured Tahn for the information. Luke remained true, however, and ultimately learned that Leia, who had some faint memories of their mother, was his sister. During the Battle of Endor, Luke set out to redeem his father from the dark side of the Force. His efforts were successful; Sidious attempted to kill Luke with a barrage of Force lightning, but Vader stepped in to rescue his son and kill the Emperor. Vader, once again Anakin Skywalker, died as a result of the injuries he sustained in killing the Emperor, but not before proving Amidala's final words correct: there was still good within Darth Vader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The funeral of Padm\u00e9 Amidala was one of the final scenes in the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, written and directed by Star Wars creator George Lucas. The scene was filmed at Fox Studios in Sydney, Australia on September 16, 2003, the 57th day of filming on Revenge of the Sith. One of the primary actors involved in the shooting of the scene was Keisha Castle-Hughes, who portrayed Queen Apailana. In addition to Hughes were individuals dressed as hooded dignitaries, blue guards, and two dozen other people. Oliver Ford Davies briefly reprised his role from the prior two films as Sio Bibble, and the scene also featured cameos from members of the film's crew.
