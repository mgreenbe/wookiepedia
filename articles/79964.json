Prior to the Battle of Hoth, Luke Skywalker was patrolling in the Lanteel Glacier when he was attacked by a wampa who took the captive human to a cave. Skywalker later escaped from the wampa cave, severing the arm of another wampa in the process, but collapsed both due to the blizzard that was occurring and from his earlier injuries. Solo was later forced to camp out with the comatose Skywalker after his tauntaun died from the blizzard, also using the tauntaun as a heat source. Han later reported his location to Rogue 2, Zev Senesca, when Echo Base sent out a search party for them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
