The Lioaoin Regime sent the heavy cruiser and three others for an attack on the Vigilant, on behalf of the Nikardun Destiny, when the Chiss vessel attempted to retrieve Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo from the planet Primea. Attacker Three, along with the cruiser designated Four, blocked the Viiglant's optimal escape route, so Admiral Ar'alani had the warship target Three, while Attacker Four was heavily damaged by the Vak patrol boat that Thrawn was piloting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
