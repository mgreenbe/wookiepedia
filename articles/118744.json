It produced a blue energy shield around a base that protected it from energy blasts and orbital bombardments. It did not however, prevent solid objects such as infantry, vehicles, or missiles, from entering the barrier, however it could be upgraded to stop missiles. Like all other shield generators, it required a power generator to stay operational. They were also used by numerous other factions such as the Zann Consortium and the Hutt Cartel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
