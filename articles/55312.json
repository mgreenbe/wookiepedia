These Sith were disillusioned by their knowledge of the Tribe's true history and saw the Omen as the last remnant of the Tribe's \"inglorious past\" which needed to be destroyed. However, the Caretaker and historian Varner Hilts stopped the Sith from carrying out their plan by revealing a map which confirmed the existence of another continent called Alanciar or \"Keshtah Major\". As a result, the Sith factions stopped fighting and elected Hilts as their new Grand Lord, ending the Time of the Rot.

Adherents believed that the Tribe had to regroup in order to return to the Kesh Sith Temple and rediscover interstellar travel. They speculated that Humans were a master race in the galaxy and that every Human had their own planet to rule as their own planetary kingdom. Members of the Golden Destiny were distinguished by their golden-colored tunics. While they respected the Testament of Yaru Korsin, they did not adhere to the political structure which Korsin had outlined.

For centuries, the continent of Keshtah Minor, the Tribe's main domain, was devastated by fighting between rival Sith factions over the leadership of the Tribe. In 3000 BBY, an unidentified leader of the Golden Destiny attended the Testament Day where a reading of Yaru Korsin's Testament was carried out before the assembled Sith factions. This Testimony had been recorded by Korsin himself in a holocron prior to his death in 4975 BBY. The Golden Destiny leader disagreed with the Korsinite League leader Korsin Bentado's view that the Tribe should emulate the teachings of Yaru Korsin about the Tribe's structure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During that year's Pantheon's Peace, the Caretaker Varner Hilts discovered an earlier recording beneath Korsin's Testament. The assembled Sith delegates quickly discovered that their vaunted founder Korsin was merely a slave to the ancient Sith Lord Naga Sadow, one of the last rulers of the Sith Empire. Rather than being great \"conquerors,\" the ancestors of the Tribe themselves were slaves to Naga Sadow who had been sent to extract Lignan ores from Phaegon III. This revelation effectively discredited the long-held popular mythology that the Tribe's ancestors had been \"great conquerors\" in the past. Despite attempts to hide the \"inglorious history\" of the Tribe, news of the Tribe's true origins spread among the various Sith factions.

Later, several surviving members of the Golden Destiny led by the mathematician and engineer Edell Vrai joined forces with the other Sith factions to destroy the Omen, the ancient Sith starship which had brought the Lost Tribe's ancestors to Kesh. Vrai justified his plans by arguing that the ship was merely a \"carrier for chattle\" and sought to purge this \"inglorious history\" from the Tribe's memories. Vrai and Bentado believed that the Tribe, which had been reduced to a few thousand members, was predestined to extinction.

However, they were stopped by Varner Hilts, his Keshiri assistant Jaye Vuhld, and Iliana Merko, the former leader of the Sisters of Seelah. Hilts revealed that Korsin had a secret that could save the Tribe from destruction: a map which confirmed the existence of a second continent known as Alanciar, or Keshtah Major. Hilts was able to unite the various Sith by convincing them to work together to reach and conquer this new continent. Edell Vrai and his fellow Golden Destiny members crowned Hilts as their new Grand Lord, ending the Time of the Rot. The other Sith also submitted to Hilts and pledged their allegiance to him."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Hilts Restoration"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Golden Destiny was the largest faction to survive the great crisis. They quickly allied themselves with Grand Lord Hilts and joined his new government. The mathematician Edell Vrai was put in charge of the Tribe's efforts to develop a form of transport that could reach Keshtah Major. After twenty-five years of experimentation and research, Vrai succeeded in building a fleet of airships that were powered by hydrogen extracted from the volcano Sessal Spire. This enabled the Lost Tribe to travel to Keshtah Minor. While the Tribe's invasion of Alanciar was rebuffed by the Alanciari Keshiri, the Tribe were able to manipulate the Alanciari man Jogan Halder into convincing the Alanciar that the Tribe was not a threat to them but were rather their mythical Protectors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
