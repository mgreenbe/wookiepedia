It had a flat base with a raised gunnery platform, from which a single operator could defend a position from aerial assault while protected by two physical shields, both colored brown with gold highlights. Two large, gray launch tubes fired explosive warhead-tipped missiles. The launcher suffered from a slow rate of fire, though the powerful missiles could pierce the hull of a starship and, with repeated fire, could even destroy a cruiser. The turret was most effective against large flying targets rather than ground units."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wookiee dual missile turret saw use during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, with the Republic-aligned Wookiees using the emplacements to defend against Trandoshan or Separatist aerial assaults.
