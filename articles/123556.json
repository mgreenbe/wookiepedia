Its geomorphous wings allowed for superior mobility, and the on-board repulsorlift generator allowed for a flight ceiling of 5 kilometers. However, the ShadoWing-4 was a fragile design and not recommended for use in hazardous weather. Safety features included a sensor beacon, navigational equipment and emergency thrusters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alliance Special Forces often modified the ShadoWing for use by Pathfinders and Infiltrators, by removing the beacon to avoid detection."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
