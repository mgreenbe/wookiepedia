The Lorell Raiders would abduct beautiful women along with their plundering, they would take them back to Hapes and eventually, due to an isolated gene pool, this created the near-Human Hapans. When the Jedi finally wiped out the Lorell Raiders, leaving the male population practically nonexistent, Hapes became a matriarchal monarchy led by a Queen Mother. The first Queen Mother then established the Hapes Consortium based on the planet of Hapes, and closed the borders of the Cluster around 3000 BBY, which would remain thus until 8 ABY. By the time of the New Republic, the Hapan state contained sixty-three explored star systems with inhabited worlds, although it was suspected that as many as one hundred nineteen habitable planets existed in the Cluster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Regions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were seven distinct regions within the Cluster:"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known planets"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Interior Regions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Hapan Rim Worlds"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Corsair Outback"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Lorelli Reach"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Rifle Worlds"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Other"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In terms of real-life astrophysics, the Hapes Cluster would appear to be a star cluster of the open cluster or possibly stellar association type, while the Transitory Mists describe either an H II region and its Bok globules, or perhaps a dark nebula."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
