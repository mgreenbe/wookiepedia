The spacetroopers wore standard stormtrooper armor, and would then \"plug in\" to the armored suit that served as a personal assault vehicle. The powered exoskeleton gave the spacetrooper enhanced strength, and made him into a walking arsenal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mark II armor stood over two meters tall, and had built in environmental controls, sensors, and magnetic couplers for attaching to the hulls of starships. The suit had an inbuilt grenade launcher with concussion, stun, and gas grenades, a blaster cannon, and a laser cutter. A launch rack developed by Arakyd Industries could be mounted to the back of the armor, providing a launching platform for mini-proton torpedoes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
