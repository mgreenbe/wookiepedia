The term itself seemed to be of Corellian origin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Uglies were predominantly used by pirates, smugglers, and other groups that lacked the resources to purchase or build conventional starfighters. Ugly fighters were best known as products of independent shipyards in the Corellian system, but they and the yards that created them could be found throughout the galaxy. Some Ugly types had relatively standardized designs, but most were unique and had wildly varied performance traits. An Ugly generally tended to be a poor match for a modern conventional military-built fighter, as they typically ended up with more of the weaknesses than the strengths of their component parts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many uglies during the New Republic era were amalgamations of parts from Rebel and Imperial craft. They were used by gangs such as Kavil's Corsairs, who flew them against Rogue Squadron. Other versions of uglies could be found in pirate and mercenary fleets such as that of the Invid pirate fleet led by Leonia Tavira. The Sacorrian Triad was known to make heavy use of uglies during the First Corellian Insurrection, and it is possible that the Peace Brigade used them during the Yuuzhan Vong War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These craft could sometimes have surprising abilities, although they were sometimes prone to failure and may have needed repeated repairs.
