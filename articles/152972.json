In 19 BBY, the Human Jedi survived the initial execution of Order 66, which was the directive commanding clone troopers to execute the Jedi Knights as enemies of the Republic. She evaded the clone soldiers she was accompanying by taking advantage of the fog on the world on which she was stationed. Eventually she was among several Jedi who were captured and brought to Emperor Palpatine, alias the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who gave them lightsabers and encouraged them to duel each other to see who would survive under his rule. The Jedi instead attacked Sidious, who killed all of them except for her and the Verpine Jedi Beyghor Sahdett.

Soon, the Jedi were brought before Emperor Palpatine himself, whom they recognized to be a Sith Lord, Darth Sidious. The Emperor handed lightsabers to this Jedi and her fellow captives, encouraging them to duel one another for the right to survive under his rule. The Jedi had not given in to fear, however, and attacked the Sith as one; yet Sidious' prowess with the Force and a lightsaber allowed him to kill three of the Jedi in an instant. She and Sahdett were the only two left standing, shocked at how quickly their compatriots had been slaughtered. Sahdett, however, enraptured by awe and fear of Sidious' power, turned on the Jedi and rammed his blade through her stomach, killing her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi was light-skinned with green eyes and red hair.

At the time of her capture, she was wearing a different tiara, with a silver stone at the center.
