Grand Moff Kilran threatened to kill the entire crew of the Esseles if they resisted his forces. Four individuals aboard the Esseles stood against the invaders, eventually repelling them and boarding the Moff's ship, disengaging the tractor beam that held the Esseles and allowed it to escape. Following the assault, Imperial spokesmen denied any wrongdoing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
