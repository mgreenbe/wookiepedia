When the Galactic Empire annexed Hargeeva in 7 BBY, Makintay used the opportunity to attend the Imperial Academy and learn how to pilot starfighters. Upon his return, he fell in love with a lowborn commoner, Ketrian Altronel, and announced his intention to marry her. This action, along with his critical opposition of his father's oppression of the lower classes of Hargeevan society, led his father to disinherit Makintay. He also arranged for his son's kidnapping and incarceration at the Imperial penal colony on Garen IV. Makintay escaped with the aid of his friend, the Sullustan Merinda Niemeh, and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Returning to Hargeeva, Makintay established a small Rebel cell on the planet.

Flying as Rogue Nine with his gunner, Barlon Hightower, the pair survived the battle and escaped Hoth. Makintay was transferred to Eyrie Base on the planet of Karatha, where he commanded Green Squadron. A shortage of supplies and critical parts for the Alliance forced Makintay to undergo a risky mission to Hargeeva to contact his former fianc\u00e9e, Ketrian Altronel, and convince her to join the Alliance. Altronel, however, believed that Makintay had abandoned her for a life in space, unaware of his father's machinations. During their meeting, Imperial forces captured them, bounding them over for transport to the Imperial capital of Coruscant.

Although the Alliance was aware of the treatment for such poisonings, the standard treatment was not working. Makintay and Merinda Niemeh traveled back to Hargeeva to capture Major Pedrin, who had infected Altronel in the first place, as they believed that she had been poisoned with a new compound only he could cure. While their mission was successful, upon their return to Eyrie Base Makintay discovered that Altronel's condition was not caused by Pedrin, but by a fellow Hargeevan, Assistant Medic Astina Griek, who blamed Altronel's work for the deaths of her husband and son at the hands of the Empire. Makintay confronted Griek, who was also in possession of an antidote to cure Altronel. Subsequently, a struggle with Pedrin ensued as he sought to escape Alliance custody. Makintay was stabbed in the back, and Griek was killed by a blaster fired by Pedrin.

However, the benefits were restricted to the elite of Hargeeva's society and the impoverished lower classes saw little change. The Empire established a garrison and refinery on the planet under the command of Major Nial Pedrin, a former AT-AT platoon commander whose cross-training in geology made him the perfect candidate for the assignment. Makintay, meanwhile, used the Imperial interest in the planet to attend the Imperial Academy, where he trained as a starfighter pilot and gained a love of flying. After graduating, he returned to Hargeeva, joining his father's court. There, he witnessed his father oppressing the masses and saw the injustices present within Hargeevan society. He was vocally critical of his father and his policies. During this time, Makintay met Merinda Niemeh, a Sullustan technician employed by the High King to upgrade the equipment in his palace.

In 3 ABY, Makintay was stationed at the Alliance's Echo Base, on the ice planet of Hoth, as part of the starfighter complement. Shortly after being declared operational, the base was discovered by Imperial forces, necessitating an immediate evacuation.

However, due to this, Eyrie Base found itself critically short of supplies including, food and spare parts to keep its X-wings flying. To try and alleviate the situation, Commander Biros Baran, the base's intelligence officer, had passed word to Fighter Command that a stray Imperial supply carrier had been located.

Makintay, realizing that not being in command of the squadron would place someone with lesser skills in charge of his pilots, thereby endangering their safety, relented. Niemeh informed him that she had been working on a plan to obtain the necessary parts Eyrie Base needed without resorting to raiding missions by securing experts who could manufacture the replacement parts and supplies they needed. Makintay immediately thought of contacting Ketrian Altronel for her expertise in geology and metallurgy, and the plan was approved by Alliance High Command. A contact team was put together to meet her on Hargeeva, led by the Alderaanian, Merak. Although he knew that Merak could handle the initial contact, Makintay maneuvered himself onto the team so that he could meet with Altronel.

Grathal met them at the Lantern Inn, and then escorted them out of the rear entrance to avoid the guards that Major Pedrin insisted accompany Altronel at all times as she was considered to be a strategic asset to the Empire. At the warehouse, Makintay and the team met with Altronel, where he attempted to explain the reasons for his disappearance. Altronel was furious at him, believing that he had ran from his father's threats and had abandoned her to be in space. Makintay revealed the truth behind his disappearance, and told her the reason he had not contacted her during his previous return to Hargeeva was to protect her as he was a wanted criminal, and she was secure in her position working for the Empire. He convinced her to at least listen to what the Rebel contact team had to say, but after an hour Altronel proclaimed that the Alliance was no better than the Empire; all they cared about was what Altronel could do for them, and felt that all Makintay cared about was repairing his X-wings. Reluctantly, Makintay agreed to escort Altronel and Nolan back home. Upon exiting the warehouse, the Rebels inside were attacked by Imperial troops; Altronel's guards had discovered that she was missing from the inn and had learned of their location after questioning Grathal upon his return to the establishment after delivering Altronel and Nolan to the warehouse.

Traditional methods of torture were employed, leaving Makintay with bruises and blood-stained clothing. Drugs were also used on Nolan, but their effects overloaded her heart, killing her; Makintay held her as she died. With Makintay still refusing to break and reveal the location of Eyrie Base, Imperial High Command ordered him to be transferred to the Imperial capital, Coruscant, where experts in interrogation and torture would take over.

She had agreed to help Pedrin in return for the Major freeing Nolan; Altronel was unaware her friend was dead as Pedrin claimed she was still being questioned. Makintay and Altronel talked, and he told her of Nolan's death, which upset and angered her. During the conversation, Makintay noticed that Altronel was unwell; her skin was tinged greenish-yellow, and her eyes appeared feverish. She claimed that the constant hyperspace jumps the transport was making were the cause, despite never being space sick in the past. Makinaty wondered if being stunned had caused the effect, but she told him that a medical droid had given her an injection to counteract the blast. The pilot realized that Altronel had been poisoned by Pedrin; he had seen similar cases of poisoning amongst Imperial defectors who had arrived at Eyrie Base. It was the Empire's way of ensuring that personnel classified as a Class A Security Risk would not end up as useful defectors or healthy prisoners if they were captured during transport from secure areas. Regular injections of the proscribed antidote would keep the drug's lethal effect at bay until a full treatment regime could be implemented once the individual was secure.

Altronel showed it to Makintay and revealed that it was her new alloy, a modified form of ostrine that had heat-absorption properties. It was the reason that she was being transferred to Coruscant, as Imperial High Command saw great potential in the discovery. Taking the ensign's uniform and weapon, Makintay kissed Altronel and reaffirmed his love for her before they left the room to find an escape pod to leave the ship. It quickly became apparent that the Empire was losing ground to the pirates, and that the pair would have to find a less public route to avoid being caught in the crossfire. Makintay also realized that the attacking pirates were led by Uskgarv, and consisted of methane-breathing Ghawems, who generally flooded the decks with methane gas after they had captured them. They worked in tandem with a slave species, the Myills, who were oxygen-breathers. Both species wore breathers with their respective atmosphere during boarding operations, and Makintay hoped to procure some oxygen breathers off the Myills.

Relaying the bad news concerning the escape pods to her, Makintay revealed he had a new plan; stay hidden on the ship until the ship made port, then sneak off. Altronel disliked the idea of being taken to a pirate base, but Makintay told her that the chances of them taking the ship straight to a buyer were equally as good. Altronel's condition continued to worsen, and she complained of being freezing. Makintay's worry for her condition deepened, and he intended to seek help from the pirates if she got worse, knowing that the transport's sick bay carried a supply of the antidote.

However, Makintay believed that the lessons he learned while training with the sword could be applied to starfighter combat tactics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ketrian Altronel was the love of Makintay's life. He cared not that she was considered to be a lowborn commoner, and willingly accepted disinheritance from his family for the chance to marry her. He felt a large amount for being forced to leave Altronel when his father arranged for him to be shipped off to an Imperial prison, despite him not being at fault. Makintay did not contact her upon his return to Hargeeva to start a Rebel cell since he wanted her to remain safe and not be suspected of Rebel activity through her involvement with him. He knew that his father had lied to her and told Altronel that he had willingly abandoned her to live among the stars. However, he never stopped loving her. He was willing to risk his own live to save hers when she was poisoned and on the brink of death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Makintay was trained to use a blaster, and generally carried a heavy blaster pistol. He was also proficient in unarmed and melee combat, especially swords, and carried a combat knife with him. An excellent pilot, Makintay was trained to fly starfighter\u2014with a specialization in X-wings\u2014and space transports. He could also plot courses through hyperspace, and operate starship systems such as weapons and shields. He was also trained to repair starfighters and operate security systems, as well as pilot repulsorlift vehicles. The product of a well-rounded education, Makintay was knowledgeable about planetary systems and other languages, and was well versed in the inner workings of bureaucracies. As a starfighter squadron leader, he was trained in starfighter tactics and operations. An able commanding officer, Makintay was a persuasive individual who was also conditioned to resist standard Imperial interrogation and torture methods. Schooled in the art of survival, he could be stealthy when the need arose. Makintay usually dressed in a flight suit and carried a comlink."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stevan Makintay first appeared in Firepower, a short story written by Carolyn Golledge for the eighth issue of the Star Wars Adventure Journal which was published in November 1995. Golledge wrote a sequel to the story, Desperate Measures, which was included in the tenth issue in series released in May 1996. The art accompanying both stories was by Doug Shuler. Firepower was subsequently reprinted on Hyperspace, where the original black-and-white images accompanying the story were colorized. Despite Makintay's eyes being described as green in the Desperate Measures, the Hyperspace image depicts him with blue eyes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Makintay later received a mention in 2008's The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia under an entry for Green Squadron. In 2012, authors Jason Fry and Paul R. Urquhart included Makintay in a roster of Rogue Squadron pilots who participated in the Battle of Hoth from Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. In 2013, The Essential Reader's Companion mentioned Makintay in relation to the stories he appeared in, although errors were included in the text. The Companion stated that, in Firepower, Makintay was the one to propose the idea of securing experts for the Alliance when it was Merinda Niemeh in-story. It also states he went on the mission solo, with no mention of the contact team led by Merak. It also describes Ketrian Altronel as agreeing to help the Alliance before being captured by the Empire, when in the original story, she does so after her capture. In the description for Desperate Measures, he is referred to as \"Mak Makintay\" on one occasion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
