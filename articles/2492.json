AR-72 was designed to interface with the \"brain\" of the the Tomb, a Rakata prison complex on the planet Belsavis, so that he could bring the prison's communication systems online for the Empire. After forty-seven straight hours of being connected to the brain, AR-72 was being overwhelmed by the Rakata technology, and was \"dreaming\" at times. AR-72 recruited the help of Imperial forces to retrieve the key for the command console, as the Esh-kha were guarding the key, and later remotely recruited more Imperials to destroy the radiation-generating machines in the overrun machine vault."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "AR-72 appears on Belsavis in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, where he provides Imperial players with the missions \"Ancient Transmissions\" and \"Deadly Mutations.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
