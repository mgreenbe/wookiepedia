Threepio warns Fivelines that the Empire is planning to strip Ronyards of its metal and use it for their own purposes. Fivelines unfortunately does not listen and is destroyed when an Imperial Star Destroyer arrives.\nThe droids' \"God\" then destroy the scout group of stormtroopers and eventually the Star Destroyer itself. Imperial records simply state that there was an accident that caused the Star Destroyer to crash on Ronyards and that all onboard the ship were killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rust Never Sleeps was written in Great Britain, so many of the words were spelled differently, occasionally confusing American readers.
