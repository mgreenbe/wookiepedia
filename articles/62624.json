Coming from a low-caste Fondorian family, he was given an apprenticeship in the Fondor Guild of Starshipwrights due to his family's years of service to the guild. Hune was put to work on weapons systems, but when he realized that they were for the Galactic Empire's massive Executor warship, he deserted his post and joined the Rebel Alliance, the Empire's opponent in the war. In the year 3 ABY, Hune was stationed at the Alliance's Echo Base on the icy world of Hoth. He was part of the base's starfighter complement, which was composed of Rogue Flight, Blue Squadron, and Green Squadron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When an Imperial probe droid discovered the base, the Alliance's General Rieekan ordered an evacuation. The Imperial Navy arrived in the Hoth system, and various members of the Rebel starfighter complement were pressed into service as the makeshift Rogue Group, flying T-47 airspeeders that had been adapted to cold weather use. Hune served as the rear gunner for pilot Tarrin Datch; together, the two were Rogue Ten of twelve. While Alliance personnel evacuated the planet in GR-75 medium transports, Commander Luke Skywalker led Rogue Group into the Battle of Hoth, hoping to delay the Imperial AT-AT walkers of Blizzard Force that were trying to destroy Echo Base's deflector shield generator. Datch and Hune made a strafing run at Blizzard 1, the enemy force's lead walker, but caused little damage to its armor. Their airspeeder was later shot down during the battle, and although Datch survived and the vehicle was salvaged, Hune was killed. However, the Rebels' evacuation was ultimately a success."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hosh Hune was a grim, bald man from a family of low status.

However, a card titled \"Snowspeeder Rogue Ten\" that was released in the Star Wars Trading Card Game's 2003 \"The Empire Strikes Back\" expansion revealed that one of the airspeeders seen attacking General Veers's AT-AT in the film is Rogue Ten.
