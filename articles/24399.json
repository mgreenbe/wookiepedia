He despised what his cousin Firith Olan had become and, when Firith came to him for shelter, made plans to sell his relative to the highest bidder. Cazne'olan orchestrated a negotiation between Rogue Squadron and Imperial Captain Marl Semtin, forcing Rogue Leader Wedge Antilles and Winter to battle Sixtus Quin and Septaas for information on Firith's and Eidolon Base's whereabouts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Cazne'olan showed that he believed crime did not pay\u2014either for Firith or the Galactic Empire\u2014by staging the battle in a virtual reality environment, in which all parties were consumed in a heat storm. The Empire came out the victor in the virtual game, with Sixtus securing the prize. However, Semtin secretly bribed his way into the upper levels of Kala'uun and took Firith, presumably without paying Cazne'olan his promised fee."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Cazne'olan was reunited with Antilles during Rogue Squadron's mission to procure ryll kor to aid in the fight against the Krytos virus.
