At some point, it was placed within the vaults of the Infinite Empire's prison world of Belsavis. The name for this device came from the legends of Ajunta Pall, and the carvings within the Tomb indicated that the relic was capable of granting its user great power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Cold War, Major Gart Charkron of the reconstituted Sith Empire's Imperial Reclamation Service was stationed on Belsavis. He uncovered the existence of the ancient alien device but was not sure how it operated, though he knew it was extremely dangerous and had disintegrated three of his men. Furthermore, he believed some of the prisoners had inadvertently salvaged some of its core components that had been split into three parts. He tasked a Sith official with the recovery of the device and reassembling it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
