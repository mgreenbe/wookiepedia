In 89 BBY, he encouraged groups of Ferroan and Langhesi colonists to settle on the planet, and he made himself the first Magister of the planet. During his time there, Hal discovered the being Sekot, with whom Hal formed a symbiotic relationship with and used this to help transform the planet into a thriving manufacturing organ. Having imprinted his own philosophy of the Force on Sekot and the settlers, Hal began the Zonama Sekot Shipbuilders and the planet began manufacturing hyperdrives beneath the planet's surface as well as the rare living ships the planet was famed for."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following his death, the citizens of Zonama banned speaking the name of their leader in reverence to his great deeds.
