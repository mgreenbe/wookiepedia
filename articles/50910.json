The experiment went badly when the clones killed all of the scientists and stormtroopers in the facility. The surviving clones remained on the moon until 41.5 ABY when Jaden Korr was led there by a Force vision, followed by Anzat assassin Kell Douro, who was hunting Korr for his soup. Korr dueled and killed Alpha, a clone of Kam Solusar, and Khedryn Faal killed Douro, and the remaining clones and their children escaped in the assassin's ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Jaden Korr's visions that first led him to the frozen moon, the escaped clones may have been cloned from Mara Jade, Lassin, or Lumiya.
