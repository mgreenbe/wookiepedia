When a skirmish broke out after Eternal Rur, a consicousness held within the crystal, was given a droid body and attacked the guests, the service droid sustained damage. The droid approached Aphra and the bounty hunter Black Krrsantan as they attempted to get into a heavily defended hangar containing the starship of the Xonti Brothers. After the droid offered Aphra a drink, the archaeologist sent it in as bait for the Xonti Brothers' turrets, equipped with an ion pulse. The droid was shot down by the turrets, and Aphra entered the room, pretending to bargain with the Xonti Brothers. The ion pulse detonated, deactivating the Xontis' turrets and allowing Krrsantan to enter, shooting the brothers' gladiator bodyguard Kthoo-Ra."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
