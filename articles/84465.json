The security droid was over two hundred years old by 232 BBY, at which point he was in the possession of Chancey Yarrow, owner of the cargo hauler Switchback. After Chancey Yarrow was killed when Nihil raiders boarded the hauler, her daughter, Sylvestri Yarrow, inherited both the Switchback and M-227. While Yarrow considered trading the droid away, she could not bring herself to sell M-227, viewing him as family. Yarrow continued to haul cargo aboard the Switchback, and M-227 served her alongside the co-pilot Neeto Janajana. Due to the rising costs associated with shipping and the threat posed by the Nihil, the crew of the Switchback were barely able to earn enough money to survive, owing numerous debts regardless of the profits they made."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Switchback was in transit\u2014despite M-227 having planned a route that avoided sectors where the Nihil had been sighted\u2014marauders pulled the hauler out of hyperspace, and its crew found that they had circled back into the system. M-227, who had been sitting in the co-pilot's seat, moved aside for Janajana to sit down, and Yarrow attempted to discern what had caused the issue. The crew realized what had happened when a number of Nihil vessels approached, but their attempt to make a hyperspace jump without a destination failed when their engine failed as a result of a faulty coaxium regulator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Both M-227 and Janajana insisted that evacuating the ship was their only option for survival, while Yarrow refused to abandon the Switchback.
