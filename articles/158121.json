Named after the park near which it was built, the Parkway was still relatively new and continuing to expand around 40 ABY. The community was predominantly occupied by Human scientists working for AruMed, due largely to the fact that it was only about five minutes from the AruMed labs. Its nightlife consisted mostly of people going to expensive bars and bistros."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boba Fett, after a brief visit to Upper Parkway, purchased half a dozen homes and transferred them to one of his holding companies in the hopes that his investment would double within the year."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
