To save some lives in the process, the Empire would utilize single-person Compact Assault Vehicles piloted by droids. Then with the planet on the verge of pacification, Imperial Admiral Riwwel refused to accept the Acherin plea for cease-fire, ordering the bombardment of Eluthan, the Acherin capital, as revenge for all his dead troops. Only the timely arrival of the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ferus Olin saved the lives of the resistance leaders Toma and Raina Quill. While they fled, the Empire devastated the city and claimed the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
