The virus seemed to turn almost any being, living or dead, who came in contact with it to a mindless flesh-craving undead creature. These creatures seemed to possess only primitive feral instincts after being turned, but were able to communicate and learn from each other through what seemed like unintelligible screeching. They were also capable of operating machinery and handling weapons, such as blasters, and were even able to pilot ships, such as X-Wings and TIE Fighters. The two known outbreaks that occurred during this time were on the Star Destroyer, Vector where Blackwing had been reintroduced to sentient hosts, causing the vessel and its former crew to drift in deep space. Ten weeks after the outbreak, the Imperial prison barge Purge that had experienced engine malfunction docked to the Vector and sent two teams to search for engine parts to repair their ship and move on. Soon after the virus infected nearly the entire population of the barge, crew and inmates with a few survivors forced to escape onto the larger vessel. After a series of close calls and more deaths, the survivors escaped the Star Destroyer via a drop shuttle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Other vessels piloted by infected zombies tried to spread the disease from the Vector but failed, as distancing an infected individual from the source of the infection caused the virus to become inactive, and remained drifting in space. One of the vessels eventually crashed landed on Dathomir creating the Quarantine Zone and spreading the infection. Anyone who survived the zone was deemed very lucky."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Han Solo and Chewbacca once visited an uncharted planet which was haunted by dead, living skeletal figures. These zombies were once the 1,000 crew members of a Great Interplanetary Ark that had crashed on the planet some time before.

However, Solo laid down two lines of tandgor gems to light a runway for the ghostly form of the Great Interplanetary Ark to land, finally putting the souls to rest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
