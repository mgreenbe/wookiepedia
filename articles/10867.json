Its basic blueprints, or SpecPlate, had been drawn up by Raith Sienar and designed by Louis Solis. It had been commissioned by Lorth Needa under special orders. It was developed by a team under the Imperial Navy Research, Development and Engineering Center, composed of the Chief Naval Architect Lira Wessex; Chief Project Engineer J. Johnston, Senior Structural Engineer C. Cantwell; Senior Construction Designer S. Gawley; Chief Design Engineer R. McQuarrie; and Systems Engineering Director D. Beasley. Its keel had been laid, with it undergoing a naming ceremony shortly thereafter. Afterwards, it underwent the stepping of the mast, and was launched. It eventually underwent christening of the name Avenger, and had a pre-commission crew man the ship to undergo various trials. It then underwent dock trials, fast cruises, space trails, and contractor fitting out. Eventually, it was delivered to Captain Lorth Needa, and was fitted with an active service crew alongside it undergoing a shakedown cruise before it underwent official commissioning. Upon completion and undergoing its official commissioning ceremony, it had a commemorative SpecPlate placed on the bulkhead until the event where it was stricken from the registry."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Period"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the Avenger's earliest missions was the attack on the CR90 corvette Karinne, carrying a Twi'lek delegation to the Rebel Alliance.
