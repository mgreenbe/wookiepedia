The area was home to the Petranaki Arena, several droid factories and the Separatist command center. The Separatist Alliance used the wide and flat plains between the elevated areas as landing zones for Separatist starships. After the Separatists' failed execution of Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin Skywalker in the Petranaki arena, a portion of the subsequent battle occurred in the Im'g'twe Hills. After the battle and subsequent skirmishes, the Im'g'twe Hills were littered with Separatist and Galactic Republic debris."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
