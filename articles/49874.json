It was a technique of telekinesis that was frequently employed by the Sith and other users of the dark side of the Force, although there were some cases where Jedi or other users of the light side would use the technique."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Force choke was a dark side Force power, meaning that the power was fueled from dark emotions such as fear, anger, and hatred. As the name suggested, the Force choke was used to telekinetically grip, squeeze or crush a victim's throat with the Force and restrict blood circulation or airflow. Some who used the ability demonstrated being able to lift their victim off the ground, holding the victim up by their necks. The technique could also be aimed to break the neck of a victim, either by twisting, bending or crushing it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The power was generally used at close range, but in rare instances the target could be choked at greater distances if they were seen through a viewscreen. However, this power could be applied even if the user did not have a direct line of sight to the target, or even if the target was light-years away, viewed though a holocomm. Upon becoming a victim of the Force ability, a very distinctive sound could be heard resembling a person taking a deep gasp, usually followed by a low pitched bass-sound that ended when the user of the Force choke released their grip. However, there were very many instances of the technique being used without the sound occurring."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Depending on the degree of power applied, the effects of a Force choke on a person would result in either death, unconsciousness, or simply leaving the person gasping for air or unable to speak, with the ability sometimes being employed to incapacitate or subdue rather than to kill. However, the ability could be used to leave a victim mortally wounded even after releasing them, resulting in their death without the user having to do so directly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Force choke was generally used against one target at a time, while in some instances, perhaps involving an increase of dark side power fueled by intense emotions, such as rage, two targets could be grabbed in a Force choke at the same time; Asajj Ventress, and Savage Opress, demonstrated this on different occasions. However, both Darth Sidious and Darth Vader demonstrated the ability to choke at least two separate individuals simultaneously in relatively casual situations. Vader in particular was able to use the ability on numerous people simultaneously, and on one occasion used the ability to crush the throats of five Imperial officers to make a point."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Applications"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Force choke was used to inflict harm or injury for various purposes, such as forcing a person to obey the user's commands. Sometimes it was used simply as an expression of anger or displeasure. Other times, it was used to kill outright. The Force choke was an effective tactic when engaged in lightsaber combat. Related to this, a Force choke could also be used as a display of power."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Users"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Generally, Force choke was used by the Sith and other dark side users like Sixth Brother, Snoke, or Quinlan Vos after he became apprenticed to Dooku. However, despite their strict adherence to the light side of the Force, several Jedi were known to use this power, as although it was considered a dark side ability, it was also a technique of telekinesis.

He used it to an even deadlier effect when he assumed his Sith Lord persona, Darth Vader. Those under his command who failed him and were deemed in his opinion to no longer be worth their weight to the Galactic Empire would be executed in the relatively clean way of being Force choked to death. While many Imperial officers were paralyzed with fear when in the presence of the Dark Lord of the Sith, knowing his tendency to dispose of those who made even the slightest mistake, Vader himself took no pleasure in using the move and even considered it more forgiving than what the Galactic Emperor would do.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the ship Padawans Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee were aboard was infected with the parasitic Geonosis brain worms.

However, the Jedi Masters' attempts to extract that information were unsuccessful. An angry Skywalker decided to take matters into his own hands, and entered Poggle's cell alone. Skywalker attempted to use a mind trick to get Poggle to talk, but it was unsuccessful. Poggle informed Skywalker that mind tricks wouldn't work on Geonosians, as the other Jedi had already discovered. Skywalker angrily knocked him down, telling him that he wouldn't need mind tricks to get him to cooperate. Skywalker then gave in to the dark side and grabbed Poggle using a Force choke, lifting him off the ground and throttling him until he finally explained that the brain worms were vulnerable to cold temperatures.

Vader was convinced that the dark side had made him more powerful than the Emperor; he rejected Amidala's pleas to run away together, and declared that they would rule the galaxy in Sidious' place. Amidala refused to join him moments before Kenobi appeared, causing Vader to give into his anger under the belief that his wife had betrayed him.

Motti mocked Vader, insulting his devotion to the Force, contending that it had not helped him recover the stolen Death Star plans or locate the Rebels' hidden base.

Realizing that they would now have to waste resources in fighting a costly ground battle rather than simply destroying the base from orbit as a result of Ozzel's actions, Vader contacted the admiral from his meditation chamber aboard the Executor. Via a viewscreen, Ozzel announced that the fleet had arrived in the Hoth system, but his report was cut short when Vader began to Force choke the admiral as punishment for his blunder.

Grand Vizier Mas Amedda pulled a blaster on Vader, to which the Sith Lord called him a fool before telekinetically choking Amedda and the Royal Guards.
