However, it was in reality a front for an illegal mining operation. When Calrissian was absent, his RQ protocol droid W1-LE maintained the farmland. Calrissian purchased the farm from the Devaronian crime lord Cikatro Vizago. It was close enough to the refugee camp Tarkintown that, after the camp was destroyed by the Galactic Empire, the smoke plume was visible from the farm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
