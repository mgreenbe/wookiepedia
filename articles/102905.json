At some point, Palabee was taken from her home by members of the Jedi Order to become a Jedi and to have a new and better life. In 19 BBY, Palabee was killed when Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine initiated Order 66, which resulted in the destruction of the Jedi Order. Nipaltoo watched a HoloNet broadcast of Palpatine saying that clone troopers had contained a Jedi insurrection within the Jedi Temple and that the troopers had quelled uprisings on a thousand worlds, something that left Nipaltoo in disbelief. Some time later, Nipaltoo came into contact with Padawan Ferren Barr, a survivor of Order 66, who claimed that Nipaltoo would find justice for Palabee's murder and that to achieve this he had to follow him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
