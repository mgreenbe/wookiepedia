He was born years before 130 ABY into a litter that also included his brother Ahn, and another brother who was known only by their family name, Rasi Tuum. The three littermates were all sensitive to the Force, and they joined the New Jedi Order prior to 130 ABY. Around that year, Zho had long hair that fell past his shoulders and a short beard.

Although Ahn was killed by Sith agents in 137 ABY in the middle of the Second Imperial Civil War, Zho and Rasi Tuum were able to find refuge at a Hidden Jedi Temple on the planet Taivas.

One of the Rasi Tuums appeared and was killed in the second issue, and the character was only revealed to be Ahn two years later in Issue 25, which was also the first source to explicitly mention Zho. The issue established \"Rasi Tuum\" as Zho's family name, but so far, no source has indicated the order in which his family and given names should be placed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
