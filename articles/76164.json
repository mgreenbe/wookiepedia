The insects raised and lowered their abdomen, rapidly shut their mandibles and rubbed antennae together to convey their language. This language was incomprehensible to C-3PO when the Millennium Falcon first encountered the Killiks, and only the Jedi were able to communicate fluently with the alien species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
