When first designing the A/SF-01, engineers at Slayn & Korpil originally wanted to fit the B-wing with an astromech droid, but Quarrie convinced them it would be expensive and problematic trying to incorporate the droid into the starfighter's electrical system. Instead the LpM-549 uses the starfighter's multiple sensor systems to help it make the calculations necessary for hyperspace travel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
