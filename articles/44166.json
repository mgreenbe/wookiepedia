This, combined with their rapid technological development, resulted in a species that not only fought well, but excelled in weapon design and manufacture. Eventually, one Coynite clan learned how to manufacture biological weapons. Whether the action was accidental or intentional is not known, but a dangerous toxin was eventually released. The microbe spread across Coyn, uncontrolled. Anything as simple as a touching of hands could spread the deadly organism. The plague killed over half of the planet's population."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Toral, chief of the strongest clan, realized that the Coynite species was heading toward extinction. He began a series of reforms with his allies and eventually succeeded in not only banishing biological weapons, but also instituted a code of law for the warrior society. Toral's leadership and wisdom united the warring clans under one law and one leader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this time the Coynite established the tradition of no personal contact without express permission first. The effect on the biological toxin was so pronounced that the ban on contact became part of this law.

Toral's son, Arl'Toral, managed to bring peace to the planet. Arl'Toral channeled his people's natural aggressiveness into a ridged code of conduct by revising the En'Tra'Sol."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly thereafter, settlers from Elrood first discovered Coyn. During the early exchanges with these strangers from space, Arl'Toral realized that the best way to ensure peace on Coyn was to turn the Coynite aggressive energies into other pursuits. Thus the first Coynite mercenary units were formed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A summary of the En'Tra'Sol"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
