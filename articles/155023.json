While fending off a Republic assault, this droid encountered a malfunctioning battle droid which had been apprehended by Separatist forces after it had opened fire on its own squad. Despite attempting to restore the droid's original programing, the malfunctioning unit identified as \"Bats\" proceeded to resist and destroyed a pair of nearby guards. Just as this tactical droid ordered the destruction of the malfunctioning droid, a stolen Armored Assault Tank crashed into the garrison piloted by Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and Clone Captain Rex. During this massive diversion, the tactical droid was attacked and destroyed by \"Bats\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
