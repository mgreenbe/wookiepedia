It was visited mostly by miners and once by Lando Calrissian in 4 BBY. Lando's droid companion at the time, Vuffi Raa, had to wait outside because droids were not allowed inside. It had a bar running down the left side of the building with booths lining the opposite wall. On the walls hung paintings and scenes from sporting events from around the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
