In large part because of this, the Advanced X-wing was supplied with similar modifications to its hull as the Heavy-95 before finalizing the latter fighter design. The improved heat handling and increased mass capacity made the Advanced X-wing a better choice for X-wing pilots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several Advanced X-wing starfighters were awarded to Rebel agents for escorting and protecting representatives of the Civilian Protection Guild on Kashyyyk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
