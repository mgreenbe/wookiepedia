She entered the cave through a gaping hole in the ceiling, covered in black vines, but fell through to an underground lake. Upon reaching the wall of the cave, Rey began to see herself mirrored many times over. She placed her hand up to the mirrored surface, hoping to find an answer to her past. Two dark figures appeared and morphed into one. The surface unfogged and displayed the face of Rey. Distraught that she was unable to find any information about her parents here, Rey left the cave defeated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
