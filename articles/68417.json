He later placed a hefty death mark on Han Solo, a former employee of his, after Solo lost a load of spice to an Imperial patrol vessel. He would finally get his revenge on Solo when the carbonite-encased Corellian was delivered to him by Boba Fett, one of the many bounty hunters Jabba was known to employ.

The gang war would continue for nearly three decades until 33 BBY, when Jabba, with Bib Fortuna, Ephant Mon and Diva Shaliqua, had a clandestine meeting with Magister Hego Damask II on Sojourn. Damask was secretly the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Plagueis, but Jabba demanded that he end his and elements of the InterGalactic Banking Clan's support for Gardulla. In exchange, Jabba offered information on the Bando Gora terrorist syndicate that had been targeting the leadership of some of the shipping cartels Plagueis backed: Komari Vosa, believed dead after a disastrous mission to Baltizaar and the former Padawan of Jedi Master Dooku, was alive and had come to lead the cult.

Plagueis was able to escape the conspirators' bombardment of Sojourn undetected and was rescued by Jabba's yacht Star Jewel. Perhaps coincidentally, Jabba had also played a small part in the acquisition of the nuclear device used against Plagueis: Darth Sidious had sent his own apprentice, Darth Maul, to the Cog Hive Seven prison to retrieve the weapon from the arms dealer Iram Radique, with the eventual aim of delivering it to the Bando Gora so it could be used to kill his master. When Jabba had attacked the prison with the Star Jewel, Maul was able to escape (with the aid of Komari Vosa) aboard Jabba's ship, whereupon he passed the weapon on to Vosa.

To Jabba's surprise, it said the winner would be Gasgano, whereas Jabba's droid, R5-X2, showed Sebulba would come in first, Gasgano in second, and Mawhonic in third; the droid also favored Gardulla's former slave, Anakin Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the race began, Jabba hosted Gardulla as his guest as he presided over the race.

His involvement with the Confederacy was discovered by Republic informant Raala Ponchar, but battle droids under the command of the Dark Acolyte Saato captured her and she was imprisoned in his palace. When the Jedi Council learned of Ponchar's disappearance, they sent Anakin Skywalker to investigate. Jabba, however, quickly learned of Anakin's presence on Tatooine and his intentions after he was tipped off by Aurra Sing, and posted a bounty on Anakin's head.

One of the reasons Jabba accepted Boba was to repay the favor Jango Fett did him by killing Gardulla the Hutt a decade earlier.

Count Dooku and the CIS kidnapped Jabba's son, allowed the Jedi to get him back, and employed lies, a secret video, and an all-out assault to get him back and to curry the crime lord's favor. Ultimately, the Jedi proved victorious and eventually earned Jabba's trust for a time, thus allowing his Empire to ally with the Republic against the CIS during the war.

He reasoned that if Greedo's blood matched the sample that he found on Coruscant, then it will prove that the Rodian was involved in the kidnapping. No sooner did Jabba did permit a blood sample to be taken, did Greedo spill that he was working for the Separatists. He then led the Pantorans to Mos Eisley, where one of the girls was located. During another time, Jabba hired bounty hunter Cad Bane to get information about the Senate building. After Bane's success, Jabba talked to the Hutt Council to see if Ziro should be released from prison. The Hutts hired Bane and he succeeded.

This depiction of Jabba went on to appear in two additional issues of the Marvel Comics-issued Star Wars series. Although no official retcon has addressed this issue, Abel G. Pe\u00f1a, a Star Wars author who has fit other continuity problems from the Marvel series into Star Wars canon, has suggested that the discrepancy between Jabba's Nimbanel appearance and his canonical depiction as a slug-like creature can be explained by retconning \"Jabba the Hut\" into actually being Mosep Binneed, Jabba the Hutt's Nimbanel accountant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although not present in the final version of Star Wars, Jabba is mentioned several times in the film as being owed a large sum of credits by Han Solo.

Philpott has described the interior as smelling like a fine collection of fumes of lubricants, paints, and glues. For several weeks, he and Barclay would spend most of a day inside the puppet, where they had access to a single headset and a monitor showing them a view of the puppet's exterior.
