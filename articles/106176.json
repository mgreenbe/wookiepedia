Plevitz also noted that while the Zeltrons lacked concern for any military defense of their homeworld of Zeltros, they usually kept themselves physically fit. As a result, if a Zeltron found no other way to show their passion, they could become a fierce and dangerous warrior."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plevitz was first mentioned in the comic One of a Kind, when the Plevitz Essential Guide to Species was quoted a number of times throughout the comic's story.
