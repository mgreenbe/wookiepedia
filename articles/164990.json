However, as she pointed out when they approached it, it was deactivated upon their arrival. Tyce further explained that that meant that the tower was no longer transmitting a signal. Finn discovered that the nav signal had been transferred to come from the Final Order's command ship, the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Steadfast.
