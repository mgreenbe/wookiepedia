The Hutt sent his retainers, the Max Rebo Band, to Hoth to perform at Mehndra's Spawning Day party. Unbeknownst to Mehndra, the band's sound equipment was rigged to explode at the end of the concert. The explosion destroyed Mehndra's base, presumably killing him and most of his gang. The Max Rebo Band would have died as well, had they not substituted a hologram of a concert on Orto for a live performance after Droopy McCool discovered the thermite explosives in their speakers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
