Imperials operated from the Treinhaus Citadel, which the New Republic attacked with ground forces as well as air support from General Hera Syndulla's battle group's Vanguard Squadron and eventually Meteor Squadron and Hail Squadron. After days of brutal fighting, including orbital bombardment and precision strikes from Syndulla's fleet, the Treinhaus Citadel was heavily damaged, missing most of the eastern wall. Alphabet Squadron was sent in to patrol the battlefields surrounding the now ruined Treinhaus Citadel to prevent Imperials from retaking the citadel while New Republic salvage teams attempted to recover data. Alphabet Squadron defended the citadel for sixteen hours, flying over the wreckage of speeders, troop carriers, walkers, and other vehicles to fend off infantry units, TIE fighters, and TIE/sa bombers. After hours of patrols, the data was recovered and the New Republic forces returned to their ships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
