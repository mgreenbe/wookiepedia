Such meetings of Iyra from both sexes of a single caste occurred twice each local year. The species's courtship behavior included virtuoso displays of color changing by the males and aquatic dances by the females. Couples attracted by such performances copulated, the male placing a specialized tentacle into the female and fertilizing the eggs inside her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Iyra breeding grounds are mentioned in Galaxy Guide 4: Alien Races, a sourcebook written by Troy Denning for West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published in 1989.
