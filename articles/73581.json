During her training however, Kalifa was abducted by Trandoshan hunters and taken to the Trandoshan moon, Wasskah, where she was tirelessly hunted by her captors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Entering into the academy, Kalifa became part of a clan of several other Jedi Initiates as she attended classes and studied the arts of the Jedi. Approaching the end of her training at the academy at the start of the Clone Wars, Kalifa was away from Coruscant when she was abducted by Trandoshan slavers and transported to the moon of Wasskah along with fellow Initiates O-Mer and Jinx."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Released into the wilds of Island Four, the three Initiates evaded their captors, who constantly hunted them for sport. Sleeping in caves and tree hollows by night, the group was constantly on the move to avoid being tracked. Over the course of their imprisonment, they encountered at least one captured Padawan who eventually got themselves killed by the Trandoshans trying to confront them. Kalifa and her fellows were forced to forsake the Jedi role of protectors. If they tried to help the other prisoners, they would all certainly be killed. It wasn't until the Padawan Ahsoka Tano was captured and brought to the moon that the Initiates began to remember their training and take the offensive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Searching for the Trandoshan base, the four Jedi-in-training were ambushed and divided into two groups. As Tano and Kalifa raced into the jungle, they were followed by a young Trandoshan hunter, Dar, who managed to send Kalifa tumbling into the underbrush. Dar was then granted the kill opportunity by his father and pursued the two Force-sensitives. After a brief bout of hand-to-hand combat, the two Jedi managed to impale the Trandoshan on a jungle plant. As Tano helped Kalifa to her feet, Kalifa was struck in the back with a blaster bolt by a vengeful Garnac through the heart and collapsed. Taking cover, Tano stood with Kalifa as her life faded, promising to protect the others and lead them off the planet. When Kalifa was dead, Tano raced off, leaving her body on top of the crook of a tree root."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kalifa appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode \"Padawan Lost\", where she was voiced by Gwendoline Yeo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
