These cluster bombs released a burst of shrapnel in the initial detonation, followed by a cloud of magnetized grenades, and were highly effective against the massed, unshielded starfighters employed by the Galactic Empire. These weapons were common on Mon Calamari cruisers, but could also be seen on EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigates and CR90 corvettes. Each CL-3 consisted of preliminary charges, the main bomb, a bomb thruster to propel the shrapnel and grenades, breakaway explosive dampeners, and the outer blister shell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
