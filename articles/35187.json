They were mainly used to store encrypted data. Revan and Malak stored encrypted information in a datacron and hid it on Rekkiad in the Twin Spears along with Mandalore's Mask. Canderous Ordo and a redeemed Revan later returned with other Mandalorians to take Mandalore's Mask back."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Datacrons are small cubes hidden throughout the universe of Star Wars: The Old Republic. They grant bonus points to a single stat or a matrix shard. Datacrons glow and emit a pillar of colored light into the sky making them more visible.
