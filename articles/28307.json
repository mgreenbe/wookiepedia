He eventually became the Padawan of the Fillithar Jedi Master Simmix. Vitus deeply cared for his master, and found him to be a kind and understanding Jedi, but the Padawan sometimes complained that Simmix could be reckless with his own life. Simmix countered, often amused by this, that Vitus had enough caution for the both of them."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Eiram\u2013E'ronoh crisis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his time as Simmix\u2019s Padawan, Vitus, his master, now Padawan Jareni and her master, Laret Soveral, were asked to intervene in the burgeoning Eiram\u2013E'ronoh crisis. It was the first mission for both Padawans and the two of them were elated to be allowed to fly the A-1 shuttle given to the team. This was because it was both a departure from more mundane tasks Padawans normally performed and a sign of confidence in their abilities. During their approach into the system, their masters were together in the passenger area of the craft in deep meditation. The Padawans detected an apparent distress call from a survivor of Monarch Cassel\u2019s ship, and Vitus automatically steered the shuttle toward the call. Master Soveral entered the cabin and demanded to know what had happened. Upon being filled in on the situation, the master grimly commented that the signal had only come from the ship, not a survivor. The shuttle was then shot down and crashed onto the surface of the lost moon that sat between the two planets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the crash, Vitus quickly awakened, and made sure that Jareni was alright. He then tried to sense the two masters, but only Master Soveral came to him in the Force, leading to him panicking and rushing to try and find his master. However, Soveral found him and told him solemnly that Simmix had unfortunately died in the crash. Vitus still moved past her, and eventually found the corpse of his master, overcome with enormous grief and personal guilt. The shuttle\u2019s safety harnesses hadn\u2019t been designed for limbless beings like the Fillithar, and despite Vitus pointing that out, Simmix had not been concerned."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Distraught, but informed by Soveral that they had to keep moving, the team left the crash site and entered into a nearby cave system. Upon noting the large snake carvings along the wall, Vitus tried to focus and partly explained their origin of tying into local tales of giant serpents. It was then that the group was attacked by a white serpent, and the Jedi succeeded in dispatching it. Vitus remained frustrated, realizing that his master\u2019s urgings to learn more about local myths and legends had a purpose, since such tales always had a kernel of truth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi were forced to press on, and after dispatching six of the large snakes, Master Soveral took point to lead them forward while the two Padawans were allowed to talk in relative private. Vitus fumed to his friend about the lack of mourning practices in the Jedi Order, and the unrealistic expectations placed on one\u2019s emotions. Despite Jareni\u2019s efforts to soothe him, he sharply proclaimed these practices as wrong, and the conversation cooled. Vitus became slightly embarrassed, aware he had been snapping at his friend and his various emotions were easily sensed in the Force by his fellow Jedi. Seeking to better represent his now deceased master\u2019s teachings, he calmed himself down and proceeded with the group."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon, the trio of Jedi came to the hideout of the Lasat gangster Isamer, and sprung into action to save the two captured monarchs. Unfortunately, while the group followed procedure, this allowed the Lasat criminal to shoot at the two royals. Monarch Cassel lept in the way of the shot to save his fellow captive, and died moments later. As he watched the Queen Consort Thandeka cry over the body of her departed savior, Vitus felt intense envy that she was capable of mourning openly, while he was unable to.

He had decided to take up a post at the Starlight Beacon to study the cultures of the unknown or newly discovered societies in the new frontier. To reach the Beacon though, he found himself traveling with three other Jedi, Padawan Reath Silas, Jedi Knight Dez Rydan, and his old friend, now Jedi Wayseeker, Orla Jareni, as they were all bound for the same destination. The two friends briefly commented on the change in their lives, and that they were returning to that same fateful area of space from a quarter of a century ago. The starship that had been hired for the mission, however, was unavailable, resulting in a last-minute replacement in the form of the Vessel, crewed by Captain Leox Gyasi, co-pilot Affie Hollow, and navigator Geode."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon boarding the ship, Vitus used his robe\u2019s hood as a shield, as he worked hard to hide the emotions that flickered on his face while internally, he maintained order in the chaos. He expressed disquiet at returning to the area of space that had so long ago changed him from a Padawan to a Jedi in mere hours, as the well of emotions that came with those memories was difficult for him to handle. He hoped, however, that he would be able to set his feelings at peace through this voyage. The Vessel then entered hyperspace, and later, Cohmac Vitus was sitting near Dez Rydan and Reath Silas as the younger Jedi discussed a conversation Silas had had with Affie Hollow. Vitus was somewhat distracted as he continued to ponder his choice to go out to the frontier, thinking about his own traits and thought process, commented on by others as being precise, with a focus on reason and logic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When he attempted to leave, Padawan Silas asked him how his activities as a folklorist worked, and he provided an explanation while gazing out of one of the ship\u2019s small viewports. He stated that while some tales were readily shared, it was often difficult to acquire stories meant to stay internal to a community, or darker tales that people did not wish to share. These words immediately turned his mind back to the events of the Crisis, but he continued on and added that every species was different. He offered the strategy of studying a group\u2019s art, as from that legends emerged to explain imagery in the work. He then pondered saying more as the two younger Jedi spoke, but he mused that he had learned to limit his words as he was aware he could readily say too much."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was at this point that the Great Disaster began, the event echoing through the Force and affecting all of the Jedi aboard the Vessel. The ship itself was suddenly hit with debris from the destroyed Legacy Run while in hyperspace, forcing repairs conducted by Silas and Hollow. The craft then exited hyperspace in an unknown region of space near a volatile star. Vitus was able to sense that many had died, joining the other Jedi in their shared shock and pain. The Jedi all moved to the communications area to contact the Starlight Beacon, joining the ship\u2019s crew. There, they learned the extent of the disaster, multiple signals from across the galaxy overlapping. However, a broadcast from the Galactic Republic cut through the panic and called on all hyperspace travel to cease due to the dangers of using it. Vitus then left the group, but when the ship received a message from a signal beacon, Orla Jareni and Reath Silas went to fetch him after the Wayseeker advised caution. Jareni, however, was shaken, and as the closest to a \u201chead monk\u201d in the group, Vitus returned to the bridge with Silas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There, he oversaw the assessment of their situation, asking for identification of the different ships stranded around them and helping to better ascertain why the ship that originally sent the beacon was so difficult to scan (as it was a mix of many different parts). After contact was initially made with Nan and Hague\u2019s ship, Cohmac Vitus took over the call to give her instructions before turning off the call. However, the Force tugged at him, as he sensed something undiscovered, and asked for the Vessel's scans to widen. This revealed an ancient space station and Cohmac directed the other eleven starships to take refuge around it and it\u2019s shields due to the nearby volatile star."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Darkness aboard the station"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the station proved safe to enter, Master Vitus stood with Wayseeker Jareni, Knight Rydan, Padawan Silas and crewmate Hollow to welcome apparent refugees Nan and her guardian Hague, whose ship had been rescued by the Vessel\u2019s crew and was the first to dock. Cohmac Vitus spoke with Hague about getting settled, and moved to lead boarding affairs. However, Orla Jareni lured him away from his duties, telling him to delegate, in order to investigate the mysterious statues and technologies the boarding team had found. Jareni knew exactly what sort of teases would get Vitus\u2019 attention, specifically mentioning unknown languages, and the two moved off to investigate. Jareni then directly addressed the parallels to their current situation and their first mission years ago but was stopped by the sudden feeling of the shadow and accompanying chill reported earlier by Silas and Rydan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short time later, the pair were standing in the central sphere of the station, Vitus dissecting the appearance of the idols while Jareni provided her own suggestions. He noted that the design was not unlike that of the ancient Kubaz, but their star system was so distant that it could be coincidence. Jareni commented that they might not be gods, instead monarchs or historical leaders, which Vitus had considered. He ultimately settled on the educated guess that the beings were gods. Just then, another chill accompanying a breeze wafted over them, and the pair discussed what might be happening. Moving to check the nearby corridor, concerned a dark force was approaching them, Orla Jareni was instead suddenly sucked into an intense Force vision. Cohmac Vitus was similarly pulled into an intense vision, and fell into the surrounding vegetation. He came out of his vision soon after, and told Jareni with great clarity that the vision had been a warning."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orla Jareni helped Cohmac Vitus to his feet, and the two returned to the wider station. By the time they reached Reath Silas and Dez Rydan, a battle had broken out onboard between the passengers and crews of the newly arriving ships, who were looting supplies, and a few were even attempting to seize others for unsavory purposes. Master Vitus was able to stand on his own and he rushed to action, leaping through the air to the upper levels. There, he engaged the Orincans, a species from one of the docked ships. Due to his concerns about stray blaster bolts rickoeting around the station due to possible magnetic seals, he carefully reflected the bolts fired at him into nearby tree trunks and other vegetation. This show of ability caused the plunderers to retreat, and allowed Vitus a moment to get his bearings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Realizing that he and Wayseeker Jareni would be insicicent in using their martial skills to help defuse the situation (as the looters could easily run away in the large, round space), he chose to commit an act of awe. He jumped through the air into the atrium, which caused Affie Hollow to scream, but through the use of the Force he was able to levitate himself eight meters in the air. He called attention to himself, his voice echoing clearly in the atrium space, and he ordered that in the name of the Republic everyone was to cease their criminal activities immediately. He added that in fifteen minutes, either every captain had to have their passengers and crews onboard their ships and leave, or be ready to cooperate peacefully. He finished his speech with a vague threat that everyone had to follow the laws of the Republic on this station, or else everyone would have to make a choice. His words and actions worked, and while the crews did peacefully return to the airlock level, Vitus knew the peace he\u2019d brought was only a brief reprieve."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Complications on the station"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short time later, Cohmac Vitus and Dez Rydan were discussing the visions had by the two older Jedi. Vitus described his vision as his conscience being removed to someplace different, where he was looking down into a terrible abyss that filled his soul with an aching anguish. Dez continued to press for information, asking if the artifacts may have triggered the event, which Vitus carefully considered possible. He said that there were legends of objects imbued with the powers of the dark side, but that all legend was rooted in some truth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dez then switched to suggesting that the darkness was instead coming from the plants if it was not the idols. However, Master Vitus outright rejected this, openly scoffing and stating he had encountered trees steeped in the dark side before. This darkness, he added, was different, and seemed to be a power with a focused intelligence, which surprised Dez. The Jedi scholar further postulated that the statues were a warning of the darkness, which Dez asked what they could do about. Vitus replied that for now, nothing, as they needed to shelter from the hyperspace disaster gripping the galaxy, and that they were functionally trapped with the darkness onboard. Dez then told the other Jedi to take it easy for a time, while he left to find Reath Silas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following this, after a criminal ship had been made to detach from the station, and supplies were being equally distributed, Cohmac Vitus stepped away to center himself. He found a space at the back of the Vessel away from the other members of the group, and knelt on a makeshift meditation mat to begin. He repeated a common mantra he\u2019d embraced over the years: \u201cI behold the world within myself. I behold the world without myself.\u201d He then began to consider the darkness aboard the station, and what its source could be. He pondered on the lack of Jedi insight into the darkness, and then considered the violence of separating dark from light, and if that itself created darkness. Some time later, after an effort had been made by a mixed group of the station\u2019s residents, Orla Jareni found Cohmac Vitus in further meditation on the Vessel\u2018s observation deck. The two entered a more in-depth discussion than before about the parallels between the present and their shared past from the Eiram\u2013E'ronoh crisis. However, they did not get far into their talk before the pair of them were thrown into another intense, terrifying vision."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of this vision, the four Jedi grouped within the Vessel\u2019s tiny communication\u2019s area, Reath Silas having also experienced a vision and the need to address the threat having grown too significant to put off any longer. Jareni gave them a rundown of what they knew about the darkness on board of the station and agreed with Master Vitus\u2019 assessment of the idols as keeping a darkness sealed within, with a psychic warning seal placed over them. Vitus corrected Padawan Silas\u2019 belief that the Force only comes from life and that the artifacts had to be Sith in origin, as he stated that others had held powers in the Force. Jareni asked for options of what they should do, with Vitus affirming his belief that they needed to do something soon, as Affie Hollow\u2019s explorations of the station had revealed frequent visitation by traders, which could result in one of them accidentally freeing the darkness. However, Knight Rydan\u2019s comment on a possible connection between the shadow and the lower areas of the station caused Jareni to instruct him to find a way for his group to make their way down there successfully (as the last attempt had involved the station\u2019s 8-T droids attacking them, and Affie Hollow poisoned)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, Cohmac Vitus was with Leox Gyasi and Geode in the cockpit of the Vessel when he felt a disturbance in the Force, indicating that something was wrong. He immediately rushed out of the ship followed by Gyasi, and they encountered the distraught group who had attempted to breach the lower level again but had now fled back to the wider station. His emotions were destabilized as he realized what had happened to Dez Rydan, and harangued himself for not sensing what the similarities between his past and now present could have meant for the mission. After learning more information about the accident, he bluntly stated the likely truth, that Rydan had been vaporized, and upon reaching out in the Force, he could feel nothing of the Jedi Knight. A few minutes later, Cohmac Vitus boarded the Vessel and retreated to his cabin to meditate, his disrupted emotional state clearly felt by his friend Orla Jareni."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Final preparations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after this meeting, the refugees aboard the Amaxine station received word from the Republic that hyperlanes were conditionally open, with enough information fed to starships by the Republic to allow for essential travel. Master Vitus joined a meeting of Padawan Silas, Wayseeker Jareni, Captain Gyasi and co-pilot Hollow in the comm area of the ship, where he remained withdrawn, allowing Reath Silas to speak on the essentials of Force artifacts. The group ultimately affirmed that the idols were Force containers, as well as with Master Vitus\u2019 belief that they should be removed from the station. Vitus finally spoke and suggested a binding ritual should be performed on the idols to make sure the darkness contained within stayed that way during transport. The other two Jedi agreed, and the group ultimately separated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After this meeting though, Jareni went to confront Cohmac Vitus, feeling he was neglecting his duties and allowing the death of Dez Rydan to impact him more than was natural. Vitus began to rail against the death of Dez Rydan, and how it didn\u2019t feel right for him to overcome the anger within him, and that the young Knight should be openly mourned. After some further prodding from Jareni, Vitus openly admitted the ties between these present feelings with those he had held onto since his past. However, despite Jareni\u2019s efforts to affirm both Jedi teachings, and the fact that everyone had shared responsibility that day for what went wrong, Vitus was not swayed from his position. He then disengaged in the conversation, to focus on continued preparations for the binding exercise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time after this, he, Padawan Silas, and Wayseeker Jareni went into the center of the Amaxine station\u2019s central sphere and commenced their binding ritual on the idols.

As they flew through the rocky journey, he and Orla Jareni stood in the cargo bay keeping an eye on the mysterious idols. He answered Orla\u2019s questions about how rough the trip was with an explanation provided by what information he knew of the effects of the disaster and the Republic\u2019s solution to it. By this time, his inner anger and lack of balance had calmed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He joined with the other Jedi as a distress call was received by the Vessel, and affirmed that the craft should respond to it. He then joined Jareni and Silas in their plunge onboard the heavily damaged passenger ship Journeyman once the Vessel had exited hyperspace and attached itself to the larger ship. Donning a breath mask, Vitus rushed through the burning ship to reach the main loading bay. Once there, he shouted to be taken to the escape pod doors and dislodged debris keeping the ship\u2019s passengers from accessing the pods. Realizing he could not return on the path he\u2019d come, he joined the throng moving to the escape pods and contacted the Vessel to learn the progress of the rest of his team.

He informed them of the death of Dez Rydan, as well as the events of their time onboard the Amaxine station, in a calm and nearly droid-like fashion. Internally however, he was enraged at both his tone, and the lack of mourning from any of the Council members. He almost asked them if they had no more emotion to share beyond the brief moment of sadness. However, he controlled his internal outburst, and left."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, he joined Wayseeker Jareni, and Masters Poreht La, Tia Mirabel, and Giktoo Nelmo at the Shrine in the Depths to handle the Force containers which had been moved to the site from the Vessel by Jareni. He then entered a deep trance with these idols as they surrounded the idols. The connection was profound, and they were all in a deep harmony that would allow them to best combat whatever darkness lay within the idols. However, upon removing the Force barrier around the idols, the group learned there was nothing present, and instead, the idols had been keeping a darkness contained aboard the ancient station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vitus was deeply dismayed at the mistake, though others attempted to alleviate the guilt he and Wayseeker Jareni were experiencing. He struggled to calm himself, and tried to proceed to the next step, returning the idols to the station and re-establishing containment. Instead, the Council wanted to wait and take their time to establish a proper team, to prevent any further loss of life. Cohmac promptly shouldered the responsibility of taking the idols to a secure location, but once the other Jedi had left him and Orla Jareni, he confided in her his intention to fix their mistake."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cohmac then went to recruit Reath Silas to their cause, finding him in the Jedi Archives and explaining the situation to him. He rapidly recruited the young Padawan, who was already eager to fix his own mistake as he\u2019d since learned that Nan and Hague were both Nihil. Cohmac also knew this, but his focus was on returning the idols. The pair of Jedi went to the crew of the Vessel to hire them for the mission, but upon arrival were initially dismayed to hear that the ship had already been hired by another party.

By the piloting expertise of Leox Gyasi, the Vessel was attached to a nearby small asteroid, effectively hiding the starship from the larger vessel. Vitus complimented the captain on his quick maneuver, and worked to discuss options for their successful docking with the station outside of the view of the larger, menacing, ship. It was Geode who proposed the plan, and when executed, resulted in the Vessel orbiting on the opposite side of the station from the Nihil ship. But, as boarding still needed to be accomplished, Cohmac Vitus joined Orla Jareni, Affie Hollow and Reath Silas in donning exosuits to leave their ship and float down to the Amaxine station. The group then exited the Vessel and used their thrusters to reach the airlock, with the three Jedi using the Force to pull the idols to safety, and into the station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once aboard, the darkness the Jedi had been sensing before was overwhelming, and the group split up to handle their mutual assignments. As Jareni and Vitus walked together, Jareni commented on the rapid spread of the darkness, and Vitus agreed with her. She further commented that the visions they had seen before had a strange familiarity to them now, but she dismissed it before the two of them headed into the dense brush. As they walked, Vitus brought up the clay warriors of Zardossa Stix, which Jareni had heard of, but his mention of them at that particular moment put her on edge. Vitus speculated that the idols were keeping an army in place due to the nature of what they were feeling in the Force around them, though Jareni couldn\u2019t see an army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the two were suddenly approached by plantlike beings, the Drengir, who expressed pleasure at having encountered meat. The pair were gradually surrounded by the creatures, and an oppressive sensation in the Force itself settled over them.

Vitus sliced through a whip of thorns that had been directed at him, severing the tendril but it continued to slither on the ground.

Landing awkwardly due her damaged leg, she joined Vitus in deflecting the probes of the Drengir while backing up, bringing the Drengir to a point directly beneath the collapsing bower. The architecture, drenched in vegetation, ultimately fell right on top of the Drengir, temporarily waylaying them. When they sought to cut themselves free, they damaged the vegetation which resulted in swarms of 8-Ts descending on them as they were perceived as harming the station\u2019s plant life. Jareni and Vitus watched on before centering themselves and formed a new Force container out of the idols sitting in the atrium. The act appeared like a green flash to the Jedi, and its effect was instantaneous, the Drengir melting into the vegetation of the station.

After alerting the other Nihil on the station of the Jedi, a group soon closed in on their position as the Nihil vessel was directly moored to the airlock ring. However, a grenade thrown by Affie Hollow disrupted the Nihil\u2019s charge, allowing Master Vitus and Wayseeker Jareni to charge forward themselves.

While Jareni engaged a pair of Nihil wielding energized polearms, Vitus used the Force to grab and swing a metal beam through the legs of the main Nihil group, causing many of them to fall over. The Nihil then retreated, and the two senior Jedi went to regroup with Silas and Hollow.

Vitus accompanied Rydan back to the airlock that the Vessel was now docked at, but just before he entered the ship, he saw the form of Geode receding down the station hallway into the chaos.

Shortly after his departure, Silas vented the arboretum into space, while also launching all of the hyperspace-capable pods.
