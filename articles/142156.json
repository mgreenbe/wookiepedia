The pair took the cruiser to the planet Zanbar, where the Separatists attacked a Shadow Collective rendezvousing there with Maul. Tey-Zuka remained on the ship during the battle, in which both sides sustained heavy casualties and Maul escaped. Grievous and Tey-Zuka were able to pursue Maul to the planet Ord Mantell where they again attacked the Shadow Collective.
