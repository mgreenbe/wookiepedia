Following the foundation of the New Mandalorians, the pacifist sect rejected the authority of the clan-chosen Mandalores, and instead appointed their own leaders in opposition to those who ruled the warrior clans. The Death Watch, in turn, appointed their own Secret Mandalores in opposition to both the New Mandalorians and the unaffiliated warrior clans. During this period of social division in the Mandalorian culture, the traditionally chosen Mand'alor of the clans became known as the \"True Mandalore\", as a means of countering the claims of the New Mandalorian and Death Watch leaders.

When the previous Mandalore fell or stepped down, a Mandalorian with both vision and strength could make a claim for the title, but if the other clans did not accept the individual as the new Mand'alor and recognize their authority, their duty was to remove the unsuitable claimant and institute a more favorable leader. The significance of the Mand'alor's role in Mandalorian society was so great that one of the Resol'nare\u2014the six basic tenets that defined Mandalorian culture\u2014detailed the importance of loyalty toward the Mand'alor, and rallying to the Mandalorian leader when called upon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to being the leader of the Mandalorian people, the Mand'alor was the de facto leader of the planet Mandalore, the Mandalorian homeworld with which the title shared its Basic-translated name.

Mandalorians referred to their leader either by title or by name, when on an informal basis. Non-Mandalorians, however, often addressed the Mand'alor by the formal title of \"Lord Mandalore\" when wishing to be respectful. During times of war, the Mand'alor was expected to serve as a strong leader on the battlefield. During times of peace, it was the Mandalore's duty to liaise with the various clan chieftains who comprised a loose government, over which only the Mand'alor held greater authority in traditional Mandalorian society, in order to make decisions concerning the planet Mandalore, Mandalorian space, and Mandalorians living throughout the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Taung race was driven from Coruscant by the Human Battalions of Zhell in the years prior to the foundation of the Galactic Republic, they fled to the planet Roon.

By this time, the position of Mand'alor was symbolized by the war mask of Mandalore, passed down to a successor when the previous leader perished. With an army of Mandalorian Crusaders, Mandalore led his warriors on a campaign to conquer new worlds that put him into conflict with the newly anointed Sith Lord, Ulic Qel-Droma. Mandalore was defeated in single combat on Kuar by the former Jedi, and thus pledged his service and the service of his warriors to the Sith. The Mandalorians engaged the Republic on behalf of the Brotherhood of the Sith, culminating in the battle at Onderon, where Mandalore fell, and a new warrior claimed his mask and the title of Mand'alor. Indomitable's successor, Mandalore the Ultimate, reorganized the Mandalorian warriors according to the Neo-Crusader movement, and led the Mandalorians into the Mandalorian Wars with the Republic, during which he conquered vast expanses of the galaxy. But Mandalore the Ultimate met his match in the rogue Jedi Knight Revan, who slew the Mand'alor on Malachor V and defeated the Neo-Crusader army.

Banding together under the banner of Clan Ordo, Mandalore the Preserver's assembled warriors aided Meetra Surik in battling against the forces of the Sith Triumvirate during the Dark Wars. However, in spite of Ordo's attempts to reunite the clans, the Mandalorians remained predominantly fragmented for several centuries. That all changed when a young Mandalorian gladiator rose to fame on the planet Geonosis: defeating all of his opponents with the help of Imperial Intelligence agents in the employ of the reconstituted Sith Empire, the gladiator used his notoriety to claim the title of Mand'alor. As the leader who became known as Mandalore the Lesser, the new Mand'alor rallied the widespread Mandalorian forces, but did so in accordance with the orders of his Sith masters. He blockaded the Hydian Way trade route, but was defeated by a contingent of smugglers. In an effort to regain support, Mandalore the Lesser initiated the galaxy-wide competition for glory known as the Great Hunt, only to be challenged by the victor, and killed. The Great Hunt's champion, Artus Lok, took the title of Mand'alor for himself, consolidating his power and defeating a pro-Republic Mandalorian schism led by Jicoln Cadera. Under the title \"Mandalore the Vindicated,\" Artus ensured the Mandalorians remained allies of the Sith, albeit cautious and highly paid ones. Mandalore the Vindicated later died in battle against the forces of the Eternal Empire, and the famed Mandalorian bounty hunter Shae Vizla reluctantly took up the absent mantle, becoming \"Mandalore the Avenger\" as she led the fight against the Eternal Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Long after the reign of Mandalore the Avenger, the Mandalorian training master Jaing attempted to bring several Mandalorian clans under his guidance. However, by that time, a ruthless Mandalorian by the name of Ung Kusp asserted himself as Mandalore.

Jaing's apprentice, the Gen'Dai warrior known as Durge, vowed to avenge his fallen master and developed an intense hatred for the Mandalorian people. Durge's thirst for revenge led him to ally with a rogue group of Jedi Knights in 100 BBY, on a vengeful strike against the Mand'alor as retaliation for the Mandalorian genocide of the Ithullan race. The mercenary Aga Awaud returned home to Mandalore at the end of the New Sith Wars, only to find that his clan had been ravaged by the Candorian plague and the Mandalore sector was on the defensive against raiders and pirates. He rallied his scattered people to return and defend Mandalore, becoming \"Mandalore the Uniter\" as he rebuilt Mandalorian space.

Determined to reform the increasingly amoral ways of the Mandalorian warrior clans since the destruction of the Ithullans, Mereel established the Supercommando Codex, guidelines dictating that any Mandalorian who wished to fight would behave as an honorable mercenary. Mereel's reforms were met with opposition both from the pacifistic New Mandalorian faction\u2014who rejected the traditional authority of the Mandalores chosen by the warrior clans, often referred to during this time as \"True Mandalores,\" instead appointing their own Mand'alor\u2014and, more dangerously, by Tor Vizsla, who hated Mereel for stealing power over the Mandalorians away from him. With talk of returning the Mandalorians to their crusading roots and igniting another war of conquest, Vizsla gathered like-minded warriors to form the splinter group that came to be known as Death Watch, declaring himself the Mand'alor in secret. Mereel's loyal soldiers recast themselves as the \"True Mandalorians\" in turn, and civil war soon broke out. Mereel was killed by Vizsla during the course of the war, but the Mand'alor was succeeded by his surrogate son, Jango Fett. Fett led the Mandalorians throughout the rest of the war until the Battle of Galidraan, where the Death Watch deceived a team of Jedi into destroying the True Mandalorian army; Fett was the only survivor, but his subsequent stint as a slave courtesy of the Governor of Galidraan, and the loss of his comrades, made Fett bitter and distant from his people.

In the wake of Jango Fett's death in 22 BBY, the Mandalorian warrior clans were left without a proper Mand'alor. Pre Vizsla, kinsman of Tor Vizsla and the new leader of the Death Watch in hiding by 22 BBY, believed that he was in fact continuing the tradition of the Mand'alor in the face of the political dominance established by the New Mandalorian government. In 20 BBY, the Death Watch was able to depose Kryze and the New Mandalorian leadership with the aid of a collective of crime lords led by the Sith Darth Maul, allowing Pre Vizsla to take his place at the head of both Death Watch and the New Mandalorian people. Unfortunately for him, Vizsla's rule was short lived: challenged for leadership by Maul after a betrayal of his former ally's trust, Vizsla was defeated and killed in a duel, after which Maul claimed the title of Secret Mandalore for himself, along with the right to rule Death Watch. Death Watch fragmented at the claim, with a portion of the sect refusing to follow the rule of a non-Mandalorian.

Even still, Shysa's past came back to haunt him years later, when Jango Fett's clone son, Boba Fett, was hired to kill Shysa in revenge for his actions during the Clone Wars.
