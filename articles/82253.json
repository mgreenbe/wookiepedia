This hyperroute intersected with the Rimma Trade Route, the Yankirk Route, and the Hydian Way (after the Eriadu Bypass became a part of the latter), at the planet Eriadu in the Seswenna sector. The Run went from Eriadu, through the Greater Javin region, and on to Lipsec in the Koradin sector. The Eriadu system's location at the intersection of the Lipsec Run, Rimma Trade Route, and Yankirk Route ensured Eriadu's importance from the moment colonists first arrived."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
