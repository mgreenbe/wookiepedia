Costing 500,000 credits and with a cargo capacity of 40,000 metric tons, cruisers with the rescue module were dispatched to space battle clean-up and recovery duty. Loaded with replacement parts, the primary mission of the rescue module's 2,130 technicians was to repair what ships they could in order for them to transit back to a shipyard under their own power. Restoring drive systems and life support systems were a priority in undertaking this mission. For ships unable to be repaired in this manner, an analysis of the resources required to repair the ship was made, with military planners deciding whether or not to attempt the repair, or simply scuttle the ship. The rescue module also carried 140 doctors in case survivors were found in the wreckage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
