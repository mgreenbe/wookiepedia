Located far from its star, Pho Ph'eah relied on its heavy natural geothermal activity to provide heat to its native lifeforms. Pho Ph'eahians were naturally adept with technology, and turned Pho Ph'eah into a hub of technological development in the years after contact with the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located along the Hydian Way in the Outer Rim Kalamith sector, Pho Ph'eah was a world of diverse terrains and active geothermal forces. The planet's natural geothermal activity kept the world\u2014which was located far from its star\u2014warm despite the relatively little solar heat it received, especially when it was in the outer reaches of its orbit. Pho Ph'eah's mountains had an abundance of small animals and vegetation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Civilization on Pho Ph'eah evolved with the native Pho Ph'eahians, who over time managed to develop nuclear fusion and limited spaceflight on their own. Once held by the Rakatan Infinite Empire, Pho Phe'ah eventually attracted the attention of the Galactic Republic sometime between 5000 and 3000 BBY, and quickly welcomed the galactic government's advanced technology to Pho Ph'eah. The natives swiftly turned advanced technology into their culture's calling card, as they developed and exported new hyperdrives, weapons and other devices. Pho Ph'eah, along with that entire stretch of the Hydian Way, fell within Separatist space during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sole sentient species that called Pho Ph'eah home was the four-armed Pho Ph'eahians, who evolved from mountain-dwelling hunters who used their powerful limbs to climb Pho Ph'eah's heights. Pho Ph'eahians lived off a high-tech system of agriculture, developing many new methods of food production on Pho Ph'eah's large farms. Naturally adept with technology, Pho Ph'eahians often stood out in the wider galaxy due to their appearance, and were known for their affable natures and senses of humor. Although they did not often leave their homeworld, they were in high demand as mechanics and engineers offworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pho Ph'eah was first mentioned in Han Solo's Revenge, a novel written by Brian Daley and released in 1979.
