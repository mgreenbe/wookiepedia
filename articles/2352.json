One day, one such droid designated AC-38 allowed its StarSpeeder to be hijacked by a rogue protocol droid and taken to a dangerous trip across the galaxy. Because of that incident, all AC-series units were retired from service and replaced by RX-series droids, which proved to be only slightly more reliable."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The AC-series droids originated in Star Tours: The Adventures Continue, a Disney simulator ride theme park attraction.
