The fruit, which grew in large quantities all year long in the planet's rain forests, had an oblong shape with prickly skin. Its yellow flesh had a sweet taste, making it a particular delicacy to the native Pa'lowick, as well as a popular export. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, the Yuuzhan Vong destroyed the planet's harvesting machines, but the veejy crops themselves were left untouched. As a result, veejy fruit export played a significant part in the planet's economic recovery after the war was over."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
