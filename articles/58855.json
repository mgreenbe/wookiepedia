The hair trigger accessory made it easier to fire several shots in quick succession by reducing the amount of pressure that must be placed on the trigger. This works as a two-stage system. The initial depression of the trigger set the weapon to 'ready', while the second would fire it. The second stage would require little pressure to activate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
