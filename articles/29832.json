Patrolled strictly by CorSec under the direct order of the Diktat, it was a sector unsullied by the presence of the Galactic Empire even at its height. Traveled mostly by peaceful freighters and civilian ships, the Corellia's Own quadrant provided safe, speedy travel to the Double Worlds of Talus and Tralus and Centerpoint Station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
