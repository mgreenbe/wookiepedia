Evin Yarrow's ex-wife, Dantrua Haggi, had valuable contacts within the InterGalactic Banking Clan and was able to secure large loans to help fuel the business in its earlier stages. After the InterGalactic Banking Clan's investment in the Separatist Allies in the Clone Wars went dry, Evin Yarrow eventually decided to withdraw from the now waning galactic economical power. Yarrow Industries would also later unknowingly benefit from its former allegations by means of the secretly invested billions of credits fed to the InterGalactic Banking Clan and expand to be a market leader during the Galactic Empire's 19 year reign under Emperor Palpatine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
