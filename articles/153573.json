Hoping that it would lead him to other surviving Jedi, Jarrus attempted to meditate with the artifact, but to no avail, since it had been emptied from all its secrets. However, the holocron was given a new use when Jarrus and Syndulla crossed paths with a malevolent, technopathic entity after retrieving the informant Graysom near an asteroid belt. While the entity possessed Chopper, Syndulla convinced it to inhabit the holocron instead. When the entity took over the holocron, it discovered not only that the artifact was now empty and powerless, but also that there was no way out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
