A frontier port town, Hyllyard consisted of a number of starship landing pits and numerous makeshift structures home to the planet's settlers. Its small houses and commercial buildings were crammed tightly together between narrow streets, while several wider avenues radiated outwards from the town center, like the spokes of a wheel. The center contained an open village square, measuring a fifteen-meter expanse, marked by a large, gray archway reaching ten meters high."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hyllyard was colonized during the end of the Galactic Civil War.
