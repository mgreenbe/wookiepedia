Eventually, the moon became uninhabited, and its structures and terrain were overrun by dirkweed. In around 5 ABY, following the Empire's defeat at the Battle of Endor, the New Republic initiated a campaign to capture the Cerberon system. By that time, Narthex was home to a unit of Imperials that were on the run, residing in an abandoned observatory.
