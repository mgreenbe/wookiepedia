Aside from the \"regular\" containers, there existed flatbed carriers (to carry small ships) and tanker containers (to carry liquids or gas). Thanks to their magnetic locking mechanisms, some intermodal freight containers could be secured end-to-end in succession on a special carriage, becoming a freight train. With its prow mandibles, the CEC YT-1300 light freighter could be used to push such trains across shipping lanes at sublight speed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
