The junkyard had stone walls and a formal entrance on the route known to locals as Savi's Path. Savi's business traded in metal, but especially starships which were abandoned or purchased as scrap. The employees rebuilt starships that had promise, collected metal from wrecks that were not worth repairing, and salvaged items within them to sell at Savi's Workshop, which served as the company's office in the outpost. Cranes and droids were utilized for heavy lifting. Certain employees called Gatherers sifted through the finds to present items of interest for Savi's evaluation as possible historic artifacts that were to be preserved rather than sold."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Savi & Son Salvage was an operating salvage business, the Gatherers were secretly looking for items related to the Jedi Order and were teachers of Jedi lore. The Gatherers passed on their knowledge and helped visitors build custom lightsabers in a secret room within Savi's Workshop."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Savi & Son Salvage is a part of the back story of Disney Parks' Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge.
