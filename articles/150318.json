Mutations that occurred over several thousand years led to the evolution of the species. These mutations were caused by a large dose of radiation which originated from M'dweshuu, a star located at the heart of the Si'Klaata cluster, going nova. The species were considered fearsome monsters and so, due to the threat they posed the sentient Nikto species who were also native to Kintan, the sentients drove them to extinction. The Nikto used weapons named Tuskbeast pikes, which were made from the ivory and bone of slain tuskbeasts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tuskbeasts were first mentioned in Galaxy Guide 12: Aliens \u2014 Enemies and Allies a 1995 supplement book released as part of the Galaxy Guide series for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game by West End Games.
