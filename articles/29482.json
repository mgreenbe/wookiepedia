One example was to dislocate both the thumb and pinky finger to reduce the width of a hand to slip out of binders; a trained Jedi could use the Force to withstand the pain and negate damage to muscles and ligaments."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
