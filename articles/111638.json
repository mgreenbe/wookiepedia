He commented on the S2R Science Droid entry in Cynabar's Droid Datalog Version 4.7.110, confirming information provided by user \"Toria\" regarding the civilian model's safeguards against modification to work on weapons or projects with military applications. Ranger had been hired by Rebels to remove such safeguards in similar droids, and noted that the TelBrinTel subroutines were quite subtle, hard to locate, and deeply ingrained in the droid's systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
