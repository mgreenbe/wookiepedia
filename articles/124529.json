In the syndicate, he held the rank of vigo, or lieutenant. Sometime before the start of the Clone Wars, he double-crossed Tarnese Lyanne, a Sakiyan who had invested much in black market and smuggling operations; the betrayal resulted in the ruination of Lyanne's clan. In 30 BBY, Shiltu died from a massive cellular hemorrhage, a sort of full-body stroke that ended the Hutt's life far too quickly and painlessly, in the opinion of Tarnese Bleyd, a descendant of Lyanne."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shiltu was first mentioned in MedStar I: Battle Surgeons, a novel written by Michael Reaves and Steve Perry which was published in 2004."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
