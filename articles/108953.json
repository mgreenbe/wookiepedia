Working as a spice smuggler, he was employed by the Givin counterfeiter Pendor Gyrr. Gindoch was captured by New Republic agents during a raid on the planet Mantooine, and was found with a large amount of counterfeit credits on him, which had been paid to the smuggler by Gyrr. Gindoch cooperated with the New Republic, giving testimony about much of Gyrr's counterfeiting operation. The New Republic was satisfied that Gindoch was not part of Gyrr's counterfeiting operation, and was just a smuggler employed by the Givin. As a result, and given the minor severity of his crime, Gindoch was released after paying a small fine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gindoch returned to smuggling, and began working directly for both the Galactic Empire and other criminal organizations. He was implicated in the theft of a shipment of blasters bound for the New Republic training facilities on the planet Vessitoar. A portion of the shipment was recovered during a routine security check at a spaceport on Celanon, traced to a small time arms dealer who had obtained the samples from the Ithorian crime lord Rethorn. Interrogation of Rethorn's agents revealed that Gindoch had smuggled the weapons aboard a stolen freighter. The New Republic posted a reward of 3,500 credits for Gindoch's capture on charges of smuggling and theft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Qan Gindoch was a Human male who was 1.75 meters tall and weighed eighty kilograms.
