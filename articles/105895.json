In his book Of Minds, Men, and Machines, he argued that droids were incapable of attaining artificial sentience. In the years following, however, the development of increasingly sophisticated models of droids would prove him wrong, although his beliefs on the fundamental limitations of droid sentience would nonetheless remain widespread throughout the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
