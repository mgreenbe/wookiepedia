Many planets such as Kamino, Mon Cala, Trask, and Quila were covered in oceans of water and many species, including the Mon Calamari, Quarren, and Gungans, evolved on, under, and around water. On arid worlds like Tatooine, moisture farmers used vaporators to collect water from the atmosphere. The Tusken Raiders of Tatooine believed that all water was sacred and promised to them, resulting in them raiding local moisture farms set up by colonists. Indeed, water was more valuable than gold in Tatooine. On Jakku, another desert world, water was a precious commodity and was sold by the junk dealer Unkar Plutt, along with dehydrated rations which could be activated by it. Frozen water was known as ice. According to the Resistance spy Vi Moradi, a human would die after a couple of days without water, though she managed to survive after going three days without water on one occasion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, most industrial processes such as refining and manufacturing required a large water supply."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
