Armor-clad Jedi were a common sight on the battlefields of the New Sith Wars, while the ancient Jedi of the era of the Old Sith Wars would often wear parts of armor to protect certain areas of their bodies, as would many Jedi of the New Sith Wars era. Shoulder guards were especially common among the ranks of the ancient Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi armor was designed to be light and comfortable, giving the wearer as much freedom of movement as possible. However, the freedoms provided by Jedi armor were very limited compared to those provided by traditional Jedi robes. In the ancient wars between the Jedi and the Sith, the battlefields were often so packed with combatants that moving about freely on the battlefield would be difficult even without armor. This would result in immobile and poorly protected combatants, which may be why the Jedi of those eras chose to prioritize armor to mobility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finding particular use in the Army of Light under Lord Hoth during the New Sith Wars, Jedi armor was designed to be comfortable for the wearer, light and give the wearer the ability to use the Force as much as possible."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "At the time of the Pius Dea Crusades"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Pius Dea and early Ductavis eras, Jedi Knights wore full-body metal armor with horned helmets.

Obi-Wan Kenobi and Saesee Tiin are both featured in full armor in Star Wars: Clone Wars, although Tiin's armor's primary function is that of a spacesuit. The Knights of the Old Republic games on the other hand preserve consistency with the typical Jedi apparel in that, even though Force-sensitive party members (including the player) may wear battle armor, doing so blocks the use of many Force powers, such as Force speed, while others don't. This may be seen simply as a game mechanic designed to balance a Force-sensitive character's abilities, yet it is remarkably in line with Thorsland's statement about the inconsistency of armor and the way of the Jedi, though there are still armors available that don't restrict Force usage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The concept of Imperial Knights seems to completely disregard this notion, since Imperial Knights' standard apparel is armor, and yet it does not restrict their use of Force powers in any way."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the non-canon Return of the Jedi Infinities, Darth Vader is redeemed without dying, resulting in Anakin having his armor repainted white to symbolize his return to the light."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
