The route ran south-east from the planet Coruscant in the Core Worlds and ending at Naos and Lamaredd. Along its path, the Corellian Run intersected with the Hydian Way super-hyperroute, touching planets in every region of the galaxy, from the Core to the Outer Rim. As well as the Perlemian Trade Route, the Corellian Run formed the border of an area known as the Slice, which became the most populated and explored region of the galaxy. Spanning further out into the Outer Rim, parts of the Corellian Run crossed with other trade routes to form the Spice Triangle, a series of lanes popular among smugglers and free traders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
