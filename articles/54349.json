This tangle made hyperspace travel to the planet extremely difficult; it wasn't uncommon for visitors to the planet to stall out of hyperspace at the edge of the system, or even several lightyears away from Giaca - suffering damage to their hyperdrives in the process. This problem was exacerbated by the lack of current and accurate charts, with available charts being out of date and sketchy at best. Pilots and researchers who made regular trips to the planet thus guarded their secret routes jealously, and, if they could be convinced to share their charts at all, would often only do so for outrageous prices."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
