In the distant past of the Old Republic, the Sith were led by the Dark Lords during their conflict against the Jedi Order. Ultimately, the Sith collapsed in defeat as a result of infighting and constant war with the Jedi. As the sole surviving member of the ancient Sith Order, Darth Bane assumed the mantle of Dark Lord and established a philosophy known as the Rule of Two, declaring that only two Dark Lords\u2014a Sith Master and a Sith apprentice\u2014could exist at any given time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Dark Lords that succeeded Darth Bane would adhere to his teachings, maintaining the Sith Order's ranks to two members throughout the millennium-long reign of the modern Galactic Republic.

At the time of the Clone Wars Sidious' former apprentice, Darth Maul, sought to reclaim his status as a Sith Lord while training his brother, Savage Opress. Having replaced Maul with Darth Tyranus, Sidious confronted them on Mandalore where he killed Opress and subdued Maul. The Dark Lord castigated Maul, informing the Dathomirian that he had been replaced in an order that permitted only two Sith Lords."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sidious would later betray Tyranus and have him killed by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, as he desired to make Anakin his apprentice. Not too long after killing Tyranus, Skywalker fell to the dark side and became Darth Vader, as well as Sidious's third apprentice, while Sidious proclaimed himself Galactic Emperor after destroying the Jedi Order. The Dark Lords ruled the galaxy for a generation until Vader destroyed Sidious at the cost of his own life, fulfilling the Jedi prophecy that foretold the destruction of the Sith. Vader subsequently died as the last Sith Lord in the thousand-year lineage that began with Darth Bane.
