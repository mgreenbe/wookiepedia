There his teammates were killed by Wookiees, but when he came close to Leia, his highly acute sense of smell helped him recognize her as Mal'ary'ush: the biological daughter of Lord Darth Vader, whom the Noghri considered their savior. Khabarakh agreed to take Leia, who had promised him the New Republic would help the Noghri people, to Honoghr."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Chewbacca had previously agreed to stay on the Millennium Falcon, he changed his mind and insisted on accompanying Leia to Honoghr, as he had extended the life debt he owed Han Solo, to her and her brother. Khabarakh agreed to this, stating that \"The Wookiee code of honor is similar to our own.\" However, the unexpected appearance of a Star Destroyer sent Chewbacca into a rage, as the Wookiee believed the Noghri had betrayed him and Leia to Thrawn. Chewbacca and Khabarakh scuffled in the cockpit for a while, and though Khabarakh was a skilled warrior, Chewbacca's pure strength overwhelmed the Noghri, and he was forced to use a stun weapon to save the lives of his passengers and himself. With Chewbacca subdued Khabarakh sent out the recognition code, albeit late."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His reappearance on Honoghr, however, drew the attention of Thrawn, who thought him dead on Kashyyyk, and believed that he was interrogated and released after divulging some Imperial information. Thrawn wanted to find out exactly what the information was. Khabarakh showed Chewbacca several Noghri styles of combat, teaching him a bit in the lull. Furthering Thrawn's belief that he was interrogated was that Imperials found Wookiee hair in his ship. Khabarakh was arrested for treason, and was imprisoned in Nystao, but was freed when Leia revealed the Imperials' treachery in poisoning their world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Luke Skywalker came to Honoghr seeking the aid of the Noghri, Khabarakh and Ovkhevam greeted Luke at a new area of clean lands and helped him repair his ship.
