It was at this fortress that Dreddon was killed by Zam Wesell who was after the bounty place on the Hutt's head by the Black Sun Vigo Antonin, Dreddon's rival. It was only shortly after his death that Jango Fett arrived at the fortress to collect the bounty on Antonin that Dreddon himself had placed on the Vigo. As such, both executed their contracts effectively but resulted in neither receiving their promised pay."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
