During the Clone Wars between the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Republic, the Confederacy's Supreme Commander of the Droid Army, General Grievous, escaped to the surface of the Outer Rim planet Saleucami in a C-9979 landing craft during the Battle of Saleucami in 21 BBY. As the Confederacy's general descended upon the planet, his landing craft was damaged and its crew was forced to jettison numerous escape pods, one of which included the general himself. Republic forces, including Crys\u2014acting as a technical specialist due to his robolobotomy skills\u2014were quickly deployed to the planet to track down the elusive general."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Republic forces landed near the crash site in an Acclamator-class assault ship, Crys accompanied Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi, Clone Commander CC-2224 \"Cody,\" Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex,\" and many other Republic troops and vehicles in the proceeding search of the planet. As Republic forces began to inspect the landing craft's crash site and failed to locate Grievous, Kenobi split his forces to investigate the landing sites of the escape pods. Crys accompanied All Terrain Tactical Enforcer walkers, Kenobi, and Cody to an escape pod and inspected a destroyed B1 battle droid for any possible intelligence before deducing that the droid was too damaged for any reliable information to be extracted. Soon after, a fellow clone trooper spotted an intact\u2014albeit inactive\u2014battle droid inside the escape pod, and Kenobi ordered the droid to be brought into one of the AT-TE walkers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside the AT-TE walker, Crys and Cody conducted a robolobotomy, breaking through the droid's access codes and activating its guidance systems. When Kenobi later asked if the pair had found any data regarding Grievous's pod's whereabouts, the soldiers briefed him that the droid's escape pod had crashed to avoid a mid-air collision with another pod, the latter being the final undiscovered pod. General Grievous was proceeding from his crash site with his remaining troops towards the final intact escape pod at the same time the Republic forces managed to pinpoint its location. The Republic and Confederacy forces engaged, with the clone forces emerging victorious.
