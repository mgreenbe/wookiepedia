It was meant to advertise a series of lectures that Count Dooku, then leader of the Independent Movement for Self-Determination, was supposed to give at the university's Panos Lecture Hall at a yet-to-be determined date and time. Following the end of the Clone Wars, the newly-created Security Bureau of the Galactic Empire conducted loyalty purges, during which much propaganda material featuring Dooku was destroyed. However, rare specimens of Dellu's work-in-progress poster survived those purges."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
