The reason for this is that Mission to Zila was written before X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble, the source which fixed the liberation of Coruscant at that earlier date."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Perhaps the simplest retcon is to suggest that the Imperials on Garos IV remained unaware of the loss of Coruscant, but that would not explain why the planet's well-organized Rebel underground would be ignorant of such a major event more than two years; an alternative retcon would involve supposing that Thrawn had actually returned from the Unknown Regions much earlier than is generally supposed, but this would require some other means for explaining Alex's age."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
