Residing in a cloiser at the location Templemarch, the faction was among many which sought power and control over the planet.

Namir was named Umu seven, being the seventh individual in the Creed to be named after Umu the second son of the Hieroprince. The Creed initially enjoyed great success and prosperity, amassing great amounts of food, water, and gold, but eventually dissolved, with their cloister being reduced to ruins."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Traditions and beliefs"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Creed's doctrines included worship of a being known as the \"Hieroprince\" which drove them to oppose the other clans of Crucival.
