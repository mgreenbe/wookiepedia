The Clone Wars were coming to an end when Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker reported to Jedi Master Mace Windu that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine was, in fact, the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious.

Unbeknownst to Jurokk, however, Skywalker had helped Sidious defeat Windu, becoming the Dark Lord's apprentice and taking the name Darth Vader.
