Riders jumped a ditch with repulsor field generators at the bottom, which worked to draw the rider and their swoop towards the bottom of the pit. Riders who were unable to clear the jump fell into a pit usually filled with the debris of previous racers who did not make it. Rescue crews considered attending crashes on this obstacle to be a waste of time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
