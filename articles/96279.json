He liked haggling over the items he sold and was also fascinated by interesting stories. During the Clone Wars, he ran a Nemo's Curios stall at the Cularin Trade Show, aboard the TAV Prosperity. He also visited the Prosperity Casino and Entertainment Center while he was there and lost a lot of money. The Prosperity was shaken after a hyperdrive failure in the Cularin comet cloud and parts of Nenmo's booth fell on him. This trapped him and he complained about how his wares had been damaged. Luckily, some of the show's guests went and helped to get him free."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
