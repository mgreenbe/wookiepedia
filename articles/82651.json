In order to do so, he allowed the Imperials to implant an AJ^6 cyborg construct to his brain, exchanging some of his personality for increased productivity. Eventually leaving the Empire, Lobot became a smuggler and formed a friendship with fellow smuggler Lando Calrissian, owner of the Millennium Falcon, and Chanath Cha, a bounty hunter. They remained friends for years, and Lobot and Cha fell in love. Nonetheless, Calrissian and Cha went separate ways, and Lobot chose to remain with Lando.

Calrissian, in order to pay off the debt, went to steal a valuable object from the Imperial governor of the sector: Moff Ssaria, known as the \"Fiend of Castell\" and the \"Burning Moff.\" However, instead of just stealing the trinket and running, Calrissian suavely manipulated the Moff into giving it to him; Calrissian soon told the story to Lobot when they met in Toren's cantina. Lobot was shocked at the risks his partner took, adding that his implants gleaned that the odds of that working were about one in ten thousand. The gambler replied that he didn't like to know the odds, and explained that he had done what he did because he didn't want the Moff hunting them. Lobot was assured by his partner that they were debt free after he traded the trinket to Toren, and Lando then went to speak with the crime boss. He returned a few minutes later with news: ten percent of their debt had been wiped away, and he had a chance at one \"hell of a score.\" Lobot was appalled that only ten percent of their debt had been cleared and demanded to know what had gone wrong. Calrissian explained that things had not gone as planned, but still had gone well, given the new job. Lobot, however, did not share Calrissian's optimism and believed they should fight Toren. Calrissian did not, adding that Lobot had the cyborg construct implanted so he wouldn't have to fight, just analyze battlefront movements from afar. Lobot gave in, so they began preparations for the job."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The duo first recruited the cloned hand-to-hand combat experts Aleksin and Pavol in case they did need to fight, and next, the Ugnaught antiquities expert, Sava Korin Pers, whom they met in her office. Pers pulled a blaster on Calrissian when he entered; the last time they had worked together, Pers lost an eye. Pers eventually agreed to assist in the job after seeing the ease and the payoff. Soon, the team of five made their way to Sienar Fleet Systems Orbital Shipyard CC-24 in orbit over Castell, which the team infiltrated using stealth suits. They quickly secured a portion of the shipyard, hijacked an Imperial pleasure craft that they believed had belonged to an Imperial art collector, and blasted away from the station. Calrissian piloted the ship, the Imperialis, while Lobot acted as his co-pilot. Lobot was unsure of Calrissian's rejoicing in escaping so easily; Lobot believed there was still trouble to come."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Escaping Castell"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lobot was soon proven correct when a trio of Imperial-class Star Destroyers emerged from hyperspace near the Imperialis. Lobot grew frustrated as the \"easy score\" that Calrissian had promised began to disappear. Calrissian argued that it was a good thing that the Star Destroyers arrived; it meant the ship was incredibly valuable to its owner\u2014who, unknown to Lobot and his fellows, was none other than Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine. The Star Destroyers dropped gravity-based mines to prevent the Imperialis from entering hyperspace, but the yacht's automated defenses destroyed the mines. When the Star Destroyers captained by Shan and Conro activated tractor beams to reclaim the vessel, Lando had Lobot upload the ships' coordinates to Lando's piloting computer. With the coordinates uploaded, Lando piloted the Imperialis between the two Star Destroyers, causing them to lock onto each other. Unable to disengage in time, the capital ships collided, giving the Imperialis the opportunity to jump to hyperspace. Free from the Castell system, Lando and Lobot were approached by Sava Korin, who said the yacht was filled with treasure. Touring the crew around, Korin explained that one area of the ship, the central chamber, was very well secured, so Lobot volunteered to open the sealed door with his implants. When he did, however, he was confronted by a pair of Imperial Guards, one of which immediately impaled him through the chest with their staff."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "A turn for the worse"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Guards were quickly engaged by Pavol and Aleksin, while Lando rushed to Lobot's side.

Not sure if the semi-conscious Lobot reached the bacta tank in time, Lando apologized to his friend. Pers, deducing the Imperialis belonged to Palpatine, told Lando that the entire crew would die.

Shocked, Calrissian and Pers fled the chamber, resealing the door behind them. Pers argued to enter the escape pods, but Lando refused to leave Lobot behind. Meanwhile, unknown to Lando and Pers, Chanath Cha, now working for the Emperor, had infiltrated the ship. Preventing the crew's escape, Cha disabled the pods, and the ship relayed the message over the intercom. Lando realized that someone else must be on the ship, and, soon after, Pers and Lando encountered the bounty hunter at gunpoint. However, Cha recognized Lando and lowered her weapons.

However, when Calrissian told Cha that Lobot was aboard the Imperialis and was injured, Cha succumbed to Calrissian's plan of stopping Aleksin and Pavol and keeping the ship intact. Immediately after, Aleksin and Pavol confronted the group, saying that Pers was a victim, before killing her. Sealing the door between them and the twins, Cha went to dock the Scimitar while Calrissian went to retrieve Lobot. Despite Lobot needing more time, Calrissian removed him from the bacta as the ship announced it would self-destruct. Helping Lobot out of the medical bay, Calrissian encountered Aleksin, fatally shooting the alien. The two reunited with Cha, and Lobot told her that he'd missed her company. When Lando asked if the Scimitar was prepped, Cha explained that her ship's droid pilot, O-66, had fled, trapping them on the self-destructing Imperialis. Lobot then requested to be taken to a computer interface, where he attempted to disable the auto-destruct. Unable to do so, Lobot realized he could turn the escape pods back on, but he couldn't do so while fighting his implant from taking over. Deciding to save his longtime friends, he enabled the pods, allowing the implants to take over his mind. Moving to the escape pods, Lando invited Cha to come with them, saying that it might bring Lobot back, but Cha declined, saying that he'd made his choice and picked Lando. After Cha said goodbye, Lando and Lobot's pod ejected. As it departed, Lando told Lobot he'd find a cure to bring him back. Upon hearing the word \"cure,\" Lobot's cybernetic construct played a pre-recorded contingency message to his friend, saying that Lobot believed Lando could find a cure, but either way he wouldn't be upset, as he had lived by his choices. Lobot's message went on to tell Lando that people trust his leadership, and that he needed to do something good with that power. Lobot's recording then ended with, \"Lando. Old buddy.

Unhappy about Vader's unilateral changes and feeling guilty for his role in betraying Solo, Calrissian, via comlink, issued Code Force Seven, ordering Lobot and the Bespin Wing Guard to detain Vader's troops and free Solo's rebel associates.

Lobot, still present on Bespin, relayed messages through the blockade to Calrissian, who had been promoted to a general in the Republic following his departure from Cloud City. At one point during the blockade, Lobot hired the pirate Kars Tal-Korla to capture Borgin Kaa, an Imperial collaborator, and extract a code needed to open an access panel connected to Adelhard's personal chamber; once the panel was opened, Lobot and an intrusion team would apprehend the Governor. Rather than being paid for the act, the pirate said to treat it as a favor.

One of the later drafts of the script established this character as a cyborg, and it was then that actor John Hollis was selected for the role by the filmmakers. The cybernetic implant prop Hollis wore on his head was completely battery-powered and was connected to a spring clip that was fit around the actor's head.
