While this was the opinion of SpecForce members, this was not entirely true as Navy troopers tended to be both well equipped and adequately trained for their tasks. In addition, they did see combat but tended to lack the edge that blooded troops got from their engagements. Vessels and installations that were located in more remote regions tended to rely more on their Navy troopers. In some cases, such as those units stationed in the Outer Rim Territories, the Navy soldiers had gained enough experience to be a credible threat to their enemies. However, in general, Imperial Navy troopers were not considered a challenge to members of the Rebel Alliance's SpecOps."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These men backed up stormtroopers and were created to provide the Imperial Navy a corps of troops separate from the Imperial Army and the Stormtrooper Corps for protection of their ships. After the initial boarding operations were conducted by Stormtroopers, Imperial Navy troopers often moved in to conduct mop up actions. However, Crix Madine, a former Imperial soldier-turned Rebel General, indicated that the naval troopers are more likely to be encountered during a boarding action."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Besides serving the Galactic Empire as soldiers and security guards, they handled hangar control traffic, monitored sensor arrays, and performed various other duties.
