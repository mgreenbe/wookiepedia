She provided services as an information broker out of the establishment, assisting the Jedi during the Clone Wars and later the Bad Batch during the Imperial Era. A variety of games, including slot machines and dejarik, were available there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located in a grimy, garbage-strewn alleyway in Ord Mantell City, Cid's Parlor was largely below street level, accessible by a staircase entrance with a sign bearing the name \"Cid's\" in Aurebesh and a picture of a pair of dice. The parlor's main room was dimly-lit, containing a bar area with seating in the middle, a large oblong holotable, and a bench seat along the back of the room on the side nearer the door. Smaller holotables were available for the playing of dejarik, and slot machines were arrayed around the sides of the room. The parlor served a wide variety of alcohol, including Whyren's Reserve, Deep Core, Oo'ta Goo'ta, Mooften, Wicked Womprat, Dark Blue Milk, Thermal Detonator, and Reactor Coolant. The drinks were displayed on shelves behind the bar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cid kept an office in the back where she met clients. The room contained a holotable, a desk and a chair, as well as shelving along the sides. The office was filled with trophies, including a fur pelt behind the chair, a mounted horn on the desk, an axe, and several clone trooper helmets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the final years of the Republic Era, the cantina was run by Cid, a Trandoshan informant who had a working relationship with the Jedi. At some point during the Clone Wars, the ARC trooper Echo learned of Cid and where to find her from his Jedi commanding officers. After the Jedi Order was destroyed at the end of the war and declared enemies of the new Galactic Empire, Echo and his current unit, the irregular Clone Force 99, deserted the Empire's service. They took Omega, a young enhanced clone created by the Kaminoans, with them. When Omega was targeted by a bounty hunter on Pantora, the so-called \"Bad Batch\" decided to visit Cid on Echo's suggestion for answers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Landing on Ord Mantell, the squad travelled through the streets of the city to Cid's Parlor. Upon entering, they were initially unaware of Cid was, as Echo had never actually met her. Hunter asked Cid, who was working on a slot machine, if she knew the owner, but she denied it. The only other people present were regular patrons Bolo and Ketch, who were in the midst of an argument over a dejarik game which quickly escalated to a fight. Noting the state of the room, Tech suggested that Cid may have been arrested for violating health code regulations. Omega, after poking at a holotable, managed to identify Cid and told the rest of the squad, after which she took them to her office."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Batch showed Cid a hologram of the bounty hunter and told her what they wanted. In return for the information, however, Cid hired them to rescue Muchi, whom she said was a child in danger from Zygerrian slavers. When they agreed, Cid tossed Hunter a data disk with the information, and they left. Muchi, however, was not a child but a young rancor belonging to the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. After the squad left, Cid was eating in her office when she was contacted by Jabba's majordomo, Bib Fortuna. Cid reassured Fortuna that Muchi would be returned soon, stating that threats were unnecessary as she had her \"best people\" on it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite some difficulties, the Bad Batch managed to pull the rescue off, defeating the slavers and also freeing the slaves they had taken before returning to Ord Mantell City with Muchi. Fortuna had visited Cid in person with two Gamorrean guards, further insisting on Muchi's return as soon as possible. Any further argument was forestalled when Fortuna heard Muchi nearby, leading him to rush out of Cid's to greet the rancor. Fortuna paid Cid for the job and left with the creature, after which Cid asked Hunter to accompany her to her office. She paid him his squad's share of the credits and gave him the intel she had gathered on the bounty hunter, Fennec Shand, and who had hired her. Cid further offered Hunter some more mercenary work for the Batch, stating they would need both friends and credits to survive in the new era."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterwards, the Batch remained on Ord Mantell, spending time at Cid's. Omega, supervised by Echo, trained to use her new energy bow in the bar's main room, while Bolo and Ketch bet on whether she would hit the target, which had been built out of some crates and a slot machine. A woman came in while the practice was going on, but was frightened into leaving by a stray shot for which Omega apologized. Practice ended after Cid appeared and, shooing Ketch and Bolo out, requested the Batch do another job for her. She used one of the bar's holotables to explain the mission, which was for the squad to break into a decommissioning facility on Corellia and steal a tactical droid for the intel it contained. Hunter was reluctant to do the job, but eventually agreed, and the Batch departed for the Core Worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mission to Corellia failed because the tactical droid's head was destroyed and Hunter chose to give the copied data to smugglers Trace and Rafa Martez, who had also been after the head and whom Hunter believed would use the information for the right reasons. However, the sisters learned where the Batch was based out of and passed the information on to their contact, the former Clone Captain Rex, who was a friend of the Batch. Some time later, he travelled to Ord Mantell and, disguising himself with a hooded cloak, entered Cid's, where he got a drink and sat in a corner to observe, unnoticed amidst other patrons. The Batch shortly returned to the cantina from a mission to retrieve a stolen lizard from the Rhokai. Meeting the clones at the bar, Cid commented on how strange the lizard looked, having an exchange with Hunter about how she did not care what her client would do with the creature as long as she was paid. She headed into her office and told the clones to follow her. Hunter surveyed the room and took note of the cloaked figure in the back, but thought little of him before Wrecker and Omega asked permission to go on leave, which he granted after they argued that it was a tradition."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In her office, Cid paid Hunter much less for the job than she had said it was worth. When Echo demanded to know how their arrangement was mutually beneficial, Cid retorted that she was being generous considering what they owed her. Hunter asked how much, and she passed him a datapad containing a list of expenses for port and docking fees, fuel, rations, and cartons of Mantell Mix, a snack food Wrecker and Omega had taken to eating after missions and putting on Cid's tab. Cid told the clones that in order for their debt to be squared, they needed to make another big score, like what the tactical droid would have been worth. She further warned them to figure something out before they saw her ugly side, prompting Tech to make a quip about Cid's appearance. Before she could answer, however, the conversation was interrupted by two blaster shots from the main room."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after Hunter had gone to Cid's office, some other patrons had left, leaving Bolo and Ketch the only people in the cantina besides the disguised Rex. Taking offense to the man sitting in \"his\" seat, Bolo had approached Rex and demanded that he move. After he pointedly ignored them and took a sip of his drink, Ketch noted to his friend that the man was ignoring them, leading Bolo to restate his demand. Things quickly escalated, and Rex drew one of his blaster pistols and fired two warning shots, leading the duo to flee the cantina in terror as Cid, Hunter, Tech and Echo burst into the main room from her office. As Rex set his gun down on the table, Cid demanded to know who he was. Hunter, Tech and Echo recognized Rex immediately when he lowered his hood, and Cid, exasperated, stated that she was done taking in strays and that her business was not a clone bar, leaving while grumbling about how clones kept acting as if they owned the place. Rex commented that it had been a while, and when Echo asked him where he had been, he responded that it was a long story."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clones sat at the bar and got drinks while Rex filled them in on some of what he had been doing, saying he had been keeping a low profile since the end of the war. Tech agreed, telling Rex the Empire had listed him as killed in action. When Echo asked him how he had known where to find them, Rex mentioned the Martezes, adding that they had told him the Batch was travelling with a kid and asked who that was. Hunter told him that Omega was a clone, which surprised Rex, just as Wrecker and Omega returned. Wrecker recognized Rex immediately and greeted him warmly, lifting him off of his stool in a bear hug. Omega was surprised to see him greeting a \"reg\" so warmly as she had thought the Batch disliked normal clones, but Wrecker told her they liked this one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hunter introduced Omega to Rex, and he told her he had never met a clone like her before. He was surprised when she was able to deduce that he was a Generation One clone, but the conversation took a turn when Wrecker began having one of his persistent headaches. Rex was alarmed when he realized that none of the Batch had removed their implanted inhibitor chips, which had been used to turn the clones against the Jedi, as Tech had concluded their deviant nature protected them. Going for one of his pistols, Rex warned them that the chips were more dangerous than they knew and made them a threat to everyone, including Omega. He only relaxed when Hunter asked him how to remove the chips, and said it was a good question and he would be in touch. Rex later had the Batch meet him on Bracca, to use the medical bay of a wrecked Venator-class Star Destroyer to perform the surgeries."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cid's Parlor first appeared in \"Rampage,\" the fifth episode of the first season of Star Wars: The Bad Batch.
