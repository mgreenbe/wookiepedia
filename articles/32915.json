It resembled the DL-44 heavy blaster pistol, except it was more metallic in appearance. A roughed and powerful sidearm for all occasions, the weapon was finished with a fine chrome. A variant of this weapon was the DL-44 \"Dosh Special\" pistol, a weapon of envy for many junior Trandoshans. Another variant was the DL-44 XT, an extended design which used a metal housing to provide the weapon with a more substantial feel and increased accuracy due to the improved balance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
