By the New Republic Era, the vehicle was valuable on the black market, and at least one was used by the Imperial remnant led by Moff Gideon. One was present on Gideon's Imperial base on Nevarro, and was stolen by Greef Karga, Carasynthia Dune, and a Mythrol during a skirmish at the facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Trexler 906 Armored Marauder was a grey, box-like troop transport derived from the similar K79-S80 model. The vehicle was clad in metal plating resistant to standard blaster fire, thicker than the armor of the K79-S80, and provided space for three crew members consisting of two pilots and one gunner, as well as personnel to be transported. At the front, several blocky, open viewports for the drivers could be found on the flat nose of the craft, while at the rear, a power plant comprised of two thin, vertical outlets emitted a blue hue when activated to propel the vehicle. It levitated above the ground when travelling due to its repulsorlifts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Also located at the back was a dome-shaped dorsal twin laser turret operated by a gunner within the Marauder, whose position also contained viewports. This dorsal turret could target both ground-based units, such as speeder bikes, and units in the air, such as fighters. The gunner could also fire at individual personnel, even if they were on the Marauder itself. The targeting mechanism consisted of a screen where potential targets showed up as white objects on a red grid and black background. When a target was selected, its outline flashed red with an affirmative sequence of beeps. Additional beeping sounds informed the presence of nearby targets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The gunner had a rotating chair that they could swing around a whole revolution, allowing the turret to fire in any direction. It fired red laser bolts. The troop transport's other weapons included two laser guns and four laser cannons throughout the troop transport, some of which could be found at the two trapezoidal protrusions near the rear. Overall, the armament of the Marauder was considered to be more powerful than that of the K79-S80 transport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the cockpit, the drivers possessed various controls and buttons in red and white, some on a dashboard before them and others on the ceiling of the vehicle. Although one such Marauder was serviced by Gideon's Imperial remnant, an individual who was not part of this Imperial remnant could access the controls and activate the vehicle without much difficulty. A tarp could be thrown over the Trexler 906 Armored Marauder to protect it from degradation or unwanted attention."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the New Republic Era, at least one Trexler 906 Armored Marauder operated by Gideon's Imperial remnant was held at an Imperial base on the planet Nevarro. When this base was attacked by Magistrate Greef Karga and his allies, Karga, Carasynthia Dune and a Mythrol stole this Marauder from a platform of the facility to escape it. Dune was able to successfully activate the transport, with Karga in the gunner's seat, and sped it off the platform and into the gorge below the Imperial base. Despite being fired upon by several stormtroopers, the vehicle was unaffected by these shots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A chase then ensued as several scout troopers riding 74-Z speeder bikes pursued the troop transport. Two of the bikes crashed into each other and exploded; Karga destroyed a third with the dual laser turret. Dune piloted the Marauder into another speeder bike, slamming it against the cliff face and destroying it. The last scout trooper managed to climb onto the top of the vehicle, holding an explosive, but Karga swung the turret around to face the front and shot the trooper to death at close range."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Next, four Outland TIE fighters chased the Marauder through the ravine. Karga again used the laser turret to severely damage the wing of the lead fighter, causing it to crash. However, the burning cockpit of the fighter slammed into the rear of the Marauder, incapacitating the turret as Karga abandoned that position. Once the troop transport had reached the open rock flats, the other three Outland fighters swooped overhead the craft, but were quickly dispatched by Din Djarin arriving in the Razor Crest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In concept art for \"Chapter 12: The Siege\", the fourth episode of the second season of the television show The Mandalorian, the chase of the Trexler 906 Armored Marauder depicts the vehicle with three passenger or cargo compartments on the outside, causing it to seem like a K79-S80 troop transport. However, the forward section of the craft largely retains its appearance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
