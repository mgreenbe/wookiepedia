Struggling to exist on an insect-based diet on Kubindi, which was plagued by intense solar radiation from Ku'Bakai, each Kubaz clan maintained its own hive of insects for food, but some were still lacking in sustenance. Shortages and raids sparked all-out wars between neighboring clans. Slowly killing off the Kubaz, the Hive Wars were ended with the discovery of Insecticulture, which allowed the Kubaz geneticists to alter the coloration of an insect, color-coding them according to ownership."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
