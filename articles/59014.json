Following the night of rest, the Jedi would enter the Hall of Knighthood and a gathering of Jedi Masters, typically made up of the Jedi High Council, would raise the rank of the individual."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the final years of the Galactic Republic several of the last generation of Jedi were knighted here. In 30 BBY Padawan Aayla Secura was made a Knight, while her master Quinlan Vos became a full Jedi Master.

The circular pattern in the center of the chamber was reminiscent of the pattern used in the High Council Chamber at the summit of the Tower Spire.
