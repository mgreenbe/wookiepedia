During the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire, two Imperial Inquisitors, the Seventh Sister and the Fifth Brother, captured a Force-sensitive Ithorian there. The infant was rescued by Ezra Bridger and other members of the rebel crew of the Ghost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Much like the domes and steeples on many of the buildings in Takobo City as a whole resemble those of real-life Eastern Orthodox church architecture found in Russia and some of its neighboring countries, the tower block-laden landscape of Hammertown is similar to cities across Eastern Europe that were once part of the Eastern Bloc. These and other factors suggest that the planet of Takobo was heavily inspired by aesthetics of the Slavonic countries.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
