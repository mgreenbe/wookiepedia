The short, squat design was built for the long fingers of the native Deaons, who manufactured a variety of different blaster models. Over the years, interest in Ord Gimmel's brewing civil war had grown galaxy-wide, and as a result, many collectors and enthusiasts discovered the utility of the variable blaster design, which made it a popular export."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When firing the weapon, the pistol's wielder was required to choose a power setting between one and seven. This was the amount of damage a successful shot inflicted on a target, but it was also the amount of ammo that was consumed for each shot. If set to a power setting higher than the available ammo left, the weapon dealt damage equal to the amount of ammo that remained."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
