Run by the pirate Gradak Ungan of the White Maw gang, the Lavaworks were accessible from an entrance in White Maw Pass. A bounty hunter hunted down and killed Gradak in the Lavaworks in an effort to draw out Reneget Vause. Around 3630 BBY, the facility was being ruled by Forgemaster Droub, who was stockpiling weaponry within it. Soon after, the Eternal Alliance's Commander led an assault and freed Firefrost Lavaworks, eliminating all White Maw forces present. Once Firefrost Lavaworks was secured and the civilian workers were rescued, the Eternal Alliance established themselves in the factory. The Alliance modified the factory to serve their purposes and civilian workers that were liberated by the Alliance decided to run the factory on their behalf."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
