Born on the planet Corellia to a farming family, Fel developed his piloting skills over the fields before gaining entrance to the Imperial Academy and beginning a career as a TIE fighter pilot. He served dutifully, demonstrating a strong sense of responsibility for his men. After a series of events out of his control tarnished his career, Fel was exiled to the lackluster 181st Imperial Fighter Wing, which he revived, eventually gaining its command and the title of Baron of the Empire, winning Fel a reputation as the Empire's most deadly pilot and the 181st as its most elite starfighter unit. During that time, Fel met and married the famous actress Wynssa Starflare, who he discovered was actually the sister of Rebel ace Wedge Antilles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Director of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard sent Fel and his men to die at Brentaal IV for her own political gain, Fel was captured and defected to the New Republic, tired of the growing corruption after Palpatine's death. He joined his brother-in-law Antilles in Rogue Squadron, serving the New Republic faithfully, but shortly thereafter Fel was recaptured by Isard and sent to Grand Admiral Thrawn's base on Nirauan. There, Thrawn showed Fel the myriad threats awaiting the galaxy in the Unknown Regions, and Fel agreed to serve in Thrawn's Empire of the Hand, fighting against warlords and would-be invaders beyond the knowledge of galactic civilization."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There Fel raised a family, surrounded by hardship, before once again making contact with the galaxy at large during the hoax proclaiming Thrawn's return. When the Yuuzhan Vong War broke out, Fel sent his son Jagged and a handful of Empire of the Hand forces to the New Republic's aid. During the course of the war, the Empire of the Hand was dissolved, with Fel joining the Chiss Ascendancy and becoming a senior officer in the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet. A failed guarantee of parole on Jagged's part during the Dark Nest Crisis bankrupted and dishonored the Fels, but their difficulties would not last forever\u2014Jagged was able to restore the family's honor in one final act before taking the reins of the Imperial Remnant, which was revived with Jagged and his descendants ruling as Emperors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Upbringing"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soontir Fel was born in the Astrilde Bottomlands region of the planet Corellia in 28 BBY to a tight-knit rural Corellian family, the eldest child. The Fels lived on an agro-combine owned by Allied Grain and Roughage, where Fel's father worked as a transport pilot for the company; his mother and much of his extended family were employed by AGR as well. He had at least one younger brother, Todr, and possibly another brother and sister as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Fel, he was taught the family values of strict loyalty, virtue, and dependence on each other. Fel learned to put his family first and to always look out for them. Among his fellow farmers, he also developed a skill in raising plants, and the love of growing things would always remain with him. The greatest skill he honed on the agro-combine, though, was piloting. Fel grew to be an accomplished pilot as he soared across AGR's lands in a skyhopper. In 11 and 10 BBY, Fel won the airspeeder race at the AGR harvest festival two consecutive years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Fel's father accidentally suffered contact with poison and couldn't make his rounds for the company, Fel stepped in and flew for him, saving his job. The job was long enough for it to become an open secret that he was filling in for his father despite being underage. Once Fel turned eighteen in 10 BBY, around the time of the harvest festival, his father arranged for Soontir to take his place while the elder Fel took a job in the department shop. Fel spent a month delivering supplies and parts and making field repairs in his own right, adding another source of income for his family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The night of the harvest festival, Fel came upon Pamr, a female friend, about to be raped by Ilir Post and two other young men, all the sons of figures in AGR's management. Fel defended her, beating all three assailants into submission. The local police, however, were loyal to AGR and Fel knew they would not prosecute the children of company managers\u2014in Post's case, a member of the board. He therefore went to the Corellian Security Force, where Inspector Hal Horn took his statement and arrested Post."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This was not to the liking of AGR, which could face potential embarrassment. AGR director Ivr Drop called Fel, employed for only a month, into his office. He told Fel that he had secured for him a last-minute senatorial appointment to the Imperial Academy on Carida. In order to take it, Fel would have to depart at once\u2014before his testimony at the trial of Post the next week. This was a tremendous opportunity for Fel, but Drop pushed even farther, offering to make sure that Fel's family was well-cared-for in his absence. If Fel didn't take it, however, Drop threatened repercussions for his father, who had allowed Fel, technically an unauthorized individual, to fly company property. Fel was reluctant to halt justice, but felt that for his family's sake he had no choice. He accepted the appointment and the case against Post fell apart. Inspector Horn met Fel before his flight to Carida, assuring him that he had made the best choice he could, and that Horn would watch Post and be sure to prosecute if he ever infringed upon the law again. Post did eventually commit another crime, and was sent to the prison world of Kessel."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Imperial Academy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fel soon arrived at the Academy, and found little time to adjust. His long ponytail was shaven off upon the induction to the Academy, and a life in the fields turned to one of discipline and rigid obedience. Fel did not care for the more intellectual studies forced upon him, such as astrogation, but excelled nonetheless, taking full advantage of the educational opportunities afforded by the Galactic Empire's most elite academy. He took much greater enjoyment from physical pursuits, though, such as combat training, mechanical classes, and grav-ball, where Fel, wearing number seven, captained Carida's Inter-Academy League team and often led it to victory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fel's favorite part of Academy life, however, was piloting. He trained in TIE/LN starfighters and simulators until only fellow cadet Han Solo rivaled his skill and set new heights for cadet performance. He studied their technical systems, learning to repair the starfighters as well as fly them. Fel gained a reputation as a hotshot cadet, among the Academy's elite, and challenged Solo often. Despite their similarities, fellow Corellian Solo did not care to befriend Fel, whom he regarded as too rural and quietly disciplined to fit in with his roguish friends. There was, however, a mutual respect between the two, and Fel regarded Solo as a heroic officer with a bright future ahead of him. One friend he did have, though, was a close one: Darv Eldon, who had been a tight friend on Corellia before applying to the Academy himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fel performed as well academically as he did in the cockpit and graduated from the Imperial Military Academy as salutatorian behind Solo. Darth Vader and Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin themselves were present at the ceremonies, and Tarkin congratulated Fel on his accomplishments.

He was assigned to command a flight of the sixth squadron of the 37th Imperial Fighter Wing under Captain Lun Tessra, considered a prime assignment for an up-and-coming officer. Based aboard the Dreadnaught-class heavy cruiser Abrogator, Fel quickly cut his teeth on combat with a mission to Saloch\u00b2, suppressing remnants of the Lortan Fanatics and saving the local Tunroth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 6/37th continued its campaign against the Lortan Fanatics leftover from the crushing of the Reslian Purge, and Fel guided his men through many battles, taking special care for their welfare and taking the fight to the enemy. He became a strong leader, as Captain Tessra suffered from what was known as temp-flu: with only weeks left in his one-year tour of duty in a TIE fighter, Tessra hung back and took no risks, neglecting his men and hoping to be one of the lucky pilots to survive a year in a TIE. During that time, Fel took the initiative to protect his men and provide a firm leader to the squadron. After Tessra's tour was up, Fel took on command of the squadron, drilling it and building habits of order and study, emphasizing post-battle analysis. Under his guiding hand, the 6/37th became a squadron known for its fierce and efficient performance, considered among the Empire's best."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a year of fighting the Lortans, Fel was promoted to captain and set to be transferred out of the squadron and into fleet operations, as was customary. However, when he learned that the last refuge of the Lortans had been discovered and would be assaulted in what would likely be a bloody fight, Fel felt that it was his duty to stay with his men. It was a feat to survive one tour of duty, and few would have blamed Fel for choosing to move on. However, he volunteered for another tour of duty in the 6/37th, claiming that it was where he could do the most with his talents. The offer was accepted, and Fel served out another full year with the squadron; his survival marked him as an elite pilot indeed. Tessra had been scheduled to take command of the squadron after Fel's departure, as his performance after his transfer had been lackluster; whether he or Fel ultimately took command after Fel decided to stay is unclear. Fel's extraordinary performance marked him out as an outstanding pilot, and his exploits became well-known throughout the starfighter corps."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Naval service"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When his second tour of duty was finished, Fel finally accepted a transfer to fleet operations in the Imperial Navy. He earned the naval rank of captain; being around 24-25 years of age, he was one of the youngest men to ever achieve that honor. Fel commanded patrol ships for the Imperial Customs agency long enough to develop a healthy respect for the capabilities of smugglers. The great majority of his time in fleet operations, though, was spent aboard his largest command: the Dreadnaught-class heavy cruiser Pride of the Senate. For two years Fel commanded the Pride, which he found old, outmoded, and underwhelming in performance; he longed to move up to command of a Star Destroyer. If not that, he would have preferred to be back in the cockpit; he certainly did not care to make a career aboard the Dreadnaught. Nevertheless, he was determined to do the best job possible with the command he had. Fel's men, including his executive officer Commander Toniv and his navigator Commander Rosk, admired and respected him, for his past accomplishments and for his command style and care for those under his command. He had a strong rapport with the TIE pilots aboard the ship, who had even more reason to be impressed by his past and with whom he felt a special connection. By 2 BBY, Fel was attached to the Sector Group for Hutt Space, under Admiral Winstel Greelanx; he, Captain Reldo Dovlis, and Admiral Greelanx commanded the three Dreadnaughts of the relatively under-supplied fleet under Moff Sarn Shild's command, making Fel one of the senior officers in the Sector Group. Commanding the Carrack-class cruiser Vigilance was Captain Darv Eldon, Fel's old friend with whom he remained close. At some point, he ended up being stationed at the Imperial Classified Flight Yards for a brief period, where he acted as a test-pilot for various experimental TIE fighters, including the TIE/AG Aggressor starfighter, TIE/HU Hunter multi-role starfighter, TIE/D Defender, and the TIE/ph phantom, eventually giving insight into the basic stats of each fighter based on his experiences at the Flight Yards in the official field guide for the Imperial Military, the Imperial Handbook: A Commander's Guide."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 BBY, Moff Shild, who had previously been benefiting from Hutt graft, responded to Imperial scrutiny by declaring a hard line against smuggling. He would send his fleet to blockade the Hutt homeworld of Nal Hutta and raze its city-covered moon, Nar Shaddaa, to ashes in a Base Delta Zero assault. The Hutts joined together to defend their worlds and business; when attempts to bribe Shild were rebuffed, they paid off Greelanx to give them his battle plans and retreat at the first opportunity. This succeeded, though it ultimately proved unneeded; a high-level Imperial communiqu\u00e9 instructed Greelanx to secretly throw the battle as part of a plot to discredit the newly ambitious Shild. Fel was not at all happy with his orders; he felt sickened by the instructions to perform a Base Delta Zero. Fel had until then avoided engaging in any massacres, which were all too common in the Imperial state, but he reluctantly accepted that he must carry out the orders no matter how personally distasteful he found them. Fel also objected to Greelanx's battle plans, which were simplistic and relied on the assumption that the Hutts would be able to put up no significant resistance\u2014Fel, of course, did not know the plans were deliberately poor. He found the plans foolishly overconfident, and seemed to have little confidence in Greelanx's leadership; Greelanx himself knew that Fel was likely to question his orders and was therefore the greatest threat to his ability to lose without being accused of incompetence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the battle commenced, Fel found that the smugglers of Nar Shaddaa had organized an efficient defense; what he did not know was that it was commanded by his former classmates Mako Spince and Han Solo\u2014Fel had been surprised and disappointed to learn that Solo had lasted only eight months in Imperial service before being court-martialed for defending a Wookiee slave. The smuggler coalition launched an ambush of the Vigilance, which was serving as an advance picket. Trapped in Nar Shaddaa's debris field, a swarm of smaller ships overwhelmed it, killing Fel's old friend Eldon. Deeply saddened, Fel's resolve to destroy the smugglers was strengthened. He suggested to Greelanx that the smugglers, having demonstrated the capability for coordinated attacks, should perhaps be taken more seriously as threats. Greelanx, obliged to lose, dismissed him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The smugglers engaged and defeated elements of Greelanx's skirmish line before he moved in his wedge formation of capital ships: three Dreadnaughts and four bulk cruisers. Fel, in the Pride of the Senate, anchored a flank. The Imperials were surprised, however, to find a massive fleet awaiting them as they closed in on Nar Shaddaa; in fact, most of the ships were holographic with falsified transponder signals in an illusion orchestrated by the magician Xaverri. Fel's Dreadnaught was engaged by elements of Drea Renthal's pirate fleet, sustaining proton torpedo attacks from her Y-wings but emerging without significant damage. Instead, Renthal's fleet moved on to Dovlis's Dreadnaught, the Peacekeeper, which they were able to cripple, whereupon it succumbed to Nar Shaddaa's gravitic pull. This provided all the justification Greelanx needed to pull out, and he ordered a full retreat. Fel, who thought that the Empire could still manage a victory, felt that Greelanx lacked courage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Commander Jelon, Greelanx's executive officer, relayed the orders to retreat, Fel angrily objected that there were still TIE fighters remaining in the arena of battle which could not be abandoned. Jelon and Greelanx did not care, and Fel was unwilling to disobey orders. However, he knew that he could obey only the letter of the orders, if not their spirit, by taking his time in the retreat. He ordered the broadcast of an emergency recall of all TIEs to the Pride and followed Greelanx's remaining ships at only one-quarter speed. The docking bays had room for only twelve fighters, but fifteen remained on the field; Fel fit the additional three in his shuttle bay and, satisfied that he had saved all the men he could, caught up with the retreat. Greelanx angrily contacted him, contesting that Fel had disobeyed orders; Fel replied that he considered the retrieval of the pilots and their fighters crucial. Greelanx threatened to end Fel's career, but Fel implied that his own report would depict Greelanx as cowardly and incompetent. Greelanx seemed to back down, but Fel wondered if his decision might cost him his commission. He was, however, relieved that he had not had to carry out a Base Delta Zero, one of the few bright spots of the engagement for him."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Instructor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Greelanx was killed days later by Darth Vader, but the failure of the battle still reflected poorly on Fel. Fel had hoped to receive a transfer to command of a Star Destroyer in the future, but shortly after the battle he was instead transferred to the Imperial Naval Academy on Prefsbelt IV and returned to the pilot corps, likely with a demotion to the piloting rank of captain\u2014inferior to the naval rank of captain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 1 BBY, Fel spent a brief period of time at the Imperial Classified Flight Yards, where he flew a number of prototype TIE models.

Fel's class included cadets Tycho Celchu, Biggs Darklighter, Derek Klivian, Laine, Rens, and the future DS-181-3; Celchu, Darklighter, and Klivian all went on to become legendary pilots, but none were ever able to defeat Fel in simulations. Fel looked out for his students and built a bond of mutual respect with them, fostering trust among students and between the students and himself. When Cadet Laine insulted Cadet Celchu's Alderaanian heritage, Celchu took a swing at Laine. Rather than discipline Celchu, Fel covered for him, holding that Laine had been at fault by insulting a fellow cadet while reminding Celchu that his loyalties no longer lay with Alderaan but with the Empire. During Fel's tenure, a Rebel Alliance cell was found among the cadets; Fel used the opportunity to remind his students that the Rebellion was dangerous and disorderly. When some objected that citizens across the galaxy were feeling that the Empire's methods were too harsh, Fel insisted that the Empire represented order and the protection of those unable to protect themselves; Rebels broke that order and created chaos and danger to the galaxy's citizens."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fel's methods inspired his students to new heights, and the exceptional performance of his cadets gained attention in high places. Nar Shaddaa had damaged Fel's reputation but could not destroy it; Grand Moff Tarkin himself remained interested in Fel, and Fel hoped to join Tarkin's bodyguard unit, an elite squadron which would put Fel at the pinnacle of his career. After two years at Prefsbelt, Fel's class of prodigies graduated. At the ball following the graduation ceremonies, Tarkin extended to Fel an invitation to join his guard. Fel was ecstatic, but the opportunity was abruptly cut off when two of his top prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Darklighter and Klivian, on their first posting, mutinied and took the frigate Rand Ecliptic over to the Rebel Alliance in a planned defection. Though his superiors understood that Fel was not to blame, the defection reflected poorly on Fel and he could not be allowed to continue instructing; instead of transferring to Tarkin's guard, Fel was punitively transferred to the 181st Imperial Fighter Wing, a disreputable unit. His chance at restarting his career had been destroyed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "From disgrace to ace"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 181st, nicknamed the \"One-eighty-worst\", was a notoriously poor unit, a posting for those whose careers were in the gutter. Under the nearly nonexistent leadership of Colonel Evir Derricote, an unimpressive pilot and mediocre officer who was more interested in cultivating his garden than commanding his squadrons, the 181st had almost no discipline and even less motivation, simply whiling away time until the political enemies who had placed the men in the wing sent them to die. This was far from acceptable to Fel. In command of the second squadron, he requested Derricote's permission to bring his men to a sufficient state of discipline and training; Derricote, saying that at least the 2/181st could then die as men, casually agreed. Fel instituted a strict training regimen, raising his men up to his exacting standards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, not long after Fel's transfer but after he had whipped his men into shape, the 2/181st was assigned to retake Ord Biniir, which had been lost to Rebel Y-wings by an entire wing of Imperial fighters. Fel was dismayed at the odds, but his squadron performed superbly, destroying many enemy fighters and driving the Rebels off Ord Biniir. Fel's performance was enough to merit attention on its own, but it so happened that the Second Battle of Ord Biniir occurred on the same day as the Empire's catastrophic loss at the Battle of Yavin. Ironically, had Fel's career not been damaged, he would have been aboard the Death Star with Tarkin's bodyguard unit when it was destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Empire rushed to propagandize Fel's victory and minimize news of the Death Star's loss at Yavin 4. Fel was promoted to the rank of major at a gala event on Imperial Center and feted as a hero. There, he was pigeonholed by two older senators who wished to share war stories, but a beautiful woman abruptly intervened and swept Fel away. Fel was shocked when she introduced herself as Wynssa Starflare, the famous actress. She was Corellian herself, and Fel's accent sparked her nostalgia; she also found him attractive. She took him out of the gala and on a tour of the Palace District, flirting gently with him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fel and Starflare began dating, seeing the sights of Coruscant. This was made much easier by the transfer of the 181st to the Imperial capital, where it was downsized from a wing to a group and rebuilt into an elite unit. Fel spent much of his time recruiting new, elite pilots such as Captain Turr Phennir; he wanted only those with truly exceptional skills and strong devotion to the Empire, accepting no political appointees or glory hounds. Though Colonel Derricote remained officially in command, Fel effectively ran the 181st by himself, shaping it into one of the Empire's most feared units."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time following the Battle of Yavin, Fel flew a TIE/In interceptor during a skirmish against at least one Rebel pilot.

She wanted to accept but was terrified; her great secret, which she revealed to Fel, was that Wynssa Starflare was a stage name. Her real name was Syal Antilles, and her brother was Rebel ace Wedge Antilles. She feared that if that secret ever got out, her career would be ruined, and marriage to Fel would take him down with her. She was also frightened that Fel might be called upon to face her brother in combat and that one would kill the other; Fel was likewise concerned but reassured her that such an occurrence would be unlikely and that, married or dating, the hurt she felt would be the same. He also cast aside doubts about his career, saying that he was marrying her, not her brother. With those reassurances, Fel was able to convince Starflare to join him in marriage.

Starflare became pregnant early in their marriage, giving birth to Fel's eldest son, Davin, and then again to another son, Chak.

Isard presented Fel with his reward for passing the test: the opportunity to help destroy the Rebellion at Derra IV. After her departure, however, Fel remained disturbed by the fact that Isard was now aware of him and likely hostile.

Fel concluded that, in the xenophobic Empire, the only explanation for the admiral's silent presence was that the battle plan was, in fact, his. Fel was familiar enough with Vader's style of battle to analyze the plan and determine that it did not appear to be crafted by Vader, further reinforcing his suspicions.

Fel himself was promoted to colonel, given formal command of the entire 181st, and granted the title of Baron of the Empire by the hand of Emperor Palpatine himself. With the barony came a vast estate on Corellia, to which he moved his family members, who were able to live a life of quiet comfort. The alien got nothing, and Fel's opinion of the Empire's policies soured. Later learning that he had been exiled to the Unknown Regions, Fel was no longer able to believe so purely in the Empire as he once had.

A player in military politics and proponent of the Defender, she somehow angered Fel, who became a fierce critic. When Ryad and her Red Star Squadron began attacking any unexpected ship they came across, she was convicted of treason and hunted down and killed by Fel. In this time, Fel also gained the skills of Emperor's Hand Maarek Stele, another legendary Imperial pilot who transferred into the 181st.

New cadets looked upon him as a legend, while those he had actually trained felt even more strongly of his skill, having seen it firsthand. Rumors throughout the pilot corps had the renowned Darth Vader himself fearful of Fel's talent in the cockpit, though no evidence of an actual rivalry existed.

A squadron from the elite 181st was dispatched, but the planet's defense remained under the command of Admiral Lon Isoto, an officer more interested in debauchery than defense and widely regarded as completely incompetent. When the squadron of Fel's pilots was defeated by Antilles's elite Rogue Squadron and Brentaal IV's moonbase taken, Fel was enraged that Isard had spent their lives in what he could perceive were her political games. She ordered Fel and the rest of the 181st to Brentaal, taunting him with the possibility of having to kill Antilles; by this time Isard had apparently found the pair's connection.

Isoto then praised Fel for his humility and declared the holiday of \"Fel's Day\" in honor of the baron. Phennir engaged Fel at the celebration, uplifted by the \"victory\", but Fel attempted to disabuse him of that notion, telling him that Brentaal IV was a political trap from which no glory would come; Fel in fact could perceive clearly that Isard intended to throw away the lives of his men for her political gain.

During her time with the Galactic Alliance representatives, Wynssa mentioned Cem; she was notorious for spilling secrets, but Fel's ally Formbi was convinced that Wynssa only revealed what her father instructed her to."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When several of the party had left, Wynssa was led away by Aabe in what turned out to be a kidnapping. At the same time, Fel was aboard an ice barge, ferrying most of the Skywalker party back to their ship. He was ambushed and forced off course by several agents of a rival, conservative syndic who resented his attempts to bring change to Chiss society, and whose family had been devastated in the Chiss Civil War; this syndic had bought Aabe's cooperation. Fel and the group faked surrender before attacking with the aid of a distracting burst of timed fire from the ice barge's cannons. They downed the enemy craft and captured Ina'ganet'nuruodo, leader of the rival syndic's phalanx; meanwhile, Jacen Solo rescued Wynssa and captured Aabe. The exposure of the plot gained Fel more support as the Chiss saw the unsavory actions of his opponents and caused them to give fuller support to the Skywalkers' mission. Fel apparently took advantage of his access to Chiss medical facilities to replace his right eye shortly thereafter. The mission to find Zonama Sekot was a success, and the Galactic Alliance was able to win the war with Sekot's aid. With the war over, Jagged Fel was appointed to the position of liaison between the CEDF and the Galactic Alliance, where he continued his romance with Jaina, nearly bringing Fel into the Solo family by marriage before the couple broke up. Fel's state was not entirely happy, however, as Chak died during the later years of the war, leaving him with only Jagged, Cem, and Wynssa surviving\u2014half his children were dead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Killiks, an insectoid species dominated by a hive mind, had been the catalyst for the Chiss Civil War, as they had been used as labor before their ability to absorb others into the hive mind absorbed two houses of Chiss. Five years after the end of the Yuuzhan Vong War, the expansionistic Killik Colony sparked a war with the Chiss. Jagged, now a commander in the CEDF fleet, led a task force against the Colony's outpost on Qoribu, where he found that several Jedi, summoned mentally by former Jedi Raynar Thul, now the injured and mind-warped leader of the Colony, were aiding the Killiks. This was a point of great concern for the Chiss, who were invited to the Ossus Academy by Skywalker in an attempt to assure them that the Jedi Order as a whole would act to end the conflict and any Jedi fighting solely for the Killiks were rogues. Fel himself was invited, though he declined on the basis of his position as an officer on the general staff of the CEDF, meaning he should not consort with a current enemy; he did suggest that they attempt an exchange of information on the Jedi. Aristocra Chaf'orm'bintrano was sent instead, where he was accidentally informed of the existence of Cem, but promised to keep it secret."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the conflict, Jag captured the Wookiee Jedi Lowbacca and, after a Jedi peace treaty was forged between the Ascendancy and the Killiks, guaranteed Lowbacca's parole upon his release back to the Jedi. Jagged was promoted to captain for his role, but the Fels' situation came crashing down when the Killiks, with the aid of the Joiner Jedi, restarted the war. Lowbacca fought once more, and the Fel family was, through their guarantee of his parole, held responsible, morally and financially, for his damage to the Chiss Ascendancy. Additionally, Jag was shot down during the final battle of the war, where he was marooned for two years. Fel financed a private recovery operation after the Chiss recovery team was killed in the jungles, though that expedition was destroyed as well. A second private recovery effort was able to find Jagged, who was able to make use of the first team's equipment to contact the second team. The Fel family was unable to pay for all the damages caused by Lowbacca, however, and Jag was forced into exile; banished even from technical membership in Fel's family. He reentered the known regions of the galaxy, where he intended to hunt down Alema Rar, the last remnant of the Killik Dark Nest and restore his family's honor, though he himself could never return. Soontir Fel himself was dishonored and impoverished."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fel would not remain in dishonor forever; in 41 ABY, with the aid of Jaina Solo and the Jedi Zekk, Jagged succeeded in killing Rar and restoring the family's good name. Jagged soon after became the head of state of the Imperial Remnant as part of the Second Galactic Civil War's peace settlement and in 43 ABY became engaged to Jaina Solo. Eventually, Jagged reestablished the office of Galactic Emperor and took the throne of the Imperial Remnant, transforming it into a new Galactic Empire which Soontir Fel's descendants ruled for at least three generations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fel was raised by his family to be dutiful, loyal, upstanding, and a hard worker. The Fel family placed a strong priority on looking out for each other, and fiercely opposed the betrayal of anyone in the family group; instead, any family member should put the rest of the family above himself and be willing to make sacrifices for them. An imposing figure, he had built up his physique through years of hard work as a farmer. Fel followed this ideology in his decision to accept the appointment to Carida; though he valued justice for Post, he could not bring himself to pursue it at the cost AGR would have imposed upon his family. Fel did remain ashamed that he had been forced into such a compromise, however."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Additional values were forged into Fel during his time at the Academy. Fel learned to value discipline, order, and responsibility. He dutifully devoted himself to his studies; Fel was always determined, at all times, to do his very best at whatever task he was assigned, whether he cared for it or not. When he graduated, he took responsibility for his men, building camaraderie with them and taking close care of them, just as he did with his family. He always maintained strict discipline and training, however, as he later did with his children. He considered himself a conscientious and involved commander and was as devoted to do right by them as he was to perform to his fullest in his duties. One of the surest ways to infuriate Fel was to endanger his men, as Isard did. Fel was once known as the Empire's best TIE pilot, and Han Solo claimed that Fel was the best pilot that he had ever met, but that Fel's rigidity prevented him from becoming an even greater pilot. Fel also preferred flying as a starfighter pilot to serving as a command officer on the bridge of a starship, and as such, he did not enjoy his tenure aboard the Pride of the Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fel believed very strongly in the Empire at the outset. He felt that the Empire brought order and protected those who could not protect themselves; he initially believed as well the Human High Culture rhetoric that aliens were lesser species who needed Human protection. However, Fel reconsidered his views on non-Humans after the Battle of Derra IV, where the intellect of the alien Thrawn led the Empire to victory. Fel felt that the Rebellion was unjustified because it disrupted the Empire's order and brought war and anarchy upon those he was sworn to protect\u2014and Fel took his obligation to protect the Empire's citizens extremely seriously."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fel did not approve of all Imperial practices, however; he did not care for the execution of Base Delta Zero attacks, the destruction of Alderaan, or other such massacres, being opposed to causing the deaths of civilians. He appeared to regard them not as inherent to the Empire, though, but as the result of orders on the part of individual officers whom he felt, if he were ever assigned to one, he could and should counsel away from such measures. Fel did accept, however, that such extreme actions could sometimes be carried out for a greater good and was resigned to follow any lawful orders he received."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fel's disillusionment with the Empire grew, however, after witnessing Thrawn, an alien, perform a central role in winning a crucial battle. Aliens, he saw, were capable of performing as well as Humans and could indeed outperform them in defending the Empire; therefore, the Empire's rationale for its humanocentrism fell apart in Fel's eyes. Isard's testing of Fel's loyalty also contributed to his doubts, though he constantly reminded himself of his duty to the Empire's citizens and hoped that the regime would change its ways. When the Empire dissolved into infighting and chaos after Endor, Fel's belief was further undermined. Isard's sacrifice of his men for her own aims was the final straw."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fel had time during his captivity to think over the conclusions he had avoided drawing during his Imperial service. The Empire was not, and perhaps never had been, the shining institution which he had originally viewed it to be. For the first time, he considered that the New Republic might, at this juncture, represent order and stability better than the Empire, and that its values might now be more in line with his own than the Empire's. He joined and in short order became a true believer in the New Republic cause, championing equality and democracy, and he wanted more Imperials to see that the New Republic could represent the best values of the Empire without its oppression, though he was struck by occasional doubts about turning his back on all he had fought for previously, especially with his separation from his wife. Fel considered himself as having genuinely turned over a new leaf with his conversion, and was determined to make amends for any previous sins. However, he did not care to have his Imperial past held against him by others, given how many Rebels were former Imperials themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fel had little conflict over returning to Imperial service, however, when approached by Thrawn. In the Empire of the Hand, he saw an Empire which lacked the flaws of the Empire proper, and he considered its mission absolutely vital. Furthermore, he was not called to fight against the New Republic himself, though how he felt about Thrawn's war against it was unclear. Both with the Empire of the Hand and later with the Chiss, Fel found a culture which matched his devotion to duty, discipline, and order, and Fel fully embraced Chiss values."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his noble title, Fel was not an aristocratic man. He believed that those with power should serve, not be served by, those without as their duty. He enjoyed gardening and physical activity and, while he did not unnecessarily deny himself, Fel did not indulge in extravagance or excess during his time as an Imperial hero. When he moved to the Unknown Regions, he was satisfied to exist in harsh and unforgiving circumstances with little or no luxury."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fel was deeply in love with his wife, Syal. He was quite devoted to her, and refused to cheat on her when given the opportunity. When she disappeared, he was extremely distraught, and spent much of his time alone and brooding, looking at holos of her. She was the only person known to call him by his nickname Tir, and he spoke tenderly to her where he usually kept his emotions hidden with most others. Fel loved his children as well and was quite proud of them, but also served as their superior in the military and so was required to deal with them more brusquely in that role. He was deeply saddened by the deaths of half his children, but accepted it as part of serving in the armed forces\u2014even given that he had issued the orders which sent them to their deaths and had brought them up with his own military-centric sense of duty and unrelenting high standards.

Editor Peet Janes asked Stackpole to come up with an \"Imperial Red Baron\" to complement the New Republic aces of Rogue Squadron, a concept Stackpole thought was in line with fan desire to see an Imperial fighter pilot perspective. Timothy Bradstreet illustrated Fel for the trade paperback covers of In the Empire's Service and Blood and Honor using his brother, Bob Bradstreet, as reference. Bradstreet and Janes wanted Fel to have a similar look to the renowned World War I fighter pilot Manfred von Richthofen, known as the Red Baron, appearing to be a \"master of the skies.\" Stackpole used Fel throughout the X-wing series in order to explore issues surrounding the Empire. Upon Stackpole's mentioning him to Timothy Zahn, Zahn decided he could use the character, causing Fel's appearance in Zahn's Hand of Thrawn Duology. Zahn and Stackpole worked together to outline Fel's entire career as backstory material in preparation for his appearances.

Those releases were followed up with X-Wing Rogue Squadron 25, in which Fel's extensive backstory, already given broadly in In the Empire's Service, was detailed.

Presumably, Stackpole referred to The Reenlistment of Baron Fel, which he created with Zahn as a six-part comic. When the X-wing series was canceled, the storyline was reworked as a four-part short story, a format in which Stackpole and Zahn had collaborated before.

Fel's only other novel appearances were in The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey and The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee, though he received frequent mention throughout the New Jedi Order series and subsequent Dark Nest Trilogy and Star Wars: Legacy of the Force series due to the prominent role of his son Jagged in those series.

If Fel spawned, he attacked the player while flying TIE Interceptor and if he was defeated, the player received an award and Fel immediately departed from the system and entered hyperspace.

While not portrayed as anything more than suspicions in the final book, author Jason Fry revealed in his endnotes that he did intend the military to be considering Fel as a possible leader.

Refugee filled in the missing two as Cem and Wynssa. Survivor's Quest, however, created the character of Chak, a Fel son older than Jagged; the shadow child retcon allowed there to be five public Fel children and one, Cem, hidden. Chak's existence also created other complication, as his age\u2014approximately early or mid twenties\u2014did not allow him to have been born after Fel's transition to the Empire of the Hand, as the other Fels' ages did; in fact, it barely allowed time for him to be born after, rather than before, Fel's marriage. Therefore, he must have existed during Fel's time in the New Republic, but no mention of him was ever made, while Fel constantly fretted about his wife, and no one in the New Republic displayed any knowledge of any Fel children, only of Syal, suggesting very strongly that Chak's existence was kept secret.
