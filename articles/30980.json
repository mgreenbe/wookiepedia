Designed as a vessel of war, most of the cargo space was taken up by additional power generators. These generators were necessary for the additional heavy weapons and powerful deflector shield generators. The rest of available space was taken over by the massive capacitors of the two turbolasers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The front part of the freighter was completely rebuilt to reinforce the keel and spine. This allowed the Courageous to carry two forward-firing Taim & Bak XI7 turbolasers of a Nebulon-B2 frigate. Additional armament changed with every new owner, but most of them opted for a top-mounted dual laser cannon turret."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike most other freighters modified as warships, the Courageous did not carry any proton torpedo or concussion missile launchers, because too much space was used by the turbolasers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Courageous came off the assembly lines of the Corellian Engineering Corporation during the reign of Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum during the days of the Old Republic.
