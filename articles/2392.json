The trooper was stationed in a garrison on Bespin's Cloud City after the planet was occupied by Imperial forces led by the Sith Lord Darth Vader in the year 3 ABY. AF-119 was armed with an E-11 blaster rifle. He found his assigned guard duty on Bespin boring, and preferred the excitement of hunting gundarks. AF-119 also found the Cloud City casinos lost their attraction after he was stationed on the gas giant for an extended period."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "AF-119 was created by a card for the Premiere set of Decipher's 2001 Jedi Knights Trading Card Game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
