Following the victory over the Empire, a ceremony in honor of the Heroes of Yavin was held at the Great Temple on Yavin 4. Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan awarded the heroes of the day the Medal of Bravery, the highest military honor the Alliance gave. Although he did receive his own medal in private after the official ceremony, the Wookiee Chewbacca didn't place any meaning in it, as members of his species did not care for tangible awards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, members of the Alliance did not wish to appear ungrateful toward one of its new figureheads. In order to officially recognize Chewbacca's contribution to the victory at Yavin, a large delegation of Alliance officers was sent to the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk, where a huge celebration was held in 0 ABY.

This feast on the Wookiee planet was only mentioned in the interview, but never made any real appearance in narration in any form of Star Wars media. However, the existence of the Kashyyyk celebration was confirmed in the 1998 CD-ROM Star Wars: Behind the Magic, and was also mentioned in \"May The Facts Be With You: Part Two: #51-100,\" an article published by Daniel Wallace in the ninety-fifth issue of the Star Wars Insider magazine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the 1980 short comic The Day after the Death Star!, Chewbacca did receive the Medal of Bravery in private on Yavin 4, at the insistence of both Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. However, this fact does not contradict the existence of the Kashyyyk celebration, and the declarations coming directly from Lucas are considered the highest level of canonicity. The present article thus considers both events canon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
