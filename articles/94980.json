However, his success made him so self-assured that he started disregarding the class system that had been the cornerstone of Trandoshan society for thousands of years.

He found out that one of Glorga's lieutenants, Lanish Ran, was in reality a Rebel agent, and decided to wait for the right moment to expose him. Ran, however, knew that Nakaron had found out. Nakaron knew that Ran had been planted as an agent, but he thought he was an Imperial agent, because he had previously seen Ran while he was posing as an Imperial officer in Forak, and did whatever he could to prove absolute fealty to the Hutt.

He had a sickly greenish complexion due to exposure to the sandstorms of Varic. His skin appeared broken and unhealthy, because he had spent considerable time in the dry desert heat of Lorpfan. However, he was in great physical condition and incredibly strong and agile. He had almost no scars, unlike many of his species, with the exception of some mangled tissue caused by a landspeeder accident."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
