Due to Causus' value to the Empire, he was assigned four bodyguards, to accompany him whenever he went on excursions. Unknown to Causus or his bodyguards, they were monitored at all time by a team of skilled Imperial agents led by Colonel Hadis Ato, who were under orders to kill Causus rather than let him fall into the hands of the Empire's enemies. During the time of the Galactic Civil War, Causus covertly indicated his desire to defect to the Rebel Alliance and the Alliance sent a team of agents to Corulag, to extract him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
