He accompanied several cultists to Zardossa Stix in order to oversee the sacrifice of the captive Queen Julia of Bardotta. The Jedi Master Mace Windu, along with Representative Jar Jar Binks, followed the cultists to the moon to rescue the queen. The trainer was ordered to stop Windu and Binks, summoning a pair of gundarks to do so. As Windu fought the gundarks, Binks scuffled with the trainer. The trainer attempted to escape after one of his gundarks was killed and the other fled, but Binks knocked him down. Windu attempted to question the trainer on the cult's intentions, but he did not answer, only threatening Windu with the arrival of the Great Mother, who, unknown to Windu, was the Nightsister leader Mother Talzin. Unable to obtain any information from the trainer, Windu knocked him unconscious."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
