When the Clone Wars erupted between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Order's members were forced to serve in the Grand Army of the Republic. As the war was waged around them, Ganodi was deemed to be one of the top members of her clan and suitable to travel to the sacred Jedi world of Ilum to participate in the ancient ritual known as The Gathering. Escorted to Ilum by Padawan Ahsoka Tano, Ganodi and several other Initiates met with Grand Master Yoda in the Jedi temple at the mouth of the Crystal Caves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Entering into the caves in search of a crystal for use in her personal lightsaber, Ganodi was accompanied by fellow Initiate Gungi as they searched the labyrinthine caves. Coming across a massive subterranean lake, Gungi was confident that his crystal lay on a frozen island in the midst of the lake. Parting ways so the Wookiee could pursue his own journey, Ganodi delved deeper into the caves, finding her mission to be hopeless as she couldn't find any crystals. Cursing her mentors for sending her into the caves to freeze to death, Ganodi fell into a cave filled with crystals, and was struck by the fear she would not be able to find her own unique crystal most attuned to her. Despite her fear, Ganodi found hope in the Force and was guided to the correct crystal, revealing the others to simply be illusions created by the caves manipulation of her fears. Making her way out of the caves and back to the Temple when the crystal was secured in her pocket, Master Yoda commended her on finding hope in the Force."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Attack on the Crucible"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning to the Crucible, Ganodi and the rest of the younglings were eager to undertake the next part of their training\u2014the actual construction of their lightsabers. On board, they met Professor Huyang, an ancient droid who taught lightsaber construction aboard the vessel. Ganodi was surprised that a droid would be able to train them in a Jedi art form, but Huyang assured the young Rodian that he was more than proficient in the matter. Huyang showed the younglings countless models of lightsabers, then asked them to visualize their own particular models. Once they were able to see their saber in their minds, only then would they be able to build the weapon.
