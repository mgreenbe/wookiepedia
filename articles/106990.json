Native Pamarthens drank it easily, even consuming it before flying. Other non-Pamarthen drinkers had a negative opinion of how drinking it made it feel like they were burning. The wine was served throughout the galaxy for more than two hundred years on planets such as Corellia, Coruscant, and Takodana. It was consumable by Bith, Wookiees, and humans. Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs created a cocktail with the same name and published its recipe in his cookbook, The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Port in a Storm was a sweet, reddish amber, fortified wine that originated on the planet of Pamarthe. It had a reputation for taking even the strongest of drinkers to their knees. The Pamarthen human pilot Greer Sonnel, who could easily down the drink, likened its heat to a fire that simultaneously went to the head and the gut. Senator Ransolm Casterfo of Riosa compared the experience of drinking the beverage to consuming exploding fireworks, then a fireball that expanded like a star, and eventually settled on a supernova being the most apt comparison; after he tried it, he believed it was unfit for human consumption. Nonetheless, native Pamarthens were known to sip the drink as if it were nothing harsher than fruit juice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pamarthens had rituals associated with Port in a Storm. Native Pamarthens who were away from their homeworld for too long were regarded as going soft like an offworlder, but one way they could prove themselves was downing a glass. A great omen of success for a Pamarthen pilot was leaving an empty cup before a flight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The drink shared its name with a saying, \"Any port in a storm.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 232 BBY, a group of Bith from the Outer Rim Territories were drinking Port in a Storm at a Coruscant street market when Jedi Master Jora Malli and her Padawan Reath Silas passed through after capturing some pirates who had been attempting to steal building materials."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In around 40 BBY, the human Jedi Knight and Lord Regent of Pijal Rael Averross had just wished he had ordered a good drink, such as a bottle of Port in a Storm or Corellian ale, when Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn walked into his room and saw he was in bed with Selbie. Jinn's words about propriety made Averross wish even more that he had a drink."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, Port in a Storm was being served at the Outlander Club on the planet Coruscant, and was kept in a tall tube on the counter behind the club's central bar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The beverage was served at Maz Kanata's castle on the planet Takodana at some point between 4 and 5 ABY. While Han Solo was visiting the castle, a 3PO-series protocol droid working there attempted to deliver a drink order that included Port in a Storm along with a Huttslayer Splash on the rocks, two Twi'lek Toppers, and a triple-shaken Outer Rim and Fizz. The droid made the order correctly, but could not remember which table had placed the order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An annual starfighter race called The Gauntlet took place on Corellia in 25 ABY, and attracted several Pamarthen pilots, including Greer Sonnel. Prior to the race, Sonnel emptied a cup of the drink in accordance with Pamarthen pilot tradition, but it had a new effect on her; she felt dizzy and like her thoughts were scrambled by a painful heat behind her eyes, instead of a burn she savored. She visited a medcenter sometime after the race and received a diagnosis of bloodburn, a medical condition that caused dangerously high fevers and grounded pilots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 28 ABY, Sonnel visited a cantina on Pamarthe with Joph Seastriker, a New Republic pilot from Gatalenta, on a mission to collect intelligence for Princess turned Senator Leia Organa. The tavern-keeper, who did not recognize them and was suspicious of the excuses given, asked Seastriker to drink a full glass of Port in a Storm to prove he was a real Pamarthen. Sonnel intercepted the glass and downed it in three gulps, which earned them acceptance from the tavern-keeper and the patrons. Afterward, Sonnel told Seastriker that they could not let the success of their mission depend on his first taste of the drink. When they were on Hosnian Prime for Equinox Day, Sonnel produced a bottle and poured a small amount for Seastriker and Senator Ransolm Casterfo to try, and they drank a toast to Organa. Casterfo and Seastriker soon regretted it as they experienced immediate side effects. Organa was unimpressed when she saw they had been drinking a beverage she characterized as dangerous. In all of Organa's experience, the only non-Pamarthen being she had ever known to willingly ingest the drink was her Wookiee friend Chewbacca. Even the notoriously daring Han Solo would not consume it, though C-3PO said that Solo had employed Port in a Storm as an emergency solvent during starship repairs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY, Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs published his cookbook, The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, which contained a recipe for a cocktail of mixed spirits that was also named Port in a Storm. Tuggs said that his cocktail would warm drinkers' bodies while cooling their nerves. He compared it to the relief and euphoria felt after safely navigating the hazardous Akkadese Maelstrom."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Port in a Storm was retroactively established by Star Wars: How Not to Get Eaten by Ewoks and Other Galactic Survival Skills to have first appeared in the 2002 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. The novel Bloodline by Claudia Gray first identified the drink as Port in a Storm. Bloodline and the short story \"Scorched\" by Delilah S.
