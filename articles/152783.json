Papanoida, the Chairman of Pantora. The two hunters ambushed the Papanoida girls in their apartment on Coruscant, and the Gotal brought Amanwe to a cantina on Tatooine. The Baron and his son, Ion, tracked Greedo down, however, and coerced him into bringing them to the cantina. Upon their arrival, the Gotal immediately grew suspicious and began to question Greedo's actions. When Amanwe was brought out of captivity and spotted her father, a firefight broke out, and the Gotal hid behind the bar until the Papanoidas had killed the majority of the cantina's other patrons.

The two Papanoidas were both daughters of Baron N. Papanoida, Chairman of Pantora; Sib Canay of the Trade Federation hoped to use them as leverage in an effort to convince Pantora to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems, with which the Federation was aligned. The Gotal thus entered the Papanoidas' apartment on the planet Coruscant along with the Rodian bounty hunter Greedo and silently waited for them to return home. After their arrival, the Gotal sneaked up behind Eekway and rendered her unconscious before pointing a blaster pistol at Amanwe. Although Amanwe bludgeoned Greedo with an idol of the Pantoran Moon Goddess, the Gotal fired a stun blast at her, and the two hunters departed the planet with their quarry."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eekway was held in Canay's possession, but the Gotal brought Amanwe to a cantina in the city of Mos Eisley on Tatooine. He was in the cantina shortly afterward when Greedo entered along with N. Papanoida and his son, Ion, who had earlier subdued the Rodian. The Gotal was suspicious when Greedo, who was in fact being held at blasterpoint by Ion, ordered a Weequay to retrieve Amanwe, and he began to question his partner's actions. Greedo nervously claimed that he had been sent by the Trade Federation's Viceroy, Nute Gunray, and that his companions were Federation emissaries. Amanwe was then brought into the open; she called out to her father and a firefight erupted between the Papanoidas and the various denizens of the cantina. The Gotal hid behind the bar until the Papanoidas had killed the majority of their opponents, and then slowly began to rise and point his blaster at the Baron's back. Amanwe spotted him, however, and fired a shot into his shoulder, knocking him over and bringing the skirmish to an end."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gotal was immediately suspicious when Greedo ordered that Che Amanwe Papanoida be retrieved from captivity, and was persistent in his consequent interrogation of the Rodian. He doubted the validity of Greedo's nervous claims that Nute Gunray had contacted him and altered their deal, and that the two Papanoida men were emissaries from the Trade Federation. When a firefight began, the Gotal opted to remain in hiding rather than rush headlong into the fray, and attempted to stealthily fire on his foes when their backs were turned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This Gotal appeared in \"Sphere of Influence,\" the fourth episode of the third season of the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, wherein he was credited as \"Gotal\" and voiced by Gideon Emery.
