When they were based on Courkrus in 11 ABY, they tended to gather in a cantina called the Mynock Hole, which included a secure and luxurious hideout that other Invids could not access. Corran Horn, in his \"Ghost Jedi\" guise, penetrated their hideout and put on a dramatic display to frighten them. While the Blackstars did not abandon Courkrus like the Fastblasters, their ranks were decimated by desertion following this incident and the later \"Great Hutt Roast\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
