They were repelled by the Je'daii Order at Tython, though the Rakata have established a command post on Ska Gora. The Je'daii have allied with the Settled Worlds and appointed Rajivari as the general of their joint forces, and also constructed Forcesabers with the aid of the former Force Hound-turned-Je'daii Xesh\u2014but the weapons forced the Je'daii to draw upon the dark side of the Force. The mad Je'daii Daegen Lok has been freed from his imprisonment on the moon of Bogan and allowed to lead the Je'daii into battle against the Flesh Raiders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Je'daii foresee the Infinite Empire's attack on the planet Shikaakwa, they arrange for their forces to ambush the enemy in the swamps surrounding Ryo Fortress, which serves as a command post for the Tythans. As the Flesh Raider soldiers of the Empire make their way through the swamps around Ryo Fortress, Xesh ambushes a group and engages them in battle. Xesh dispatches many of the Flesh Raiders, and when a Force Hound tries to attack Xesh, the Je'daii Ranger Shae Koda intercepts the Force Hound atop her rancor-dragon Butch. Koda kills the enemy's mount, and Xesh defeats the Force Hound when his opponent survives. Xesh and Daegen Lok then flee from a trio of destructive Rakatan annihilators, and Xesh convinces Lok to order an airstrike on their position in order to take out the enemy walkers. Despite the presence of other Je'daii in the area, Lok orders Hawk Ryo and his Hunter-class starfighters to bomb the Annihilators. Amid the chaos, the Je'daii Sek'nos Rath saves his ally Trill and ferries her out of danger. In Ryo Fortress, General Rajivari oversees the battle despite criticism from Baron Volnos Ryo, and upon learning of the successful attack on the Annihilators, he orders Masters Tave, Quan-Jang, and Tem Madog to launch their primary assault against the Rakatan forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rakatan commander, Sub-Predor Ceh'let, informs Predor Skal'nas of the heavy losses that her forces are taking, and Skal'nas allows Ceh'let to withdraw her forces to Ska Gora. Despite the Rakatan retreat, the Flesh Raiders continue to fight, and as a result Xesh orders the Je'daii to wipe them all out. Hours later, Lok gives a victory speech to the remaining Je'daii, though Sek'nos Rath storms off in disgust, as he dislikes how the Je'daii are embracing the dark side. Xesh struggles to recall where he remembers Trill from, and he and Shae Koda share a moment before Koda departs. On Ska Gora, Ceh'let openly challenges Skal'nas's authority in front of the other commanders, prompting Skal'nas to end the war conference and speak to her in private. Skal'nas explains that the Rakata are losing their connection to the Force, and that he seeks the Infinity Gate built by the Kwa species that supposedly exists on Tython. With the Infinity Gate, Skal'nas hopes to reverse the decay of his species' Force potential, and by doing so become the ruler of the Empire. However, after explaining his plans, Skal'nas then executes Ceh'let with Force lightning as punishment for challenging him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Main characters"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi: Force War 1 is the first issue in Dawn of the Jedi: Force War, a five-part comic book miniseries produced by Dark Horse Comics.
