He entrusted the holocron to Wyn, to return it to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant when she transferred there for special training under Master Windu. After Sirrus was killed in the conflict, Wyn retained the holocron as she fought alongside orphaned Padawans of the Padawan Pack and the Jabiimi Loyalists. Knowing she would not survive a forthcoming battle to delay the Jabiimi Nationalists, Wyn passed the holocron on to Anakin Skywalker who was tasked with overseeing the evacuation of Republic forces from Jabiim. In this way, Wyn was able to keep her promise to her master."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
