The priests used the Force to forge tools which were stronger then those crafted by a common blacksmith. Additionally, the priests tended to the city's incendifers, great duracrete aquifer-like constructs that carried lava instead of water. Using secret rituals to conjure the power of the Force, the priests could smooth cracks in the duracrete with a touch. As an order that did not accept payment for their services, Cendiary Priests accepted alms from those grateful citizens and humbly accepted housing in a smithy's home as payment for work completed in their forge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
