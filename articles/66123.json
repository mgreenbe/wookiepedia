Use of the facility was not to be permanent; Palpatine had already begun construction on his new throne room at the nearby Imperial Palace and, upon its completion, would take up residence within."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Layout"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Constructed below the Emperor Palpatine Surgical Reconstruction Center in the upper levels of the Coruscant Medical tower, the Emperor's throne room was a long and narrow chamber that resembled the holding office located below the Grand Convocation Chamber in the Senate Rotunda. A wide but short burnished staircase bisected the room into two levels, with the upper level dais replete with long permaplas windows. A pair of the Emperor's Royal Guards were to stand at attention at the staircase's foot. Behind the Guard stations was a table for Palpatine to meet with his Imperial Advisors, and behind that table stood his large mechanized throne, integrated with the building's communications and computer systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As his old offices were in ruins in the Republic Executive Building, Palpatine ordered the removal of most of his Sith statuary and artwork and had it transferred to his new throne room. Flanking the door and windows were the bronzium statues of the Four Sages of Dwartii and the Massassi frieze recounting the Great Hyperspace War adorned the walls. Directly above the throne room in the restricted Reconstruction Center was the Dark Lord of the Sith's private meditation chamber and repositories of the dark side of the Force knowledge banks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
