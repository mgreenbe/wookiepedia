During the year 5 ABY, the Gran, along with numerous other Gran bounty hunters and Grave Tuskens, were hired by the Dark Jedi Jerec to patrol the city of Barons Hed, located on the moon Sulon. At some point, the Gran grouped with four other Gran, one named Shmorg, and headed to a local cantina. After ordering drinks from the bartender, Shmorg offered to pay the bill. The Gran countered Shmorg, and offered to pay instead. Shmorg did not take kindly to the Gran's generosity, however. An argument started, which soon engulfed the entire party. The heated exchanging of words quickly turned into an all out bare-knuckled brawl. Although none of the Gran were armed, save for one Gran who had a belt of thermal detonators, the terrified bartender shouted for the violent aliens to refrain from using blasters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As soon as the brawl began, the New Republic agent and Jedi trainee Kyle Katarn entered the scene while searching for a way into a large tower in the center of Barons Hed, known as the Government House.

In the guide, author Rick Barba theorized that the Gran were fighting over a bar tab, and advised the player to wait out their fight until at least two Gran were killed, and that after that the player should kill the remaining Gran and pillage the bar's supplies. It is never made clear which Gran is the one represented in this article. However, due to the fact that completing this encounter is not necessary for beating the game for either of its two endings, this portion of the game can be skipped completely without effect."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
