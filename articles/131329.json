I just never in my wildest dreams thought I would have a chance to execute them.\" The creative team met with Lucas, Johnson and Kasdan before writing the script; according to Abrams, Lucas explained many of his own ideas about the Force and the midi-chlorians. Terrio also spent some time doing extensive research into the Expanded Universe and recent Star Wars animation; he was influenced by many of those stories in writing the film, comparing the process to writing nonfiction: \"When we would make a story decision, we were fully aware that this now will become canon, and so are we sure that this is the right story decision? Are we sure about it character-wise? Are we sure about it thematically? Does it seem like it gels with George's original intentions from Episode IV?

During the process, they collaborated on ideas with Kennedy, Michelle Rejwan, Rick Carter, Roger Guyett, Kevin Jenkins, Michael Kaplan, and Neal Scanlan.

If you couldn't follow it, if you thought, from a fan's point of view, that you're stepping outside the lines and it was a bogus kind of thinking, no one was afraid to say that because we knew how important this was to get right.

Certain aspects of the story changed significantly during pre-production, and the film had frequent dialogue changes from day to day. Producer Kathleen Kennedy claimed that Palpatine's return (an idea first used in Star Wars: Dark Empire) was planned from the beginning, although Trevorrow believed it was a new idea by Abrams. According to Terrio, he and Abrams didn't use anything from Trevorrow's script, although \"There may have been certain elements that we used that had been in the original script and we weren't aware of it. The Guild makes the determination about those things.\" Regardless, Trevorrow and his frequent writing partner Derek Connolly received story credits in the final film. In regards to The Last Jedi's influence on the film, Abrams told Esquire: \"As a filmmaker, working on episode IX, amazingly, nothing that he [Rian Johnson] did in Last Jedi got in the way of things that we had talked about wanting to do down the line, ideas that I had about where things might go, so\u2026 it wasn't like his story somehow derailed the things I wanted to pursue. In fact, strangely, they might have even helped strengthen them because we got to make some choices that sort of take advantage of the fact that Rian hadn't done the things that we were thinking about doing.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lucasfilm dispelled rumors that it would digitally recreate Fisher in future films. Fisher's brother Todd said that he and Billie Lourd had granted Lucasfilm rights to use footage of her. Kennedy initially claimed that Ms. Fisher would not appear in the film, though Abrams later confirmed that Ms. Fisher would appear in the film via unused footage from The Force Awakens. Mr. Fisher credited this decision to Abrams, who said, \"It was like finding this impossible answer to this impossible question.\" According to Mr. Fisher: \"There's a lot of minutes of footage. I don't mean just outtakes. This is unused, new content that could be woven into the storyline. That's what's going to give everybody such a great kick. It's going to look like it was meant to be. Like it was shot yesterday.\u201d He also claimed that unused footage from The Last Jedi would also be used, but Abrams later clarified that no footage from that film was used due to nothing substantial being available. Ultimately, ILM placed Fisher's facial performance onto a digital body, with an on-set stand-in serving as a visual reference for the actors. This allowed the character to be placed in new locations, and for the effects artists to give her different clothes and a new hairstyle that would be unique to The Rise of Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Production"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Principal photography began at Pinewood Studios on August 1, 2018, under the working title of \"trlXie\" (originally \"Black Diamond\").

There's less pressure for it to be right. We just want to make a good movie and have a really good time while doing it.\" Abrams shot many of the character interactions in long takes, with actors sometimes coming up with their own lines. Daisy Ridley also commented: \"There was this thing: JJ would ask us to do the scene without speaking, just to feel the emotional\u2026 whatever. He was like, 'You never know what could come up.'
