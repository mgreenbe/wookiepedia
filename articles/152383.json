Members of the species had tentacles protruding from all parts of their body, some of which they used as limbs. A group of scavengers belonging to the species began dismantling the light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon while it was hidden in the junkyards near the Imperial Weapons Factory Alpha. The protocol droid C-3PO, who was inside the Falcon as it was being taken apart, attempted to initiate the starships autopilot feature in order to pick up a group of Rebels who had sabotaged the weapons factory. The droid discovered however that autopilot was not functional due to the scavengers work, and was ordered by the Falcon's owner, Han Solo to prevent the creatures from further dismantling the ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The species first appeared, but went unnamed, in Star Wars 1 a comic book illustrated by John Cassaday and written by Jason Aaron. The comic book was released in 2015, and was the first comic published by Marvel Comics after they re-obtained the Star Wars license.
