The ship locked onto an AT-TE with its magnetic claps and brought the walker to the designated drop zone. They were used by the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, and by the Galactic Empire as well. They could also carry K79-S80 Imperial Troop Transports and RTT-04 armored troop transports."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Low Altitude Assault Transport carrier produced by Rothana Heavy Engineering was a heavy airlift variant of the Grand Army of the Republic's Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunship. Initially designed as a carrier for the All Terrain Tactical Enforcer, the LAAT/c was a fast, lightly armed vehicle used to transport walkers and other heavy vehicles, such as RX-200 Falchion-class assault tanks, to the battlefield for fast deployment. These large, 175,000-credit airspeeders allowed Galactic Republic Army commanders to move and deploy their armored forces quickly and efficiently."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like the LAAT/i, from which the carrier was derived, the LAAT/c had a long, narrow fuselage with a broad, armored flight deck forward and a pair of high-mounted, downward angled wings mounted aft. Two huge ion engines were mounted in armored nacelles above the wings, which provided the vehicle with a blistering straight-line maximum speed of 620 kilometers per hour and a maximum altitude of 100 kilometers per hour. The troop compartment of the LAAT/i was replaced with modular articulated electromagnetic clamps and other cargo-handling equipment used to carry and deploy vehicles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While not a frontline combat vehicle like the LAAT/i, the carrier still possessed a respectable defensive weapons load-out, armed with two light laser cannons mount in ball turrets below the flight deck, and two more were mounted aft beneath the speeder's engines for both anti-fighter and anti-personnel purposes. In addition, four unguided air-to-ground rockets were mounted beneath both wings, which provided the craft limited light anti-air capabilities and the ability to clear fighting vehicles and droids from contested landing zones. The LAAT/c was also equipped with medium-ranged sensors, had a passenger complement of two for capacity, and crewed by a pilot and co-pilot, while also possessing a cargo capacity of fifteen metric tons for encrumbance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
