Shortly before the end of the war, the SoroSuub Corporation began donating spare ships to the Alignment, including several Quasar Fire-class bulk cruisers which were refitted into light carriers, like Flurry. These carriers were used to carry Zebra starfighters, C-73 Tracker starfighters, and Z-95 Headhunters. After twenty eight years of fighting, the Alignment finally defeated the Aristocracy and ended the war, shortly before the Battle of Endor. The new Alignment government sent what forces it could spare to the Alliance force massing at Sullust, including twenty-two warships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
