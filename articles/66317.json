At the Resistance base on D'Qar, one such toggle was placed in every command room. It was meant to be used only in a kay-one-zero base abandonment scenario. Dec Hansen once activated the switch-off in order to prevent Jothan Tiaan Jerjerrod from wiping the memory of Hansen's droid \"brother\" AG-90. That incident nearly killed a whole squadron of starfighter pilots, who were forced to land their crafts on a pitch-black tarmac because of the power shutdown. Due to quick thinking, there was not much damage, but Hansen and his comrades were still severely punished for what they did."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
