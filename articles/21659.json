Byd Chillings and other slicer NPCs were not part of any quest but they were indirectly involved in the so-called \"Meatlumps Theme Park\". In the basement of the Slicer House, there was a bomb that the player had to defuse as part of the quest \"Muddle the Meatlumps\". While there were several slicer NPC enemies in the house, none of them had to be killed for the mission. \"Chronicle Relics\" could be looted from them. Such relics could be used by players in the Chronicle Quest system to create their own quests for other players. By using the relics related to the slicer NPCs, the quests would task the player with killing Byd Chillings or other slicers in the house. Chillings was a Level 56 Gold Elite NPC, which meant that he was considerably stronger and harder to kill than normal NPCs at this level."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
