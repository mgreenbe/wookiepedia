During the middle of the battle, the droid commander's ships had crippled the enemy fleet and had ordered this droid to send in the B2 battle droids. Later in the battle master Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano came to aid Aayla aboard LAAT/i gunships to rescue the remaining survivors. Then this droid was ordered to destroy the cruiser but the droid tried to remind TF-1726 that there were still droids fighting inside the ship but he had no attention for them. The droid followed the command and the cruisers fired all batteries at the defenseless ship which caused it to explode leaving Skywalker severely damaged but failed to stop the Jedi onboard their escape ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
