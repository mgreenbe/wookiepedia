During this incident, a number of beings were killed and eaten by the rathtars. Finn was familiar with the event, and hoped that Rey hadn't heard of it due to its extremely vile and depraved reputation, with him ultimately confirming that she hadn't heard of it while discussing three rathtars that the smuggler Han Solo and his partner Chewbacca had brought onboard the Eravana."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
