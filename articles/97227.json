Derlin described how after General Han Solo split the Endor strike team, Derlin kept his team out of site. At one point, he had to stop Delevar from taking a pot shot at scout trooper. When they set down to rest, their scanners picked up an AT-ST. When it approached their position, Derlin ordered Dansra Beezer to jam communications, then Greeve shot out its searchlights. The walker opened fire, and Delevar approached it with a Caspel launcher, who shot a smoke grenade right into the cockipt. The strike team forced the AT-ST pilot to make a radio check-in, and the next morning, the team met back up with Solo's team."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
