Graush's fifty-year reign of terror and cruelty produced a dizzying amount of corpses, which he then experimented on using Sith magic and alchemy to produce a zombie army. At some point in his life, Graush had replaced his heart with a dark side Force-sensitive crystal, which, after his death, was used to capture the spirits of his zombies.\nThe crystal was laid to rest with Graush's remains and the zombies lay dormant until a being touched the Heart."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
