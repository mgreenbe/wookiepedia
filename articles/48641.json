A preliminary version of the yacht was inspired by the high collar of Bela Lugosi's vampire costume of the 1931 film Dracula. In earlier versions of the script, however, Dryden Vos' operations base was an island fortress with a canal system like Mont-Saint-Michel, rather than a ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
