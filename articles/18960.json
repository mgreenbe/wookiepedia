A bombard squadron was comprised of two torpedo lines, a skirmish line, and a pursuit line, for a force of vessels numbering between twenty to twenty-eight. Bombard squadrons were deployed against planets that had successfully rebelled from the Galactic Empire, and had significant ground forces that would take a long time to defeat in conventionial warfare. At least one Torpedo Sphere was usually present in this formation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
