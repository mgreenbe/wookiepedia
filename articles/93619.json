Before Armo was sent to a detention moon via the Imperial prison barge Purge for committing a crime, Bostt was paid back money by the family with the profits from their farm season. In the post-post-script of a letter to Tso, to be delivered by a guard from Purge named Wembly, Armo warned his wife that Bostt was a piker and may try and swindle her into paying the money to him again. The letter was recovered aboard Purge after its occupants were decimated by a plague so it is unlikely that it reached her before it was released to the public for academic purposes in relation to the history of Purge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
