It was located in the Riverlands, near the city of Tyrena. Its owner, the farmer Zorajas Garamin was a very delusional individual who believed he could actually farm droids by planting them in the ground. Unsuccessful, he tried watering them more often, blocking sunlight, using Banthamax 4600-SL fertilizer and even talking nicely to them. Around 1 ABY, Garamin complained to Corellia Times reporter Vani Korr that his droids were sabotaged. Interested about possible sabotage from the technology-hating Meatlump criminals, Korr dispatched a spacer to investigate the farm. Indeed, the spacer did not find any sabotage which could explain that the droids did not \"grow\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zorajas Garamin's farm was a location in the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011.
