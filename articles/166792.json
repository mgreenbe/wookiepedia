Shortly before the onset of war, the hackers were wiped out by forces put together by the Corporate Alliance. The Alliance was tipped off to the facility on the asteroid by the testimony of Denlace Sachoore. A force of large, treaded tank droids was dispatched to the asteroid, and quickly dismantled the training facility. Several Galactic Republic Senators questioned the use of excessive force in eliminating the facility, despite the fact that the asteroid was located within the boundaries of Corporate Alliance space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
