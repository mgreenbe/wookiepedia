Pontoons could be used to build boats, or be fitted to the underside of starships that made occasional water landings.

These pontoons could be filled with pressurized gas, or the ship's landing jets could be modified to divert gas into the pontoons. Despite this, the YT-1300 was perfectly capable of making emergency water landings without pontoons, so long as it was properly maintained."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Millennium Falcon was fitted with flotation pontoons.
