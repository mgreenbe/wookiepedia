The circle is trimmed in gold, symbolizing the right of the people to govern themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Older sources mentioned it was taken from the seal of the Old Republic itself, but as none of the different seals of the Old Republic looked like the Rebellion's crest, this information seems now deemed non-canon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
