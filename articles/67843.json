His first year as senator took place during the Separatist Crisis, in which succession from the Republic greatly increased and the the Separatist Confederacy of Independent Systems formed. During the crisis in 22 BBY, the senator of the Corellian sector, Garm Bel Iblis, announced that his sector was closing its borders and removing itself from senate proceedings concerning the Military Creation Act, a proposal for the creation of a Grand Army of the Republic. Paddie was highly critical of the Corellians' decision due to their relative wealth compared to his own sector and the HoloNet News quoted the senators views on the matter in a piece concerning Corellia in HoloNet News Vol. 531 47."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that same year, a package was found in the Sermerian First House in the city of Addolis on Sermeria, which caused the House to be partially evacuated for three hours due to fears the package might be dangerous. Addressed to both to Paddie and President Dibra Born, the package contained a doll effigy of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine covered in stone mites.\nWhen Palpatine created a Loyalist Committee from the Senate to negotiate with the Separatists and handle the situation, Paddie was named amongst the ten initial members. The group were tasked with creating a six month action plan for handling the Separatists. They received large amounts of criticism from other senators who saw them as Palpatine's attempt to create a partisan body in an attempt to sway the Military Creation Act, although the members of the committee were strongly divided on the matter. Ultimately the Act was successful and a Grand Army of Clone troopers was formed, which the Republic used to combat the Separatist Droid Army used by the Confederacy in the Clone Wars, which began shortly after the Acts success."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his time as senator, Paddie was a loyalist who was particularly close to the office of Chancellor Palpatine. Palpatine declared that he thought of the senator as one of the most trusted, skilled and intelligent members of the senate upon his addition to the Loyalist Committee. As befitting a noble of his status, he carried the regal airs of a noble and wore ornate, golden robes whilst in the senate and sported an orthodox hairstyle from the planet Halbara."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ister Paddie was played by William Clay in Attack of the Clones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Paddie's ornate headdress is reminiscent of that worn by the Imperial Dignitaries introduced in Return of the Jedi.
