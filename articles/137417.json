Unlike their Commission for the Preservation of the New Order counterpart, Surveillance was a relatively small operation, with one agent for every seventy employed by COMPNOR. Despite the fewer personnel assigned to the organization, it kept watch on more serious threats than its rival. Surveillance agents sorted through mountains of material on megascandocs and were trained to make sense of the information to discover suspects bent on anti-Imperial activity. Surveillance agents were thoroughly briefed on their mission, and assistance from local system cells was often called on."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Surveillance agents were well trained in combat skills and other appropriate talents, and were expected to perform solo in the field without reinforcement.
