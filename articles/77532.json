Imperial Security was searching for Thrylle, so he needed a loyal sympathizer to deliver the message.

Though the spacer came across an Imperial Probot, he quickly destroyed it, and handed the message over to Loruk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrylle was happy with the spacer's progress, but still had one final task. A soldier of the Alliance needed to collect important Imperial documents from Thrylle, but he needed help escorting the soldier to him. Thrylle was sure that once he handed the datadisc to the Alliance, he could get arrested twice an hour without risking any further information. So the spacer, dedicated to help the Rebellion, agreed to find the soldier, named Rodius Tharn. Fortunately, the spacer managed to find Tharn, despite the intervention of the Tatooine militia, and escorted him back safely to Thrylle. Thrylle was thankful, but had no further work for the spacer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kormund Thrylle is a Non-Player Character (NPC) in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies.
