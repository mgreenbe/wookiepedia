A pirate by the name of Rav is looking for him and Screeger is trying to buy his way into the cantina's safe house. Cade Skywalker bursts into the cantina along with his partners Jariah Syn and Deliah Blue announcing themselves to be Bounty Hunters looking to collect the bounty on Screeger's head. A Jedi in hiding by the name of Hosk Trey'lis believes that Cade is there for him and Force throws a table at Cade and Syn. Hosk makes a run for the door but is shot with a sleeping dart by Deliah. Hosk turns and Force pushes Deliah back but is taken down when Syn hits him with a thud-bug. Cade captures Screeger and is confronted by the Brogar for capturing someone that has paid for Brogar's protection. Cade makes a deal with Brogar that he won't tell the \"Imps\" that Brogar was sheltering a Jedi if Brogar allows them to take Screeger. Brogar agrees and Cade takes Hosk and Screeger back to his speeder. Hosk begs Cade not to turn him over to the Sith but Syn informs Hosk that he won't find any pity from Cade and that Syn and Cade once worked for Rav the pirate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Coruscant, the Jedi Temple has been rebuilt but now serves as the Temple of the Sith.
