He retained this particular failure as \"a cautionary reminder not to overstep one's competence,\" that he was not immune to fallibility and to \"always think three times before acting\" upon any given technological enterprise and, even then, to \"always prepare three alternatives\" as insurance against failure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
