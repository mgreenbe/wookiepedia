Resting deep below the towering structures comprising Nar Shaddaa's ecumenopolis, the Undercity was home to shipyards owned by the Hutt Cartel, until its demise in 4 ABY. During her teenage years, the Mirialan Hylo Visz worked in the shipyards as a mechanic. It was also home to the Evocii of Evocar and the native Nar Shaddaa inhabitants, the Ganks. Just as Han Solo had endured the Coruscant underworld, and never revisit it, he did the same with Nar Shaddaa's Undercity. In 26 ABY the Undercity was ultimately destroyed along with the rest of the moon's surface by the Yuuzhan Vong."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
