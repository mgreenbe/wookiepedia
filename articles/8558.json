He was formerly romantically involved with Just Lucky, an assassin who undertook jobs for the Sixth Kin for some time. At some point after Lucky no longer operated for the Sixth Kin, Yu confronted his brother, Pak, who was indebted to Delphis, leaving him with a bruise on his face. After Lucky went back to working for the Sixth Kin to pay off the debt, he met Yu while returning to Delphis following a successful job, and Yu threatened him about his brother's situation. Yu accompanied Lucky as he entered the organization's headquarters to meet with Delphis, as the leader had wished to meet with both of them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
