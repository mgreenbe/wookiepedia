When the war ended, Ch'gally continued to study as a Sentinel, maintaining the role of investigator. Working intimately with the droids in the Jedi Temple analysis wing, Ch'gally would advise students on patience when it came to dealing with the computers there, as they provide answers only to those who thoughtfully requested them. At some point, Ch'gally entered into work with the Acquisition Division and helped acquire several hundred Jedi Initiates throughout his career."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Master Ch'gally, while a believer in the Force, also stressed a reliance on one's own skills.
