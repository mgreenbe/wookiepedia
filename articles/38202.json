In their belief, the Ho'Din were originally mobile plants, but they were transformed into animals as punishment for their sins against the [Dinegia], or passive force of nature. Only by acting as stewards of their natural environment could they complete the [Flik'a kirki]. If they did this, they would be reborn as plants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ho'Din customs mirrored these beliefs.
