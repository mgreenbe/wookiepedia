It consisted of two sheet crystal paddles connected to a control pack powered by rare thaissen crystals found only on Mimban. When an individual was placed between the paddles, the device would produce a hologram of the person in question. If the individual was Force sensitive, a blue corona would surround the hologram. If the individual was tainted by the dark side then the hologram would have red marks in the blue corona."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some of the devices were recovered on Coruscant by Wedge Antilles, and Luke Skywalker later used the devices in his efforts to find candidates for his Jedi Praxeum at Yavin 4. Dark Jedi Brakiss stole a few of the devices and used them to discover potential students for his Shadow Academy. Luke later disdained their use, although it is known that Kyp Durron used one to test his Padawan Miko Reglia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
