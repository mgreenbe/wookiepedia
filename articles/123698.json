They were made up of numerous strands of a light blue material. When seen in the ultraviolet spectrum, it appeared to have numerous colors that had no name in most sentients' tongues. These cloaks appeared to be a riot of colors to species who could see into the ultraviolet, including colors such as berl, crynor, nusp, and onsible.
