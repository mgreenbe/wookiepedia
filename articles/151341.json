The youngest of four sons, Ulric joined the Imperial service after his brother Cassio, and both brothers became high-ranking officers. But Cassio's death in the Battle of Yavin made Ulric the focal point of his eldest brother, Baron Orman Tagge's plots to gain the favor of Emperor Palpatine. Orman's used his family connections to get Ulric placed in charge of the Imperial blockade of the Yavin system, and in turn Ulric provided military support to several of his brothers' schemes, most notably an effort to destroy a Rebel fleet in the Feswe Corridor with a superweapon called the Omega Frost. The Omega Frost endeavor turned into a disaster after the interference of Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker, and both Orman and brother Silas Tagge were seemingly killed, leaving Ulric as the new Baron Tagge. Afterwards, Ulric retired from Imperial service to focus on his new duties with the Tagges' business holdings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A native of the Core World of Tepasi, Ulric Tagge was born a younger son of the rich and venerable House of Tagge, the owners of the megacorporation known as the Tagge Company and one of the galaxy's wealthiest and most prestigious families. Ulric grew up in the shadow of his three elder brothers: Orman, groomed from birth to be the family's next Baron; Silas, a natural-born scientist; and Cassio, a careful strategist destined to go into military service. Awed and intimidated by his brothers, Ulric spent much of his youth with his sister Domina, with whom he felt most comfortable. Ulric and Domina were eventually separated when Domina was sent to Monastery in order to join the Order of the Sacred Circle, a religious organization the Tagges hoped would keep Domina free from Imperial and corporate intrigues\u2014 afterward, Ulric followed Cassio into the Imperial Military, earning a reputation as an effective, if unimaginative officer. Tagge was promoted to General by the time of the Galactic Civil War, personally commanding a starship called the Peacehawk, and promoting an ambitious young man named Zertik Strom to First Officer after Strom distinguished himself by crushing a rebellion among the Poporov merchants of Armstiss. Strom served Tagge brilliantly in that position, going on to become one of the youngest officers ever to command his own fleet of patrol ships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ulric's rise up the Imperial ranks was mirrored by his brother Cassio, who himself became a high-ranking general and, by 0 BBY, the head of Imperial Army operations aboard the Death Star battlestation. However, Cassio was killed when the Rebels destroyed the station during their stunning victory in the Battle of Yavin, leaving Ulric as the focal point for Orman's plots to gain the favor of the Emperor. Orman used his family connections and political maneuverings to secure Ulric a post as a Major General and command of a Tagge fleet that blockaded the Yavin system after the battle on behalf of the Imperials. Ulric directed the blockade with assistance from Orman and Silas, who operated a device known as Achtnak Turbine Station in order to effectively disguise starfighter runs on the Rebels' Yavin 4 base. However, Orman and Silas were nearly killed when Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker destroyed the station, sending the Tagges back to the drawing board."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before long, Orman and Silas returned to Ulric with another plot, much to the General's chagrin. This time around, the elder Tagge brothers had developed a superweapon called the Omega Frost, which they hoped could freeze an entire Rebel fleet. Although Ulric was skeptical about Orman's desire to upstage the Sith Lord Darth Vader, he again pledged to lend his brother the support of his battle group, pending successful tests of the device on the desert world Tatooine. When the experiments on Tatooine proved successful, the Tagge brothers met again above the planet Feriae Junction, where Orman transferred the Omega Frost's conductor towers onto Ulric's Star Destroyer. The Tagges set up the device within the nearby Feswe Corridor, a major Rebel supply route, and planned to use the Omega Frost to obliterate a fleet of Rebel gunships. Ulric's part was to stay nearby to provide any needed military support, as well as provide a record of his brothers' success to the Emperor. However, Skywalker managed to destroy one of the conductor towers, foiling their plot\u2014moments later, Ulric watched as the Rebel gunships destroyed his brothers' Mining Explorer, seemingly killing both. Ulric himself managed to escape the Rebel assault, and indicated on his official report that the defeat was merely the result of a standard blockade action."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Believed by the galaxy to be the last living Tagge brother, Ulric suddenly found himself the new Baron Tagge. He soon received another unwelcome surprise in a visit from Darth Vader, who wanted the truth about the defeat at the Corridor. Tagge spilled the beans after experiencing a Vader Force choke, after which Vader revealed a secret that shocked Tagge to his core: Orman and Silas still lived, having somehow survived the destruction of their ship. Vader held Orman and Silas in life support capsules aboard his Star Destroyer, and offered to keep their survival a secret\u2014allowing Ulric's claim to the title of Baron to remain unchallenged\u2014in exchange for his unquestioning loyalty and obedience. Tagge accepted the offer and traveled to Monastery to meet with Domina, who had since become the leader of the Order of the Sacred Circle. There, Tagge informed her that Orman and Silas were dead, and that her best chance to get revenge on Skywalker was to join forces with Vader. After visiting Domina on Monastery, Ulric retired from military service to focus on his new responsibilities as the steward of the Tagges' business holdings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike the flashy and ambitious Orman, Ulric Tagge was content not rocking the boat\u2014growing up in the shadow of his three elder brothers, Tagge simply wanted to be seen as a competent military officer unburdened by excessive imagination or aspiration. Of his siblings, Ulric was only particularly close with his sister Domina, and solely felt real happiness when in her company. But the death of his brother Cassio at the Battle of Yavin flung Ulric into Orman's plots, and the youngest Tagge brother dutifully followed. However, while Ulric played his part in Orman's schemes, he did not always do so eagerly, as he was often dubious of their success and wary of Orman's animus towards Darth Vader. Ulric was proud of his new station upon ascending to the title of Baron Tagge, and jumped at the opportunity to keep his surviving brothers hidden away in Vaders custody, attempting to justify his decision as concern for his sister Domina."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ulric Tagge first appeared in Star Wars 31, written by Archie Goodwin and released in 1979. A \"General Tagge\" previously appears in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, and Goodwin originally intended the two characters to be one and the same, with Ulric having escaped the destruction of the Death Star at the end of the film. However, the 2004 Wizards of the Coast supplement Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds established the movie general's first name as Cassio, while the original StarWars.com Databank conclusively established Ulric and Cassio Tagge as brothers. During Tagge's comic appearances, he was illustrated by Carmine Infantino."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
