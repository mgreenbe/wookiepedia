At some point prior to the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, the Rebel Alliance formed a base in the asteroid belt, from which the rebels, which included a number of humans, communicated with their undercover operative Gita, who was disguised as the Tusken Raider \"Urrr'k.\" When Gita was recruited by the Hidden Hand criminal syndicate, she contacted the rebels at the base and informed them that the team of bounty hunters she had joined was beginning its hunt for the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader. The rebel who received the message at the base then passed it on to Gita's superior, Aeliar, who also resided at the base at the time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Fellio Asteroid Belt appeared in the first issue of the 2019 comic-book series Star Wars: Target Vader, which was written by Robbie Thompson, illustrated by Marc Laming and Cris Bolson, and published by Marvel Comics on July 3, 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
