She plans to cover her tracks and leave Tatooine, but is attacked by an unknown figure. She assumes it is Lando, but it turns out to be 12-4C-41, seeking vengeance for the torture and destruction of his \"brothers\" on Cloud City. 12-4C-41 releases the droids that EV-9D9 has tortured so they can take revenge on her.
