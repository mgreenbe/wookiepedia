The clones don't see any droids, even though their scanners say otherwise, when one spots three super battle droids and an Armored Assault Tank. A battle droid in the tank tells the clones to surrender. The clone trooper commander responds by ordering the shuttle into the air and his troops to open fire. The clones destroy the super battle droids and climb onto the AAT while looking for a weak spot. Before they can destroy the tank, however, the droid inside flees out the back hatch, leaving victory for the Republic. After failing to get any information about R2-D2 from the captured battle droids, the commander notices that their shuttle hasn't returned. Believing that they have been abandoned, the clones commandeer the AAT with their gunner acting as pilot. The commander tries to keep up morale inside the cramped cockpit just as their tank appears on someone else's viewscreen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
