They were quadrupeds with three black clawed toes on each of their feet and a fourth claw on their heel. They were large enough for a human to ride on their back. Thuvasaurs were predominantly brown in color, with darker brown scales covering the upper half of their body and outer sides of their limbs, and light brown scales covering their underside including half of their thick tail and their spiked throats. Thuvasaur's had a brown eye surrounded by a semi-circle of spikes on either side of their head and a single horn located at the tip of their nose above their mouth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thuvasaurs were at some point domesticated and tamed, but after adapting to the harsh conditions of the world Eiattu 6 they became cold-blooded predators. Unlike their cousins in the dewback family, thuvasaurs were capable of harming others and dwelt in non-dry habitats, although they still did not like deep swamps. Expert creature handlers could train fierce thuvasaurs to act as riding animals, strapping saddles to their backs and bridles in their mouths."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thuvasaurs were imported to Eiattu 6 for sport as tame and domesticated animals, but once there they began adapting to the harsh environment. In a matter of time, they had destroyed all of the local predators and moved to the top of the foodchain. During the Great Galactic War, thuvasaurs were used as mounts or kept decoratively in some buildings and could be purchased for 50,000 credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, a stable master on Eiattu 6 spoke with the Rogue Squadron pilot Wes Janson about thuvasaurs. Janson later relayed the information to fellow pilots Tycho Celchu and Ibtisam while they were out patrolling the wilderness of Eiattu 6 near some deep swamps. Celchu and Ibtisam were surprised that the thuvasaur and dewback were related given the differences between the two creatures. When the pilot Dllr Nep heard something out in the swamps, Antilles and Celchu realised it would probably not be thuvasaurs in that kind of environment and so went to investigate, discovering Imperial forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The thuvasaur was first mentioned in the comic book X-Wing Rogue Squadron 14, which was written by Michael A.
