Also aboard the Daring was his crew: his first mate Kohlbacca, a female albino Wookiee; and Herren, a human who was the ship's gunner and engineer. However, the ship collided with an asteroid and was severely damaged. With the life support systems failing, Dindau sent at a distress call to any nearby ships.
