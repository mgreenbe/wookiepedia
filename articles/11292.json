Their stock was limited, with barely a half-dozen among the core of the Resistance. X-wing pilots were also cross-trained on these newer models. The pilot Pattros Navesh led assaults against Resurgent-class Star Destroyers in the craft. At least six were present at the Battle of Exegol between the Resistance and the Sith Eternal, including two flown by Enanan Supa and Pattros Navesh. One was shot down by ion cannon fire shortly after the Resistance forces exited hyperspace into the skies of Exegol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The B-Wing appears in the 2019 saga film Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker.
