Manufactured from high-density plastoids, and covered with exceptionally strong hardwoods, the power cane had the appearance of a simple walking cane. Hidden inside a spring-loaded compartment however, was a 30-centimeter stiletto blade, which was attached to a power source and vibro generator. When desired, the handle of the cane could be released by the spring, sending the hidden short sword into waiting hands. It also had a power point on top, disguised as an ornamental gemstone-like top, that could be used to deliver a shock as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
