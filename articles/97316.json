The sensor-baffling coating would allow the ship to avoid detection, but could be nullified if the ship traveled too fast, as the engine emissions would negate the sensor baffling. As an anti-sensor coating, Nightshadow could also be used to line smuggling compartments against scans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
