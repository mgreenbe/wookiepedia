Intended as a fail-safe in the case of Thrawn's death, the clone remained in his cylinder beneath the facility for almost ten years. But in 19 ABY, the clone was discovered by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and the former Emperor's Hand Mara Jade, and the clone was destroyed when the cylinder's generator was overloaded in a fight with the facility's defenders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke Skywalker, Mara Jade, and R2-D2 discovered Thrawn's clone during a mission to Nirauan in 19 ABY.
