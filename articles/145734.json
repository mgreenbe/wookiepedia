The following year,[source?] the Jablogian crime lord Azmorigan was eating a platter of fruits including a thorn pear for dinner when he was visited by the \"galactic entrepreneur\" Lando Calrissian and his associates on board his C-ROC Gozanti-class light cruiser Merchant One. After trading the slave Hera Syndulla for a puffer pig with Azmorigan, Calrissian left and the crime lord continued his dinner, biting into one side of a thorn pear as he held it. Covering his face in the fruit's juice as he ate and then spitting some it out onto the floor, he offered the rest of the half-eaten morsel to Syndulla, who turned it down and soon after escaped from his ownership."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the same year, the father of human Crucival native Hazram Namir slipped a slightly bruised thorn pear into his son's bag when the long estranged pair met by coincidence at a bazaar on the planet Crucival. Namir, who went by the name Umu Seven at the time and had been in the bazaar to purchase supplies for the Opaline Creed he served, was puzzled when he later discovered the fruit and then nearly dropped it when he realised that it was a gift. Not wanting the pear, he placed it in the storeroom of the cloister that he and the rest of the Creed dwelt in."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A thorn pear first appeared, albeit unnamed, in \"Fighter Flight,\" the fourth episode of the first season of the animated television series Star Wars Rebels, which premiered on Disney XD on October 13, 2015.
