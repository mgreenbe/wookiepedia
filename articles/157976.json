Unkajo and several smaller common wampas attacked the Imperials during their planning session, forcing them to defend themselves against the vicious animals. After the smaller wampas were dealt with, all efforts were concentrated on taking down the giant Unkajo. Hamstringing the huge wampa limited the range of its deadly claw swipes, and eventually it tired enough that one soldier could deliver a finishing blow. After the battle Kyrisa herself revealed her presence to the group from across the ridge. Furious at the defeat of her pet, she ordered a pack of Hoth hogs to attack the Imperials."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unkajo, however, had survived, and was present in the Wampa Valley near Echo Base during the Battle of Hoth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
