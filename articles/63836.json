He trained to race in the Voxx Cluster, a racetrack owned by a swindling Hutt, Vranki the Blue. In the years following the Galactic Civil War, Hype left Vranki and the Voxx Cluster[source?] and resided on the ocean planet Castilon in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. During the era of the New Republic, Fazon became known as one of the most talented pilots on the Colossus, a large refueling station located on Castilon. In his early days on the Colossus, he was friends with fellow racer Tamara Ryvora. However, they fell out of contact after Fazon earned a place in Ace Squadron, a group of the best pilots on the platform. As the leader of the Aces, he had the callsign \"Ace One.\" In addition, his personal starfighter was designated Green Ace due to its appearance and affiliation. Together, the Aces flew defense for the Colossus, and therefore, protected the platform from various threats to its security."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like his teammates, Fazon competed in the Colossus' racing tournaments, which became the source of his fame. In time he became known as Ace Squadron's top racer, and by 34 ABY had not lost a race in two years. As his popularity increased, Fazon acquired the patronage of numerous high-end sponsors\u2014including Aunt Z's Tavern and the Office of Acquisitions\u2014a fact which Fazon advertised by covering his starship in their logos.

Fazon, as he usually did during missions involving them, instead went down to Aunt Z's Tavern, where he encountered Xiono of Team Fireball, a colleague of his old friend Ryvora. Xiono, who was secretly a spy for the Resistance, had heard that Captain Imanuel Doza might be working for the First Order and was trying to figure out a way into Doza Tower, location of the Aces' Lounge. Fazon spotted Ryvora sitting at Team Fireball's booth, but didn't get a chance to approach her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Fazon came across Ryvora and Xiono talking about him in the hallway, as Ryvora was listing off reasons she disliked Fazon. Wanting to repair their friendship, Fazon invited the two of them up to the Aces Lounge, an invitation Xiono was happy to accept. At the lounge, Fazon complimented Xiono on his performance in his solo race against Torra Doza. He shortly got into an argument with Ryvora about the Fireball, the old racing ship she was repairing, as he thought she would never become a star racer with a ship that old.
