The image used for the painting came from the art book From Pencil to Pixel: The Art of Star Wars Galaxies. The ship itself was added in the game's first expansion pack, Jump to Lightspeed, in 2004 as an enemy-controlled ship and became player-obtainable as part of the Chapter 8: The Nova Orion Crisis update on January 15, 2008. The painting was one of nine paintings given out randomly to players of the game for the game's first anniversary of release in the United States and Europe. The painting was later added to the \"rare loot system\" in Hotfix 17.10 on October 7, 2010. The system allowed players to loot rare items from any enemy in the game. The player could use the painting in their house as decoration."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
