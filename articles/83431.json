At some point in time, the moon had broken from its orbit and drifted between the two worlds, and the inhabitants of neither planet knew which it had originated from.

A crisis broke out after members of the Directorate kidnapped rulers from both Eiram and E'ronoh, holding them in caves on the lost moon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
