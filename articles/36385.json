After losing the original factories at Omar to Zaarin and retaking ZA-13, Emperor Palpatine ordered the manufacture of TIE Advanced as a top priority. To that end, a Convoy Designated Rope 17 was sent to retrofit and upgrade the facility.

Stele engaged both fighters to find more Y-wings attacking the Plant. As the convoy reached ZA-13 more Y-wings and B-wings arrived but these were destroyed by Stele. Soon more Z-95s arrived with 4 CR90 corvettes, Cobra. Despite the corvettes armed with a missile launcher, Stele managed to destroy all 4 corvettes. Soon a final wave of Rebel starfighters which started with Y-wings to attack the convoy, followed by A-wings to attack the TIE Defenders and lastly X-wings arrived to attack the plant, all destroyed by Stele as the convoy delivered the cargo to ZA-13 and jumped to Hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel attacked also included the use of Mag Pulse Warheads, that could disable and drain a ships lasers on any craft it hits.
