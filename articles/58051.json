After working as a pirate for two years, Mabin had earned the nickname \"Gunda the Terrible\" and operated a small fleet of heavily-armed freighters. She would rob her victims of everything they had, before selling any survivors into slavery. As a result, a bounty of 50,000 credits was placed on her head by the authorities in the Perrinn sector and a number of criminal organizations became angered by actions she had taken against them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Mabin's image in the sourcebook Pirates & Privateers, she is depicted with a lightsaber sheathed on her belt.
