The Sergeant complied and after infiltrating the village, leaving behind several Separatist corpses, the commando discovered that Bellis had been murdered previously and the agent's field box was nowhere to be found. The Sergeant was contacted by Lieutenant Aric Jorgan who told the Commando to recover the Bellis' field box from his house. The Sergeant did so and acquired the field box with the needed intelligence from Bellis' wife, leaving the village afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
