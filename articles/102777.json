As a child, Accu developed a passion for boating, which he could exercise freely in his native Lake Country. Some time later, he went on to serve in the Royal Naboo Security Forces as a soldier and a pilot. Like many of his fellow Security Forces members, he worked with the sectorial forces of the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Accu retired from the Security Forces, he continued to serve the royalty by joining the staff working at the Royal Palace in Theed. In that new capacity, the man would fly major public figures, including royal family members and important politicians.

He was hired by the House Naberrie, whose member charged him with taking care of their summer residence on the Varykino island. As Varykino was located in the middle of a lake in his native region, Accu was glad to accept his new employment. When the Naberries made trips to their estate in the summer, the former soldier would often pilot the boats or speeders for the family's youngest daughter, Padm\u00e9. Under the name of Amidala, the girl ended up becoming Queen of Naboo in 33 BBY, at age thirteen, and Accu retained fond memories of taking her on thrilling rides in his gondola speeder back when she was a child."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, Amidala\u2014now a representative in the Galactic Senate\u2014returned to the Varykino estate with her Jedi protector, Anakin Skywalker following an assassination attempt on her person.

Seeing that the senator enjoyed the ride like she used to, Accu made sure to take his time reaching the estate's shore. After the boat made it to its destination, Accu helped Amidala and her protector unload their baggage. When Skywalker decided to travel to Tatooine, Accu again transported the pair to a landing pad where the Senator's H-type Nubian yacht was docked."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 22 BBY, Paddy Accu was an older, light-skinned man with graying hair. Although he appeared surly to strangers, he was a loyal and helpful man. He liked to share his passion for boating with those he transported aboard his gondola speeder. When riding wildly across the water, he would show his easy-going side, laughing mischievously all the way. When Amidala and Skywalker visited Varykino, Accu wore a lilac shirt with a laced neck and a folded over collar, a pair of blue pants and a dark, sleeveless vest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Paddy is only seen very briefly in Attack of the Clones, helping to unpack suitcases from a gondola at Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala's home in the Lake Country."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
