The base, constructed from a renovated Celestial Watchtower, was discovered by the Opposition, a political group who also opposed Czerka, who reported its existence to Lord Regent Rael Averross, along with the Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. The Jedi chose to investigate the base, accompanied by Aveross and Captain Deren of the royal guard, who, as the leader of the blackguards, warned the outpost. When the Jedi arrived, they found the base hurriedly abandoned, though they managed to uncover communication records that led them to guess Deren's treachery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
