Their mission was to defend the bunker that housed the shield generator protecting the second Death Star during its construction. Eventually, the Rebel Alliance learned that a second Death Star was being constructed and dispatched a strike team, led by General Han Solo, to the forest moon with the mission of destroying the shield bunker. It was the Alliance's hope that once the shield generator was sabotaged, a massed Rebel Fleet could then approach and destroy the partially completed Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Rebel infiltration, Misik and his fellow scout troopers stumbled across the Alliance soldiers in the woods surrounding the shield bunker. What ensued was a speeder bike chase between Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, Misik, Barich, and a number of other scout troopers. During the pursuit, Misik and another scout found themselves engaged with Skywalker; Misik's partner Drelosyn was eventually killed, and Misik and Skywalker locked their bikes together in an effort to make the other bail out or crash. Realizing that they were on a collision course with a rapidly approaching tree, Misik broke off while Skywalker jumped from his doomed speeder bike. Hoping to take advantage of the situation, Misik turned his bike around in an attempt to gun down Skywalker with his speeder's blasters. However, Skywalker managed to deflect Misik's bolts with his lightsaber, and sliced the steering vane off Misik's bike as the scout trooper flew by. Powerless to save himself, Misik's speeder bike spun uncontrollably, eventually crashing into a nearby tree, killing him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his career as an Imperial soldier, Misik developed a reputation within the military as an accurate and lethal shot with a blaster.
