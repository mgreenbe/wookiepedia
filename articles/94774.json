The speeder was unshielded and did not possess armaments. One participated in the battle to retake Theed from the Trade Federation. It carried three commandos. That speeder was escorted by Group 3, and met up with Group 2 and Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes at the Theed Courthouse. Sykes and the others escorted the transport to a gate blocking their way to the Theed Hangar, where it disgorged the commandos so they could blow the gate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The transport appears only in the 2000 video game Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
