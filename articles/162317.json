Vurrsk and his tribe attempted to buy outlawed weapons from a group of Dupei monks, but the monks stole credits from the tribe, leading Vurrsk and the Trandoshans to attack in retaliation. To solve the conflict, the Jedi Order sent Jedi Master Eno Cordova and his Padawan Cere Junda to Nameel, where the two Jedi attempted to discuss the matter with both the Trandoshans and the Dupei. Both sides claimed to be innocent, leading to an argument that was stopped when Junda pushed both the monks and the tribe back with the Force. Cordova stepped in, intending to speak with both parties individually to determine the truth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Cordova spoke to the Dupei, Junda accused the Trandoshans of being at fault. Vurrsk dismissed Junda because of her young age, refusing to follow any orders she gave. Another member of the tribe challenged Vurrsk's authority, leading to a second altercation.

However, Junda's interference in the challenge to Warlord Vurrsk insulted the Trandoshans, turning them all against the Jedi Padawan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Junda evaded an attack from Vurrsk, causing the warlord to trip and fall onto the ground.

Cordova emerged from speaking with the Dupei, having learned that they had been stealing credits from Vurrsk's tribe, and found Junda standing over the incapacitated Trandoshans.
