Due to the fact that Naboo had been Emperor Palpatine's homeworld, the planet became a rallying point for Imperial sympathizers. The Imperial Navy deployed three attack forces to wipe out the New Republic presence in the system, however, the attempts were foiled by Corona Squadron, an X-wing squadron of the New Republic Defense Fleet.
