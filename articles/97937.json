Nokk's skills as a hunter impressed her clan's elders, gaining the envy of Skikkesk, a hunt leader in the clan. As part of Nokk's coming-of-age ceremonial hunt, Skikkesk forced her to kill and skin a baby Wookiee. Nokk refused, and was exiled from the clan. Many of her sisters were killed, but Nokk managed to escape, finding work as a hunter. Skikkesk eventually fled before his actions could be discovered by the elders, and later became a wanted criminal in the Outer Rim."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
