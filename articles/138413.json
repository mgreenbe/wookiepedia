The droid suggested that they retreat from the city of Lessu, because the Galactic Republic would be able to take it soon, but Tambor refused to listen. The Republic forces pressed on, with the help of native Twi'lek freedom fighters. Again, TA-175 suggested a retreat, but Tambor refused, as two Multi-Troop Transports full of stolen treasure were arriving."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was these transports that allowed two Republic ARF clone troopers, Stak and Razor, to infiltrate the city and activate the plasma bridge leading to Lessu. This permitted the Republic and Twi'lek attack to continue. After Tambor continued to delay departing, even after being ordered by Count Dooku to do so, TA-175 decided Emir Tambor was a fool and left, departing in Tambor's own shuttle. The tactical droid then informed Count Dooku that Tambor had been captured, as he was too greedy to retreat in time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
