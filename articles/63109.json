Lucien Bender was a mad scientist who used to conduct experiments on his own sons. However, prior to the Battle of Yavin, the three young boys managed to escape their abusive father with the help of a mysterious individual who would later become the Meatlump King. This man adopted the three boys and raised them as his own. After Imperial assassins attempted to kill their adopted father, the Bender brothers founded the Meatlumps, a gang of fanatical technology-hating thugs, criminals and terrorists. While the Meatlump King became the ideological and public leader of the Meatlumps, the Bender brothers handled the daily operational details of the gang activities. They were based in a secret hideout located beneath the city of Coronet. It was Draykken Bender who named the Meatlumps after their favorite food. In response, their father Lucien created the Bofa Treat Gang, also named after food."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Battle of Yavin, two Imperial officers, Major Tery and Colonel Frost, discovered that the three Meatlump leaders were in fact three brothers. Analyzing the Meatlump attacks against Imperial researchers, Frost and Tery hypothesized that the father of the three brothers could have been himself an Imperial scientist at some point. Later, the reporter Vani Korr of Corellia Times confirmed their conclusion and revealed the filiation of the three brothers in the article Who are the Meatlumps?."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 1 ABY, Hraykken and Draykken decided to attack a droid factory that manufactured helper droids on Corellia.
