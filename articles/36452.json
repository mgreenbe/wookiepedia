In 44 ABY, he spoke out against slavery and introduced the Senate for a request on trade goods that were produced in areas with legalized slavery. His speech, in which he expressed himself as support for this measure, was interrupted by the removal of Chief of State Natasi Daala, as a result of a Jedi coup. The Lecersen Conspiracy were also planning on usurping Daala at the same time, which if it had coincided with Rockbender's speech, it would've raised the Senator's stock."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
