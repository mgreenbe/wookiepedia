When the Confederacy of Independent Systems targeted Mahranee for its plentiful resources, the native Mahran people appealed to the Jedi Order for aid. Jedi General Chubor brought a Galactic Republic task force of clone troopers to Mahranee, but they were too late to prevent the Confederate forces from laying waste to the planet's capital city. Though Chubor's detachment tried to escort thousands of Mahran civilians off-world to safety, the Separatists were unwilling to leave any survivors, killing the Mahran refugees alongside the Jedi and clone soldiers. Separatist leader Count Dooku unequivocally blamed the Jedi Order for the massacre, leading the Jedi High Council to finally sanction an operation to assassinate Dooku as a means of stemming the war's casualties."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, the final year of the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems set its sights on capturing Mahranee, a member world of the Galactic Republic, whose abundant resources made it a valuable target. As a result, the planet's native Mahran inhabitants transmitted a distress call to the Jedi Order, which responded by dispatching a detachment of clone troopers under the command of Jedi General Chubor to aid the Mahran against the Separatists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The attack"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Mahranee government refused to capitulate to their demands, the Confederate forces initiated an assault on the planet, turning it into a battlefield. Chubor and his clone soldiers arrived too late to stop the Separatists from obliterating the planet's capital city, which was summarily reduced to rubble. Consequently, thousands of Mahran civilians\u2014many of whom were injured\u2014attempted to escape from their homeworld. While some of the refugees departed aboard their planet's vessels, others were ferried off-world aboard Republic craft, such as Chubor's Republic frigate, with clone troopers aiding in the escort operation. Yet the Republic and Separatist forces continued to do battle in orbit of Mahranee, exchanging barrages of laser fire through the vacuum of space, and the Mahran refugee craft were caught in the middle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Desperate to save the refugees, Chubor opened a direct holographic transmission to Count Dooku, the leader of the Confederacy. Chubor pleaded with Dooku to spare the Mahran, stating that his own frigate was filled with civilian families; moreover, half of the Mahran were only younglings. However, Dooku was unsympathetic to the plight of the Mahran. Knowing their conversation was being broadcast to the Jedi High Council, Dooku took the opportunity to blame the Jedi Order for the billions of casualties that the war had caused, claiming that such was the price of the Republic's resistance to his Confederacy. Chubor's frigate was the next ship to fall to Separatist fire, with members of Mahranee's prominent bloodline of Ashu\u2014including Ashu-Nyamal, the Firstborn of Ashu\u2014being among the deaths. Altogether, it took the Separatists a matter of hours to capture Mahranee and slaughter its thousands of inhabitants, resulting in a victory for their side."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once they had established control of Mahranee, the Confederate forces all but issued a death warrant for any surviving Mahran, claiming that they were extremely hostile and were to be killed on sight. Dooku's message to the Jedi Council, meanwhile, was met with dismay and anguish from its recipients. At a subsequent session, the Council decided that the time had come to assassinate Dooku, an act that Jedi Master Mace Windu and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker\u2014the latter of whom had been invited by Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to sit in on the meeting\u2014believed would collapse the Separatist regime and also prevent further bloodshed from occurring. Even Grand Master Yoda agreed to such a plan, acknowledging that Dooku's schemes placed too many innocent lives at risk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The maverick Jedi Master Quinlan Vos was assigned the task of killing Dooku with the aid of Asajj Ventress, Dooku's jilted apprentice\u2013turned\u2013bounty hunter, who could assist in getting close to the elusive Sith Lord. Ventress still harbored a grudge for her former Master, who previously tried to eliminate her at the behest of his own Sith Master, Darth Sidious. Going undercover as a bounty hunter, Vos found Ventress on the moon Pantora and convinced her to take him on as a partner. Yet they failed to execute Dooku, and it was not until the later Battle of Coruscant that Skywalker finally managed to kill him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack on Mahranee served as the opening scene of author Christie Golden's novel Dark Disciple, which was published on July 7, 2015.
