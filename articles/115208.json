But as Windu expresses his concerns about this undertaking, Yoda cryptically states that Obi-Wan will not be alone in this endeavor \u2013 and as he speaks, in a certain place on Tatooine, Asajj Ventress learns of a reward placed on the head of Savage Opress and goes off after him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obi-Wan travels to the Raydonian village and is quickly taken down by Maul and Opress, who take him aboard their hijacked freighter to be tortured to death.
