Popular amongst the village's children, she would regale them with tales of brave heroes and epic adventures underneath the takka trees. One day, she approached a local girl of sixteen or seventeen years, named Ana Tathis. Caryn had sensed that Tathis was strong in the Force, and wished for Tathis to become her apprentice. Tathis eagerly took to Caryn's training, and labored in her master's tropical gardens, making them lush with beauty. Through her physical labors, Tathis learned focus and concentration. Over the course of three years, Caryn taught her the skills of controlling her body, Force healing, seeking out knowledge and Farsight. Though Tathis became quite skilled, she was never able to read Caryn's mind. After a time, Caryn felt that she had taught Tathis all she was able, and bid her farewell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
