In some cases, the passage from a precursor to its descendants was accompanied by the development of sentience (as exemplified by the sentient Dowutins, whose precursors were herd animals). In other cases, a species that was already sentient to begin with could give rise to several distinct sentient lifeforms (as exemplified by the Pau'ans and Utai, who shared a sentient ancestor)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
