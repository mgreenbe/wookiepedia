At some point, their leader Raynod Menar decided to move all the members of the movement in the wilderness of the planet Corellia in order to live in isolation from the rest of society. They eventually took shelter in a cave in the Thaos Mountains."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 1 ABY, psychotic cave-dwellers captured two groups of hikers in the Thaos Mountains. Ilyamo and other hikers were kept as hostages in the dwellers' cave. Commander Talte of the Corellian Security Force therefore hired a spacer to investigate the disappearances of the hikers. The spacer fought several cave-dwellers at the spot where the second group disappeared. From a communicator found on a body, the spacer managed to triangulate a signal to the cave. The CorSec finally assaulted the cave and freed the hostages. Raynod Menar was killed by the spacer during the attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cave-dwellers appeared in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
