Konstantine managed to trap the Squadron's captain, Mart Mattin, but underestimated the ingenuity of the Spectres and Mart's uncle Commander Jun Sato. Konstantine was greatly embarrassed by this skirmish, and attempted to spin the incident in a positive way. However, Thrawn saw through his obfuscation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, Konstantine, commanding an Interdictor vessel, accompanied Thrawn and Pryce at the Battle of Atollon.

Though primarily an anti-smuggling task force, the fleet was forced to deal with a sharp rise in insurgent activity in the sector. Konstantine worked to capture the Ghost, a starship crewed by rebels known as the Spectres; in these effort, he cooperated with the Inquisitorius, who specifically sought to neutralize the Jedi Kanan Jarrus. After the Spectres rescued another fugitive, the Rodian Imperial Information Office staffer Tseebo, and breached the Imperial security cordon around the planet Lothal's Capital City, Konstantine commanded the Relentless in the pursuit of the rebels. With Tseebo's help, the rebels escaped into hyperspace. While Konstantine thought of shifting the blame for the rebels' escape to the Grand Inquisitor, he decided against it, as the Emperor's agent had succeeded in planting a tracking device onto the hull of the Ghost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Admiral Konstantine reported that they were receiving a signal from the tracker, the Inquisitor did not acknowledge his presence but merely commented that he himself could sense the Jedi Kanan Jarrus and his Padawan Ezra Bridger. In response to the Inquisitor's comments, Konstantine stifled a laugh, as he believed that the Empire had wiped out the Jedi years ago during the Great Jedi Purge. He was personally skeptical of reports that the leader of that rebel cell was a Jedi. However, the Inquisitor read his emotions and scowled back at the Admiral. Fearing that his long and storied career would end if he failed to capture the rebels, he vowed that they would succeed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the Spectres realized that there was a tracking device planted onto the Ghost's auxiliary vessel, the Phantom. To prevent the Imperials from capturing Tseebo, Kanan and Ezra separated from the Ghost and flew the Phantom to an outpost on the planetoid PM-1203\u2014a remnant of the destroyed planet Anaxes, where Konstantine had previously studied. As planned, Konstantine took the bait and initially ordered the deployment of a full battalion, though he would be countermanded by the Inquisitor, who would personally led a small contingent of stormtroopers to the surface. Despite the contingent and the Inquisitor's own lightsaber proficiency, Kanan and Ezra managed to escape with the aid of the native fyrnocks, leaving both the Inquisitor and Admiral Konstantine empty-handed."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Further encounters with the Ghost"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning with the Relentless to Lothal, Konstantine again encountered the Ghost when it attempted to smuggle a \"galactic entrepreneur\" Lando Calrissian and his puffer pig onto the planet, in the interest of an illegal mining operation. Using a signature modulator, the rebels were able to disguise the Ghost as the Tontine, a legitimate VCX-100 light freighter traveling from Boz Pity. However, the rebels accidentally deactivated the signature modulator and exposed the Ghost to the Imperial authorities. Konstantine then dispatched four TIE/ln space superiority starfighters after the Ghost, but the rebels managed to lose their Imperial pursuers in Lothal's cloudy skies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Inquisitor's capture of Kanan Jarrus sometime later, Konstantine was temporarily reassigned to Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's flagship, the Sovereign, while over the planet Mustafar. Jarrus escaped with the assistance of Phoenix Squadron, a rebel cell of RZ-1 A-wing interceptors;  in the course of a lightsaber duel against the Grand Inquisitor, Jarrus and the Spectres were able to destroy the Sovereign.

Nevertheless, Konstantine and the Relentless launched a surprise attack on the Phoenix Cell, led by Sith Lord Darth Vader, who was piloting a TIE Advanced x1 starfighter. As the Ghost made its escape, Konstantine activated his Destroyer's tractor beam to attempt to catch them. However, he instead ended up catching Vader as the rebels jumped to hyperspace. Knowing that his life was in danger for this mistake, Konstantine blamed his failure on a subordinate bridge officer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Admiral Konstantine retained his command of the Relentless despite his failure in Vader's eyes, now hunting for the Phoenix Squadron and accompanied by the Imperial Security Bureau agent Alexsandr Kallus (who also had experience dealing with the Spectres).

Wolffe, distrusting the rebels, secretly sent a coded transmission that was picked up by the Relentless; a probe droid sent to Seelos confirmed the rebel presence there. While Agent Kallus led a ground assault with three AT-AT walkers, Admiral Konstantine remained aboard the Relentless to render air support to Kallus' forces. However, the clones and rebels put up an unexpectedly fierce fight and immobilized Kallus' AT-AT walkers.

This surge had been triggered by several members of the Spectres, though the Fifth Brother informed the Admiral and Kallus that he would visit the station alone. There, the Fifth Brother and another Inquisitor known as the Seventh Sister almost succeeded in apprehending Chopper, Ezra Bridger, and Sabine Wren.

Despite this, several rebel ships, including the Spectres' ship the Ghost and Commander Jun Sato's CR90 corvette, managed to escape into the skies above Garel City, forcing the Relentless to deploy its tractor beam projector to trap Commander Sato's corvette. However, Phoenix Leader Hera Syndulla used the Ghost to ram the tractor beam projector, knocking it out of action (as well as a TIE fighter that collided with it). This distraction enabled the Phoenix rebel fleet to make a jump into hyperspace. When Agent Kallus, who had led the ground assault, demanded an update on the location of the rebel fleet, a visibly frustrated Admiral Konstantine reported that he and his men were also wondering the same thing; despite having flushed them out of hiding, Konstantine had again failed to crush the Phoenix cell."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Continued failures"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Admiral Konstantine and Agent Kallus again encountered the Ghost above Nixus, though the Spectres evaded their Arquitens-class command cruiser.

Later, Konstantine met with Grand Moff Tarkin and Agent Kallus on the bridge of a Star Destroyer. Konstantine told Tarkin that Pryce was overestimating the threat posed by the Phoenix rebels and dismissed them as a localized insurgency. At that point, Thrawn interjected and expressed his hopes that the insurgency would remain that way. Konstantine was present when Thrawn theorized that the Phoenix rebels were planning to raid Reklam Station in the planet Yarma. Later, Konstantine, Pryce, and Kallus commanded a Star Destroyer that intercepted the rebels and their stolen Y-wing starfighters.

Despite his protests, Thrawn dispatched the Admiral with a single Arquitens-class light cruiser and two Gozanti-class cruisers, replying that a man of Konstantine's talents should have no difficulty even with one light cruiser. By the time Konstantine had arrived, Phoenix Group had already evacuated the rebel sympathizers among the population."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving, Konstantine's subordinate sighted a single YT-2400 light freighter. Despite his previous caution, the Admiral now believed that Thrawn had overestimated the threat posed by the rebel cell and dispatched fighters to attack the ship. The freighter's inexperienced captain, Mart Mattin, moved to attack the light cruiser and released his cargo of explosives; Konstantine was able to neutralize them by unleashing his ship's forward batteries. Mart attempted to flee, but Konstantine's TIE fighters disabled his engines. However, Konstantine's forces were unable to stop his fellow crew, along with Spectres Ezra Bridger, Sabine Wren, and C1-10P, from escaping the system aboard the shuttle Phantom II. In a ploy to lure the Spectres back into a trap, Konstantine allowed Mattin to send a distress signal while TIE bombers attached a magno-mine to the hull of Sato's Hammer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Spectres returned aboard the Ghost, Konstantine ordered his subordinate to await his command to trigger the mine, intending to destroy the two rebel ships in one fell swoop. However, through the action of rebel astromech droids C1-10P and R3-A3, the rebels were able to stealthily detached the magno-mine and plant it on one of the YT-2400's cargo boxes. The plan was further complicated by the arrival of Phoenix Squadron under Commander Jun Sato (Mattin's uncle). Sato's reinforcements destroyed one of Konstantine's Gozanti cruisers and several TIEs, causing Konstantine to panic and call Thrawn for reinforcements. In the chaos, the two rebel ships flew over Konstantine's cruiser, dislodging the cargo box at the same moment that Konstantine ordered the mine triggered. The resulting explosion badly damaged Konstantine's ship. Konstantine and the officer survived the blast but their ship was badly damaged."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that point, Thrawn arrived in the system. Thrawn allowed the rebels to escape following a brief exchange with Commander Sato. Thrawn then contacted Konstantine via hologram. When Thrawn asked him whether he had contacted him for assistance, Konstantine tried to save face by claiming that he had called to inform him that the rebels had been driven from system.

Konstantine was present at a meeting where Thrawn briefed the others about Fulcrum, a traitor in the ranks who had been aiding Phoenix Squadron as a spy and saboteur, who Thrawn attributed the recent Imperial defeats and Rebel successes to, and explained his plan to screen the Lothal Sector's Command staff for Rebel affiliations. Konstantine was also privy to Thrawn's plan to hunt down Phoenix Squadron's base in the Lothal sector. When he asked about Thrawn's tactics, the Grand Admiral replied that he had calculated the possible locations of the rebel bases based on their proximity to attacks on Imperial ships and facilities, and the planet Lothal. After Kallus had apprehended Lyste, accusing him of being the Rebel spy, Konstantine was present at a meeting with Governor Pryce, Colonel Yularen, Thrawn and Kallus.

When Pryce volunteered for the \"honor\" of silencing the rogue Senator, Thrawn tasked both Konstantine and Pryce with intercepting the rebel ships outside the Archeon Nebula. Thrawn's plan was to use his prototype TIE Defender and two TIE Interceptors to flush the rebels out of the nebula so that they could be captured by Konstantine and Pryce. For that mission, Konstantine and Pryce commanded two Imperial Star Destroyers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the rebel ship Ghost exited the Archeon Nebula, Konstantine informed Pryce that the rebel ship had sustained damaged to its core systems. After Pryce rejected Mon Mothma's demands, she ordered Konstantine to activate the ship's tractor beam projector.

Placed in command of an Interdictor vessel, Konstantine prevented the rebels from escaping the system. When Commander Sato attempted a Danan tactic, Thrawn ordered Konstantine to hold back until ordered otherwise.

Realizing his mistake too late, Konstantine frantically ordered evasive action. Not only did Konstantine perish for his reckless insubordination, but his actions undermined the outcome of Thrawn's battle plans by allowing Ezra and Chopper to escape into hyperspace to seek reinforcements for the rebels.

He showed little regard for any of his fellow Imperials, and on occasion he showed himself to be self-serving and was not above sacrificing his own men to save himself. When confronted with failure, Konstantine sought to protect his career by shifting blame or by misrepresentation of the facts (though this did not fool keen observers like Grand Admiral Thrawn). Furthermore, he did not view his colleagues as friends, even Agent Kallus; his cold and unsympathetic attitude towards Kallus after a near-death experience on Bahryn contrasted with the warmth and unlikely friendship that the ISB had been shown his rebel opponent Garazeb Orrelios."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Admiral's tactical skill was not highly regarded by Governor Arihnda Pryce, who saw him as a self-serving politician rather than a soldier; indeed, he preferred meetings and committees to direct action and left much of his fleet's operation to his subordinates. Despite his role in forging the Imperial Navy's fleet culture, he was known to slavishly follow the Imperial Navy Handbook. Underestimating the rebel threat, Konstantine's perception of them was that of a localized insurgency rather than a galaxy-wide insurrection; he lacked Grand Admiral Thrawn's strategic vision for defeating the entire rebellion. Instead, he appeared to favor overwhelming military force\u2014feeling a single Arquitens-class cruiser was insufficient firepower against Iron Squadron's YT-2400 freighter. He also underestimated the ingenuity and resourcefulness of his numerically and militarily-inferior opponents, and panicked when confronted by unexpected enemy forces.

His working relationship with the alien Grand Admiral Thrawn was also acrimonious, as his jealousy turned to open insubordination. During the Battle of Atollon, Konstantine defied Grand Admiral Thrawn's orders and tried to intercept the Rebel command ship Phoenix Nest with his own interdictor cruiser. Konstantine's defiance was his undoing, as it was through this tactical error that Commander Sato, the captain aboard the rebel ship, was able to ram Konstantine's cruiser; Konstatine was killed, and the rebels were able to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kassius Konstantine is a Star Wars Rebels character who first appeared in the first-season episode \"Gathering Forces.\" He is voiced by Star Wars: The Clone Wars veteran Dee Bradley Baker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
