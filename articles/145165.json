Durand, a former client of Cid's, was attempting to make it big in the criminal underground, and had gotten himself involved with the Pykes, taking over Cid's Parlor in the process. Cid, wanting her business back, arranged to sneak through the mining tunnels underneath the city to steal spice Durand was keeping in her office, which he owed to the syndicate. The theft was successful, but Durand implicated Cid in the theft, and the Pykes took the child Omega hostage in order to make Cid and the others retrieve the spice, a task complicated by an irling infestation in the tunnels. Once the spice had been successfully retrieved, the Pykes cut off one of Durand's horns as a warning before leaving."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
