It was able to provide a strong anti-starfighter capability to an otherwise under-defended installation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "More effective than Mn/T1 laser cannon mines, the Laser Battery was more costly to deploy in large numbers. This meant that while it was also a useful strategic weapon, it was far less widespread, and required the presence of a support station nearby where the gunnery crew might spend their off-duty hours. This also meant that it was subject to the further cost of employing sentient gunners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The solar arrays on either side of the cannons provided all the power the weapon needed, so long as the Laser Battery was located a suitable distance from a primary star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of its lightweight construction, its hull was very fragile, and was unable to withstand even a single hit from a laser cannon. However, with an effective shield system rated at 600 SBD, the Laser Battery was able to take some punishment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
