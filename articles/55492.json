Around 9 ABY, the Abyssin met the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin at a fighting pit, who was searching for other Mandalorians.

He at some point heard about a supposed Mandalorian on the planet Tatooine, as well the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin, who closely protected an infant foundling. Around 9 ABY, the gangster sat ringside a fighting pit at a town, betting on one of the Gamorrean fighters in the ring. While observing the fight, Koresh was approached by Djarin, having been told that Koresh knew where to find other Mandalorians, and Grogu. The gambler remarked that the pit was no place for Grogu, but the Mandalorian stated that the foundling went wherever he went."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Djarin told Koresh that he was looking for information on other Mandalorians in the galaxy as part of a quest to return Grogu to his kind. Koresh, though, advised the bounty hunter to enjoy the entertainment instead of going straight to business. The Gamorrean Koresh had bet on was knocked to the ground, and so the gangster shouted for the winning Gamorrean to kill the other fighter. As the losing Gamorrean evaded such fate, Koresh attempted to make Djarin gamble for the information if the losing Gamorrean died within the next minute and a half, asking for the Mandalorian's beskar armor if the bounty hunter lost the bet. Djarin refused, and so Koresh shot the winning Gamorrean with his blaster pistol, and his armed assailants swiftly surrounded the Mandalorian with their own blasters drawn."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Unsuccessful hunt"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fighting pit audience promptly fled the arena, and Koresh bragged about not having to seek out Djarin for his armor. The gangster demanded Djarin's armor in return for not killing the Mandalorian. In reply, the Djarin threatened to kill Koresh if he did not tell him where other Mandalorians could be found. Shortly after, the Mandalorian used his whistling birds to eliminate Koresh's armed assailants and fought the fighting pit's workers. Koresh fled the arena as the Mandalorian defeated his remaining opponents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Koresh ran outside and down the street when Djarin, exiting the fighting pit, snared the gambler with his grappling line. The Mandalorian then pulled Koresh across the ground and hung him on a light post. The Abyssin offered Djarin the information he desired in return for his life, and revealed what he knew of the alleged Mandalorian on Tatooine, swearing this information to be true by the droid emancipation group Droid Gotra. Djarin then began leaving, and Koresh begged to be freed from the grappling line. The Mandalorian instead shot out the light post with his blaster pistol, allowing several local creatures to advance on the gangster, who screamed in fear."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gor Koresh was an Abyssin male with green skin, gray hair and a single brown eye.

Seeing Grogu, he pointed out that the fighting pit was not a place for the foundling. Koresh also attempted to trick the Mandalorian into betting for information as an attempt to trick the bounty hunter into handing over his beskar armor. When Djarin did not play into the gambler's trick, Koresh and his assailants held him at gunpoint, and Koresh bragged to the Mandalorian.
