The treaty ended the Eternal Empire's assault upon the Republic, but forced the Republic to begin paying a heavy tribute of raw materials and resources, as well as an arms limitation statute that the Republic broke in secret. The Senators who negotiated the cease-fire did so when the Galactic Senate overruled Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh, though Saresh arranged for the disgrace or dismissal of the Senators who were involved in the aftermath."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The treaty would become void when the Eternal Alliance absorbed the Eternal Empire and freed the Republic from these terms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
