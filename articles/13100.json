Located in the Judicial Quarter of the Voss-Ka city near the Tower of Prophecy, the tea house was a popular establishment among both the Voss and outsiders alike. At some point prior to 3640 BBY Bas-Ton was kidnapped and killed by the Imperial Intelligence of the reconstituted Sith Empire. His likeness was then used to craft a Human Imperial Agent into an identical copy of Bas-Ton, who would then go and replace him in his life. The Agent led a double life for a long time and maintained the life of the tea house owner as his guise."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bas-Ton's teahouse appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the Imperial Agent class mission on Voss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
