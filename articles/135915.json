Such circles could be found all over the various continents of Lothal, a planet located in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. In the time of the Galactic Republic, many archaeologists came to Lothal to examine the stones circles in hopes of discovering their origins and purpose. Some suggested that the slabs were placed in the relatively recent past, when the original colonists of Lothal dragged them together for use as a landing area instead of electronic beacons. Others, however, surmised that the stone circles were proof that a ritualistic civilization had lived on Lothal millennia before Republic scouts discovered the planet. All inquiries into the mystery of the Lothal stone circles were suspended when the Galactic Republic was replaced by the Galactic Empire, which believed that superstitious mysteries of the past had no place in the New Order. The Devaronian crime lord Cikatro Vizago used one of those stone circles as a meeting point for his Broken Horn Syndicate. The Lothal resistance group later used the same stone circle as a base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
