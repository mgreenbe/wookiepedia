During the Republic Dark Age, Vanahame was part of the Odionate, a Sith rump state ruled by the Sith Lord Odion. The moon also housed a Cloister, a large planet-sized orphanage where children throughout the Odionate were indoctrinated into slaves and warriors for Odion's war effort. There were twelve such other facilities scattered throughout the Odionate. The moon had no atmosphere, but consisted of a large spaceport which housed the Cloister underneath."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the First Battle of Skarpos in 1032 BBY, Odion's naval commander Beld Yulan's fleet stopped at the moon to replenish their ammunition stocks prior to traveling to Jubalene, Odion's temporary throne world, and then invading of Sarrassia. Following the Second Battle of Skarpos, Odion returned to Vanahame with the newly-acquired Helm of Ieldis, an ancient Sith artifact capable of driving sentient beings into a homicidal frenzy. He intended to use the grief and misery of the child inmates at the Cloister to unleash the Helm on a galactic level; however, he was defeated by his enemy, Jedi Knight Kerra Holt who succeeded in convincing his second in command, General Beld Yulan, to turn against him during the Battle of Vanahame. They freed the captive children and the subsequent rush of positive emotions caused the Helm to overload, killing Odion. After Odion's death, the territories of the Odionate were divided up between the other members of the Calimondra family."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars: The Essential Atlas Online Companion on StarWars.com (article) (backup link)"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
