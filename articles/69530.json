After the battle group defeated the Galactic Empire's blockades in the Nythlide Array in 5 ABY, Syndulla planned to appoint a pair of carriers under Juan to remain to support the local militia while she continued her hunt for the Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing. The general echoed her intentions to Admiral Gial Ackbar when he asked her of the Nythlide Array's status during a meeting of the New Republic High Command.
