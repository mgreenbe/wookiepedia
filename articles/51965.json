Omas realized that the cumbersome organization of the New Republic could not withstand the pressures of the galactic war. As a result, Omas instituted a massive reorganization and streamlining of the government. Named the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, or Galactic Alliance for short, it began the long task of bringing the galaxy back together.

The Alliance began massive reconstruction efforts on Coruscant, in the form of the Reconstruction Authority. The new government devoted itself to rebuilding and repairing the galaxy, left in disorder following the war. By 30 ABY, the Galactic Alliance had relocated its government to Coruscant, though some viewed this as a public relations move, as there was still much work to be done, however the Alliance had officially taken authority of the galaxy. While the problems with repairing Coruscant were great, there were some bright spots, like the construction of the new Jedi Temple and the new Senate and Executive Buildings five years later.

Relations between the Killiks and the Alliance quickly soured, as their addictive black membrosia began to ruin the lives of various insect members of the government. This was further exacerbated by the death of Supreme Commander Sien Sovv, who was killed when a spacecraft piloted by a Vratix drunk on the membrosia collided with the admiral's private transport, killing him and his entire staff.

Some more independent worlds, especially those with strong industries and patriotic streaks saw themselves as above the legal requirements, began viewing the government as a resurrected Galactic Empire. By 40 ABY, relationships between the Alliance and several local governments had deteriorated to the point that the Alliance decided to show a preemptive display of military might at Corellia. When the Corellians launched a counterstrike at the show of force, full scale galactic war once again loomed. As both sides struggled to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis, mysterious acts of treachery and sabotage threatened to derail peace efforts. To combat the mounting terrorism on Coruscant, Chief of State Omas was forced to institute the Galactic Alliance Guard as a secret police force under Colonel Jacen Solo. This resulted in the resignation of Supreme Commander Gilad Pellaeon, as well as growing discontent over the increasingly draconian system of government, with the most common chant at political protests being 'The Empire is back'.

The Alliance faced a growing crisis as Adumar, Fondor, Bespin, and the remnants of the Hapan Heritage Council separated from the Galactic Alliance to join the rebels. The Hutts and the Imperial Remnant were also encouraged to join, but did not do so. Many other lesser worlds continued to voice their support and the Confederation, already possessing many of the leading shipyards in the galaxy, raised ship production to epic levels and led attacks on Alliance shipyards such as those at Gyndine and Sluis Van with its very own Confederation Fleet. At a confrontation in the Gilatter VIII system, former Imperial Turr Phennir was named Supreme Commander of the Confederation military. As more worlds flocked to the banner of the Confederation, freeing themselves of what they saw as Alliance tyranny, old conflicts broke out. Soon, militarily, the two forces were at similar strengths, and a dangerous GA reliance on Hapes had arisen.

The GA then attacked the planet without success, leading to the death of Caedus, the capture of his apprentice, Tahiri Veila, and the end of the war. The Jedi, along with Jagged Fel, were able to have the Moff Council join them, and brought the Confederation to the bargaining table.
