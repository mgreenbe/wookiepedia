Shortly after Popara was killed, the Quarren was present at Dock Q2214 of Popara's penthouse, along with a squad of Wookiees under the employ Popara's eldest son, Zonnos Anjiliac Priare. They were at the dock as part of a trap set by Zonnos to capture those he believed responsible for Popara's death: the Jedi Knight Mander Zuma, the Pantoran Reen Irana, the Bothan Eddey Be'ray, Corporate Sector Authority Lieutenant Commander Angela Krin, and Mika Anjiliac Chiera, Popara's youngest son."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zonnos arranged for a message to be sent to Mika claiming that Vago Gejalli Thokka, Popara's Hutt adviser, had arranged safe passage for the unidentified Quarren to fly Mika and his allies to flee for Anjiliac family estates on Nal Hutta. The Quarren waited at Dock Q2214 with a SoroSuub Corporation shuttle. The Quarren was waiting at the shuttle, leaning against one of hte shuttle's support struts and sucking on a death stick, when he spotted Mika and his party and waved to them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Quarren entered the shuttle to make preparations for its liftoff, the Wookiees exited the shuttle and attacked Mika's party with blaster rifles and stun net projectors. Mika's party fought back against the Wookiees, and a group of Rodians from the Bomu Clan attacked them at the same time. One of the Rodians rolled a small thermal detonator toward the landing pad with the shuttle, which Zuma unsuccessfully attempted to roll off the pad using the Force. It detonated and destroyed half of the pad, leaving the rest structurally unstable, with the shuttle containing the Quarren teetering and almost falling off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Quarren struggled with the controls of the shuttle and attempted to activate its side thrusters and bring the shuttle up to safety, but it took lurched sharply off its cradle and began tipping into the abyss below. The Quarren tried to fire the ship's landing thrusters to stabilize and rescue the ship, but the effort was proving unsuccessful.

With a final effort, the Wookiees pushed the shuttle over the edge, and the Quarren nearly succeeded in gaining control of the craft. But instead, its thrusters failed, and it fell downward into the depths of Nal Shadda, resulting in the destruction of the shuttle and the death of the Quarren pilot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The destruction of the shuttle, and by extension the Quarren's death, were later blamed on Reen Irana, who was captured in the assault. Zonnos publicly accused Reen Irana of being responsible for Popara's assassination and announced that she would be executed. No additional charges were brought against Irana for the Quarren's death or the shuttle's destruction because they were considered trivial in comparison with the murder of Popara."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Andoorni Hui was created by Jeff Grubb and first appeared in Scourge, a novelized version of Tempest Feud, a Wizards of the Coast roleplaying sourcebook."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
