After warding off the Lost Tribe of Sith when they emerged in 43 and 44 ABY, Thrawn's first clone of Luke, Luuke Skywalker, retired after serving Thrawn since the original's death. Luuke was replaced summarily with Luuuke, who inherited duties as the Grand Master of the New Jedi Order and a significant political persona. Luuuke would go on to assemble a Clone Army comprised of the copies whom Thrawn had made over the decades.

Luuuke was the replacement of another clone, Luuke Skywalker, who had fulfilled this purpose for decades after the original's death in 9 ABY, actually earning the position of Grand Master.

In the context of the story, any appearance of Luke Skywalker following the Fate of the Jedi series would be Luuuke. Further, the article in which \"An Apology\" was published announced facetiously that Luuuke would star in upcoming novels such as Star Wars: The Clone Wars 2: Luuuke by Zahn. The provided cover of that novel pictured Luuuke, with an appearance based upon a preexisting image depicting Luke confronting the Dark Spirit during the events of Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. The novel serial, The Clone Wars 2 or Son of Clone Wars, was to continue releasing titles for perpetuity, and Luuuke's adventure with Streeen would have taken place in the seventeenth volume of the tale. Though he was considered indistinguishable from his predecessors, it was not made clear whether or not Luuuke maintained the use of cybernetic prosthesis, which the original Luke required after losing his hand in a duel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
