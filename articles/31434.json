In 8 ABY, the base was under the control of Imperial forces loyal to Moff Kentor Sarne, who ruled the sector as a warlord. Sarne, who had recently been ousted from his capital on the planet Kal'Shebbol by New Republic forces, led the majority of his fleet to Gandle Ott as he retreated into the depths of the Kathol sector. While in orbit, he began loading supplies from Crimler Naval Base and recalled all reserve military personnel on the planet to duty. News of Sarne's defeat at Kal'Shebbol had not reached the planet, and the Moff claimed to the media that he was leading the large fleet on an extended mission to exterminate pirates and Rebels throughout the sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Moff's actions were documented by Dana Cadwell, a reporter for the NewsNet KatholNet, who filed a news report entitled Moff Sarne Prepares For Pirate Purge. A couple of days later, the fleet departed from Gandle Ott to carry out the mission on which Sarne had claimed to be. In the aftermath of the departure, it was discovered that Sarne had not only taken the supplies but the majority of the planet's defense force and active military personnel with him, including the planetary governor. The loss of many high-ranking officials left Gandle Ott's government in disarray, leading to political infighting between senior government figures Vice-Governor Marja Lang and General Herron Dade over who should take over the absent governor's position."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Crimler Naval Base was mentioned in the RPG adventure Death Is Remotely Possible, which was published in The DarkStryder Campaign by West End Games in 1995.
