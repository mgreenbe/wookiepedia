Because the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Lusankya had already taken severe damage in the defense of Borleias, it was decided that she would be used in a final suicide mission against the worldship in command of all Yuuzhan Vong forces in the Pyria system. The plan involved installing a giant reinforced lance into the center of Lusankya, filling it with explosives and ramming the ship into the Domain Hul worldship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Star Dreadnought had long before had its weapons subtly and systematically stripped and donated to smaller ships, including Booster Terrik's Errant Venture. Commander Eldo Davip, the Lusankya's commanding officer, successfully steered the bow of the vast warship toward its target, piercing it deep into the enemy worldship's hull. He managed to escape from the ship shortly before the collision via a Y-wing stored in a nearby shuttle bay. The force of the resulting detonation was so great that it utterly destroyed both the Yuuzhan Vong ship and the Lusankya herself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
