The Rodian, who apparently had aims to be worshipped as a god, hired the starship Vessel, crewed by Leox Gyasi and Geode, to transport himself and the idols to the planet. However, the planet's populace instead chose to worship Gyasi and Geode for returning the idols, leading the Rodian to flee the planet in another starship. Gyasi remembered the incident with the Rodian while later transporting another set of uncanny statues aboard the Vessel, these ones recovered from the Amaxine station by some Jedi travelling on the transport as passengers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
