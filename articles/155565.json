Initially gaining the upper hand in the brawl, he knocked Dune into the bar's counter, but was quickly countered by the former shock trooper. The Zabrak then pulled the tether in an attempt to close their distance. Dune used the opportunity to pull the fighter off-balance, and won the fight by strangling him with the tether until he tapped out.
