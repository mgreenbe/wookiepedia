Known as Maravada the Silent, Maravada was a philospher and a recluse, and dedicated his time to categorizing and naming the elements of the cosmos. His reign was remembered as a time of peace and learning, which contrasted sharply with that of one of his predecessors Avamarivash. A history of Maravada's reign could be found in the Chamber of Speech in Kaleth up until the Cold War-era and the Jedi Order's return to Tython."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
