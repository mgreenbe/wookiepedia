As such, the YT-1250 shared the same basic design as its predecessors; being circular and disk shaped while having a right mounted cockpit and a left mounted laser cannon separated by a long sensor-laden boom. The ship was 32.25 meters in length and sported 3 thrusters like the YT-1210."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The YT-1250 had 20% less cargo capacity than a YT-1210, capable of carrying up to 80 metric tons. As a trade-off, the YT-1250 was armed with a heavier double laser cannon, more powerful engines and had basic defensive shields. The YT-1250 had six modular attachment points, four less than most YT-series freighters, and was considered more durable than the YT-1300 light freighter. Inside, the YT-1250 came equipped with a Class 2 primary hyperdrive and a Class 16 backup drive, along with a hyperdrive system and a navicomputer. The starship was manned by a crew a 2, could carry up to 5 passengers, and had consumables for up to 3 months."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The YT-1250's boom carried enhanced sensors that allowed pilots to navigate through areas with poor visibility. This made up for the fact that the boom somewhat obscured the pilots vision from inside the cockpit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The YT-1250 could be utilized for light defense duties, cargo duties in hazardous regions of space, or as an armed merchant ship to protect freighter convoys. The YT-1250 could traverse through nebular clouds or through dense, gaseous atmospheres."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the release of the popular YT-1300 light freighter, sales of the YT-1200 and YT-1210 dropped, leaving Corellian Engineering Corporation with a large back stock of unsold transports. As a solution, the two models were upgraded and re-marketed as a \"new\" ship, the YT-1250 transport. The ship was initially criticized for having a long boom that partially obscured the pilots field of view, but CEC emphasized the fact that sensors within the boom would assist the pilot. A new YT-1250 cost 120,000 credits, while a used model cost 80,000. The YT-1250 opened to sluggish sales, before eventually finding its footing among customers who favored its durability."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The YT-1250 transport was first mentioned in Canon in the 2018 reference book YT-1300 Millennium Falcon Owners' Workshop Manual.
