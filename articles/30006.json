Following the Battle of Yavin during the Galactic Civil War, rebels Luke Skywalker and Nakari Kelen were sent to meet with the Kupohan intelligence agent Sakhet on the planet Denon. Skywalker and Kelen successfully reached Sakhet's Noodles, the noodle bar that the Kudophan used as a front for her intelligence services, and Skywalker made their order: Corellian buckwheat noodles with nerf nuggets for Kelen, and the same noodle with rancor sauce for him. The pair were given a receipt telling them to return for a meeting the following morning and then received their orders, although Skywalker was given the same order as Kelen, for which he was truly grateful."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Corellian buckwheat noodles appeared in Heir to the Jedi, a novel written by Kevin Hearne and released in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
