Death Watch would eventually betray Maul and Savage Opress, leaders of the Shadow Collective, and unknowingly allowed Maul and Opress to find a suitable successor to Vizsla, in the form of the former Prime Minister Almec. Maul would eventually kill Vizsla in a duel, splintering Death Watch, and allowing Maul to establish a new puppet government under Almec. Members of House Kryze would participate in an attempt to liberate Satine, led by Bo-Katan Kryze, a former member of Death Watch who opposed Maul after the death of Vizsla, and Satine's sister, and Korkie Kryze, nephew of Satine. The rescue attempt would later fail, and Satine was recaptured by Maul's forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Satine was later executed by Maul as vengeance against Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, and leadership of House Kryze passed to her sister, Bo-Katan. After assisting her in finally driving Maul and his ilk from Mandalore, the Jedi proclaimed Bo-Katan regent of the planet. However, her rule ended when she refused to submit Mandalore to the authority of the new Galactic Empire and she was betrayed by Clan Saxon, who deposed her and brought in the Empire to subjugate Mandalore in exchange for being named rulers themselves. To this end, Bo-Katan and her loyal cadre of Nite Owls sided with the Rebel Alliance to liberate the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
