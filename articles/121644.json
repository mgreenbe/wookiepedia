After Trilla Suduri was captured by the Galactic Empire and turned to the dark side of the Force, Suduri became known as the Second Sister and used the lightsaber as her primary weapon. She used it to hunt down Padawan Cal Kestis during the Great Jedi Purge. During their third duel on Bogano, Kestis disarmed Suduri, grabbed the lightsaber, and was forced to relive Suduri's capture and conscription into the Inquisitorius through his psychometry, allowing her to steal a Jedi holocron and escape. Kestis gave the saber to his master, Cere Junda, the Second Sister's former Master, who knighted him with it. Junda used the lightsaber as her primary weapon during the Mission to Nur. By the time Kestis faced the Second Sister in their fourth and final duel at Fortress Inquisitorius, she had replaced this lightsaber with a new one."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The letters on the wheel of the Second Sister's lightsaber reads \"ASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCVBNMAASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCVBNM\" in Aurebesh.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
