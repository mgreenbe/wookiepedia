Though not as inhospitable as other areas of the planet, the habitable band was still plagued by intense cold and wind. At some point after the Battle of Kur, Marchion Ro, the Eye of the Nihil, touched down in Rystan's habitable band along with a navigator, the Force-sensitive Talortai Udi Dis. The two Nihil marauders met with Kufa, Ro's cousin, in order to arrange passage through the Golamaran ice flats."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
