Having discovered that the Cartel never evacuated their secret Tilnes base, the Believers decide to test a bioengineered anti-Caarite virus on the installation there. After the virus had been released into the base's ventilation system for two weeks, the Believers sent in a party to investigate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, a group of heroes is present on Tilnes when an EMP knocks out the base's facilities. When power returns, a contamination in the ventilation is detected, as is a distress signal coming from the secret Cartel base. The heroes decide to investigate after interrogating Nevan Khash, current manager of Verga Mer Mining Company, who was aware of the secret base. On entering the base, the heroes find stacks of deceased Caarite bodies, as well as a few fresh Human corpses. Searching through the base they encounter some mutated Caarite survivors which have slowly been eating the corpses to survive. Attacking the heroes out of desperation, the heroes manage to defeat the mutants, in the process discovering an undeployed sample of the virus that the Believers scout team had brought with them. Two members of that scout team had survived, and monitoring the heroes on the base's security system, they attempt to prevent the heroes from leaving and exposing their plot. The heroes manage to defeat them, and are met at the base exit by a decontamination team that is able to clean up the base and ensure the heroes are not affected by their exposure to the virus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
