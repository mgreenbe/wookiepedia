Long and flexible, they housed the wiring needed to connect the controls and the engines. While most Podracers incorporated the cables, a rare few pods had their engines mounted directly to the cockpit and did not require cables. The most fragile part of a Podracer, these durable cables were prone to snapping and breaking if strained too much."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
