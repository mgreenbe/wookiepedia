Like the nobility's ore-dukes, the monarchy was a hereditary system based on a line of succession with the first-born serving as heir apparent. In matters of government, the monarch was assisted by members of the court such as the chamberlain and the chancellor. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, both titles were held by Jooli, a nobleman who served the King of Shu-Torun and his successor, Queen Trios. According to Shu-Torun tradition, Jooli's position as an aide and advisor gave him the power to veto decisions made by a newly crowned monarch."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Darth Vader's mission to Shu-Torun, the king plotted to assassinate the Sith Lord as part of a conspiracy to rebel against the rule of the Galactic Empire. The plot ended in failure, resulting in the deaths of the king and his two eldest children, Prince Monthan and Princess Hollian. Princess Trios, king's the third child, was spared and appointed by Vader to rule Shu-Torun as the Empire's figurehead queen. Despite the liquidation of the royal family, Duke Rubix and his supporters initiated a full-scale rebellion against the new monarch due to her renewed allegiance to the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
