The ecumenopolis was infiltrated by demolition droids, which took out several Coruscant power generator engineers and planted themselves on the wall as bombs. The droids then exploded, crippling all electrical sources on Coruscant, which resulted in power outages and fires as well as civilian deaths."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a consequence of the attack, the Galactic Senate passed a bill that de-regulated the banking conglomerates, also rejecting the initiative to end hostilities between the two belligerents.

The Separatist Parliament approved this initiative."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Padm\u00e9 returned and announced the same proposal in the Galactic Senate, Count Dooku became alarmed, and tasked General Grievous with disturbing the process."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Demolition droids were sent to execute the operation. These machines were capable of transforming into sweeper/maintenance units to infiltrate a location or combat units armed with two blaster cannons to secure a demolition points.

While en route, they encountered CC-1010 and two other members of the Coruscant Guard, who were checking the identification of a group of Coruscant power generator engineers. The droids displayed their holographic permission, which stated that their task was \"generator maintenance\". The clones allowed them through, with CC-1010 even showing them the correct way, which allowed Grievous' machines to travel to their target."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Ahsoka Tano visited Supreme Chancellor Palpatine in his office, attempting to persuade him to accept the Confederacy's peace offer so that no more orders for clones would have to be paid. The Chancellor, however, replied that their past efforts at ending the conflict had been fruitless, as the Separatists rejected their previous proposals, but agreed to put the vote to the floor after Padm\u00e9 told him that this particular suggestion originated from her old mentor, Mina Bonteri."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the dialogue proceeded, the demolition droids reached the generator's vicinity.

Large areas of Galactic City turned dark in moments, and fires broke out in the vicinity of the Senate Building. The Senate's red emergency lighting turned on, and Orn Free Taa, Senator of Ryloth shouted that they were under attack. Soon, Senator Gume Saam announced that the attack had been confirmed as a Separatist one, and Halle Burtoni, Senator of Kamino proposed to vote on the bill to deregulate the banks. Padm\u00e9 attempted to stop the process, but to no avail, as more and more Senators began to support Burtoni's proposal.
