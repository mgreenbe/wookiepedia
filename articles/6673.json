Abandoned and resettled many times, it lost significance until it was only a minor outpost for several nearby moisture farms where youths such as Luke Skywalker and his friends spent much of their free time. The Jawas often referred to Anchorhead as \"Old City New\". Anchorhead was part of the Great Chott salt flat region."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Settlement"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anchorhead was one of the oldest settlements on the planet Tatooine. Located nearly 80 kilometers from Mos Eisley, it was originally a mining outpost. It was abandoned and resettled many times, as each mining company came to discover the poor quality of the ore located there. The most notable of the mining operations was carried out by Czerka Corporation in 3956 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The companies would abandon their equipment each time, due to the prohibitive costs of transporting it off-world. The indigenous Jawas would take this abandoned equipment as their own. This gave rise to the use of Sandcrawlers\u2014mobile smelting machines\u2014as well as mobile homes for the Jawas."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Old Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Revan and his companions landed at Anchorhead in 3956 BBY. They hoped to locate a hidden Star Map, a technological remnant of the Infinite Empire, which would help them find the Star Forge. At the time, Czerka Corporation's mining operations were going poorly, as the ore was substandard and word was getting out. Though Motta the Hutt established a Swoop racing track and the Ithorian Fazza Utral built a hunting lodge, attracting other forms of business to fill company coffers wasn't working, either. Worst of all, ore shipments were being intercepted and destroyed by frequent Sandpeople attacks. Revan offered his assistance, and was able to earn the Tusken Raiders' trust, enough to negotiate with them. They would not agree to stop the attacks, but the Sand people did agree to reduce them, and to free some of their prisoners, including several Jawas and Mission Vao's brother, Griff Vao."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after the ore operations ended, Czerka began a secret weapons research program on the planet. Czerka suddenly pulled out sometime during the Cold War, leading the settlement to become a hive for smugglers and other criminals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the rise of the Galactic Empire, it had been resettled, but cities like Mos Eisley and Mos Espa had been built, and stripped the settlement of its preeminence."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Galactic Empire, Anchorhead, along with other settlements on Tatooine, had become populated again. It could be found a few miles east of the Lars homestead, south of the now-bustling spaceport of Mos Eisley. Anchorhead itself primarily consisted of moisture farmers. It was governed by the Anchorhead Municipal Council. The city became a place where many youth, including Luke Skywalker and his friends, loved to visit and hang out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after Biggs Darklighter left Tatooine, there was much unrest among the Tusken Raiders. They even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead. Anchorhead itself contained a dozen pourstone stores, two cantinas (including The Weary Traveler), a market, and Tosche Station on the outskirts of town."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil war, the Anchorhead Base located in a canyon near the city served as a training facility for RebelAlliance  pilots. The base was destroyed during the Battle of Tatooine. After the Battle of Yavin, the city itself eventually became a Rebel Alliance stronghold."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 1 ABY, Anchorhead hosted a large Life Day celebration.

The Life Day event was later completely revamped and moved to other cities the subsequent years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In another game, Star Wars: Rebel Assault, Anchorhead Base is where pilot Rookie One trains on the T-16 skyhopper.
