When Jedi Master Yoda intervened and began destroying Ventress' droids, commander 224 and several of his droids were sent out to defeat him, with the winner of the ensuing battle gaining Katuunko's trust. During the battle, the droid driver was destroyed by Yoda, along with his tank."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rugosa"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle droid was an AAT driver battle droid manufactured by Baktoid Combat Automata and Baktoid Armor Workshop to serve in the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars, a conflict between the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Galactic Republic. During the war, the droid was deployed amongst a battalion of battle droids to the moon Rugosa, under the command of the Sith apprentice Asajj Ventress and the battle droid commander 224. The Separatists had learned that King Katuunko of the planet] Toydaria and Jedi Grand Master Yoda were meeting in secret on the moon in order to discuss a Republic supply post being created on Toydaria in exchange for protection of the Toydarian people. Ventress had managed to reach Katuunko first, and offered Separatist protection instead, but after she and the king learned that Yoda had successfully landed on the planet, an agreement was made. If Yoda could defeat her droid forces and reach Katuunko, he would have the allegiance of the Toydarians but if he failed they would side with the Separatists instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving on the moon in a C-9979 landing craft, commander 224 led a section of the droid forces including this driver to find and defeat Yoda, including three Armored Assault Tanks, one of which this droid rode in. Entering the coral forests of Rugosa, they soon sighted the Jedi Grand Master, who was accompanied by three clone troopers, nicknamed Lieutenant Thire, Jek and Rys, and ordered his troops to open fire. The Separatist forces were out of range, however, and 224 soon had to give the order to stop as the tanks could not fit through the surrounding foliage. This driver ignored the commander's order in the belief that the tanks could fit, but crashed and was thrown from his vehicle. As he recovered, he shouted back to 224 that he had been correct. As the vehicles could not continue, 224 remained behind while sending out ground troops to find the Republic forces. Yoda and his companions destroyed two patrols of B1 battle droids and a group of B2 super battle droids, but were eventually driven back by droidekas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Yoda and his men retreated, 224 and his tanks were able to slowly advance through the coral and eventually entered a coral-free valley area in which the Republic forces had hidden. Alone, Yoda revealed himself to the droids and sat before them, meditating. 224 contacted Ventress via hologram, informing her of the development, and was ordered to attack the Jedi immediately. The Separatist forces opened fire but were too slow, as the Grand Master sprung forward and destroyed several of them before reaching 224's tank and cutting an entry hole in the bottom with his lightsaber. The tank's crew attempted to flee but were destroyed when Yoda pulled them back into the vehicle using the Force. 224 was then also pulled down from the command hatch and cut apart by Yoda's lightsaber. After Katuunko noticed the smoke rising from the skirmish, Ventress attempted to contact 224 for a report but was informed by another droid of his demise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yoda continued to massacre the remaining droids, and soon managed to climb onto this droid's tank, making him accidentally shoot a fellow vehicle, killing several fellow droids. Yoda then carved a hole into the tank's top hatch and used the Force to propel the droid outside to his destruction. The droid was witnessed flying through the sky, still screaming, by Ventress and Katuunko before he finally hit the ground and was destroyed for good. Yoda was ultimately successful in defeating the remaining droid forces and reaching the rendezvous point, earning the allegiance of the Toydarians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like all B1 battle droids within the Separatist Droid Army, the driver stood at 1.93 meters tall and had masculine programming.
