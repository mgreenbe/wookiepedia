He served aboard a Republic assault ship during the conflict, and went on to serve the Galactic Empire following the Declaration of a New Order. Enlisted in the Imperial Navy as a TIE pilot, Declann's uncanny skills garnered the attention of Emperor Palpatine's agents. They approached Declann and suggested that he not let his aptitude with the Force go to waste, purely because the Jedi Order was now extinct. The suggestions, posited to Declann in the form of rhetorical questions, troubled him, but he agreed to be trained in the ways of the dark side of the Force. At some point, he had a son, who was inducted into the Stormtrooper Corps and given the designation 17786."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Declann's training took place on the ancient Sith world of Dromund Kaas, where he became a Dark Side Adept under the tutelage of the Prophets of the Dark Side. Once his education was complete, he had to go through a graduation exercise, in which Declann used the Force to kill a captured member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Declann succeeded, and Palpatine allowed him to return to his fleet. During a New Year's celebration in 2 BBY, Declann\u2014along with eleven other officers\u2014was promoted to the newly created rank of Grand Admiral by Palpatine himself. During the elaborate ceremony, Palpatine decreed that there could only be twelve Grand Admirals in existence at any given time."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Grand Admiral"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime following 0 ABY, Declann was stationed at the Theed Royal Palace on Naboo. There, he assigned a series of tasks to a spacer, whom he initially sent to Kessel to destroy thirty Alliance starfighters. When the spacer returned, the Grand Admiral dispatched the spacer to Kessel yet again, this time to destroy a CR90 corvette in the service of the Alliance. The spacer succeeded in completing the task."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three years later, Declann\u2014along with fellow Grand Admirals Afsheen Makati, Miltin Takel, and Osvald Teshik\u2014was stationed aboard the incomplete second Death Star superweapon over Endor. Shortly after Palpatine arrived to inspect the station, the Rebel Alliance launched an attack against the installment. During the ensuing battle, Declann used battle meditation to coordinate the Imperial fleet in their defense of the station. As the battle wore on, however, Declann felt Palpatine's death at the hands of his apprentice, Darth Vader, through the Force. Abandoning the battle meditation, he rushed to the throne room in response. While he was in transit, however, the station was destroyed by Alliance General Lando Calrissian, resulting in the death of all beings aboard, including Declann."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Declann was well-known for his mood swings and could alternatively be morose and threatening.

The Grand Admiral was later convinced by Palpatine's agents that his talent for the Force should not go squandered just because he had been overlooked at such an early age."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As much as his mood swings, Declann's ability to use the Force to meld units under his command into a superior fighting force earned him fame.

Once his training was complete, he possessed the ability to kill a man with the power of the Force.

Pe\u00f1a for the article Who's Who: Imperial Grand Admirals, which was published in the April 2003 issue of Star Wars Insider. Declann was the only original Grand Admiral in the article\u2014the other twelve had all been named in previous sources. The character was a favorite of Wallace, who enjoyed the idea of a Force-sensitive Grand Admiral, and he supposed that the character would have been adept at lightsaber combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Declann made his first appearance in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. However, in the game, he is shown to be wearing a standard Imperial officer's uniform, rather than the white uniform of a Grand Admiral. Declann is positioned in the Throne room, replacing the Naboo royal throne that had been located there prior to his NPC being added. His appearance is also considerably different\u2014he is shown to have lighter skin than that of the original Joe Corroney illustration in Who's Who. The character was later referenced in 2005's The New Essential Chronology, which was co-authored by Wallace, as well as Ryder Windham's 2007 reference book, Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally, Who's Who: Imperial Grand Admirals was intended for publication in the now-defunct Star Wars Gamer magazine, under the title Dirty Dozen: The Imperial Grand Admirals. In the original manuscript, there is considerably more information about Grand Admirals themselves, accompanied by roleplaying game statistics. Among other things, the original article identified Declann's homeworld as Raithal, and his personal Star Destroyer as the Recondite. It also went into greater detail about his appearance\u2014while all the other Grand Admirals drawn by Corroney for Who's Who wear the standard white uniform of their rank, Declann is also depicted wearing a black cape."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cut content"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hailing from Raithal, Declann dreamed of attending his home planet's famed naval academy as a youth, in spite of the lack of career opportunities available for young officers. Due to the lack of a standing military within the Republic, Declann was reluctant to join the Judicial Forces or a planetary militia. Nevertheless, Declann graduated from the Raithal Academy with honors, and shortly afterward served aboard a Republic corvette during the Clone Wars. Due to his aptitude for battle meditation, he was once able to bring a Void Demons freighter to a halt, opening it to a broadside from his frigate. Later, during his training on Dromund Kaas, Declann felt uncomfortable amongst his more treacherous peers, such as Jerec and Kadann. He was allowed to return to his fleet only after killing the captured Rebel Quarsh Panaka. After his promotion to Grand Admiral, Declann was still haunted by the dual nature of his training, and so he offset his stark white uniform with a black cape and gloves. His fleet excelled above all others, and he was able to achieve victory with a minimal loss of life on both sides."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
