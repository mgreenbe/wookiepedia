Originating with the Sith Lord Darth Bane, who had emerged victorious from a devastating conflict among his peers, its aim was to corrupt the Galactic Republic from within, discredit and diminish the Jedi Order, and ultimately rule the galaxy. A millennium after its creation, the Grand Plan was fulfilled by Darth Sidious."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi-Sith War ended in the near annihilation of the Sith due to both infighting, caused by their greed for power, and their conflict with the Jedi Order. Unbeknownst to the Jedi, the Sith Lord Darth Bane survived the destruction of the ancient Sith Order. In the shadows of the galaxy, Bane used tricks, tactics and schemes to destroy the Sith's enemies, conjuring a plan that would corrupt the Galactic Republic from within, diminish the Jedi, and allow the Sith to conquer the galaxy once more."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Desiring revenge and wanting to avoid the Sith being destroyed by greed again, Bane created the Rule of Two, which would allow the Sith to operate in secret. His rule mandated that only two Sith Lords could exist at any given time; a Sith Master and a Sith apprentice, and one had to die in order for another to come. Either the apprentice would grow more powerful with each subsequent succession, which was facilitated by the apprentice killing the master and then becoming the master of an apprentice they choose, or the master would train another student to kill and replace their outgoing student. Bane was inspired by his personal experiences, ancient Sith documents, and the idea of a dyad in the Force, a Force-bond as strong as life itself that paired two individuals strong in the Force into one in the Force. Even so, however, the Rule of Two was but a pale imitation of the older, purer doctrine of the dyad in the Force.  Following Bane's death at the apparent hands of his apprentice, Darth Zannah, she and subsequent Sith continued his plan."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The rise of Darth Sidious"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around a millennium after the time of Darth Bane, the Sith Lord's legacy was inherited by Darth Sidious, who learned the ways of the dark side of the Force as the apprentice of Darth Plagueis.

His goal was to generate sympathy for the people of Naboo in order to become the next Supreme Chancellor. Although Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala escaped with the help of the Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, she fled to the Republic capital of Coruscant seeking Senator Palpatine's counsel. Palpatine convinced the Monarch of Naboo to call for a Vote of No Confidence in Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum. Amidala returned to Naboo to liberate her planet while Palpatine secured his election as the Republic's new chancellor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the loss of Maul, who was believed to have been killed by Kenobi on Naboo, the crisis presented a new opportunity in the form of a vergence in the Force\u2014Anakin Skywalker, a child whom the Jedi believed to be the Chosen One, destined to bring balance to the Force. Sidious took a great interest in Skywalker; as Palpatine he influenced the young Padawan's views even as Skywalker trained with Kenobi, who was newly-knighted for defeating Maul."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "A secret army"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sidious chose Count Dooku, a Jedi Master who renounced the Order, as his new Sith apprentice. The former Jedi converted to the ways of the dark side and became the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus.

To ensure Sifo-Dyas' silence, Dooku contacted Lom Pyke of the Pyke Syndicate, and as Tyranus, paid the Pykes to kill Sifo-Dyas.

With the outbreak of war on Geonosis in 22 BBY, the Jedi took up arms and led the newly-found clone troopers against the onslaught of the Separatist Droid Army. Thus began the Clone Wars, and as the conflict raged on and more Jedi fell to battle, Darth Sidious continued to amass economic and political power for the Office of the Chancellor, allowing himself, as Palpatine, to sway ever more support in the Senate and rule the InterGalactic Banking Clan that supplied financial aid to both the Republic and the Separatists."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A New Order"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Grand Plan came to fruition when the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, successfully seduced Anakin Skywalker to commit fully to the dark side of the Force and anointed him as the Sith Lord Darth Vader after Skywalker killed Tyranus during the Battle of Coruscant. Together, they commanded the clones of the Republic to turn against their Jedi commanders under whom they had served for three years, thereby initiating the Great Jedi Purge.

Confronting his father and Darth Sidious, Luke Skywalker's plead for help against the wrath of the Emperor convinced Darth Vader\u2014the Chosen One, Anakin Skywalker\u2014to save Luke and overthrow Darth Sidious; the Dark Lord was destroyed as he fell into an abyss aboard his new battle station, and balance was restored to the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, death was not the end for Sidious; the Sith's spirit retreated to the hidden Sith redoubt of Exegol on the fringes of the galaxy, joining with Sith Eternal cultists through new clone bodies.

Sidious created Snoke, who went on to rule the First Order as Supreme Leader, his origins unknown to the First Order's leaders. Meanwhile, the Cosmic Force\u2014an aspect of the Force that bound all things and communicated to living sentient beings, and which formed a balanced, symbiotic relationship with the Living Force, the energy of all life\u2014became dormant after the Galactic Civil War, only to be reawakened with certain individuals' realization of their latent Force abilities in 34 ABY.
