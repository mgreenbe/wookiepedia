After the Yuuzhan Vong War, Jedi Knight Jacen Solo traveled throughout the galaxy for five years to train with several Force sects in hopes of gaining a greater understanding of the Force. During this sojourn, he traveled to this station, where he met with the Mind Walkers, a group of Force-sensitives inhabiting the station who were able to separate their minds from their physical bodies in order to travel to a realm of the Force known as beyond shadows.

Their journey led them to Sinkhole Station, where they met with the Mind Walkers. They also found Qwallo Mode, a Jedi Knight who had disappeared in the Maw two years earlier and had been presumed dead. The Skywalkers learned from the Mind Walkers how to travel beyond shadows. While in the realm, Luke encountered a being called Abeloth, who wished to speak with him, but Luke declined.
