When Jedi Knight Leia Organa Solo and her husband arrived in the foyer to the chambers, Korr initially upheld his mandate to bar entrance to everyone. However, the Solos soon convinced Korr that they had evidence of an attack by Mandalorian mercenaries on the Temple, and he let them pass. Jedi Master Corran Horn and Acting Grand Master Kenth Hamner expressed their displeasure with Korr's decision to let the Solos interrupt the Masters, but Kyle Katarn insisted that the arrests should have been carried out in another location. Korr later assisted in moving the Jedi affected by Force psychosis and, along with Avinoam Arelis, helped the Solos defend against the Mandalorian Supercommandos in a lower level hangar in the Temple Precinct."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
