It was stationed aboard the Vulture's Claw. At one point, a droid that escaped its small prison on the ship after being captured was spotted by the sentinel droid, resulting in a short chase. R2-D2 lured the sentinel into the airlock, where the droid was soon trapped and jettisoned off the ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
