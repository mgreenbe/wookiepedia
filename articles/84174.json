At the feared secret prison, Isard brainwashed captives, turning them into secret agents that she then released to be activated in the future. To confound escapees, the prison was built into the Star Dreadnought upside down, artificial gravity reorienting decks as ceilings. As the prison interiors were clad in stone and the prisoners were led to believe they were within a mine, attempts to escape to the surface would only lead prisoners deeper into the Star Dreadnought, staffed by Isard's personnel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
