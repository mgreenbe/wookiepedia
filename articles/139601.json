He began his career in the organization of Jorj Car'das, where he moved quickly through the ranks to become one of Car'das's top lieutenants. When Car'das disappeared in 0 BBY, Karrde quickly and quietly took over the organization to avoid internal feuding. The smuggling and information-brokering organization was already formidable, and when Jabba Desilijic Tiure was killed in 4 ABY, Karrde was able to pick up the most pieces and guide his group to the top spot in the smuggling world. Known as an honest and honorable man, Karrde kept a low profile despite his lofty underworld position."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 9 ABY, Karrde was drawn into the Galactic Civil War, in which he had previously avoided taking sides, when he rescued Luke Skywalker from being stranded in deep space and helped Skywalker avoid capture by Imperial leader Grand Admiral Thrawn, though only after his hand was forced. Thrawn placed a bounty on Karrde, driving him to sell the location of the Katana fleet, a secret he had kept since his days in Car'das's employ, to the New Republic. Karrde then organized the Smugglers' Alliance to represent the smugglers to the New Republic and aid in the battle against Thrawn. When Thrawn was defeated, Karrde remained a valued ally of Skywalker and the Solos but was not trusted by the New Republic leadership as a whole due to his shady past."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 ABY, Karrde undertook a mission to find Car'das, whose retribution he had long feared, in order to seek out a copy of the Caamas Document and end the political crisis regarding it. Car'das did not have a copy, but did provide information that was key in exposing the hoax regarding Thrawn's return. In the aftermath of the peace treaty between the New Republic and Imperial Remnant, Karrde turned his organization into an information-sharing agency to maintain trust between the two governments. He lost his valued second-in-command, Mara Jade, in the process as she married Skywalker and took up the Jedi life. When the Yuuzhan Vong invaded six years later, Karrde revived the Smugglers' Alliance to combat the Yuuzhan Vong and played a key role, in partnership with Lando Calrissian and longtime friend Booster Terrik, in helping pro-Jedi Chief of State candidate Cal Omas be elected to office during the crisis. When the Jedi were declared enemies of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances in 40 ABY, Karrde put his organization at their disposal, having become a staunch ally of the Jedi in contrast to his previous desire for neutrality."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Climbing the ranks"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Born sometime before 31 BBY on a planet Karrde always kept secret\u2014feeling it would cause others to label him politically\u2014Karrde entered a life of crime as a young man. He began his career in the employ of Jorj Car'das, the leader of a smuggling and information-brokering gang. There, Karrde rose through the ranks, gaining much experience in both the smuggling and information-selling trades. In 6 BBY, Karrde was serving as a navigator and sensor specialist aboard one of Car'das's ships under a captain named Hoffner; he ultimately served under Hoffner for two years. On one smuggling mission, Karrde plotted a short blind jump to escape determined pursuit by a pair of Carrack-class cruisers. The jump landed them directly in front of a Dreadnaught-class cruiser; terrified, the ship fled once more, wrecking its hyperdrive in the blind jump and killing several of the crew. It was only when Karrde later examined the sensor records that he realized there had been hundreds of Dreadnaughts present; he had found the legendary lost Katana fleet. He memorized the coordinates before erasing them from the ship's navigation computer; he did not believe any of the other crewmen knew the location. He knew the discovery could make him a rich man, but he did not yet have the resources to adequately exploit his discovery. Karrde also piloted in his early career, drawing a young Ellor into helping him make a smuggling run at one point and so pulling the Duros into the smuggling life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Karrde approached a young Wedge Antilles, attempting to employ him, but Antilles declined; at this point Karrde had an extremely good if low-profile reputation, with no negative rumors widely circulating about him. Despite his quiet manner of operating, Karrde was able to make many contacts throughout the underworld, including such figures as Billey, Samuel Tomas Gillespee, Jett and Fenig Nabon, Par'tah, Lando Calrissian, and Booster Terrik. Karrde did not initially get on well with Terrik, hiring a spacer to rough up the rival information broker and smuggling boss after Terrik meddled in Karrde's business once too often. Their relationship developed into a friendly rivalry over time as their mutual skill and love for information brokering led them to cooperation. Karrde tended to come out ahead in their deals but each considered the other a valued partner. When Terrik was put away on Kessel, Karrde helped Car'das incorporate much of Terrik's network into his own. The underworld was not Karrde's only source of affiliates; he found allies inside the major galactic factions as well, such as Tarn Innis of the Imperial Army's Supply Branch."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, Car'das suddenly disappeared along with his massive private store of information. Karrde, by now one of Car'das's chief lieutenants, conferred with the other lieutenants as to what should happen to the organization as Car'das's absence wore on for three months. A bloody internal squabble nearly developed, and it was suggested each lieutenant take his own portion of the organization and go his own way. Instead, Karrde took over the organization, neutralizing the other lieutenants and announcing his control in a single night. Two lieutenants immediately made attempts to gain back control, which Karrde thwarted and by early 0 ABY had solidified his position. In short order, he acquired a reputation as trustworthy and respectable, as much as any member of the fringe could be considered so. Karrde's operation was not on the scale of Black Sun or the Hutt kajidics, but he was considered a major underworld figure and preeminent information broker, and he had ambitions to expand even more, though he was always keen to keep his profile low and his true power concealed. Only those truly in the know realized his importance, though his stature was brought to the eyes of the Imperial Security Bureau early in his career. Karrde's organization retained the name of the Car'das, at least initially; the name eventually fell out of fashion. Six more takeover attempts by the old lieutenants or their supporters followed between the suppression of the first two and 3 ABY, all of which were thwarted. The leaders of four of them confessed under interrogation to having been backed by Car'das. Karrde was left worried that Car'das wanted his organization back and terrified of his former boss, who had been a ruthless, deadly, and seemingly prescient and unstoppable man."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Karrde maintained a scrupulous neutrality in the Galactic Civil War, aiding either side as it profited him but never clearly casting his lot in with any one party; he had no desire to become involved in galactic politics in any significant way. Karrde used the heavily modified bulk freighter Wild Karrde as his flagship, outfitting it for maximum performance. He also had offices installed on the ship from which he worked, sorting the massive amount of information fed to his sensor-stealthed ship. He also maintained the luxurious private yacht Uwana Buyer, though he preferred the Wild Karrde and used the yacht only for undercover missions or impressing potential business partners. During this period, Karrde was loosely associated with some members of Billey's organization in what was sometimes referred to as the Smugglers' Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 ABY, Karrde spent some time in Doaba Guerfel on Corellia, where he recruited an operative to make minor deliveries and aid him in undercutting a Hutt rival, Shalera. He then moved on to Mos Eisley on Tatooine looking for operatives; as Karrde treated his employees very well and was considered a desirable employer, he was able to hire many agents, who returned his loyalty to them with a steadfast fidelity to him. At this time, Karrde had been selling information about Imperial troop movements to the Rebel Alliance. Though he tried to operate evenhandedly, this drew the Galactic Empire's ire when they learned of it, and it placed Karrde on the Emperor's Most Wanted bounty list in response. Zuckuss and another bounty hunter attempted to collect it by arranging a meeting between the second hunter and Karrde aboard the Wild Karrde. Zuckuss was smuggled in, and when suspicious Karrde called in his guards, the hunters attacked. They managed to overpower Karrde's guards and take him captive. He was turned in and imprisoned on Tatooine near Bestine, but was quickly broken out by the Rebellion along with several other prisoners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, Karrde gained the services of Aves, a young smuggler who would eventually grow to be one of Karrde's top associates and advisers. Also in 4 ABY, Karrde hired Fenig Nabon to make a delivery for him to Sullust, where he knew the Alliance Fleet was massing to strike against the Galactic Empire. He had heard of Jabba Desilijic Tiure's death at the hands of Leia Organa and was among the first to hear that Luke Skywalker had defeated Galactic Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader as the Alliance to Restore the Republic destroyed the Death Star II. He realized that a major shift was occurring in the balance of power and found a resurgence of the Jedi Order likely under Skywalker. This would be bad news for the fringe, in his opinion, as Jedi would crack down on smuggling and enforce law and order for the new Rebel government; even Skywalker alone could prove a formidable threat to his smuggling operation. However, opportunities abounded with Jabba's fall from preeminence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Nabon returned, he was waiting for her in the Black Dust Tavern on Socorro, where they discussed the recent events and exchanged tidbits of information. Karrde was able to make some credits by informing her that Han Solo had survived and escaped the Hutt's custody. Karrde had decided to take advantage of the chaos to expand his organization, and offered Nabon a position in his group, which she declined. He then offered her a deal finding information for him; he wanted a location for a new base, one which would have room for massive expansion and would be secure against Jedi. Nabon promised to search out a good location and was able to earn some money from Karrde for her information about a new arrival in the Black Dust Tavern, Ghitsa Dogder. Karrde departed as a bar fight broke out, leaving Nabon a heavy tab to make up for having overpaid for the information about Dogder."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Expansion opportunities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Karrde saw Jabba the Hutt's death as the perfect opportunity to build his own syndicate into a larger business. As he had revealed to Nabon, he wished to build a large secret facility; Nabon's investigations led her to Myrkr, a remote forest world with sensor-baffling flora and Force-repelling fauna\u2014the rare ysalamiri. Myrkr became Karrde's home base, from which he operated comfortably; he kept its location a secret, preferring to let no one know his headquarters. While in the forest there, he encountered one of the local vornskr predators and happened to shoot its tail off when defending himself. This immediately reduced the creature's aggression, so Karrde named it Sturm and began to domesticate it with the aid of Chin, one of Karrde's top employees and a Myrkr native who had some skill with animals. Some time later, he encountered another vornskr in a perimeter trap, docked its tail, named it Drang, and domesticated it as well, taking the pair as personal pets. Karrde would eventually write an article for Galactic Zoology Monthly describing his domestication of the vornskrs. Karrde immediately began absorbing a great many personnel from Jabba's employ, such as Melina Carniss, a part of the Hutt's former security team who became one of Karrde's top lieutenants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In this same time frame, Karrde rescued Quelev Tapper and his small smuggling organization from an Imperial attack; the two groups merged, with Tapper becoming Karrde's trusted second-in-command. Another key acquisition was that of Zakarisz Ghent, a highly skilled slicer. Karrde heard of his reputation and went to Sibisime to recruit him, but Ghent had gone to Chibias on another offer. Karrde was able to track him down and rescued him after the deal had gone sour, with Karrde's personnel able to secure the city against both Imperial and Rebel pursuit of Ghent while he got the young man to agree to work for him. Karrde made more mundane gains as well, such as the purchase of two G2 \"Goose Droid\" models after the Star Tours corporation folded. Karrde's organization quickly became the top smuggling gang in the galaxy, though he continued to keep his prominence a secret from all but the best-connected. By approximately 9 ABY, Karrde employed over eight hundred individuals and nearly two dozen ships. The growth of Karrde's organization was unusual in that he avoided the bloodshed and feuding typical of other underworld expansion efforts. He was willing to work for both the Empire and New Republic, taking cargo-moving jobs from both but never allying himself with either."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 6 ABY, Karrde's sources brought him news that, in the aftermath of Palpatine's death, Jeng Droga had crashed one of the Emperor's private yachts, complete with a cloaking device, on an unnamed waterworld. Eager to get his hands on this valuable technology, Karrde began searching likely locations, eventually settling on Kaal as the most likely world. He took advantage of negotiations offered by Tirgee Benyalle for contracts to harvest the world's aquaculture; he hoped to be able to use the aquaculture operation to cover his extraction of the intact yacht. Arriving on the world as Syndic Pandis Hart, chief purchasing agent for the Sif-Uwana Council, he began working the casinos before the negotiations opened, with Admiral Uther Kermen of the Empire, the warlord Moff Utoxx Prentioch, and a team of New Republic agents also competing. Meanwhile, Tapper led a team in searching for the downed ship and was able to locate it. When the time came for the negotiations, Karrde and the others were taken on a tour of the harvesting facilities and began making their offers; Karrde offered to set up an independent operation with generous terms for Benyalle around the Unis Islands, where the yacht went down, and allow one of the other bidders to run the main operations. Kermen, however, had infiltrated agents aboard Benyalle's barge and made an attack to take the facilities for himself. Karrde, Benyalle, and the New Republic agents were able to take the bridge, but the barge remained filled with Kermen's agents. Karrde had the barge rendezvous with Tapper's submersible and escaped, evacuating the others with him as well. Realizing, however, that he had no chance of recovering the yacht quietly, he had Tapper destroy it rather than let someone else exploit it before leaving Kaal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In early 7 ABY, Karrde was contacted by Booster Terrik and his daughter Mirax, who had taken over the family business while Booster had been imprisoned on Kessel. They were supporting Wedge Antilles's guerrilla war against Ysanne Isard and wanted Karrde, who was temporarily operating out of an asteroid base found by Tapper's group\u2014or so he maintained; this may simply have been a cover to maintain the Myrkr base's secrecy\u2014to help supply the effort. Terrik bought three hundred missile launchers and three thousand concussion missiles and proton torpedoes from Karrde, a hefty order paid in the bacta Antilles's group was stealing. Terrik arranged rendezvous locations for the shipping; Karrde's people would not be allowed all the way to Antilles's base. Karrde had Carniss handle his end of the shipments. She proved a traitor, however, selling the rendezvous location to Isard. Antilles's Rogue Squadron was able to destroy the Victory II-class Star Destroyer and damage the Interdictor that ambushed Karrde's convoy and the transfer went off smoothly, with Tapper, who led the convoy, gaining salvage in the bargain. The evidence suggested that the leak had come from Karrde's operation, and Karrde quickly realized it had been Carniss. He began watching her to determine the depth of her treachery and was able to tell that she was working alone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Terriks arrived to discuss the compromise in security, Karrde was ready to have them kill her. When they demanded she live, Karrde refused\u2014he would not tolerate betrayal. The Terriks, who wished to use her to feed Isard misinformation, were able to buy her life by giving Karrde several expensive contracts\u2014acquiring a gravity well projector, and refitting several TIE fighters with lucrative pay in bacta and sole control of the Coruscant market for the Terriks' bacta. With Coruscant in chaos due to the Krytos virus, Karrde was obligated to donate most of the bacta to charity, but reserved a sizable portion for the black market which he subcontracted to Billey and Billey's new lieutenant, Dravis. He was also able to sell a recently procured Sith lanvarok to Mirax Terrik, who specialized in exotic items. Antilles's rebel group was able to use Carniss to lure Isard's forces into a trap and defeated them. With Thyferra freed, Karrde arrived in the system and joined up with Booster Terrik, who had taken control of the Virulence, one of Isard's Star Destroyers, in negotiations. Airen Cracken of New Republic Intelligence was aghast at the idea of Terrik possessing the Star Destroyer, but Karrde was able to come up with an acceptable compromise, manipulating Admiralty law regarding salvage to buy the Virulence's surplus weaponry and TIE fighters from Terrik for enough to give him full control of the ship, then selling the hardware to Cracken and the New Republic for a seventeen-million-credit profit. Karrde made yet more from Terrik when he bet the other smuggler, with odds, that Mirax would quietly and immediately marry Rogue Squadron's Lieutenant Corran Horn, having just announced their engagement, in order to keep Booster from effectively opposing the union. Terrik refitted the ship, renamed the Errant Venture, as a mobile casino and smuggling center after he and Karrde drove the bargain through. With her usefulness over, Karrde had Carniss killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Six months into 8 ABY, Karrde and Tapper visited Varonat, where they knew the Krish crime lord Gamgalon was involved in a safari operation; Karrde wished to know what Gamgalon's true interest was and if he could cut in on the business. Masquerading once more as Pandis Hart and with Tapper claiming to be his pilot, Seoul, Karrde claimed that his ship had suffered a hyperdrive failure and entered one of the Morodin-hunting safaris supposedly to pass time while it was repaired. His hyperdrive mechanic was a young woman named Celina Marniss who impressed him with her competence and wide-ranging knowledge; her name's odd similarity to that of Carniss's also drew his attention. On the safari, Karrde noticed something that looked like a transponder before the guides pulled him away. When examining the Morodin trails, Karrde became increasingly concerned about the guides' behavior, and when he finally tracked one down he held his fire, noting that it did not attack; another hunter killed it. When they returned to the camp, Karrde tweaked the settings on his comm relay in order to pick up Gamgalon's transponders; while in the forest, he followed the Morodin trails with Tapper and realized that the Morodins were sentient and the trails were in fact a maze. Gamgalon's personnel had followed them, along with Gamgalon himself, and took Karrde and Tapper prisoner. Gamgalon admitted that the safaris were only cover for their efforts to harvest modified aleudrupe berries which could be used to create blaster gas. Tapper grabbed a blaster rifle from a guard in an attempt to escape, but was cut down by a hidden Krish sniper. While he was being marched back through the forest, Karrde was suddenly saved by Marniss, who had recognized him as likely being Talon Karrde by virtue of his tendency toward punnish names. Karrde offered her a reward for her assistance; she requested a job. Impressed by her skills and versatility, he agreed to hire Marniss, who now revealed her true name to be Mara Jade."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Drawn in"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After five and a half months of watching Jade in action and being continually impressed by her talents and demeanor, Karrde decided to promote her to be one of his lieutenants with an eye toward grooming her to take the deceased Tapper's place as his second-in-command. Karrde invited her to a private dinner in which he gave her the news, but that was quickly broken up by the arrival of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Chimaera over Myrkr. Karrde knew through his sources that this was the flagship of the Empire's new secret military commander, Grand Admiral Thrawn. When it dispatched shuttles that were clearly going to land near Karrde's forest base, Karrde hailed the Chimaera himself and offered his assistance while displaying his unusual knowledge of the Empire's doings. Captain Gilad Pellaeon remained suspicious, but Karrde freely offered his aid in showing the Imperials how to safely remove the ysalamiri, which he had deduced the Imperials were after, from their branches in an attempt to ingratiate himself with Thrawn. Deciding that Thrawn must have some reason for harvesting so many, he decided to begin carrying ysalamiri aboard his personal freighter, the Wild Karrde, as well. He then returned to conversation with Jade, who offered several ideas for comprehensive reform of his organization which she felt would make it more efficient; he tended to agree with her analysis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Karrde kept Jade by his side, teaching her more about the upper levels of his business and introducing her to his regular business contacts. They were both present for a delivery in the Sluis sector when several of Thrawn's Star Destroyers made a hit-and-fade strike, forcing Karrde to cancel the delivery. He stayed to watch the battle, however, finding Thrawn's unorthodox use of Star Destroyers for a hit-and-fade attack intriguing. When Thrawn attempted to capture Luke Skywalker, Skywalker escaped using a technique that would wreck his hyperdrive in short order, but Thrawn did not have time to recover him; instead, he contacted Karrde and several other smugglers and offered a bounty if they searched along Skywalker's route, captured him, and brought him to Thrawn. Karrde declined, citing a heavy schedule; in fact, he simply did not want to get involved in Thrawn's war effort in such a major way. On one routine journey, however, Jade, acting on a hunch, brought the Wild Karrde out of hyperspace where Skywalker's X-wing had broken down. Karrde rescued Skywalker and spoke with him, asking him why Jade had such an intense hatred for him, a hatred Karrde had been able to discover in his conversations with her. When Skywalker could not answer, Karrde ended the conversation and had him stunned by ysalamiri-protected crewmen. He took Skywalker back to Myrkr, where he was imprisoned without access to the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Skywalker awoke, Karrde interviewed him, asking him why he had suddenly become an Imperial target. Skywalker did not know, but offered to pay for his release. Karrde, however, knew that if he released Skywalker to the New Republic, Thrawn would find out, and he could not afford to have such an enemy. On the other hand, he was disinclined to hand Skywalker over to the Empire and run the risk of the New Republic finding out. He decided to look into why exactly the Empire wanted Skywalker, and to keep the Jedi imprisoned on Myrkr until he knew. Karrde kept it a secret even from most of those on Myrkr that Skywalker was a captive there. While Skywalker was still imprisoned, however, Fynn Torve, one of Karrde's captains, arrived with Lando Calrissian and Han Solo. The pair had saved Torve on Abregado-rae, and he felt obligated to grant them an audience with Karrde, which was what they had wanted. Karrde had to rush to move Skywalker to an outbuilding and hide his fighter before they landed. Karrde met with Solo and Calrissian, and Solo offered Karrde the same proposal he had been making for smuggling groups: the New Republic, suffering from a shortage of cargo transport, would hire his organization to haul legitimate cargo for them at favorable rates and with no consequences for their prior activities. Karrde, however, was not interested in tying himself to the New Republic and said as much to the two smugglers-turned-generals.

Karrde rushed away to speak with Pellaeon, but Thrawn actually appeared on the other side of the connection. When Thrawn mentioned desiring Karrde's help in procuring capital ships, Karrde momentarily thought Thrawn had somehow discovered that Karrde knew the location of the Katana fleet, but it proved to be otherwise. The Grand Admiral had decided to come down for a personal talk with Karrde, and Karrde had to rush once more to hide the Millennium Falcon and its two passengers. Just before the Imperials landed, however, Skywalker escaped and stole a Skipray blastboat; Jade set off in pursuit in another Skipray. When Thrawn arrived, Karrde had to dismiss it to him as a dissatisfied employee stealing a ship and attempting to make off with it, but Thrawn sent a team of stormtroopers to investigate the site in the forest where both ships had crashed, ostensibly as a favor to Karrde. They found nothing, however, and Thrawn soon departed after discussing his bounty for captured warships with Karrde. Solo and Calrissian returned from the forest; they had sneaked out of their ship and seen Karrde speaking with Thrawn; he assured them he was not working with the Empire. They began snooping around the base, however, and found the storage shed where Skywalker had been held. They deduced that it had been Skywalker in the shed just as Karrde tracked them down, and Karrde admitted that he had kept Skywalker imprisoned; by pointing out that he had turned over neither Skywalker nor Solo and Calrissian, however, he was able to gain back some of their trust."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Karrde felt an obligation as their host to protect Solo and Calrissian; he considered taking an individual in as a guest to involve an implicit guarantee of protection, and would not break that trust.

He could not allow Skywalker to enter Thrawn's hands alive, as the Grand Admiral would then feel Karrde had sided against him and take appropriate action; Karrde was prepared to kill the Jedi rather than let Thrawn's forces capture him. Karrde grew sad as he realized that one way or the other, he would have to leave Myrkr; over time, the base had become his home and he had grown quite attached to the peaceful location. When Skywalker was able to use R2-D2 to send a counterpart-encrypted message to Skywalker's X-wing, though, Karrde received his and Jade's report and was able to reply to them, warning them that Imperials were waiting in Hyllyard City and telling them the cover story Karrde had related to Thrawn. Karrde was not able to intercept them before they made it to the city, but a team of his personnel, working with Solo and Calrissian, were able to ambush the Imperials as they led their captives through the city and free the pair. Karrde visited the battle site after it was over and was impressed by Skywalker's role in taking down most of the stormtroopers and the Chariot Light Assault Vehicle; some of the forces had escaped, however, and Thrawn would be able to figure out what had happened at any rate.

They were able to put any hard feelings mostly behind them, and Karrde requested a warship to help the evacuation, half-hoping he could still win his way back into Thrawn's graces while letting Skywalker go, but Solo said that aid was unlikely, and Karrde knew that Thrawn would not be so easily pacified in any case.

Karrde explained to her his knowledge of the Katana fleet's location, and Jade suggested selling the secret to Thrawn. Karrde declined; he was of the opinion that while aiding the Empire would be profitable in the short term, the New Republic was best-placed to win out over time and making an enemy of either would be counterproductive. Jade left to pick up some supplies, and during her trip was attacked by a bounty hunter looking to collect on the twenty-thousand-credit bounty Thrawn had placed on Karrde.

Karrde had been worried over her delay and came out to meet her personally; once he was in the open, stormtroopers rappelled into the docking bay and surrounded him. When Jade herself disarmed him as he fought back, Karrde realized that her strange reactions to mentions of Palpatine and Skywalker were remnants of an Imperial past to which she had returned.

They took back the ship, which Karrde piloted out of storage, out the hangar bay, and along the Chimaera's hull and exhaust trail, maximizing his cover, until he could jump to hyperspace while Skywalker held off pursuing TIEs from the gun turret."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They went to Coruscant, where Karrde had decided to sell the Katana fleet's location to the New Republic, as the Empire was now clearly an enemy of his.

Karrde was rushed to negotiations with the New Republic Advisory Council, where Councilor Borsk Fey'lya responded hostilely, questioning Karrde's honesty. When Fey'lya was able to push a recovery effort off until after a reconnaissance team, launching the next day, had checked the location, Karrde felt far too much time would be wasted. Karrde sent Jade to the Trogan system, where Aves had hid after taking temporary command of the organization. Karrde had Aves gather all the forces he could and rendezvous with them at the Katana fleet's location while sending Ghent to Coruscant in order to look into suspicious bank transfers regarding Admiral Gial Ackbar that had the New Republic's supreme commander imprisoned under suspicion of treason. By disproving the dubious allegations, Karrde knew he would weaken Fey'lya's political position and hopefully keep the Bothan politician from being in a position to carry out a grudge against him.

When they arrived at the fleet's location, Fey'lya ordered the arrest of the prior party, which had already boarded the Katana. Before any orders were able to be carried out, however, the Imperial Star Destroyer Judicator entered the area. Fey'lya intended to abandon the first group, outraging Organa Solo. Karrde quietly showed Organa Solo a datapad message telling her to turn on the intercom and comm using the Force, then prodded Fey'lya into a conversation in which the politician confessed that he did not care for the lives of the soldiers who formed his growing ranks of supporters in the military but instead regarded them merely as tools for his political ambitions. The rest of the task force heard this and abandoned Fey'lya, pressing the fight against the Judicator. A small fleet of Karrde's men soon arrived as well, led by Aves and Jade. Further reinforcements under the long-disappeared Senator Garm Bel Iblis also arrived, summoned by Han Solo, who had contacted his small resistance group recently. Karrde had scanned the area, however, and realized that only fifteen Dreadnaughts were left; the Empire had already been there and retrieved the rest. When a second Star Destroyer arrived, Aves called a retreat, which Karrde approved; they did not have the forces to oppose two of the battleships. The team aboard the Katana was able to use the fleet's slave rig system to ram a Dreadnaught into the Peremptory, causing the Judicator to retreat and winning the battle for the New Republic. Jade had been forced to eject from her fighter, however, and was injured when she passed across the path of an ion beam; Skywalker was able to find and rescue her, and she was brought in for medical care and eventually moved to Coruscant to recover. While Karrde remained grateful to the New Republic for their care of Jade, he still refused to side directly with the New Republic and insisted that he was neutral; he had made an enemy of Thrawn but did not feel that the New Republic was a good long-term ally for a smuggler like himself, especially with the notoriously anti-smuggler Ackbar back in command after Ghent successfully cleared him of wrongdoing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle for the Katana fleet, the New Republic had discovered that Thrawn was using cloned troops.

One month after the Katana fleet incident, his investigations led him to Calius saj Leeloo on Berchest; Karrde was able to move relatively openly there despite the now fifty-thousand-credit bounty on him and Berchest's status as Imperial territory due to his longstanding smuggling contact with Governor Raccyx Staffa. There, he came across Skywalker investigating the clone pipeline himself.

When they arrived, Karrde proposed to them that they unify against the Empire, which he felt was bad for the smuggling business. Brasck and Mazzic responded coolly, though Par'tah was more open to the idea. Karrde was about to admit defeat and adjourn the meeting when it was suddenly raided by Imperial forces.

Karrde nearly began attacking to cover Mazzic's escape before Ellor arrived and destroyed Mazzic's pursuit. Karrde realized that this attack would earn the smugglers serious enmity from the Empire, and felt that organizing their groups together to meet the threat was more vital than ever. Karrde moved his operations to a long-abandoned fortress on Hijarna, where he continued collating intelligence reports.

When he returned, he was discomfited to see that Mazzic had brought a squad of bodyguards with him. Mazzic began confronting him, insisting the meeting be held aboard the Wild Karrde and accusing Karrde of having something to hide. Karrde realized that the intruder had been the nearly-invisible Defel Ferrier employed and he had been set up. He consented to the change of venue, but Karrde's employees were uneasy about Mazzic's actions and stalled the group, leading one of Mazzic's bodyguards to draw a blaster on Karrde and insist they be allowed aboard. Karrde refused to allow anyone more than the eight smuggler chiefs on board, where Mazzic demanded all Karrde's datacards.

Karrde attempted to persuade the others that he had been set up by Thrawn and Ferrier, who was acting increasingly defensive; finally, Ferrier blurted information he should not have known and suspicion fell squarely on him.

Car'das caught her and Karrde arrived during their conversation, summoned by Car'das. The older man told D'ukal that the Mistryl had been attacked in retaliation for a campaign of conquest they had begun, and offered her a choice between taking the attackers' identities with her and taking a datacard which he promised held information useful to the New Republic.
