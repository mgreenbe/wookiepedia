Each fighter would theoretically protect the one in front. It was thought that an attacking fighter would be unable to attack any member of the formation without coming under fire himself. The tactic was intended for slower, less capable spacecraft when attacked by enemy fighters. Luftberry circles were most often utilized by bomber spacecraft although some instances also occurred of obsolescent starfighters forming Luftberries against more advanced fighter types as a way of avoiding dog fights. Bomber formations using Luftberries often had the benefit of dorsal gunners that further prevented attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
