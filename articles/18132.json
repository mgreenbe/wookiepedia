In retaliation, seven Raptors under Scar Blenner took Teeloo's cargo, bruised and humiliated him, and forced him to participate in race through Eskaron. They planned on taking his ship, the Neeva-Beelo once they had had their fun with him, even if Teeloo won the race. During the beating, the Velkers were chased by visiting citizens who had almost been knocked down by the Raptors' skiff a few minutes before. Teeloo, who was a bad pilot and owned a battered ship, would have not had a chance in the race, but those same people selflessly offered their help. During the night, seven Raptors with grenades sneaked into Teeloo's docking bay. They aimed to sabotage the Neeva-Beelo, to ease their chances. In the middle of the race, the Blood Raptor pilot\u2014Gael Kinner\u2014destroyed one of Nirama's ships. Nirama's people, led by Len Markus, interrupted the Raptors' attempt to take Teeloo's ship, and took the Raptors and Teeloo's crew to see Nirama. Nirama had at least one of the Blood Raptors (presumably Kinner) fed to a rancor at the Bollin Exotic Animal Emporium. Markus suggested that Teeloo's allies took the Raptors' personal items and weapons before leaving, because the Raptors \"would no longer have use for them.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Living Force Campaign Guide, there was a gang active on Tolea Biqua and Varna Biqua called the Blood Velkers.
