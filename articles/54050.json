Gerlun and his fellow Dark Jedi confronted the Sith Lord. They were, however, no match for Wyyrlok's mastery of the Force and, under the influence of a Force illusion, Gerlun struck down Demtri. Soon after Darth Wyyrlok killed the rest of the group using Force lightning. He spared Gerlun, however, forcing him to guide him to Darth Andeddu's tomb. Inside the tomb Darth Andeddu's holocron tried to convince Wyyrlok to place the holocron on Andeddu's body, but he refused. In an attempt to avenge himself on Wyyrlok, Gerlun used the Force to grab the holocron and placed it on the body. When he did, however, his life was sucked out of him and Darth Andeddu was reanimated before also being destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
