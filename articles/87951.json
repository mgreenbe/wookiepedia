After the battle, the fleet gained the Star Destroyer Bloodfin, the flagship of the late Gilad Pellaeon. Daala and the Maw Irregular Fleet joined the Jedi Coalition soon after.

In 44 ABY, the time came for the fleet to be in use again when Daala was arrested after a successful coup creating the first Triumvirate of the Galactic Alliance. After freed by the bounty hunter Boba Fett, Daala reactivated the fleet and brought it to the Exodo system, where it rendezvoused with a supplement of Imperial Remnant starships from Moffs that she had blackmailed or thought that she should take control of the Remnant out from Head of State Jagged Fel, but due to Moff Tol Getelles secret loyalty to Fel, the fleet along with the Remnant supplement where ambushed in the system. Jagged Fel massed a fleet composing of several loyal Imperial Remnant ships as well as the Vanguard of the Empire of the Hand, believed by the greater galaxy to have been disbanded or destroyed in the aftermath of the Yuuzhan Vong War. The Battle over Exodo II ensued with both sides taking heavy ship losses, but the usurpers were able to destroy the Gilad Pellaeon, trying to kill Jagged Fel as the vessel served as his command ship. It failed as the Imperial Head of State was able to be transferred over to the Bloodfin, once more holding the Head of State of the Imperial Remnant safely aboard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Composition"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fleet's complement was:"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
