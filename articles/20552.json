In front of the situation of that moment, many ground troops from the Resistance were redeployed as extra shipboard security. Their task was to be present like vigilantes in case there was any breakdown of order in face that tensions began to rise as events turned increasingly dire. The assigned bridge guards, however, were forced to abandon their positions when the surviving members of the Resistance lead by General Leia Organa resolved to escape to Crait while Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo sacrificed herself to destroy the First Order's flagship Supremacy with the Raddus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
