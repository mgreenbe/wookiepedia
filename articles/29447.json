Installed in the ceilings, they would drop down once atmospheric pressure loss was detected. Containment shields were installed in the Bright Hope and were activated during their retreat from the Battle of Hoth. Unfortunately, the containment shields could not contain the explosive depressurization that occurred on many decks, including passenger level 1, and several lives were lost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
