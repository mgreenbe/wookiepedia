Its systems were easily accessed from inside and out for easy maintenance. The controls and sensor suites were recycled from a failed freighter design and easily mastered. The computers and communications arrays could be easily upgraded to full automation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The shuttle was 23.2 meters long. The ship required a single pilot, who was seated in a small cabin. The gangplank led to a passenger area with benches to accommodate eighteen. To either side of the gangplank were a storage area and weapons locker respectively, allowing a total cargo of one metric ton and consumables for two days. Being for intra-system use, the design lacked a hyperdrive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sienar contracted with the governments of Naboo and other lightly-populated worlds to provide the inexpensive but efficient ships.
