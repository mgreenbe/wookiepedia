He grew up during the tumultuous Time of the Rot which lasted almost a millennium and devastated much of the continent of Keshtah Minor. As a historian, Hilts hoped to use the wisdom of the ancients to reunite the Tribe. By that time, the Lost Tribe had descended into violent infighting, and the true origins of the Tribe had been forgotten. Unlike many of his Sith contemporaries, Hilts was very open-minded and forward-thinking. He even related to Keshiri, the purple-skinned humanoid beings indigenous to the planet Kesh, as his equals. Varner Hilts also developed a warm relationship with his Keshiri assistant Jaye Vuhld, who was a brilliant mathematician and theorist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3000 BBY, Iliana Merko, the leader of the Sisters of Seelah, attempted to coerce Hilts into giving her and her faction political favor on Testament Day. This attempt failed after Hilts tricked her into believing that the holocron of Yaru Korsin, which contained Korsin's Testament, would only activate on Testament Day. During Testament Day, the Tribe discovered an older transmission beneath Korsin's Testament which revealed that the Lost Tribe were actually descended from slaves of the Red Sith which ruled the former Sith Empire. This development sparked the Great Crisis which resulted in much rioting and unrest across Keshtah Minor. Following the disastrous Testament Day which destroyed Hilts' beloved archive, he and Jaye resolved to unseal the ancient Kesh Sith Temple and the starship Omen in order to find the secrets aboard the vessel which might hold the key to the Tribe's survival."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There they encountered Iliana Merko, who was seeking refuge from her Sith rivals during the Great Crisis. After much difficulty, the three explorers discovered the Tapani heritage of the Lost Tribe's ancestors and learnt that Kesh had another continent known as Alanciar. Through these discoveries, Varner Hilts was able to unite the various Sith factions and set the Tribe on a new mission of reaching and annexing this new continent. Hilts was unanimously elected by the other Sith as their new Grand Lord. Hilts subsequently married Iliana, who subsequently adopted his family name. While an ancient law stipulated that the consort of the Grand Lord was to be executed at the latter's death, Hilts vowed to protect her. Their marriage later produced a daughter named Takara Hilts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grand Lord Hilts' reign would be remembered by later generations as the Hilts Restoration and was regarded as a time of peace, stability and reconstruction. Under Hilts' leadership, the Lost Tribe undertook a massive programme to explore and colonize the other seas and landmasses on Kesh beginning with Alanciar. Hilt's endeavors would be supported by his wife Iliana and several other Sith including Edell Vrai and Korsin Bentado, who had earlier been bitter rivals during the Time of the Rot and the Great Crisis. These efforts succeeded with the relatively peaceful annexation of Alanciar in 2975 BBY. The Tribe successfully convinced the Alanciari man Jogan Halder that the Sith were actually the mythical Protectors who were fighting against the malevolent Destructors. Hilts himself pretended to be the Bright Tuash, a legendary avian messenger of the Gods, and helped support Halder's message. Acknowledging the strong influence of Adari Vaal on Alanciari history, he claimed that Adari was a well-meaning but misguided servant of the Bright Tuash."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the consolidation of the Lost Tribe's control over Alanciar, Lord Hilts turned his attention to exploring Kesh's South Pole Eshkrene in 2974 BBY. He theorized that the Keshiri legends of the Protectors and Destructors originated from an earlier group of offworlders who had discovered Kesh millennia earlier. Hilts enlisted the services of Parlan Spinner, an outlaw and assassin who had tried to kill him. Spinner and Hilts' daughter Takara sailed aboard an Alanciari sailing ship the Southern Star to Eshkrene. There, they discovered the Doomed, the descendants of ancient Jedi and Dark Jedi from the Hundred-Year Darkness who had devoted themselves to protecting the Keshiri and finding a balance in the Force. Spinner freed the ancient Sith Lord Remulus Dreypa, who had been imprisoned for millennia within an oubliette."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Spinner and Dreypa returned to Keshtah Minor where Dreypa resolved to return to the stars and instigated a slave uprising against the Tribe. Dreypa defeated the Tribe's forces and the Doomed with his Leviathan sithspawn. Hilts' wife Iliana narrowly survived being devoured by a Leviathan but was artificially aged. However, the Sith Lord was defeated through the combined efforts of Spinner and Hilts' daughter Takara. This ended a major threat to Grand Lord Hilts' rule while validating his earlier theory that the Lost Tribe were not the first group of offworlders to discover Kesh. In return for his services, Lord Hilts made Spinner his new Hand and the young man developed a romantic relationship with the Grand Lord's daughter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Varner Hilts was a male Human who was a member of the Lost Tribe of Sith, a group of stranded Human Sith who lived on the remote Wild Space planet of Kesh. Hilts grew up during the Time of the Rot, a nine-hundred period of turmoil and civil war which engulfed the Lost Tribe. When Hilts was still a child, his father, Slippery Hilts, died following an accident with his shikkar blade. Hilts' father had attempted to assassinate a certain faction leader with that blade but had failed to fasten the dagger's sheath. His mother also died shortly later during a failed attempt to seduce another faction leader. While her minions had delivered her inside a massive urn to that leader's private bedchambers, the lid was stubborn and she subsequently suffocated to death. Despite being orphaned during his childhood, Hilts persevered and developed an interest in the Tribe's history."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hilts eventually became the Tribe's caretaker and was in charged of providing the Tribe with accurate timekeeping and maintaining its historical archives. Hilts lived and worked in the capital city Tahv's capitol building, which had been the traditional residence of the Grand Lord. Hilts was accepted as Caretaker since few other Sith candidates were interested in that job. Most of the Sith were more interested in fighting for power. Varner Hilts' staff consisted of several Keshiri clerks who assisted him in his work. Unlike his other Sith contemporaries, Hilts treated his Keshiri staff as equals and eventually befriended Jaye Vuhld, a mathematician who helped maintain the city's Sandpipes, which were used to measure and record time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For over nine-hundred-and-sixty years, the continent of Keshtah Minor, the Tribe's domain, had been devastated by civil war which had been triggered by the death of Grand Lord Lillia Venn in 3960 BBY. Since Venn had failed to designate a successor, this had created a power vacuum as rival Sith factions fought for power. By 3000 BBY, there were over twenty rival factions competing for the Grand Lordship. Due to the fighting, many of Keshtah's cities including Tahv lay in ruins and most public infrastructure including the waterworks and roads had broken down. The only time that the various Sith factions gathered together peacefully was on Testament Day, a holiday held every twenty-five years where the Testament of Yaru Korsin, the founder of the Lost Tribe was read out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Hilts had not been able to participate in the first Testament Day when he was ten standard years old due to his young age, he committed himself to sufficient study and training. By the age of thirty-five, Hilts was able to manage that year's Testament Day due to his position as the Tribe's Caretaker. Due to his position as Grand Caretaker, Hilts had the power to convene the Pantheon's Peace which allowed a reading of Yaru Korsin's Testament from a holocron, an ancient Jedi and Sith technology which predated the Tribe. By the age of sixty, Hilts could memorize the contents of Korsin's Testament by heart. He was widely regarded within the Tribe as an expert on the Tribe's past. Due to the self-serving nature of the Sith and his dead-end position, Varner Hilts never found a long-term mate. Prior to 3000 BBY, Hilts encountered a Sith lover who seduced him and attempted to kill him. While Hilts survived the encounter, he was left with a scar which ran from his left eye to his temple."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Meeting Iliana"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3000 BBY, Hilts was walking through the streets of Tahv when he narrowly survived being hit by falling debris from a ruin aqueduct. He was saved from death by his Keshiri assistant Jaye who pushed him out of the way before the debris could crush him. While Hilts regarded that incident as just a normal day in the Crown of Kesh, Jaye regarded that near-accident as a narrow conjunction and an omen. Aware that there was a group of quarreling Sith nearby, the two men departed for the safety of the Caretaker's office within the Sith capitol building that dominated the Circle Eternal, a historic square in the heart of Tahv. Testament Day was twelve days away and the Circle Eternal's atrium was open to the public for the first time in twenty-five years. The atrium contained a massive Sandpipe which was carefully maintained by workers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While in the atrium, Jaye revealed that he and his fellow Keshiri mathematicians had calculated that Kesh's calendar was actually eight days behind the Galactic Standard Calendar, making today actually the fourth day prior to Testament Day. Jaye also revealed that year's Testament coincided with the Festival of Nida's Rise, a festival which commemorated the accession of Nida Korsin to the Grand Lordship every 79 years. Initially, Hilts was disinterested in Jaye's reports and merely commented that they would be able to save on wine this year. However, the two were interrupted by the arrival of Iliana Merko, a young woman who was the leader of the Sisters of Seelah, a Sith faction that revered Seelah Korsin, the estranged wife of Yaru Korsin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Iliana's armed followers waited within the palace atrium, Iliana herself confronted Hilts. She threatened Hilt's Keshiri assistant Jaye Vuhld with her lightsaber in order to draw Hilts' attention. Iliana also expressed her displeasure that the palace atrium contained no statues of Seelah Korsin but only contained statues of her estranged husband Yaru Korsin and her daughter Nida Korsin. Millennia earlier in 4975 BBY, Seelah and her son Jariad Korsin had plotted to overthrow Yaru Korsin. This coup failed and ended with Korsin killed and a crippled Seelah being banished to the Omen, the Sith warship that had brought the ancestors of the Lost Tribe to Kesh during the Great Hyperspace War. Since the failed coup, all statues of Seelah had been destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Iliana wanted to talk with Varner Hilts about the contents of Korsin's Testament before the other Sith arrived for the conclave in twelve days time. Hilts responded that everyone already knew about the contents of the Testament since it had been transcribed many times. Iliana reiterated that she knew the basic facts but then revealed the true reason for why she had come. Iliana was aware that Korsin's Testament had been used by different Sith factions to support their claims and to denigrate Seelah. Since the Sisters of Seelah had little to gain from Korsin's Testament, she tried to convince Hilts to change the Testament to favor her faction. Iliana wanted Varner Hilts to tell the other Sith that he and his Keshiri workers had discovered Korsin's \"true\" Testament which declared that Seelah and those who followed her teachings today were the legitimate heirs to power on Kesh. As part of their plan, the Sisters had produced a fake scroll that purported to be Korsin's \"true\" Testament."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By producing Korsin's \"true\" Testament, Iliana intended to uplift the Sisters of Seelah's standing within Sith society. However, Hilts was unwilling to cooperate with Iliana's scheme. While he admired the Sith woman's initiative, Hilts explained that Iliana's plan would not work because the Caretakers in reality did not actually read Korsin's Testament. He revealed that the Testament was actually read by a holo-recording of Yaru Korsin himself which was kept inside a holocron. In an effort to buy time until Testament Day, Hilts lied to Iliana that the holocron would only activate on Testament Day. This did not stop Iliana from fiddling with the holocron in a vain attempt to activate the projector."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Pantheon's Peace"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next four days, the Sisters of Seelah occupied the Circle Eternal's grand palace and held Varner Hilts' staff captive. The Sisters' presence attracted the attention of several rival Sith factions including the Korsinite League, Golden Destiny, Force 57. Over this period, the number of visitors which included the Human Sith and their Keshiri followers grew, which increased the risk of violence on the streets of Tahv. These Sith factions initially held off on violence but instead exploited the mass public gathering as a chance to recruit people to their causes. While there was a festive atmosphere due to Testament Day and Nida's Rise, there was also a risk that violence could escalate due to the deep rivalries between the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this time, Hilts and his assistant Jaye noted the Tribe's desire for a strong leader but lamented the poor quality of leadership within the Tribe, which had contributed to the Time of the Rot. When Jaye suggested that Hilts take up the mantle of leadership since he was well-versed in the ways of the ancient Protectors, Hilts responded that he was \"too wise\" for that position. Hilts knew that knowledge would not get him that far due to the toxic political environment. When Jaye responded that any free man or woman could become the Grand Lord, Hilts commented that it was a \"fine thing\" to believe in. However, he conceded that the \"right to rule\" had been abused by the Sith and had led to failure. For Hilts, the poor quality of leadership within the Tribe reflected the deep schisms within Sith society about the identity of the Tribe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hilts concluded that it was too late for him to assume a leadership role within the Tribe; likening himself to Donellan who never assumed power since his mother Nida had outlived him. When Jaye disagreed with Hilts' pessimism, Hilts responded that the former should never contradict a man of \"advancing years\" since that would shake his faith in his omniscience. When Jaye asked whether this rule applied when the person was wrong, Hilts replied that this rule indeed applied even when the person was wrong. Hilts then turned his attention to Iliana who was still preoccupied with trying to activate the holocron. Due to her lack of success, she was becoming increasingly impatient and frustrated. Frustrated at Hilts' unwillingness to help her to activate the Holocron, Iliana ordered her followers to harm Hilts' Keshiri secretary Jaye if he refused to cooperate. Left with no choice, Hilts reluctantly took the Holocron in his hand and agreed to activate it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that point, Varner and Iliana were both interrupted by the arrival of two rival Sith factions: the Korsinite League and Force 57. The Korsinite League was a Sith cult that had been founded by a former slave a century earlier which emulated Yaru Korsin and Nida Korsin. Each member adopted the name \"Korsin\" as their first name and their leader was Korsin Bentado. Meanwhile, Force 57 were another Sith cult that practiced ritual mutilation and scarring and were devoted to the original non-Human 57 aliens that were aboard the Omen. Since Seelah Korsin had destroyed all information related to the Red Sith, no living Sith or Keshiri could remember how they looked like."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before further lives were lost, Hilts was able to bring peace to the three factions by offering to do a reading from the holocron. After interceding between Iliana and Neera, the leader of Force 57, Hilts reminded the various Sith factions that the Circle Eternal was not the place for violence. Korsin Bentado suggested that the three Sith factions take their fight outside into the streets where several other factions had gathered. Hilts was unwilling to let bloodshed take place and offered to do the holocron reading. When Iliana realized that Hilts had lied, he retorted that lying was a Sith characteristic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bentado reiterated that the Korsinite League would not accept a reading of Korsin's Testament on any day besides the anniversary which was scheduled to occur within eight days time. At that point, Hilts convinced his Keshiri assistant Jaye to present his calculations concerning the Sandpipes. Jaye explained that the first Sith colonists had brought their Galactic Standard Calendar to Kesh which differed from the planet's length of days and years. Millennia earlier, the Sith had calibrated their Sandpipes to the magical chrono aboard the Omen prior to abandoning the ship. However, the Sandpipes in Tahv flowed one second slower than those aboard the Omen. This time difference meant that the Standard Calendar was eight days ahead of the Keshiri calendar. Hilts and Jaye then deduced that Testament Day and the Festival of Nida's Rise actually occurred on that day. Thus, Hilts was legally obliged to declare the Pantheon's Peace and ordered the assembled Sith to bring the other Sith leaders into the atrium."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "An Inglorious Past"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Varner Hilts presided over that year's Pantheon's Peace which was attended by the twenty leaders of the Sith factions. Per Sith tradition, all Keshiri including Hilt's trusted friend Jaye were excluded from the Pantheon's Peace since it contained sensitive secrets about the Tribe's origins. The Tribe's founder had been mortally wounded during Seelah's failed plot and had recorded his final testament to the Tribe. During the recording, Korsin expounded about the importance of the Tribe as a survival mechanism for the Human Sith on Kesh and how the Tribe's hierarchical structure should be managed to prevent future uprisings. Iliana was visibly angry when the late Grand Lord suggested the practice of killing the spouses of deceased future Grand Lords and talked about banishing Seelah. Meanwhile, Hilts was worried that the holocron recording contained no resolution that would end the infighting between the rival Sith factions or protect his staff and his position."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the end of Korsin's Testament, the assembled conclave descended into a verbal match. Korsin Bentado argued that the Tribe needed to adhere to Korsin's ancient tribal structure while the leader of the Golden Destiny, a faction obsessed with the Tribe's stellar origins, argued that the Tribe should reopen the Omen and return to the stars. Due to the loss of historical knowledge during the Time of the Rot, the Golden Destiny's leader mistakenly believed that Yaru Korsin was a \"great conqueror\" and that the Sith came from a powerful people who ruled the galaxy. While attempting to deactivate the holocron, Hilts discovered that the Testament recording had been recorded over an earlier transmission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The assembled Sith quickly learnt the true history of the Lost Tribe. It turned out that Yaru Korsin had used the holocron as a communications device during his servitude to the Sith Empire. Rather than being conquerors from a glorious past, the Human Sith had actually been slaves to the Sith Lord Naga Sadow, a red-skinned and tentacled-face humanoid. The \"vaunted\" Yaru Korsin was merely a \"delivery boy.\" The Omen was a dreadnought which had been tasked with delivering Lignan crystals to Sith forces on Kirrek during the Great Hyperspace War. In addition, Sadow dispatched Ravilan Wroth and his Massassi warriors to work with Korsin. It quickly transpired that Wroth and the \"Original 57\" had actually been members of an alien species known as the Red Sith, the original forebears of the Sith Order and the alien masters of the Tribe's ancestors. Finally, Sadow warned Korsin that he expected nothing but success and that failure would be punishable by death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These revelations about the Lost Tribe's origins as slaves sparked anxiety and panic among the attendees. Korsin Bentado initially reacted with disbelief and commented that Naga Sadow had been \"Korsin's celestial ally\" in folk tales. He was shocked to learn that the \"thing\" actually owned the Omen and its crew. In response, Iliana commented that the Tribe's ancestors had not been conquerors but had merely been \"diggers in the dirt\" and that the Tribe's founder had merely been a \"delivery boy\". Similarly, Neera commented that this was not Sith but madness. Iliana commented that this \"inglorious past\" had been what motivated Seelah Korsin to aspire for all members of the Tribe to be pure specimens. She deduced that Seelah was \"sanctifying\" the Humans on Kesh. Korsin Bentado accused Hilts and Iliana of tampering with the holocron. Hilts responded that he would not have known how to tamper with the device."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Caretaker then concluded that the Sith Tribe was just a \"lost\" Tribe that had ended up on Kesh because Korsin was unwilling to go back and face Sadow. Ashamed at the stigma that her ancestors had been merely runaway slaves, Iliana ignited her lightsaber and used it to destroy the holocron and the pedestal it stood upon. When Hilts asked her to justify her actions, Iliana warned the Sith that their ancestors did not want them to know about their \"inglorious past.\" She reasoned that the Tribe's origins as slaves had motivated Seelah to forbid any records of what Ravilan's people really looked like. She concluded that Korsin had recorded over the message to preserve this secret."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Hilts was open to telling the true story of the Tribe's origins, Korsin feared that this would inspire a revolt among the Keshiri. Neera vowed to kill anyone who revealed this secret while Iliana stressed that such measures would not be necessary since she had already destroyed the holocron. Despite efforts by the leaders of the Sith factions to preserve the secrecy of the Testament Day, a drunken Sith leader revealed the truth behind the Lost Tribe's origins to the Humans celebrating the Festival of Nida's Rise. This sparked a series of violent riots across Keshtah Minor, known as the Great Crisis, which resulted in the razing of several cities. Within eight days, the unrest had spread all over the continent. Since the Tribe had been reduced to a few thousand individuals, the ensuing bloodbath threatened the viability of the Tribe itself."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Saving the Tribe"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to his mild-mannered personality and poor combat skills, Varner Hilts did not take part in the fighting. During the riots, the Tribe's historical archive at the Kesh capitol building was destroyed; leading to the loss of Hilts' substantial collection of rare maps which depicted the continent of Keshtah Minor. The caretaker's large Sandpipe was also destroyed, which upset Hilts' assistant Jaye greatly. Hilts regarded the recent Testament Day as a disaster and feared that the ensuing violence would endanger the Tribe itself. While Jaye believed that this was the \"end of times\", Hilts recalled that Yaru Korsin had mentioned during his Testament that \"there were some secrets he had always kept and that the true power lay behind the throne.\" Korsin had instructed his descendants to search for this \"secret\" in the event that disaster befell the Tribe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Believing that Korsin had left a postscript, Hilts resolved to travel to the ancient Kesh Sith Temple and unseal it. The temple was the final resting place of the Omen, the ancient Sith vessel which had brought the Tribe's ancestors to Kesh. Hilts and Jaye returned to the Temple where they gathered some supplies and then traveled to the Kesh Sith temple, which was located at the northern tip of a long, mountainous peninsula which ran parallel to mainland Keshtah Minor. This journey lasted about a week and was fraught with danger and violence due to the Great Crisis. For safety, Hilts had brought Jaye with him to dispel fears among local Keshiri villages that he was on a murderous rampage. During the day, Hilts and Jaye took shelter in Keshiri shacks and only traveled at night."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his travels, Hilts managed to obtain a Sith lightsaber from a deceased Sith warrior who had died outside Kesh. Since they lacked any uvak steeds, Hilts and Jaye had taken the long-way to the Kesh Sith temple which involved walking along the dry and barren southern coast. This region had little shelter and sustenance for travelers. Hilts and Jaye had not eaten for several days. After seven days, the pair arrived at the base of The Blocks, a series of massive granite barriers which had been placed in a narrow pass by Nida Korsin to prevent anyone from accessing the Temple. Hilts and Jaye discovered several strong vines were growing among the stone's crevices; which they used to climb up the barrier. While climbing up the barrier, Hilts was trapped within a thorny web of vines which tightened around his limbs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After some difficulty, Jaye managed to free his master. After climbing the final barrier, the pair traveled up a path which led to the Temple. While walking up this path, Hilts noticed an uvak with a rider wielding a lightsaber above them. Hilts then fell into a posthole but was unhurt. Instead, he and Jaye used the posthole as a brief resting place. Throughout his career as the Tribe's historian, Hilts had memorized the contents of Yaru Korsin's Testament and the entire layout of the Kesh Sith Temple. Thus, Hilts knew that the Omen was buried beneath part of the upper plaza. They then climbed down a set of stairs which led them to the middle terrace. There, they found a freshly-killed uvak, the same one which Hilts had seen earlier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sensing the presence of another visitor in the wardroom, Hilts activated his lightsaber and investigated that structure. He also warned Jaye to run away if Hilts encountered trouble. Hilts noted that a statue of Seelah Korsin, the Mother of the Tribe, was built outside of the Wardroom. There, he encountered Iliana Merko, who was in a despondent state. Iliana had taken part in the fighting which accompanied the Great Crisis. During the fighting, her own Sisters of Seelah had splintered and Iliana had fled to the Sith Temple to escape her pursuers particularly Korsin Bentado, the leader of the Korsinite League whom she had seriously wounded earlier. In the Temple's wardroom, Iliana had discovered the remains of her idol Seelah Korsin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Merko was despondent because she could not come to terms that her ancestor had died alone. She was distraught that her forebears had left Seelah to die alone and forgotten on the Sith Temple. Iliana expressed her anger at the unjust treatment of Seelah.

When Hilts asked Iliana whether this was how she learned how to braid her hair, Iliana replied that she had seen Seelah washing the feet of the Sith quartermaster Ravilan Wroth. The revelation of Seelah's lowly origins destroyed the Sisters' unity of purpose and splintered the group. Enraged at this revelation, she smashed Seelah's skull against the wall which shattered into pieces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Jaye revealed his presence, Iliana was startled but Hilts assured her that the Keshiri was on his side. The Caretaker Hilts succeeded in convincing Iliana to follow them since they might need her help to find what they were looking for.

While Jaye believed that he was unworthy to be here with the Sith due to his Keshiri ancestry, Hilts urged him to forget about that belief and to shine more light.

However, Iliana was unable to find the command chair which was usually at the center of the command bridge. Hilts reasoned that the command chair was not inside the Omen since it have been moved by Yaru Korsin to the colonnade of the temple for use on the days when he received visitors.

These newcomers were disturbed that the Omen had been used to transport slaves eons ago and was the cause for their ancestors' \"imprisonment\" on Kesh.

The three explorers quickly realized that they were inside a planetarium which depicted the stars above Kesh.

Hilts discovered a glass vial was sewn to the upholstery which contained a single rolled-up sheet of transparent film. Hilts brought it to the fire and discovered that it contained the old cant of the Tapani, the language of the Humans under Sith rule. This film contained a message from Yaru Korsin's mother Takara Korsin to her son prior to his fateful delivery run to Phaegon III during the Great Hyperspace War.
