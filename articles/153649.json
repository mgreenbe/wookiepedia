Following the Battle of Yavin, the king was on the verge of dying. Thus, he gave his three children their future positions. He then sent his daughter, Trios, to meet with the Sith Lord Darth Vader. During the ball, the king sent assassins to kill Vader. However, they failed in their mission. When Vader was able to avoid another trap, the king became frustrated. He, along with his guards and two eldest children, Monthan and Hollian, were eventually killed by Vader's assassin droids, 0-0-0 and BT-1. Having liquidated most of the royal family, Vader appointed Trios as the new monarch of Shu-Torun, granting her the title of queen along with her father's crown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
