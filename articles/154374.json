By 43.5 ABY, he had become an officer within Galactic Alliance Security, serving on the galactic capital of Coruscant. In that year, several Jedi Knights began to fall under the psychotic influence of the dark side entity Abeloth, causing them to believe that everyone who remained unaffected had been replaced by impostors. A division between the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances and the Jedi Order resulted, as the Jedi wanted to have the afflicted Knights available for study, while the Galactic Alliance decided to encase the psychotic Knights in carbonite."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around that time, Jedi Knight Jysella Horn fell prey to the psychosis. She fled from the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and went on a rampage through the Processional Way, where two of her friends, the Jedi Bazel Warv and Yaqeel Saav'etu, attempted to stop her. Meanwhile, a contingent of Galactic Alliance Security troops, including the Quarren officer, rushed to the scene to try and capture Horn. Horn fled straight toward the approaching Security forces and was shot with a stun bolt, causing her to fall unconscious. The Security forces quickly apprehended her, and the Quarren officer was speaking into a handheld device when he was approached by Saav'etu. The Jedi attempted to use a mind trick to get the officer to turn Horn over to Jedi custody, but the Quarren proved impervious to her influence, threatening to arrest her for interfering with Horn's apprehension. He also added that, as they were outside of the Jedi Temple, they were within the Galactic Alliance's jurisdiction\u2014not within the Jedi's\u2014forcing Saav'etu to yield."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Quarren officer was able to resist the mind trick of Jedi Knight Yaqeel Saav'etu, refusing to hand Horn over to her when she attempted to persuade him with the Force to do so.

The officer was amused by Saav'etu's subsequent frustration, reasserting to her that, as they were outside of the Jedi Temple, they were not under Jedi jurisdiction.
