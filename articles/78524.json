Some time after surviving these events, Sperado and Cycyed Ock found their way to the opposite hemisphere of the moon. After discovering a smuggler's guide left behind by Shesslaria, the two left Jedha in a Z-95 Headhunter in hopes of finding Maz Kanata's treasure on Iskalon with their old crew, which consisted of Nersiton, Isin, and Rufork Tamson. While initially seizing the treasure, they were soon captured and thrown into Megalox Beta Penitentiary."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kullbee Sperado first appeared in the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was released in North America on December 16, 2016.
