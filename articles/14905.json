Vorrik hoped to destroy the shipyards as a means of both crippling the Empire and getting revenge for his defeat at the hands of what he thought were a crippled enemy. The local Sector Fleet under Yaga Minor's Moff, Kurlen Flennic, held off Vorrik's forces until, at the approach of Imperial reinforcements from Borosk, Vorrik decided against a second battle. He fled back towards the main Yuuzhan Vong concentration near the Galactic Core, pulling the last Yuuzhan Vong forces from the Remnant's territory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one point, a group of Vong infiltrators entered a lab where they discovered that the Empire was experimenting on Bafforr tree pollen.
