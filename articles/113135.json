After the Iktotchi bounty hunter Volan Das was captured by Republic forces while attacking a hypermatter refinery, he was taken to the Tempestuous and escorted to a cell by Reed and fellow clone trooper Cale. However, moments later Das and the prisoner Arlain Zee escaped from their cells, and the pair attacked and incapacitated Cale and Reed. Das and Zee then stole their clone trooper armors. Zee took Reed's armor while Das put on Cale's armor, until the Iktotchi realized he could not fit his head into the Human-sized helmet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
