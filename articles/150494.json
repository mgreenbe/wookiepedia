The unit was fitted with advanced laser actuators that gave the Twin DF.9 a fire rate of one energy bolt per second, but produced a smaller blast radius smaller than a standard DF.9. Many Twin DF.9s were self-propelled, and these were designated as the Twin SP.9. The Twin DF.9 also featured heavier armor on the housing, giving it greater protection to incoming blaster fire.
