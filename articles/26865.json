Despite being primitive in many aspects, including wearing metal armor and fur garments derived from a canine species, they also possessed advanced weaponry, such as blaster rifles, tanks, and holoprojectors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They also spoke Basic, alluding to at least some contact with other sentient species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Cilare believed themselves to be strong and impregnable to any threat since they had mastered all native predators on their homeworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Completely isolated from the galaxy for their history, the Cilare's isolated existence came to an end with the break-out of the Yuuzhan Vong War in 25 ABY.

The Cilare gladly met this threat head-on, assembling their armies and marching toward the invasive threat. Despite their strength and their experience, however, they were easily wiped out by the onslaught of the Vong's Fire Breathers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The warrior species were quickly exterminated as the Yuuzhan Vong pacified their homeworld. Only one warrior, Arbeloa survived to tell the story, and transmitted a signal before he was taken captive aboard a Yuuzhan Vong slaveship Tsam P'ah. During his captivity, the signal was eventually picked up by the two-men crew of the exploratory ship Pythea\u2014the Chiss Panha and her Wookiee companion Sarkkin.
