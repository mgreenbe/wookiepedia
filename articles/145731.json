It was apparently once dominated by the Night Spirit, the Ewok denotation for the dark side of the Force due to its use by the evil wizards. The wizards were eventually banished from the forest moon, apparently purging the forest of its evil presence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the wizards eventually returned, and the stranger entered the forest and used the Stone Circle again, imprisoning the Ewok shaman Logray in a force field within one of the stone columns.
