The port tower doubled as a covert station for Rebel SpecForce operatives guarding contraband munitions in the warehouse district. Special Forces commando Spane Covis was stationed there shortly before the Battle of Yavin. Darth Vader learned of the Rebel presence on Nar Shaddaa, and sent two camouflaged Gamma-class Assault Shuttles to raze the port. Large sections of the port tower were destroyed during the siege, but the small band of Rebels managed to largely survive the Imperial onslaught."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
