The ceremony was in the Grand Audience Chamber of the Great Temple, where the Rebel Alliance had once celebrated the explosion of the first Imperial Death Star, although the Chamber's central aisle had been refitted with a red carpet for the occasion. The Wookiee Chewbacca was to serve as Solo's best man, while the droid counterparts C-3PO and R2-D2 were to share the title of \"best droid.\" However, the ceremony was aborted before the bride could even walk down the aisle when Triclops, son of the late Galactic Emperor Palpatine, entered the room and attacked the attendants. That incident set the actual wedding back for three more years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
