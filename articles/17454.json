It was rumored that even as a child, he knew how to hot-wire ion drives. Jack's pirates would infiltrate ships, hiding in cargo holds or maintenance crawlways, and then typically take over the ship using minimal violence. They were known to hack into ships' computer systems to plant viruses, or inject pacifying gases into the life support systems to subdue the crews. He was known for being merciful, and he only killed in self-defense. Most often the crews of ships stolen by him and his pirates would find themselves floating home in jettisoned escape pods. It was a bit of a mystery what happened to the ships Jack stole\u2014and he had a record of several hundred of stolen vessels. Some held that he would sell them on the black market to fellow criminals or to naive legitimate businessmen.
