During this time, she visited the Upper City Cantina, where she met a Human named Jergan. Asking about her opinion on the cantina's Bith band, Jergan offered Lana the chance to meet the band after the show, claiming that he had a Rodian bodyguard who could arrange a backstage meeting for a sum of twenty credits. Lana agreed and gave him the money, which Jergan ran off with, promising to set up the meeting with his contact and return. When he did not come back, Lana began to suspect a trick and went backstage in search for Jergan; however, nobody backstage knew him. Realizing that she had been conned, Lana started looking for Jergan, hoping to reclaim her money, with interest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lana was a red-haired woman with green eyes and fair skin.

Witnessing Jergan running off with Revan's money, Lana reveals that she has been tricked by him a week earlier and asks the player if she knows where Jergan went.
