The Gormak were a tech-savvy species, but did not develop space-flight capability previous to contact with the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire in 3653 BBY. After a failed invasion attempt by the Sith Empire, the Gormak turned their efforts toward constructing space-craft. The Gormak were known to convert stolen Republic and Imperial technology for their own uses, and were adept at constructing weapons and machinery from salvaged parts. They build it in Gorma-Koss under the guidance of Jokull. He united dozens of tribes for that project. The Gormak believed that this ship would be the key to their survival."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
