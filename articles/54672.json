Following the Battle of Yavin, Lumpback operated out of the Meatlump Hideout in Coronet City. Lumpback dealt with customer complaints concerning the hideout's kissing booth. It was not uncommon for the Meatlump droolers, after kissing a customer, to transmit a viral infection called Meatlump Mono. Spacers who got this infection could go to the Meatlump complaint department, staffed by Lumpback, to demand a refund of their Meatlump Lump. However, Lumpback would put customers through a bureaucratic process, all the while cowering behind a wooden box, and using a retooled B2 super battle droid as a customer service intermediary."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gitchur Lumpback was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
