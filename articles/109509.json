During that year, her daughter, Princess Calvaria, in her absence, kidnapped the parents of the child Klay\u2014for not only trespassing, but also allegedly violating Nallastia's sacred wildlife laws\u2014and, per her wrongful decree, placed them inside an energy field created by ancient Trinity Stones. When the 18-year-old Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker crashed his starfighter on the moon, Quenelle was recruited by the Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Bultar Swan to help locate him. But when she discovered, at her fortress, that Skywalker had befriended Klay and had taken Calvaria hostage in order to bargain for the release of the boy's parents, Quenelle revealed herself as the Skull Queen, chastised her daughter, then went hunting with Kenobi for the Lost Stars of Nallastia\u2014three ancient jewels that could disable the energy field. The jewels were found within the jungle-moon's Cavern of Screaming Skulls and Klay's parents set free."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the subsequent celebration at the Queen's fortress, the Esseles shipbuilder Groodo the Hutt took over a spaceport on nearby Fondor, where he took Calvaria hostage.

Their mission was a success, and the greedy Hutt and his cohorts\u2014Hurlo Holowan and Senator Rodd of Fondor\u2014fled.
