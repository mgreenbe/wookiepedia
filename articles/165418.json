They entered the bike in the Cularin Classic swoop race, in which it was to be pitted against organic racers, drawing significant media coverage to the event. During the race, the bike's controls were operated by the SoroSuub employee Imik Suum. However the Togorian criminal Mebara Jos jammed the bike's controls, hoping to make it crash into a crowd of spectators, although the Heroes of Cularin were able to prevent the bike from leaving the course."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
