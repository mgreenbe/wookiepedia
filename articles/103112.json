From orbit, Pam'ba appeared large and round, with a small number of blue oceans separated by sandy savannas and the marshes. Near the equator, the planet had a brighter green color, signifying jungles or rainforests. Pam'ba also had cold, gray mountains, which were surrounded by snowy regions. The atmosphere of Pam'ba was breathable to humans and Mirialan hybrids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pam'ba was home to several non-sentient species in its marshes, including small, long-legged birds and thick-skinned animals with long faces.

Eventually, the rough environment led to the mines closing and the planet becoming mostly abandoned. Following the Clone Wars and the start of the Great Jedi Purge, former Jedi Padawan Naq Med left his family and fled to the abandoned planet, with the hopes of keeping his daughter, J'Hara, safe. From Pam'ba, Med maintained contact with J'Hara until the New Republic Era, nearly one-hundred-fifty years after the planet's abandonment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the New Republic Era, J'Hara left a posthumous message for her grandson, Karr Nuq Sin, telling the young human of their family history and describing where to find Med's house on Pam'ba. Sin, along with his friends Maize Raynshi and RZ-7, embarked to Pam'ba on board the yacht Avadora. When they arrived, they landed the Avadora near what remained of a mining office and traveled through the marshes by foot. When Sin located Med's house, he discovered that the former Jedi was still alive, and the two shared their stories with one another before Med peacefully died. When Sin, Raynshi, and RZ-7 left Pam'ba, they burned down the structure, leaving no trace of the home."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pam'ba first appeared in the young adult novel Force Collector, which was written by Kevin Shinick and published in 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
