The store had once been owned the Koorivar Sheb Valaad during the Clone Wars before Valaad was arrested by the Jedi for dealing in black market goods. After the Destruction of Alderaan, the Imperial agent Seyn Marana was placed undercover, posing as Rudaga's slave that did forgeries for the gangster. The Empire told Rudaga that he would allow Marana to be undercover, anticipating an attack from the rebel group known as the Dreamers. When they attacked Rudaga's store, Marana lied to the Dug and told him he would be safe, but the Dreamers killed him and his Trandoshan guards. Marana then left the store and successfully infiltrated the group when she was allowed to join their ranks after she had been freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
