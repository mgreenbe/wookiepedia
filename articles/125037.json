It functioned by confusing and displacing the tracking lock of a tractor beam, enabling a ship to escape the hold of the beam. It consisted of a wave-layered bomb, containing highly reflective particles, that would throw off the tracking lock, presumably by confusing the tractor beam's sensors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Improvised shrouds"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A shroud could also be improvised, as Han Solo demonstrated during the encounter of the Hand of Judgment and the Reprisal over Gepparin. Han Solo and the Hand of Judgment, on board the Melnor Spear, were caught in the tether of a tractor beam originating from the Reprisal. Han ordered Chewbacca to execute a maneuver whereby Chewbacca, aboard the Millennium Falcon, destroyed a TIE/LN starfighter that was traveling along a similar vector to the Melnor Spear. Han then maneuvered the Melnor Spear so that the cloud of debris created by the TIE fighter caused interference in the Reprisal's tractor-beam lock. With the lock broken, the Melnor Spear was able avoid recontact with the tractor beam, due to Han Solo's flying, and escaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
