More than capable of handling freight traffic, smugglers, and pirates, the Guardian was not well equipped for large-scale boarding actions as it lacked the space for a sizable boarding party, with crews often opting to simply destroy targets in true Imperial fashion. To assist in interdiction and customs, Guardians could be outfitted with external docking points to carry TIE Fighters; however, these fighters  reduced maneuverability noticeably."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Guardian-class was one of the three main ship classes employed by Imperial Customs, and was a common Imperial system patrol craft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Guardians, which were in service from before the Battle of Nar Shaddaa, were a common sight in lightly populated, isolated systems where the Galactic Empire needed to maintain a presence without underwriting the expense of assigning a larger vessel to patrol duty.
