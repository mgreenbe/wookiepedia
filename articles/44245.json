He was informed by Count Dooku that if he failed he would not only lose his money but his life as well. He lost the transport with the crystal which was captured by Kenobi and Skywalker, but still got to the city where he entered Governor Blom's office. As he was about to speak he realized that he and the Pau'an were not alone and saw Dooku's enforcer: General Grievous. The cyborg was as displeased as his master and asked Endente where was the crystal. The Sugi attempted to cover up his failure by telling him that it would be delivered on time. With that said, Grievous sarcastically asked again if the Jedi were also part of the plan after which he revealed that he knew of the latter had lost the object. Grievous stated that he had no more business to do with him, and after which he decapitated the arms dealer, and threw his body to the other side of the room. Grievous then went to deal with the Jedi himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Endente first appeared in an unfinished episode of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, \"In Search of the Crystal,\" and was voiced by James Hong."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
