When his forces were decimated by rebels under the leadership of Alto Stratus, Master Norcuna was left to crawl through the mud as the opposition forces closed in on him. While the Jabiimi Nationalists looked on, Stratus grabbed Master Norcuna by one of his lekku and beheaded him with his steel sword while the Jedi recited the Jedi Code.
