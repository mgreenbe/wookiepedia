Some time between 3 and 4 ABY, the vessel was captured by the Alliance to Restore the Republic, who used it to raid Imperial Refining Platform M36, a refinery in the Outer Rim Territories. Assisted by Luke Skywalker, the team of rebels managed to steal fuel from the refinery, but their escape was blocked by an Imperial-class Star Destroyer. Skywalker landed his X-wing in the vessel's hangar, where he and the rebel major used a shuttle to draw the attention of the Imperial TIE fighters away. The tactic worked, and the rebels aboard 49AX3 were able to evacuate, escaping to a nearby world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
