His mother, Satele Shan, later Grand Master of the Jedi Order, names her son and then reluctantly gives Theron to be raised by Jedi Master Ngani Zho. The novel moves then to the present in 3640 BBY. Now a covert agent with the Republic Strategic Information Service, Theron Shan is on Nar Shaddaa to talk with Morbo the Hutt to plead for the life of Teff'ith, a Twi'lek female smuggler for the Old Tion Brotherhood that Theron has taken under his watch. Morbo the Hutt has decided to have Teff'ith and the crew she is with killed for violating his terms of spice smuggling in his territory. Before talking with Morbo, Theron interrupts a 3 month long SIS operation to free several Republic Military prisoners of war who are being sold by Morbo. Though Theron frees the soldiers, the SIS operation falls apart. Unable to convince Morbo to back off, Theron races to the spaceport. He arrives in time to help Teff'ith, though she is unaware of it, to kill the thugs sent by Morbo. On Coruscant, Director of Republic Strategic Information Service Marcus Trant meets with the Supreme Commander of the Republic Military, Jace Malcom. Together they discuss the state of the Cold War, now turned into the Galactic War. Trant and Malcom plan a new mission to destroy the Ascendant Spear, a dangerous prototype Imperial battle cruiser under the command of Darth Karrid, a Falleen Sith Lord. The mission is planned as a joint operation between the Republic Military, SIS, and the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the Dark Council debates possible candidates to be promoted to the council. Darth Marr puts Darth Karrid's name forward, though the Council is hesitant because she was Darth Malgus' apprentice and Malgus attempted to claim the Imperial throne and was branded as a traitor. Added to that, Karrid is a Falleen, not a pure Sith blood or a Human. The council comes to no decision and though Marr assures Karrid and urges her to be patient, she is angry, determined to be on the council. Theron Shan arrives on Coruscant and is escorted to SIS headquarters. He is chewed out by Trant for disobeying orders and causing the mission to fail. Trant reassigns Theron to the Analytics Department as a punishment. He asks Theron to trust him and to being planning a new special mission, Operation End Game. Theron is able to later develop a plan after a call from Teff'ith and the mention of Ziost inspires him. Darth Karrid meanwhile joins the battle over Leritor where she manipulates Darth Gravus into attacking her and she proceeds to destroy him and the Republic forces. The move wins approval from the Dark Council and they decide to let Darth Karrid join them. Shortly there after, Minister Davidge of the Imperial Ministry of Logistics reports to Darth Marr that there is a risk of loosing Boranall and there is a growing number of Republic ships. Darth Karrid agrees to go there to ensure Imperial rule."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Coruscant, Theron's plans move forward with Jedi Master Gnost-Dural joining the group. Theron has been chosen by Supreme Commander Malcom to lead the operation. After the meeting, Malcom invites Theron to his apartment.

The two agree to talk more later and they part on good terms. Theron and Master Gnost-Dural leave for Ziost. They are able to secure a black cipher from Minister Davidge's office. The black cipher allows the SIS to monitor Imperial transmissions and make further plans. Theron goes to see his mother and confronts her about not revealing who his father is. They argue but Satele stands by her position that it was the right course to take. At the she had believed that Jace Malcom could follow the dark side. After Theron leaves, Satele dreams a flashback. It involves an argument she had with Jace Malcom when she confronted him about brutally pursuing Imperial soldiers after the Battle of Alderaan. Malcom refuses to back down and Satele breaks down but decides to break off their 6 month affair and not reveal to him she is pregnant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Theron and Master Gnost-Dural leave for Desevro.

There Theron intends to infiltrate the Ascendant Spear. However, he learns that the Empire attacked Ruan causing massive devastation. Theron contacts Malcom and Trant who acknowledge they knew the attack was coming and the next attack will be to Duro. They plan on allowing the attack to go ahead since Ascendant Spear will not be there. Angered, Theron hatches a plan with Gnost-Dural to have the Ascendant Spear take part in the attack forcing Malcom and Trant to send a fleet. Theron also asks to Teff'ith to inform Satele Shan of what is happening to have her convince Malcom to send the fleet. Meanwhile, Gnost-Dural, aiming to force Karrid to take part in the attack, infiltrates the Ascendant Spear and takes on Darth Karrid and several of her Sith apprentices. Gnost-Dural intentionally lets himself be defeated and taken alive. Theron meanwhile sets off a simulated Republic attack. The confusion allows Theron to also get on to the Ascendant Spear where he begins scouting the ship and hacking into the system. Following Theron's request, Teff'ith fights with Gorvich who wants to keep the ship, the Prosperity.

Gnost-Dural pretends to finally \"crack\" and \"gives up\" that he was hoping to keep Karrid away from Duro. Karrid decides to head for Duro. At the same Satele and Teff'ith convince Malcom to send a fleet to Duro to intercept the coming Imperial attack and the Ascendant Spear.

The novel ends."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Annihilation was originally unconfirmed as to where the novel falls in the timeline. When Rise of the Hutt Cartel was released, the Codex entry for Darth Acina claimed that she was Darth Hadra's successor instead of Darth Karrid, though this was later remedied, placing Annihilation between the Battle of Ilum but before the events of Rise of the Hutt Cartel. Annihilation focuses on a number of primary characters: Theron Shan and Teff'ith from The Lost Suns, Gnost-Dural from the Galactic Timeline videos, and Satele Shan and Jace Malcom from The Old Republic and its cinematic trailers. Annihilation directly references several elements from The Old Republic, such as Darth Malgus's betrayal on Ilum, the death of the Emperor, and the death of three Dark Councilors on Corellia. The novel was the first to give a name to the SIS Director, who had previously gone unnamed in The Lost Suns; however, the novel did contradict the game and the rest of the metaseries by claiming that the Battle of Alderaan occurred thirty years prior to the novel in 3670 BBY. Annihilation also reveals Theron Shan's father to be Jace Malcom, expanding on the events of the cinematic trailers in which Satele Shan and Malcom appeared. Marcus Trant and Theron Shan have both been featured in promotional material framed as official SIS reports that were released to lead up to Rise of the Hutt Cartel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
