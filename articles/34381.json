The group originally included Jedi Knight Tekli, bounty hunter Tahiri Veila, Imperial Remnant Head of State Jagged Fel, former Alliance Intelligence agent Winter Celchu, and Jedi Master and healer Cilghal. Fel and Solo were initially unsure about adding Mirax Terrik Horn to the group as the organization would have to be kept secret from the Jedi Masters, including Terrik Horn's husband, Corran Horn, but they decided to include her anyway. Darkmeld soon captured the psychotic Jedi Knight Seff Hellin during his attempt to free carbonite-encased Jedi Knight Valin Horn\u2014who suffered from the same psychosis\u2014from the Armand Isard Correctional Facility. This allowed the Jedi Order to study the mysterious psychosis in hopes of finding a cure; and prevented the Galactic Alliance from encasing him in carbonite as they had done Horn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Master Cilghal, a member of the Council, who was the only known Master in regular contact with Grand Master Luke Skywalker, found out about Hellin, and joined Darkmeld shortly thereafter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lina Zev and Karn Valanti later served as doubles for Solo and Fel, respectively, when they wanted to go on a date free from the press.
