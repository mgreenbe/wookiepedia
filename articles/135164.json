It consisted of a tower on the surface of a planet. During the High Republic Era, the name of Stars' End was a common exclamation. Kalo Sulman, the Speaker of an agricultural colony on Sedri Minor, used the name of Stars' End as an expletive while reacting to the sight of the Trandoshan Jedi Master Sskeer sporting a wooden arm due to an encounter with the Drengir, sentient carnivorous plants. Stars' End was destroyed during the Imperial Era when a Corellian lowlife blew it into orbit in order to free a Wookiee. According to the labor droid Bollux, the Corellian in question may have been Han Solo, and the Wookiee Chewbacca."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
