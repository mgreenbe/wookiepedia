The planet was surrounded by a minefield which had been left there during the Second Imperial Civil War. In 139 ABY, the assassin droid AG-37 and his companions visited this planet while delivering supplies. During their visit, his friend Ania Solo attempted to tame a yarthul but lost and was forced to hand over her comlink as collateral. Later, Ania discovered that the Galactic Federation Triumvirate had placed a bounty on her head for the alleged murder of the Imperial Knight Teemen Alton. Shortly later, Ania was kidnapped by her former lover Ramid, who also attempted to blow up AG-37's freighter in the orbital minefield.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
