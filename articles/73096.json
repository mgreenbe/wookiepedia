They were able to sometimes trick people into thinking that they were simply one individual. They used this trick on General Grievous at an unspecified time before the Battle of Geonosis and were able to gain his trust enough to be invited onto his starship. While there, they were able to steal Grievous' collection of Sith lightsabers and flee undetected. However, Grievous was not kept unaware for long, and he tracked them to the acidic world of Dica where he engaged them in combat. Kaa and her twin were unable to overcome the powerful cyborg, and they were forced to flee without the stolen weapons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Origins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Near-Human of unknown origin, Kaa was nearly identical to her twin sister Lii in every respect except for the distinguishing vertical tattoos that adorned her face. Her sister possessed the same tattoos but in a horizontal manner. Both Kaa and her sister were adept in the Force, and they had obviously trained in its usage. However, whether they had received training from the Jedi Order or elsewhere is unknown. In any case, the two sisters eventually went rogue in the hopes of becoming Sith. To accomplish this goal, Kaa and her twin rationalized that they would need Sith weapons, and they decided to seek out Sith lightsabers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Theft"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was during this mission that the sisters met with General Grievous, who possessed a small collection of lightsabers that had been previously owned by the Sith. Posing as though the two sisters were only one individual, Kaa and her sister were able to gain Grievous' trust enough to be invited onto his ship. With the cyborg fooled into thinking that there was only one of them, it was easy for the twins to rob Grievous of his most prized possessions, at least four Sith lightsabers. Although Grievous suspected the Dark Jedi of suspicious behavior, it wasn't until after they had departed the ship that he became aware of the thievery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kaa and her sister left for the acidic world of Dica, but Grievous was hot on their tail. Obviously sensing that the cyborg had found them, the twins faced their foe with Lii carefully concealed behind her sister. As Grievous commanded that the Dark Jedi state her name, the twins revealed their dual nature to the surprised General. Although he was taken aback by the revelation of having to face two Dark Jedi, Grievous still resolved to kill them both and charged the Jedi with his lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Duel"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The three combatants began to duel, with Kaa and her sister both wielding two of the stolen Sith lightsabers. Kaa brought her weapon down upon Grievous, but the cyborg blocked the blow with his metal hands and held the blade fast. Just as it seemed that Kaa would have a premature end, her sister was able to quickly maneuver around behind Grievous to attack him there, but Grievous was able to parry the blow. Still outgunned, the sisters decided to try a tandem attack, and calling to each other, the two jumped away from Grievous' grasp on Kaa's command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The jump placed Kaa and her sister in front of Grievous as they both swung their weapons at the cyborg's face. Unfortunately for the Dark Jedi, the attack was only able to slightly scar Grievous' mask and did no permanent damage. Grievous was able to dodge out of the way by using his talon shaped feet to grapple himself under the cliff side that the trio had been dueling on. Kaa suspected the General's antics and peered precariously over the cliff edge. However, just at that moment, Grievous decided to attack. With one quick jump back onto the ledge, Grievous surprised Kaa and her sister and swung his blade at the two Dark Jedi, swiping the Sith weapons out of the twins' hands."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Surprisingly disarmed by the cyborg, Kaa and her sister watched as their prized weapons fell slowly into one of the many acid lakes on Dica. With their weapons gone, the twins fled the scene as quickly as they could. As the two Dark Jedi fled into the mist, Grievous called after them, mocking their na\u00efve attitudes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kaa was created by Yasushi Nirasawa for use in the short comic story, Dark Jedi that appeared in Star Wars Manga: Silver. Originally published in Japan, those stories were considered to be of \"fuzzy\" continuity by Lucasfilm. Since then, they have been republished in English in the United Kingdom under Infinities label, which established the material in them as non-canonical. Abel G. Pe\u00f1a referenced this story somewhat in his article, The Story of General Grievous: Lord of War when he mentioned that Grievous had obtained one of his lightsaber prizes from a Dark Jedi on Dica or Necropolis. Whether this refers to either of the sisters definitively remains to be seen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
