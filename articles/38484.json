It was much larger and more luxurious than the typical headquarters of a moff, including ivrooy coral furniture. By 19 ABY, in addition to housing the personal offices and quarters of Moff Vilim Disra, it also housed the meeting area of the Council of Moffs. Fifty meters below the main building was a torture/dungeon area, as well as a secret escape tunnel to the hills to the north of the complex. Disra had lined the palace with holocams accessible from his office."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
