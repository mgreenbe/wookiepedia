The player, taking the role of Kenobi, may meet this guard during the course of the game's fifth mission. The player can talk to the guard using several dialogue options, and may choose to ignore the guard or bring him water. If the player chooses the latter option, the player finds a nearby pool of water and brings the canteen back to the guard, who gives information to the player about the nearby tank. This article assumes this canonical path. The video game's strategy guide explains how to complete this side-quest. In the game's credits, Nick Jameson is listed as voicing \"Injured Soldier #2,\" while Greg Burson is listed as voicing \"Injured Soldier #1,\" although it is not clear who voices this individual character."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
