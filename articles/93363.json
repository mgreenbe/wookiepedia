The medium took weeks to grow and consisted of using different strains of moss and making patterns from their different colors. Around five years before the Battle of Yavin, the Mandalorian artist and demolitions expert Sabine Wren heard about moss paintings over the Shadowfeeds. She wrote about the art style in her journal, speculating she might be able to use it in her graffiti if she could put up pre-grown paintings using adhesive growth cultures. Wren worried that Hera Syndulla, the owner of the starship Ghost where Wren lived, would not want moss growing on the starship and also wondered if the moss painters on Alderaan would consider her pre-grown images cheating. Despite these issues, she wanted to recreate one of the works of the artist Janyor of Bith in the medium."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moss painting first appeared in the Star Wars Legends reference book The Illustrated Star Wars Universe, which was written by Kevin J.
