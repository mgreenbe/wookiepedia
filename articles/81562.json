The ecumenopolis was the homeworld of House Santhe and the headquarters of Santhe/Sienar Technologies. Located on the junction of the Perlemian Trade Route, the Cadinth Run and the Shaltin Tunnels, Lianna was one of the busiest ports in the Tion Cluster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lianna was conquered by warlords from Tion in the planet's early history, though it later fell under the jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Barseg by the time of the Galactic Republic. It was never, however, a part of Xim's empire, though this claim to independence was mocked by many other Tionese, as during Xim the Despot's reign Lianna was a bleak agricultural world with a population of only a few thousand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galactic Senate overlooked Lianna, so the planet continued to be ruled as a traditional territory. At approximately 300 BBY, the Senate eventually decided to take control of Lianna from Barseg, though some two hundred years later, Sienar Technologies set up operations on Lianna, after the planet continued to be misused as an industrial center even after the Senate's intervention. Soon after, the company was taken over by Kerred Santhe, who moved his company's headquarters to Lianna."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under the control of Kerred's granddaughter, Valles Santhe, the planet remained independent and proud of its economic power, though it eventually supported the Republic during the Clone Wars, during which the Battle of Lianna was fought.

Fortunately, as Lianna produced many of the Empire's TIE fighters, Santhe was able to hold off the attacks by threatening to cease production. The threat, plus some well-placed bribes, allowed Lianna to remain neutral by special charter of the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Firebird Society was also founded on Lianna."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A standard day on Lianna lasted for twenty-two standard hours, and a year encompassed three hundred and seventy local days."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Allied Tion appears as an independent government that issued letters of marque during the New Republic in Pirates & Privateers.
