During Moff Kentor Sarne's reign as ruler, he built a secret hangar in the valley, and berthed the CR90 corvette Renegade there. He used the hangar facilities to heavily modify the Renegade in preparation for a foray into the Kathol sector to retrieve the DarkStryder technology. In 8 ABY, when the planet was liberated by the New Republic, the location of the corvette and valley was divulged to Lieutenant Judder Page by Jessa Dajus. The Renegade was commandeered and renamed the FarStar, and used in the hunt for Moff Sarne."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
