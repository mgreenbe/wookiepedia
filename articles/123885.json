When engaging the crew of the Shamunaar in a simulation, Klauskin locked himself and Biurk in the auxiliary bridge. Klauskin immediately fired three shots into Biurk, killing him, then proceeded to open all of the hatches on the ship, suffocating the crew. He later turned the ship over to the Five Worlds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
