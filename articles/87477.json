After the Declaration of a New Order, in 19 BBY, Kinyen surrendered without resistance to the newly formed Galactic Empire, on the condition that the Imperial forces did not occupy the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three years later, in 16 BBY, the Empire used Kinyen as an orbital staging area for its Western Reaches campaign. During that time, the Empire forced the Gran's conditional surrender by deploying garrisons in Kinyen's offworld quarters. As a reward for its peaceful surrender, Kinyen was allowed to continue engaging in trade for more than a decade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The bombardment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the Empire demanded a greater access to the planet and an increase of the food production, but the Gran refused. In response, the Imperial forces bombarded the heavily populated city of Malthee, leaving nothing but a crater."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the bombardment, the Empire broke the conditions of Kinyen's initial surrender and landed occupation forces.

However, just as many Gran became sympathetic to the Rebel Alliance. The leader of the underground resistance, Gorbek Fask, set up a network of farmers that provided foodstuffs and credits to the Rebellion. Fearing more bombardments, the Gran restricted the Alliance from conducting military operations on Kinyen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Additionally, the Malthee Crater became a monument to Imperial aggression and a site of pilgrimage. The Gran built a granite memorial around the crater, displaying the carved names of those lost in the tragedy. Later, a Doellinist temple was also erected at the Malthee Crater to provide services for those visiting to honor the lost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
