Lunis was killed by the miners before Obs Kaj's eyes. She escaped from the miners in one of their short-range pods, and tried to hail any nearby ships, soon finding one in range. Unfortunately, the ship belonged to Count Dooku, who had his ship fire upon the pod, destroying it and killing Kaj."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
