Hreeda was exceptionally skilled with a blaster and few beings would stand a chance against him in a lightfight. During his career, Hreeda obtained several scars that marked his face, but his most distinctive injury lost him his left antennae, leaving a large scar running the length of his face from his missing antennae, between the eyes, to his right cheek."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Empire destroyed everything that Hreeda held dear, he honed his skills with a blaster until he was more than a match for all but a select few in the galaxy. He hired his services out as a mercenary, and relished any opportunity to strike back at the Empire he hated. His primary focus was to tear down the empire one stormtrooper at a time. He was seen as a protecting hero and vigilante to his home clan, and came to exact vengeance when a rival clan hired pirates to raid medical supplies from his people."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hreeda made use of dual blaster pistols carried in dual holsters at his waist.
