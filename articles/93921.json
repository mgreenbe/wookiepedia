Beckett killed several of his attackers, but was hit in the head by Enfys Nest's electroripper staff. Nest revealed that she had hijacked Crimson Dawn's communications to assign them the mission, and demanded that Beckett tell her where he had hidden them. To prevent Nest getting the ID chips, Beckett used a detonator to destroy the Rampart, knocking both his crew and Nest's Cloud-Riders aside. Val and Rio dragged a reluctant Beckett away from the chance to kill Enfys, and were met by several stormtroopers as they left the area. Beckett lied, telling the stormtroopers that the explosion was due to a ship using black market fuel, and the stormtroopers let them leave. Beckett traded a credit chip for a Sullustan's cloak, and suggested using their death priest scam again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
