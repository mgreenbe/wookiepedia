Most of the speeders available to buy were older and not well-maintained and the proprietor was known for buying his stock at a price far below the speeders' fair market value. For this reason, most of Tatooine's farmers bought and traded their used landspeeders in Anchorhead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The proprietor of Spaceport Speeders was an Arcona called Unut Poll.
