A few years before the Battle of Yavin, Han Solo visited her to acquire a replacement fulstar plate for the Millennium Falcon. She almost hit Solo with a hydrospanner because he startled her by arriving at her establishment immediately after Jawa shoplifters rummaged through it, before recognizing him as a friend. When she complained to Solo about his failure to stop any of the Jawas, the smuggler sarcastically asked if she expected him to shoot them. Solo then purchased a refurbished fulstar plate from Kromer, insisting on a red square plate for his YT-1300 light freighter, and \"not an old pentagonal unit,\" but Kromer protested that she already knew what he needed. In addition to the fulstar plate, Solo left with a bag of several Wookiee-ookiees from a batch Kromer said she was baking for Chalmun. Back at the Falcon, Solo and Chewbacca discovered a datapad hidden in the bag, containing a holographic message from Kromer warning them that Imperial customs officer Rench placed a transmitter inside the fulstar plate she sold them. Solo decided to place the transmitter, along with a homing beacon Chewbacca found, in an escape pod, which he used to lure Captain Rench's pursuing corvette into a black hole."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ryder Windham created Kromer in tribute to Star Wars fan Kayla Kromer, known in fandom for her selfmade Millennium Falcon bed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
