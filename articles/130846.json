He also charged Dooku with finding a suitable person to become the template for the future clone army. Dooku decided that he could accomplish both of these tasks by putting a bounty on Vosa, and he only invited the very best to take up the challenge. These included two Mandalorian bounty hunters: Jango Fett and Montross."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Opening crawl"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Story"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mission to Outland Station"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Sidious speaks to Darth Tyranus, telling him that the Bando Gora cult have become a \"parasite\" and need to be dealt with.

He declares \"this deranged former Jedi has no place in my plans for the future\" and orders that Tyranus rectify this mistake. He agrees to do so and asks after the clone army.

Above the pit, the Muttani Meeko Ghintee sits surveying the fight alongside a Rodian and a Gran associate. Meeko is rigging the fight by controlling the red borhek with a neural implant. The red borhek defeats the gold champion, giving the Muttani a reason to celebrate. Jango arrives and shoots down Meeko's associates and in fear the Muttani drops down into the arena. Jango follows Meeko down, asking whether he would rather be caught dead or alive. Still controlling the borhek, Meeko launches the creature into Fett's back, causing him to lose his jetpack. Meeko escapes, and Jango is left to fight the borhek, which he disposes of and starts his pursuit of Meeko. The bounty hunter heads into the trading sector of the Outland Station, where he sneaks up behind an unsuspecting Gran, whom he interrogates to find out the location of Meeko's hideout. Jango retrieves his jetpack from a merchant on the way.

A hologram takes the form of Tyranus, who informs Jango that he is among a select few chosen for a special hunt. The prize: 5,000,000 credits, dead or alive. The target: Komari Vosa, leader of the Bando Gora. Rozatta is very concerned upon learning this, telling Jango that all bounty hunters who have set out to defeat the Bando Gora have vanished. But ultimately she is unable to dissuade Jango from taking on the hunt. He asks what she knows about the Bando Gora and she replies that she has only heard rumours. They are very secretive and \"they're everywhere and nowhere at the same time.\" She remarks that she has heard that they are behind the new death-stick craze. Jango remarks that death-sticks are big in the underworld of Coruscant to which Rozatta comments that there is a bounty for a death-stick dealer on Coruscant, giving Jango a good place to start. As he is leaving, Rozatta remarks that he could run into Montross (Jango's enemy and rival bounty hunter) while on the hunt.

Rozatta believes that Jango should get a new ship rather than keep flying that \"relic\" but he refuses, stating that it once belonged to Jaster Mereel, who was like a father to Jango. Rozatta gives him information on the death-stick dealer: Jervis Gloom, wanted alive by the Coruscant Security Force. Both wonder if Gloom may know anything about the Bando Gora. Jango tracks Gloom down in the Industrial District, and learns that he works for Groff Haugg. Jango arrives at Haugg's plant and finds a batch of death-sticks which seem different to the ordinary ones and he sends a sample to Rozatta who uses a chemical analysis droid to determine that it contains an untraceable neurotoxin which Jango later realises can be used for brainwashing. Jango pursues Haugg, but is too late, as Montross has already frozen Haugg to death in carbonite.

Unfamiliar with Vosa, Trell reveals his underworld contact is Sebolto, a powerful Dug death-stick kingpin on Malastare, and pleads to be let go. A police gunship appears and they order Jango to release Trell. He promptly does so, releasing his grip and dropping Trell to his death.

However, Fust is currently serving time in the asteroid prison on Oovo IV. Jango briefly asks about Montross and Rozatta replies that he's in the Gazzari system.

Smootie provides Jango with some useful information about the backstory of Komari Vosa and the Bando Gora before they part ways. Jango arrives at Fust's cell but he is snatched by a female bounty hunter (much to Rozatta's amusement). With a prison riot now in effect, Jango fights his way back to the Jaster's Legacy to find the other bounty hunter and Fust are already there trying to break into the ship. Upon killing the remaining guards, the two bounty hunters swiftly turn their guns on each other but, while they are debating, one of the facility's six prototype Firespray patrol ships flies overhead and destroys the Jaster's Legacy. Jango hopes the bounty hunter has a ship of her own but she stowed aboard a supply ship which was her plan for getting out until Jango arrived. With the prison now in full lock down, Jango tells the bounty hunter to guard Fust while he salvages what he can from the Jaster's Legacy. He sets off to steal one of the Firesprays and Smootie tells him how to disable the prison's shield wall. Jango succeeds, but before leaving, he destroys the five remaining Firesprays to prevent the prison from following him.

Jango instructs her to drop him off in the jungle and then convince Sebolto to let her stay and find a way to allow Jango to sneak into Sebolto's Palace. Jango makes his way to the cliffs directly opposite from Sebolto's compound and he covers Zam with a sniper rifle while she sends a transport over to him. The two arrive back at the entrance to the palace but Jango tells Zam to return to the ship while he tries to find Sebolto's death-stick factory. After he kills Sebolto's guards, Sebolto flees into his factory, but falls into the machinery and dies with Jango quipping \"It'll be a sour batch\". Jango fights his way through the factory and finds the Bando Gora occupying an underground cave. He finds the Bando Gora ship and tries to access its flight log.

He deduces that Vosa uses Hutts to transport the death-sticks; she sends them to Tatooine and then they are sent on to Malastare to hide the trail.

A junk dealer has mentioned a bounty posted by Jabba on the outlaw Longo Two-Guns and his cronies. If Jango catches them, he can be guaranteed an audience with Jabba. Though Gardulla is more of a recluse and will be harder to get to. The bounty hunters decide to split up; Jango sets out to hunt down the gang for Jabba while Zam goes to search for Gardulla's palace (though she is rather miffed that Jango is going to \"have all the fun\"). Before she chimes out, Rozatta asks the name of Jango's new ship. He answers, \"she's called Slave I.\" Jango tracks down and captures Longo in a podracing hangar in Mos Gamos. When delivering the bounty to Jabba, Jango tells the Hutt that he is after the Bando Gora. Jabba angrily replies \"I do not deal with such scum!\" and reveals that Gardulla houses the Bando Gora's information. He also asks the bounty hunter to eliminate the rival Hutt; adding that he can gain access to her palace via the Tusken Canyon though it is heavily populated by the Sand People.

Gardulla captures Jango and throws him into an arena pit without his weapons to face off with her pet krayt dragon. However the guards did not take away his cutting laser, with which he is able to escape the arena. He retrieves his weapons and fights through the palace. Jango confronts Gardulla in her throne room, where he steals the key to her vault. Jango tells Gardulla that Jabba sends his regards, then feeds her to the krayt dragon. Jango then kills the dragon before he makes his way to the vault, where he finds an encrypted computer that he sends to Rozatta.

They presented the game design proposal in March of 2001, and development started soon after. Jon Knoles revealed in an interview that they wanted to develop Jango into the ideal action-based video-game character and that he was to be exciting to watch and fun to play. Secondly they wanted to develop a story that fleshed out Fett's character more fully than in Attack of the Clones, while at the same time remaining true to the spirit of his character as seen in the film. It was imperative to not dull the game with a slow story and leaden script; as such, their goal was to work a fine balance between back story, narrative, and action-packed gameplay. Knoles said Jango Fett was developed to be an extension of the player's will, the ideal vessel through which the player could live out the fantasy of being the galaxy's most dangerous bounty hunter. His movement and animation blending system was designed to automatically react to other world objects and to never be unable to use his weapons or devices in any situation. The jet-pack was originally designed to be used in areas specifically designed for its use. When the team got it working, they changed their minds and implemented a rechargeable timer on it so the player could use it anywhere for a limited time. At the most, the crew was over fifty people that were working on the game, excluding Industrial Light & Magic (ILM)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their concept artists looked to the team's favorite graphic novels for inspiration and the concept artwork by Ralph McQuarrie, Doug Chiang, Joe Johnston, and others who worked on the Star Wars films. They were given access to the Episode II script and concept art early on before the film came out. LucasArts created storyboarded scripts of their cutscenes and gave them to ILM, who developed them into cinematic cutscenes. Knoles envisioned the level layouts and then consulted with lead level designer David Wehr and his level designers. They created a bubble map of the levels which they worked from to determine details in what the player would face and be able to do. The team made a new engine for the game to be able to do what they wanted. The graphic designers worked concurrently with the level designers to create the environments, which the level designers then used to better visualize what they were trying to do. Knoles had previously been involved in the development of the Super Star Wars trilogy for the Super Nintendo and often referred to those games when describing certain aspects of Star Wars: Bounty Hunter to the team."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube versions of the game have different custom in-house graphics engines, each designed specifically to take advantage of the two platforms' unique strengths and work around their unique limitations, but the core game engine is identical. In the PS2 version they took advantage of both vector unit (VU) chips to drive the graphics to maximum performance. The DMA bandwidth was taken advantage of to use a high number of textures. There is full-screen antialiasing and texture mip mapping support. They used the second VU1 chip to handle all the character skinning and VU0 to handle all the skeletal animation transforms. Which enabled dozens of characters to be on-screen without bogging down the frame rate. They had 10 individually optimized rendering loops on VU1 to speed up the rendering process. Their PS2 graphics engine could move 10,000,000 triangles per second, and adding the gameplay, collision, logic, textures, sound would go down accordingly to around 30,000 to 50,000 triangles per frame, all at an average frame rate of 30 frames per second."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Nintendo GameCube version, they took advantage of the system's fast CPU to achieve a higher frame rate, and added more polygons to characters, especially Jango, who has roughly twice the polygon count on GameCube. The GameCube's texture compression allowed them to use high-resolution textures. Texture compression also allowed for improved color variance on textures. Mip mapping support across the board on all textures helped provide a rich and consistent environment. They exploited additional memory to improve load times. They implemented projected shadows on all the characters and an increased draw distance to allow for vista views."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Industrial Light & Magic and Skywalker Sound assisted in the creation of the game, which was the first collaboration between LucasArts and ILM in the field of in-game cinematics.

LucasArts provided ILM with models, textures, and a storyboarded script, and then applied their cinematic expertise in adapting the script into dynamic and visually stunning films. The sound designers of LucasArts and the sound designers at Skywalker Sound worked together to create the game soundtrack.
