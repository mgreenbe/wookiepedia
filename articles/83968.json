They were a self-contained mechanism; the operator set a horizontal and vertical distance for detonation and when fired, the flare was propelled to the detonation point. Luma flares could be used to mark artillery strikes, and to alert rescue ships to the presence of downed starfighter pilots. Salamini Chemical Munitions produced the Model-3287 luma flare during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
