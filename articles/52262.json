His reign as High Lord was quiet, in contrast to his predecessor. He was popular with the public and the influential nobles of his house alike and seemed content with House Reena's position in the Tapani sector. Under Galen's leadership, House Reena controlled the votes in the Great Council that gave the Mecetti-Calipsa-Reena coalition power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lord Panos was a former dean of the Reena University and kept his influence and interest in the affair of the institution.
