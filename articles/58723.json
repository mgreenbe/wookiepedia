The name haarshun was from the Mandalorian language of Mando'a, and while haarshun bread was colloquially translated to Galactic Basic Standard as \"parchment bread,\" a more literal translation would be \"see-bread.\" The etymology of the word was derived from the process of the bread's creation: haarshun bread dough was rolled out extremely thin, to the extent than an individual was able to see through the dough when held up to a light source. The flattened dough was then rolled up, and baked dry. In this form, haarshun bread became commonplace in Mandalorian dry rations; when it came time to eat the hardened bread, it was soaked in water to regain its edible softness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few weeks after the rise of the Galactic Empire, the female Mandalorian Besany Wennen made haarshun bread and other dishes with several members of Clan Skirata, for an informal celebration of the coming of spring in the north of the planet Mandalore. The former Mandalorian Cuy'val Dar sergeant, Rav Bralor, believed that haarshun bread should be rolled thin enough for an individual to see their betrothal ring through the dough."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Haarshun bread first appeared in Star Wars canon in the 2009 novel, Imperial Commando: 501st, the fifth entry in the Republic and Imperial Commando series by author Karen Traviss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
