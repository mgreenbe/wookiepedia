Alpha-bulls kept harems of junior spouses and concubines, and were constantly challenged by younger bulls and cows. Crolutes were naturally aggressive and ruthless, but actual violence was limited as disputes were typically settled with ritualized displays of intimidation and dominance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clan compounds were constructed around lagoons, and the species retained a love of the water.
