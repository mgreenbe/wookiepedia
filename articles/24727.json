LEGO's TIE crawler also was equipped with two dual laser cannons that extended from the outside of the port and starboard tread hulls, giving this variant increased firepower over the standard tank. The century tank was the second only fully-Expanded Universe LEGO set to be released, the first being the TIE/D automated starfighter, although the TIE/D was included in a set with two other in-universe TIE fighters and Darth Vader's TIE/Advanced starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
