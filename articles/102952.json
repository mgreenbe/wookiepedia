Forests and valleys were the terrains due to the volcanic origins of the planet. There was one main continent, but the rest was volcanic elevated islands. It was a wealthy planet, farming, and inter planet shipping industries were the main business on the planet. The planet was on an intersection so their shipping mostly went to the north inner rim and expansion region.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War it was home to an important central bank."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Palanhi joined the Galactic Republic early in its history, sometime between 25,000 BBY and 22,000 BBY, although it was outside of Republic space at the time.
