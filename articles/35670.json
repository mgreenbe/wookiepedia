Day on Dayark occurred when the moon passed out of the shadow of Nepe, and night fell once it fell back into the gas giant's shadow. The moon's orbit was close to the planet, inside the fringes of Nepe's atmosphere. As a result, Dayark's skies were constantly cloudy and a light rain fell almost continuously."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The moon was the bread basket for the Kathol Republic, with extensive wetlands ideal for growing rice and other crops tended by agricultural droids. Dayark was the most populated world in the Republic, and its vote usually ensured the election of its planetary representative to the post of President.
