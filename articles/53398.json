He was a combat trainer hired to keep Jabba's Gamorrean guards in shape. Nas Tal regretted accepting the job, as he disliked Jabba and his hired henchmen. Like many in the palace, he harbored plans in which he hoped to kill Jabba. During the Battle of the Great Pit of Carkoon, Leia Organa Solo unknowingly accomplished Gauron Nas Tal's intended goal by murdering the Hutt on the Khetanna. Nas Tal was one of the victims during the sail barge's destruction by the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ambiguously-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
