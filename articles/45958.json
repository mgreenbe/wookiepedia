Those who had served Kressh during his life remained on Athiss in his tomb and their descendants became known as the Tomb Dwellers. When Galactic Republic survey team six-eight-nine-mark-one landed on Athiss they accidentally discovered the tomb and begun excavating it before they were driven mad and then attacked by the Dwellers. Both the Republic and the Sith Empire then put together strike teams to investigate the area where the survey team had gone missing, and one of the strike teams arrived at the tomb where they fought the survey team's excavation droids and several of the team itself including professor Ley'arsha."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
