It was used in an attempt to recover a cache of loot and weapons stored by Sate Pestage on Tatooine shortly after the Battle of Endor. During this attempt, it saw multiple engagements with Rogue Squadron, until suffering a fatal explosive decompression as a result of several well-placed proton torpedoes from an X-wing of that squadron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Harrow resembles a Victory-class Star Destroyer; the raised sections along the sides are reminiscent of the Victory-class's atmospheric maneuvering fins. However, there are major differences. The Harrow had two main thrusters with two vertically placed secondary thrusters between them. Also, it bears a similar command tower and ventral terrace to the Imperial-class Star Destroyer. In addition, the Harrow lacked a forward docking bay. It is unknown if Harrow is the result of design-differences in separate Rendili shipyards or just heavily modified from a stock Victory-class Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
