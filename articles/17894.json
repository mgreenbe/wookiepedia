After the Bombing of Telos IV, a number of them could be found on Citadel Station, an orbital space station that served as the staging area for the restoration efforts. In that period, flora and fauna native to Dantooine were being studied by the Ithorian Pato Ado, a xenobiologist of Chodo Habat's herd. They apparently had sharp branches because the predator snail ate birds that were impaled on them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The blba trees can grow for hundreds of years, and some revered ones have served as wedding sites for several generations of family lineages. Dantooinians regard them as apt symbols for the planet's residents for being hardy, requiring little to thrive, and being incredibly difficult to move once their roots develop."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars Galaxies: The Ruins of Dantooine, they are misspelled as biba trees."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
