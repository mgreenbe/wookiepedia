As his stormtroopers were slaughtered, he fled back to the H.Q. with a jetpack. There he was met by Darth Vader, who brought him to Adony Station to watch Luke and Leia fall into a trap of Vader's devising. They survived, and Luke threw a proton grenade at the pair, killing Vant. The Dark Lord survived the explosion, though."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
