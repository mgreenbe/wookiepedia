In the year 1006 BBY, the Brotherhood of Darkness under Lord Kaan, Lord Qordis, and Lord Kopecz sought to re-establish the old Sith training academy on Korriban, a world within the ancient Sith Empire. It was felt that doing so would constitute a major symbolic victory against the Old Republic and the Jedi Order. After a significant ground-based battle involving both conventional forces as well as Force-wielders on both sides, the Sith claimed the ultimate victory. The battle took the life of every single Jedi Knight, Padawan, and Jedi Master who fought there. The re-establishment of the Korriban Sith Academy would eventually provide the Sith with a veritable wellspring of darksider talent\u2014indeed, the most powerful trainees in the entire Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
