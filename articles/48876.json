It started life as a standard X-34 landspeeder with three engines, however Fixer mounted two additional salvaged X-34 engines to either side of the 'speeder's rear deck. This had the effect of increasing the vehicle's top speed, at a cost of fuel consumption. It could often be seen parked outside Tosche Station in Anchorhead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
