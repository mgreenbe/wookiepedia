Due to a plague causing the loss of the Rakatan species' innate connection to the Force during the Infinite Empire's collapse, those tribes were no longer able to use the advanced Force-powered Rakatan technology left behind. Although the tribes of the Rakatan Archipelago eventually regressed into primitivism, over time the Tulpaa tribe emerged as one of the most advanced surviving Rakatan societies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tulpaa tribe started the construction of the miniaturized Star Forge, in the process competing with the Rakatan tribe of the planet Makatak, which was also building a similar station. At some point, Ruthic, one of the tribe's Elder priests, began gradually developing a sensitivity to the Force, in which she was unique among the Rakata. Ruthic became the head of the Tulpaa tribe after exiling the former leaders into a Rakatan mind prison device."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From the same device, Ruthic released the Sith magician Raspir, who, as a practitioner of the dark side of the Force, provided wise advice to Ruthic on how to bend the manufacturing facilities of the Star Forge to her will.
