Some of the moufs came after Finn and he dropped his salt when he ran away. In the following days, he became increasingly agitated due to the lust for salt. Johnson Smith noticed his behaviour and asked an adventurer to find out what bothered Finn, as Finn wouldn't have told him or Jerrol Chupapa - the Arcona running the camp. Finn told the adventurer about his lost stash and the adventurer agreed to search for it in the jungles. The adventurer eventually found it and brought it to Smith who promised to help Finn with his addiction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ryoo Finn was a Non-Player Character (NPC) in Rage of the Wookiees, the second expansion for Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
