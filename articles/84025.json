Born Lumpawarrump in 1 BBY and known as Lumpy throughout his youth, he was raised by his mother Mallatobuck and his grandfather Attichitcuk while Chewbacca served a life debt to and traveled the galaxy with the Human smuggler Han Solo. Lumpawarrump idolized his father and constantly dreamed of the elder Wookiee's adventures while Chewbacca was away. While gathering wasaka berries in Kashyyyk's dangerous Shadowlands in preparation for Chewbacca's 200th birthday, a young Lumpawarrump hoped to be as brave as his father but ended up hiding, terrified, from the various creatures that lurked in the forest. Although his father rescued him and brought him home, the ordeal caused Lumpawarrump considerable trauma. Coupled with the absence of a father figure to help him grow into a brave young man, the experience turned Lumpawarrump into a shy and timid Wookiee who rarely left his home. Unless Chewbacca was around for Lumpawarrump to attempt to impress, he stayed away from danger and did not find his rrakktorr, the eager and defiant strength of a male Wookiee's heart."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 ABY, two years after Lumpawarrump's misadventure in the Shadowlands, he and his family were visited by members of the Galactic Empire on the Wookiee holiday Life Day. The Imperials were searching Kashyyyk for ties between its inhabitants and the Rebel Alliance and remained in Lumpawarrump's home for some time before Chewbacca and Solo arrived to celebrate the holiday. Chewbacca and Solo helped free Lumpawarrump and many other Wookiees from slavery at the hands of the Nagai Knife three years later, and in 8 ABY, Lumpawarrump and Mallatobuck visited Chewbacca at his apartment on the galactic capital of Coruscant. The three became tangled in an Imperial scheme to destroy the New Republic that Chewbacca and Solo served, and Lumpawarrump was kidnapped by several Coruscanti underdwellers and taken to a secret Imperial detention center in the planet's underlevels. After his parents rescued him, the three Wookiees were able to prevent the underdwellers from unleashing a nerve toxin at an upcoming New Republic governmental banquet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 16 ABY, Lumpawarrump's coming-of-age hrrtayyk ceremony was interrupted when Chewbacca, who was guiding his son through it, learned that Solo had been kidnapped by the Yevethan Duskhan League. Lumpawarrump tagged along on the rescue mission so that he might prove himself, and father and son stormed the Yevethan Star Destroyer Pride of Yevetha and rescued the captive Solo. Lumpawarrump found his rrakktorr, passed his hrrtayyk, and earned his new name, Lumpawaroo, after receiving a blaster wound in the leg and meeting it without flinching. Chewbacca was able to spend more time with Lumpawaroo over the next several years, but when the elder Wookiee was killed in 25 ABY, Lumpawaroo and his cousin Lowbacca pledged to take over Chewbacca's life debt to Solo. Solo delayed them for four years in order to grieve the loss of his best friend, but in 29 ABY, they reaffirmed their convictions and attached themselves to Solo, although they ultimately served him for less than six years. In 40 ABY, Solo and his wife Leia Organa Solo came to Kashyyyk to speak with the planet's Rock Council, and Lumpawaroo guided them across Wroshyr trees for four days as they made their way to Council Rock. Lumpawaroo later crewed the Solos' starship Millennium Falcon and worked to extinguish forest fires that raged across Kashyyyk after an orbital bombardment by the Galactic Alliance Fifth Fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mischievous youth"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wookiee male Lumpawarrump was born in 1 BBY in the Kashyyyk city of Rwookrrorro to Mallatobuck, a teacher and caregiver who worked in a nearby village's nursery ring.

Chewbacca had then left the planet with Solo, to whom he had sworn a Wookiee life debt of protection, and Lumpawarrump was born nearly one year later. Chewbacca and Solo returned to Kashyyyk shortly thereafter while on a supply run to the Corporate Sector, and both were overjoyed to discover Mallatobuck holding the newborn Lumpawarrump in her Rwookrrorro home. Chewbacca roared with pride as he realized that he had become a father, and the new parents immediately began to discuss baby names.

While Chewbacca and Solo roamed the galaxy, Lumpawarrump was raised on Kashyyyk by his mother and grandfather. Attichitcuk lived with Lumpawarrump and Mallatobuck in their treetop dwelling and was content to live out his elder years playing with his young grandson."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 0 BBY, Chewbacca was on his way home to celebrate his 200th birthday with his family, and Mallatobuck began to plan a surprise party for her husband. Lumpawarrump was dismayed when she forbade him to venture into the dangerous Shadowlands of Kashyyyk's forest floor to gather wasaka berries, an essential ingredient of Chewbacca's favorite dessert, but he was cheered up when Attichitcuk told him a story of Chewbacca and Solo battling Trandoshan slavers. Inspired, Lumpawarrump sneaked out of his house to hunt for wasaka berries in the hope of becoming as heroic as his father. The young Wookiee was unable to find any berries near his house, and he began to cautiously descend a rope ladder into the jungle's lower levels. He soon lost his footing and tumbled down a Wroshyr tree into the Shadowlands, landing in a swamp and attracting the attention of several creatures. Lumpawarrump was very frightened, but he ignored the creatures and continued to search for berries among the swamp's tree roots, confident that his father would not have give up if faced with a similar predicament."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When a furry ball-shaped creature lunged at him, Lumpawarrump abandoned his quest and dove into a hollow log.

Lumpawarrump climbed into his father's craft but quickly began to cry, disheartened that he had failed to find any wasaka berries. As they sped toward their home, Chewbacca told his son that his persistence in the face of fear was a telltale sign of a hero, and Lumpawarrump immediately brightened. He avoided a scolding from his mother when they were greeted at their home by hundreds of Wookiees who had gathered for Chewbacca's surprise party. Along with Han Solo, the gathered Wookiees celebrated well into the night, dancing, playing games, eating Mallatobuck's souffl\u00e9s, and watching fireworks."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A Life Day to remember"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the following years, Chewbacca and Solo became key members of the Rebel Alliance during its struggle against the Galactic Empire.

In 1 ABY, Lumpawarrump was at home with his mother and grandfather on the Wookiee holiday Life Day as they prepared to receive Chewbacca and Solo for a celebration. Lumpawarrump happily ran through the house and played with a wooden model of an X-wing starfighter, but he was reprimanded by Mallatobuck for bothering his grandfather and for trying to sneak one of the Wookiee-ookiees that she had baked. Mallatobuck assigned him the task of taking out the garbage; once outside, Lumpawarrump playfully walked along the top of the railing that surrounded his home's balcony before going back inside."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After he completed his task, Lumpawarrump was treated to a tabletop performance by some holographic tumblers, which Attichitcuk turned on for the delighted young Wookiee. After the performance, his elation was interrupted by his mother's insistence that he clean dishes in the kitchen sink. When he finished with the dishes, an Imperial officer appeared on the home's viewscreen and announced that the Empire had declared martial law on the planet due to suspected Rebel activity. Lumpawarrump grew worried and hid when he heard a knock on the front door, but the visitor was merely Saun Dann, a Human trader and a friend of the family. He brought Life Day gifts for all three Wookiees, including a mini-transmitter for Lumpawarrump. The young Wookiee rushed upstairs to his room to open the gift, but he raced down to the foyer even faster when he heard the sound of Solo's starship, the Millennium Falcon, flying overhead. When he and Mallatobuck opened the front door, they were shocked to find two Imperial stormtroopers pointing blaster rifles at them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seeking evidence of ties to the Rebellion, the stormtroopers entered the house along with a technician and an Imperial commander. As the troopers searched the home, the technician asked Lumpawarrump about his father's whereabouts, only to have his fingers bitten in response. Mallatobuck and Dann prevented him from striking Lumpawarrump, and Dann was soon told to leave by the Imperials. Lumpawarrump protested when the Commander ordered his room to be searched, and when Attichitcuk attempted to block the trooper's path, the elderly Wookiee was thrown aside. The Commander then intervened and calmed a furious Mallatobuck down. The search proceeded, and Mallatobuck consoled her son by letting him watch a cartoon that featured Chewbacca, his Rebel companions, and the bounty hunter Boba Fett. When the cartoon caused him to scream, Lumpawarrump quickly changed the screen of his video book to display a simple game in order to fool the curious Commander. Although he enjoyed the cartoon, his dismay returned afterward when he discovered that the Imperials had beheaded his stuffed bantha. Alone in his room, Lumpawarrump cheered himself up by turning on his mini-transmitter and watching an instruction cassette that taught him how to assemble it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Lumpawarrump followed the instructions given by the Amorphiian Dromboid, he transmitted a \"return to base\" signal to the Imperial officer's comlink. The gambit worked, and the Commander departed the home with the technician and one trooper, but, suspecting that Chewbacca was a Rebel, left the stormtrooper B4711 behind to apprehend the Wookiee upon his return. When the \"return to base\" signal continued to chime, B4711 entered his room, discovered the tricky, and broke the device. Frightened, Lumpawarrump rushed outside and into the arms of Chewbacca, who had just arrived home. B4711 pointed his blaster rifle at the Wookiees, but Han Solo snuck up behind him and batted the rifle away. B4711 then tripped over a log and fell to the forest floor below.

Dann then departed, and Lumpawarrump and his family donned red robes, gathered Life Day orbs, and made their way to the celebratory Tree of Life to enjoy Life Day among a large gathering of Wookiees. Solo and his companions Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, and the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 joined them, and Organa sang a song. Afterward, Lumpawarrump and his family returned home for a Life Day feast.

However, the Empire's Wookiee slave trade was taken over early in 4 ABY by the Nagai Ozrei N'takkilomandrife, known to the Wookiees as \"Knife,\" who teamed up with Mallatobuck's traitorous brother Vargi and began to round up Wookiees as slaves. The Nagai were from the satellite galaxy Firefist and had dispatched Knife to create a slave trade that would distract the Alliance while the Nagai invaded the galaxy.

The two Humans escaped, however, and Calrissian managed to free Lumpawarrump, his mother, and his grandfather. The four of them made their way to the starship that Chewbacca and several other Wookiee captives were boarding and found Chewbacca and Solo in a brawl with Vargi. Calrissian fired his blaster at a combat knife that Knife was preparing to throw at Chewbacca, who then overpowered a distracted Vargi as his fellow captives rose up against Knife's Wookiee allies. Knife fled the planet in the Cobra, Calrissian's starship, but his attempts to subjugate the Wookiees had failed.

He often played as Chewbacca in the hologame \"Galactic Rebels\" and constantly boasted to his peers that he was as strong as his father. His friends grew bored of his attitude, and his enemies challenged him to back up his words. Lumpawarrump often came home bloodied after the resulting fights and grew more insular as a result. Coupled with lingering trauma from his childhood trip to the Shadowlands, these experiences caused the young Wookiee to rarely leave home, content to remain close to his house and to the Rwookrrorro nursery ring where young Wookiees were raised. Mallatobuck and Attichitcuk did not encourage Lumpawarrump to take part in the unstructured rough-and-tumble play that occurred in the nursery ring, and as such, he did not develop the fearlessly headlong fighting style that was characteristic of Wookiee males.

Lumpawarrump gathered several souvenirs during his time on the ecumenopolis, and, during the family's final hours together, Mallatobuck informed Chewbacca of their son's troubles with other young Wookiees. The two resolved that Lumpawarrump would spend one or two years with Chewbacca in order to overcome his timidity and learn that his father's life was not one constant holoadventure. As they privately came to their decision, Lumpawarrump left his father's quarters after hearing noises in the adjacent apartment of Solo and Leia Organa Solo, the former smuggler's new wife. Lumpawarrump discovered the Coruscanti underdweller Rath within, who overpowered him and drew a hold-out blaster on the young Wookiee. Rath then forced Lumpawarrump to rifle through Organa Solo's belongings in search of a datapad. When Chewbacca and Mallatobuck entered the apartment in search of their son, they located and threatened Rath, who did not understand their native Shyriiwook tongue. Lumpawarrump, eager for an opportunity to impress his father, charged at Rath, but his foe easily pulled him into a chokehold and retrieved the datapad from a garment bag on the floor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rath prepared to pull Lumpawarrump into the hole in the wall through which he had entered, and claimed that he would return the young Wookiee in three minutes if Chewbacca and Mallatobuck walked away.

Rath lost both Lumpawarrump and his blaster in the ensuing chaos, but he escaped through the hole into a service run with the datapad. Chewbacca ascertained that Rath had been a spy in search of valuable information contained on the datapad, and he prepared to call New Republic Security as he praised his son for slowing the spy down. Lumpawarrump, enthused by the compliment and convinced that he was in the middle of a \"Galactic Rebels\"\u2013like scenario, leaped into the hole in the wall. He disobeyed his parents' commands to stop and instructed them to meet him at the bottom of the service run as he climbed down after Rath.

He left distinctive footprints in the blood puddles so that they could track him, however. When Rath and his companions entered a clean-out door on an overpressure pipe, Lumpawarrump grabbed the left feet of the last two to enter and held on, hoping to take them prisoner. Chewbacca and Mallatobuck caught up to him at that point, but desperate blaster shots fired from Rath and his companions startled Lumpawarrump, caused him to let go of the feet and to stumble away from the pipes. After Chewbacca ensured that their enemies were gone, he and Mallatobuck scolded Lumpawarrump for rushing ahead without them. Lumpawarrump told his parents what he had overheard, and as they began to plan their next move, a member of Rath's group reached out from the clean-out door, grabbed Lumpawarrump, and drew him inside the pipe and away from his parents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lumpawarrump was brought into an airspeeder where Rath's boss, an Imperial IT-3 Interrogator droid nicknamed \"It,\" was waiting. The droid predicted that Chewbacca and Mallatobuck would follow them to the Imperial detention center for which they were headed, and it instructed its underlings to hold the young Wookiee in the center's hangar until his parents arrived. They then discussed a nerve toxin called zemex. After arriving at the hangar, several of the underdwellers attempted to hold the young Wookiee still. Lumpawarrump put up a fight, however, breaking noses and dislocating jaws of his captors. His parents were close behind him, and Mallatobuck chased the underdwellers off. With the knowledge that a trap had been set for them, Lumpawarrump tried to drag his parents deeper into the complex, but they interrupted his attempts to warn them and refused to budge until laser turrets appeared and fired at them. Lumpawarrump and Mallatobuck raced through a security door and into a group of underdwellers; Lumpawarrump grabbed the arms of two of them and pointed them to the floor in an effort to prevent them from accurately firing their blasters.

When he climbed a ladder into a command deck overlooking the hangar, he discovered ISBy, an ISB-120 slicer droid, working on a datapad. Lumpawarrump wanted to rush up behind Chewbacca and subdue it, but a firm reprimand from his father dampened his resolve. Lumpawarrump and Mallatobuck waited as Chewbacca entered the command deck, but they eventually followed him up when they heard the sound of blasterfire. They found the droid and the datapad destroyed, Rath unconscious, and a female underdweller pointing a blaster at Chewbacca. As they silently approached, the underdweller was contacted by \"It,\" and the ensuing conversation revealed that the destroyed datapad was a decoy. Mallatobuck snuck up behind the underdweller and thieved her weapon, and Lumpawarrump used Rath's blaster to fire three shots at a desk to convince \"It\" that the underdweller had shot the three Wookiees. \"It\" ended the conversation, and Chewbacca knocked the underdweller unconscious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chewbacca and Mallatobuck were ready to escape, but when Lumpawarrump mentioned that he had overheard the underdwellers talking about zemex, Chewbacca realized that they were planning to release it at an upcoming governmental banquet, about which Organa Solo's datapad had given them information. The Wookiees spotted the underdwellers loading the toxin into an airspeeder in the hangar, and Lumpawarrump offered to enter the hangar and act as bait while his parents attacked. With no better idea of his own, Chewbacca reluctantly approved, and Lumpawarrump climbed out of a hole that had earlier been blasted in the command deck and down into the hangar. After he was spotted, his parents rushed into the hangar from the corridor and downed several distracted underdwellers with their blasters.

For the following seven years, Chewbacca spent much of his time helping raise and look after the Solo children, and he found less and less time to return home and visit his own family. His absence had a large impact on Lumpawarrump, who grew even more insular and timid. Lumpawarrump still idolized his father, but without Chewbacca there for him to emulate and impress, he had few reasons to seek out trouble or to rush headlong into danger. In 16 ABY, he grew to adult Wookiee height and was deemed ready to undergo his coming-of-age hrrtayyk ceremony. Completion of the hrrtayyk would grant him a new name as well as the right to wear a baldric. With the Solos' blessings, Chewbacca took a leave of absence from his service to their family in order to return to Kashyyyk and guide his son through the hrrtayyk process. The elder Wookiee took the Millennium Falcon; the Solos hoped that the legendary starship would act as a symbol of the important work he did and would help ease the pain Lumpawarrump felt at his absence.

The next challenge, trapping and killing a scuttle grazer, took longer than the construction of the bowcaster and caused Lumpawarrump considerable hardship. His final task was to hunt a predatory katarn in the Well of the Dead, a location deep within the Shadowlands. Chewbacca guided him there across the Rryatt Trail from Rwookrrorro into the forest depths and shared stories of his own days hunting the well's dangerous inhabitants. While they walked, Chewbacca asked questions to test Lumpawarrump's knowledge of the reasons why Wookiees hunted katarns, and he cautioned his son patience during the forthcoming challenge.

The relative told Chewbacca that Han Solo had been taken prisoner in the Koornacht Cluster by the Duskhan League, the Yevethan government that had recently come into conflict with the New Republic. Chewbacca knew that his duty to Solo superseded his responsibility to his son and immediately decided to mount a rescue attempt. Lumpawarrump was startled when his father called out to him and told him to stop the hunt.

Lumpawarrump returned to the ship with both the food and his bowcaster, insistent that he be allowed to accompany his father on the mission. Mallatobuck protested, but Chewbacca simply asked his son's reasons why. Lumpawarrump not only wanted an opportunity to earn his baldric and new name, but also to do it at Chewbacca's side and to prove his worth to his father. Chewbacca accepted his son's reasons and allowed Lumpawarrump to join him, Shoran, and Chewbacca's cousins Jowdrrl and Dryanta on the rescue mission. Their first stop aboard the Millennium Falcon was Esau's Ridge, a private smuggler's sanctuary on the planet Tholatin open only to elite veterans of the trade.

Chewbacca dragged him to safety and advised his son that Esau's Ridge was not a place where curiosity was rewarded. Two days later, Formayj provided Chewbacca with a navigational map of the Koornacht Cluster, a recording of an address made to the New Republic Senate by the Yevethan Viceroy Nil Spaar, and other documents that provided intelligence on the Yevetha. The information had been channeled to Formayj by the clandestine New Republic Intelligence agency Alpha Blue, which also hoped to see Solo rescued. Chewbacca returned to the Millennium Falcon and played for the others a forty-hour-old recording of Spaar addressing members of the New Republic on the HoloNet's Channel 81.

After being relieved from the turret by Dryanta, Lumpawarrump joined his father and Shoran in the cockpit, and the three of them viewed and studied new information sent to them from Formayj: a New Republic Fleet Intelligence assault plan for an Executor-class Star Dreadnought, complete with marked locations of cell blocks and points on the hull that could effectively be breached.

As Chewbacca and Shoran stormed the Star Destroyer and Jowdrrl guarded the hatch, Lumpawarrump and Dryanta waited in the turrets. They sat bewildered as dozens of Yevethan starfighters flew over their location but did not locate them, and as Jowdrrl reported a group of Yevethan guards who walked past her location without noticing her. The Wookiees were unaware that their presence was being disguised in the Force by Enara, a Fallanassi adept of the White Current who was being held prisoner along with Solo.

In the 1998 novel Vision of the Future, Han Solo makes a reference to \"Chewbacca's cubs.\" Although The Essential Guide to Alien Species states that Wookiees traditionally bear two to three children, no other canonical source has ever indicated that Lumpawaroo has any siblings. However, a non-canon picture drawn by Maya Gohill in the 2010 art book Star Wars: Visions depicts Chewbacca and a wife living in a home with three children."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
