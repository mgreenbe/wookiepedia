He resided in a house there, which was guarded by a model Dz5 security door equipped with artificial intelligence. The building also housed a red-plated protocol droid, as well as several thugs armed with blaster pistols. In addition, Neg owned a furry, violent beast, which he kept in a cage in the backyard of his house. Circa 32 BBY, Neg captured a young Ithorian boy named Tomo, whom he forced to become his servant while making false promises that he would one day free the boy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A visit by a Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many months later, during the Invasion of Naboo, Neg went to the Dune Sea for approximately a week to hunt banthas and had Tomo placed inside a cage next to his beast. Meanwhile, Tomo's Force-sensitive mother, who was desperate to save her son, placed herself near Neg's house in the hopes of finding an individual who could help her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Help arrived in the form of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, who was looking for a T-14 hyperdrive generator on the planet. When the Jedi walked past the Ithorian mother, she sensed that the Force was strong with him and begged for his assistance. Agreeing to speak with Neg, Jinn went to request an audience with Neg, but he was refused entry by the captain's security door system. After finding another way into the house, Jinn encountered several of Neg's thugs, but he quickly dispatched his opponents. Jinn also fought and killed Neg's beast after it broke free from its cage and attacked him. The Jedi Master then freed Tomo from his cage and, after discovering that Neg would not be back for a week, left the house with the boy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Captain Neg was not above capturing a young boy to work for him. He often promised that Tomo would one day be free, but Tomo's mother had reason to believe that Neg was lying and that the captain would keep Tomo in captivity indefinitely.

In the video game's sixth level, after Jinn\u2014who is controlled by the player\u2014rescues Tomo, the Ithorian's mother will reward the Jedi with a repulse booster, which is needed to complete the level by trading it for another item. However, a simpler way to obtain the booster is for Jinn to murder Tomo's mother and forcibly take it, leaving Tomo behind. Due to this alternative path, whether or not Jinn's rescue of Tomo canonically took place is ambiguous. This article assumes 100% game completion with no \"dark side\" options, however, describing the events as if Jinn chose to free Tomo instead of killing the Ithorian mother."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
