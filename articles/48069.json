The fiend set fire to the building and slew most of the academy's students and Masters. It then attacked the Master in Violet, who used a shard of songsteel to keep the being at bay. The Master in Violet's student Barnab Chistor arrived at the Academy and shot the fiend with an experimental handgun, repelling the being and forcing it to flee. However, the fiend then used its powers to re-animate the corpses of a number of the slain students, and it set them upon Chistor and his master."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
