The vessel's ultimate goal was to return to Brath Qella, use its energy beams to thaw the planet, and restart its evolutionary process. It acquired its name after a sighting in the Teljkon system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship was equipped with a weapon called the EM Whip. It shot two large spikes on chains into an enemy vessel and then ran very high-voltage electric current through the now-closed circuit. This knocked out all electronics and killed or knocked out all enemy crew members. It was only effective at short range because of the physical space requirement of the cables."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The vessel's other weapon was termed the Scythe Weapon. The scythe consisted of three beams emitted from different locations on the Vagabond's hull (after being sent through a complex internal superconducting network) which then scythed together (hence the name) to destroy any point that the three intersected on. It had an enormous effective range of at least 3,500 kilometers, but was inefficient in terms of fleet combat, as it could only focus on three or four targets at a time and only one such system could be equipped to any starship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vagabond had what seemed to be organic walls and bulkheads, and the ship's walls would fix themselves after being damaged."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lando Calrissian, Lobot, R2-D2 and C-3PO managed to board the Vagabond in 17 ABY as part of New Republic effort to capture it. They eventually worked out its true purpose. Lando and Lobot discovered the vessel's organic nature when trying to escape from the ships airlock after the ship jumped to hyperspace after damaging the interdiction picket Kauri with its \"scythe\" attack. The Vagabond ended up in the Deep Core world of Prakith located in Sector 5. The Vagabond was attacked by the Imperial patrol frigate Bloodprice, the Vagabond then attacked back with its \"mace\" attack. Bloodprice was destroyed including all hands aboard. The Imperial light cruiser Gorath witnessed the attack and notified the Imperial Adz-class patrol destroyer Tobay to prepare for a micro-jump to help Gorath intercept the Teljkon Vagabond. Gorath was destroyed by the Vagabond but Tobay survived ironically since it was older than Gorath and had many problems with its sensor and navigational equipment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
