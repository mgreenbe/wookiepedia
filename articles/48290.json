Born by 82 BBY on the planet Coruscant, Valorum hailed from a highly regarded political family, and after working through several challenging occupations he was elected as senator of the Lytton sector through his family's connections. Valorum advocated against the development of a centralized Republic army, and came into prominence during the Stark Hyperspace War in 44 BBY. The conflict was a result of attacks on bacta transports by the Stark Commercial Combine. It was Valorum who advocated holding a summit with the Combine on the planet Troiken, he also attended the summit along with several Jedi and Nute Gunray of the Trade Federation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The summit turned into an ambush when Iaco Stark, founder of the combine, revealed that he knew a fleet covertly assembled by Senator Ranulph Tarkin, Valorum's political enemy, was flying to Troiken to destroy the Combine. Stark sabotaged Tarkin's ships with a nanovirus that scrambled their navcomputers, and a firefight broke out in the meeting room. Valorum and the Jedi were able to escape and rendezvous with Tarkin's forces that made it planetside. After surviving attacks from Stark forces, Valorum and Gunray were escorted back to Coruscant by the Jedi Adi Gallia, where Valorum explained the situation to the Galactic Senate and prevented them from giving in to Stark's demands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With his profile raised during the war, Valorum made a succesful bid for Supreme Chancellor in 40 BBY. He won another term four years later, but was considered an ineffectual leader for his insistence on orthodox diplomatic approaches to issues. On the advice of Palpatine, a senator from the planet Naboo and a close confidant of Valorum's, the Chancellor proposed Senate Resolution BR-0371, instituting taxation Free Trade Zones. The resolution severely impacted the Trade Federation's profits, causing the company to blockade Naboo. Valorum sent two Jedi; Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, on a secret mission to diplomatically solve the crisis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their attempt failed, but the Jedi managed to rescue Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo and brought her to Coruscant to present a plea for action to the Senate. Knowing that Valorum would be unable to effect any real progress, Palpatine convinced Amidala to call for a Vote of No Confidence against Valorum, removing him from office. Palpatine was elected Chancellor, as he had orchestrated the entire crisis in a secret plan to restore Sith dominion over the galaxy. In retirement he wrote a biography; Holding Back the Tide, and was visited by Jedi Master Yoda for information about the fate of Jedi Knight Sifo-Dyas during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finis Valorum was a Human male born on the planet Coruscant by at least 82 BBY. He was the last in the line of House Valorum, a renowned political dynasty that included Tarsus Valorum, who had served as Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic during the Ruusan Reformation of 1000 BBY. Finis Valorum's own father was a politician, who at some point failed to take action against the terrorist Nebula Front, an act which would have consequences for Valorum's own career. Valorum was expected to follow in his father's career, and as a young man he received dozens of job offers from wealthy friends of his family. He instead chose challenging assignments that would test his character."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One such assignment involved service as a judge in frontier conditions on the recently-discovered Republic protectorate of Veccacopia in the Outer Rim Territories. Unlike his predecessors in the post, Valorum worked hard to affect change; upon learning that the native Cacops were hiring stand-ins to serve their sentences, as his bailiffs were unable to distinguish between individuals of the species, he instituted mandatory retinal scanning. His actions broke a corruption ring within Veccacopia's judicial office."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After leaving Veccacopia, Valorum served with Republic police forces as a troop transport driver in the outlying regions. He later attained a post in the military advisory office of Supreme Chancellor Kalpana. Valorum held elected office for the first time when he was in his late thirties, moving his residence from his homeworld to the planet Spira. He was elected senator of the Lytton sector based on his family's reputation and political contacts, to the surprise of no one. His background generated some resentment that followed him in his career, though he rose through the unseen pecking order of the Galactic Senate quickly, making short-term allies and lasting enemies. Valorum quickly gained a reputation for being able to see and describe the bigger picture in issues, focusing on addressing the underlying causes rather than their symptoms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 52 BBY, Valorum placed upon himself the responsibility to argue against the creation of a Republic Military, speaking against its proponents; which he dubbed the Militarists, including Senator Ranulph Tarkin of the Seswenna sector. Valorum was suspicious of Tarkin's motives, and Tarkin embraced the pejorative name in an effort to outflank Valorum."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Stark Hyperspace War"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Advocate for peace"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 44 BBY, a bacta shortage on the planet Thyferra led to attacks by the pirate Stark Commercial Combine on many transports carrying the substance. Senators Nute Gunray of the Trade Federation and Tarkin argued for an increase in military power in the Senate. Valorum argued against militarization, believing it to be a violation of Republic principles and calling for a diplomatic solution that addressed the shortage's underlying causes. To do so, Valorum arranged a summit on the Outer Rim planet Troiken between the Stark Combine, the Trade Federation, and Republic representatives, with Jedi Master Tyvokka serving as chief negotiator. Shortly before the summit, Valorum met with a delegation from the Jedi High Council, including Tyvokka, Yoda, Mace Windu, Adi Gallia, and Tyvokka's former Padawan Plo Koon, who was not a Council member at the time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the meeting, Tyvokka asserted his suspicions that the bacta shortage was legitimate, due to the profits its scarcity had brought to the Trade Federation and the Thyferrans. Valorum asked if the Jedi had any proof, which was unavailable, but Tyvokka suggested that the Jedi Tholme and his Padawan Quinlan Vos investigate. Tyvokka asked to take Koon, Qui-Gon Jinn, and Obi-Wan Kenobi to Troiken, and Valorum requested Gallia's presence as an advisor. The Republic delegates along with Gunray arrived first, but after Iaco Stark and the other leadership of the Combine arrived the meeting took a sour turn. Stark revealed that he knew a Republic Navy covertly assembled by Tarkin was flying to Troiken to trap him, which Valorum assured had been done without the knowledge of anyone present. Stark had prepared a computer virus, which sabotaged the navcomputers of the Navy's vessels. The virus led to the destruction of many ships in faulty hyperspace jumps, while Tarkin's personal flagship, the Invincible, and only a third of his forces arrived at Troiken, immediately attacked by Stark's ships, beginning the Stark Hyperspace War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With his hand revealed, Stark ordered the Republic delegates to surrender, but Tyvokka threw the conference room's table in the air, leading to a firefight. The Wookiee Jedi ordered Gallia to protect Valorum, which she had already anticipated. Most of Stark's personnel in the conference room, aside from the Combine leadership, was killed and Tyvokka was injured by friendly fire from Gunray's HKB-3 hunter-killer droid. The Republic delegates knew they had to leave to get to safety, with Valorum and Koon supporting Tyvokka as they left the conference room. After reaching their Consular-class cruiser, Valorum contacted Tarkin via hologram, chastising him for the turn of events and providing coordinates on Troiken where his troops could land. Valorum's plan was for the soldiers to land near Mount Avos and retreat into its caves. Tarkin was outraged and insisted that command belonged to him, but as the Invincible took more damage and began to fall onto Troiken's surface, Valorum responded that the choice had been made for him."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Bold action"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Tarkin escaped his doomed ship, Valorum explained to the Jedi that he could not ensure Tarkin's compliance. Gunray insisted that the group head to his own shuttle, but Stark forces immediately destroyed it. Jinn knew it meant the Combine knew their location and instructed the ship's captain to take them to the rendezvous point, in spite of the ship's damaged condition. Tyvokka's state deteriorated in the jounrey, in his dying moments he instructed Koon to prioritized Valorum's safety. After learning near Mount Avos the Republic delegates had to quickly leave the ship, knowing it was about to explode. Tarkin met with the group and blamed Valorum for their circumstances and planned to say as much to the Senate, which Valorum retorted that he would have difficulty explaining his unauthorized army to the Senate. Koon insisted that they continue the discussion from the safety of the mountain. Gunray and Tarkin suggested suing for peace with Stark, an action Valorum decried as nonsense as they still had troops available and the mountain could protect them from bombardment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tarkin's army and the Jedi held off Stark's forces in the Second Battle of Qotile, after which Koon insisted that the group prioritize returning Valorum to Coruscant to explain their situation. Tarkin's aide Jace Dallin launched a diversionary attack while Valorum, Gunray, Gallia, Jinn, Kenobi, and the pilot used a transport to reach a spaceport. They planned to steal Stark's personal ship, the Quicksilver. A sudden explosion caused by Tholme and Vos, who had arrived on Troiken, provided a necessary diversion that allowed Gallia to get Gunray, Valorum, and the pilot onboard the Quicksilver and departed. As the ship came out of hyperspace near Coruscant a booby trap on the controls activated, killing the pilot. Gallia ordered Gunray and Valorum into escape pods, which were collected by Coruscant Security Forces. Valorum convinced the ground personnel of his identity and demanded a hearing in the Senate. He persuaded the Senate to refrain from surrendering to Stark, convincing the senators that they only needed to replace the infected navcomputers. The Republic decided to prioritize trade vessels, but would not act to save the troops left on Troiken due to their unauthorized presence. Valorum afterwards met with Windu and Gallia and apologized that he could not do more."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Windu was able to acquire the Trade Defense Force to save the soldiers on Troiken and end the war. Tarkin insisted on detonating an explosive to trap Stark forces inside the mountain in the last battle, in an attempt to preserve his own legacy and be remembered as hero. Valorum's actions during the war made him a rising star in the Senate and contributed to his running as Supreme Chancellor."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Supreme Chancellor"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "First Year"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Valorum won election to his first term as Supreme Chancellor of the Republic in 40 BBY, with the support of the Tarkin family. Their aid hinged on the condition that Valorum posthumously decorate Ranulph Tarkin for his role in the resolution of the Stark Hyperspace War. As Chancellor, Valorum declared Ranulph Tarkin the \"Hero of Troiken,\" resulting in an increase in support for Militarism. Valorum's election was perceived as hollow and cynical by many; his enemies believed he would be easy to control, his allies supported him only because they felt that he was the best prospect in an unremarkable group of candidates, and the public knew nothing about him other than his famous surname. He was also perceived as lacking charisma."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That year, Chancellor Valorum called a special hearing of the entire Senate on the corruption of the Cobral family on the planet Frego, including its links to Senator Crote. Testimony was given by family defector Lena Cobral, and when she arrived at the Convocation Chamber, Valorum gave her a signal to speak. Following Lena's testimony the Senate quickly voted to remove Crote from office and the Cobral family was ordered to be placed under arrest. As Chancellor, Valorum was a fan of the Jedi Order. Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi completed multiple missions on the Chancellor's behalf, which often paired them with Adi Gallia and her Padawan Siri Tachi."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Vena negotiations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One night in 37 BBY, Valorum and his Staff Aide Sei Taria waited on a Galactic City landing platform as the ship Benevolent III carried Baroness Omnino of the planet Vena to Coruscant. Valorum hoped to persuade Omnino to allow Vena to join the Republic, as its supplies could support Coruscant for generations. The Chancellor asked Taria if the baroness had been followed, as she had been targeted for death by the Vena Isolationists, but Taria assured him that precautions had been taken. Valorum hoped that the Senate Guards would be appropriate protection, as Omnino rejected a Jedi escort."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taria postulated that the baronness would not have come to Coruscant without benefitting herself. She stated that if Omnino wanted to open a trade route to Vena they would need the Republic's support to resolve the civil war in the Vena system. Valorum personally greeted Omnino when she arrived, for which she thanked him. The proceedings were interupted when a Senate guard\u2014mind-controlled by a device worn by Omnino to gain sympathy in the Senate\u2014 suddenly tried to murder the baronness. Qui-Gon Jinn had been disguised as a Senate guard and saved Omnino with his lightsaber, and the failed assassin leapt to his death from the landing platform rather than face capture. As Omnino's bodyguard had been killed by the assassin, Valorum tried to offer her Jedi protection but was initially rebuffed. The following morning however, Omnino reneged and requested Jinn's protection, despite the animosity between them for the Jedi's failure to protect her husband years earlier. Omnino was expected to meet with Valorum and a group of senators, but it was postponed until Omnino's son Sando arrived on Coruscant. In the meantime, Valorum arranged a tour of the Holographic Zoo of Extinct Animals for the baroness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Omnino met with Jinn and Kenobi and admired the exhibits, Valorum and Taria arrived to bear unfortunate news. The chancellor explained that a distress signal from Sando's ship had been detected in the Bright Jewel Cluster, far away from Vena. Valorum explained that an emergency response team was en route, but Omnino requested that Jinn investigate instead, as part of a ploy to discredit the Jedi. The investigation uncovered Sando's involvement in gathering Savrips from the planet Ord Mantell, where Omnino had been in league with the land baron Taxer Sundown. In the meantime, Omnino participated in negotiations that resulted in Vena joining the Republic. Her fabricated assassination attempt resulted in a Senate sympathetic to her, and she used her mind control device to ensure that Valorum was instrumental in securing her favoured outcome. Republic membership gave Omnino unlimited access to Ord Mantell, which she traveled to following the negotiations aboard the Benevolent III with Valorum and several mind-controlled Senate Guards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Omnino had planned to rendezvous with Sundown, but arrived just after he had been dispatched by Jinn and Kenobi, who had allied with the Savrips. The Jedi met with the baroness and she revealed her plan, and used the Senate Guards to hold Valorum hostage in front of the Jedi. Jinn resolved the situation by offering to leave the Jedi Order and work as Omnino's guardian, and when she let her guard down he decapitated her to end her mind controlling influence. Valorum was shocked to see her corpse, as he had no memory from being controlled, and Jinn explained her duplicitous actions. He then watched as Jinn railed against several Human Mantellian colonists after one of them shot the Savrip Mawkran, explaining that the Savrip species had been misunderstood as monsters. Valorum traveled back to Coruscant with the Jedi, expressing his gratitude while explaining that the Senate would insist on an investigation."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Second Term"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the aforementioned disadvantages, combined with his apparent lack of charisma, Valorum won a second four-year term in office in 36 BBY, albeit by a very slim margin. What little support Valorum still enjoyed vanished as he failed to overcome the apathy and dishonesty that afflicted the Republic, and opposing parties began to consider possible replacements for him, often considering Senator Palpatine of Naboo, who was one of Valorum's oldest political friends and had become a member of his inner circle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Valorum had become embattled by 34 BBY, when the Corporate Alliance launched a blockade of the Malastare Narrows during a dispute over fuel allocations from Malastare, which appealed to the Chancellor to intervene after efforts to reach a diplomatic solution failed. Valorum feared that the Alliance could achieve victory, as the Dustig Sector Forces were weakened by corruption and neglect, so he demurred publicly while covertly convincing the neighboring Tyus and Var Hagen sectors to support Malastare. He also diverted credits to the Dugs to hire privateers and dispatched the Jedi Kep-She and an officer named Wullf Yularen to the area, ostensibly as military observers. Although the subsequent Battle of Malastare Narrows forced the Corporate Alliance to retreat, scandal ensued, embarrassing the already-troubled Valorum."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Dorvalla Incident in 33 BBY, on the initiative of Senator Palpatine, Valorum suggested for the taxation of Free-Trade routes to make peace with the Nebula Front who had been terrorizing the Trade Federation. The Front did not think this would make any difference and attempted to murder the Chancellor. The terrorists made two assassination attempts, both of which were foiled by the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly afterwards, Palpatine secretly funneled several million credits, believed to have been stolen by the Nebula Front, through the Bank of Aargau, and into the accounts of the Valorum family. Palpatine's aide, Sate Pestage, ensured that the exchange was uncovered by Valorum's political enemy, Senator Orn Free Taa, who revealed it to the Internal Activities Committee, thus critically weakening the Chancellor's already tenuous hold on power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Valorum denied the accusations and his supporters rallied to his side, his influence and reputation languished. Correctly thinking that he could be ousted from his charge in a near future, Valorum then decided to perform one last good deed while he could, and he gathered the Coruscant security forces to fight a subversive organization known as the Flail. The Flail, who believed the Senate was corrupt, had performed several attacks, disrupting public services with no care for the lives or property lost. The Flail's members dwindled thanks to Valorum's efforts, and the main leaders of the conspiracy died in a shooting with the police. Valorum publicly promised that the remnants of the Flail would be taken to justice before the following Senate conference, which prompted the new terrorist leader, Zegmon Pent, to send Valorum death threats and vainly assault his Staff Aide Sei Taria."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this time, Valorum had strengthened his ties with the Jedi, and he asked Jedi Master and Council member Mace Windu for advice. Windu and Valorum had deduced that the Flail would attack Valorum during his next public speech. Windu noticed that the Flail tended to flee when noticing a known member of the Senate Guard or the Council; he thus suggested Valorum to create a strike force of relatively unknown but well-recommended agents. Valorum agreed and, again with Windu's help, compiled some candidates and called them for a meeting. While Valorum and Windu were to meet this new secret police in person soon afterwards, Valorum himself was delayed and arrived shamefully late."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Windu explained that the Flail would probably attack Valorum from the Weather Modulation Control Center and/or from the Air Traffic Control. The new team went to the Weather Center and fought with several anarchists who wanted to reprogram the weather and cause a threatening thunderstorm that could damage the buildings in the speech area. As soon as the combat was over, Valorum personally contacted them, to be know whether any of them had died or not and to offer his help. The Flail, including Pent himself, then tried to attack Valorum from the Air Traffic Control by sending a remote-piloted vehicle to crash in the meeting area. While Valorum was giving his conference, his new agents ended with the threat of the Flail."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Naboo crisis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 32 BBY, the Trade Federation made use of their battleships in a practically impenetrable blockade orbiting Naboo. It was a bold move for the usually cowardly Federation, triggering the Naboo crisis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the next month, the Senate debated fiercely, but did not act to aid the people of Naboo. The Federation's representative, Lott Dod, successfully argued his case: they had not violated any Republic laws; they had attacked no ships, nor had they moved against Naboo itself. And if no outright crime had been committed, the Judicial Department could not be sent. The stalling further weakened the Valorum administration; their defiance of his measures was in itself damaging to the Chancellor's already dwindling support."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Queen Amidala of Naboo contacted Valorum and held him personally responsible for the suffering on her world. Every day he delayed, she stated, he took bread out of the mouths of the starving children of Naboo. Pressed against the wall by his conscience, and desperate to shore up his crumbling support, he decided to act. He would call for a special session of the Senate to discuss the blockade, but to have a strong bargaining position, he needed the battleships sent home from Naboo. He would use the Jedi as ambassadors and send them to Naboo. Their presence would shake the Neimoidians' confidence and show them he meant business. But this came to nothing as the Federation occupied Naboo and detained Amidala. In a daring raid, she was rescued by the two Jedi Valorum had sent; Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Valorum met the Queen when she arrived on Coruscant to assure her that necessary steps were being taken to end the crisis."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Removal from office"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The long-anticipated special session of the Senate\u2014the last under the Valorum government\u2014had only two items on its agenda: a hearing of the Naboo delegation's case, and a debate on the Trade Federation's continued opposition to Senate Resolution BR-0371. Few expected it to be anything other than routine. Lott Dod, the Federation's representative, stalled the proceedings with every procedural tool at his command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dod and his allies threw up objection after objection; Amidala, unable to even finish her plea, grew more and more frustrated. Finally, Dod moved that a Senate committee be created to go to Naboo to determine if her \"accusations\" were valid, citing senatorial procedures that Amidala had no hope of understanding. Then, Mas Amedda\u2014as expected\u2014pulled Valorum aside, subtly forcing Valorum to concede that Dod was within his rights according to Section 523A. \"Enter the bureaucrats,\" Palpatine whispered into the queen's ear, \"the true rulers of the Republic, and on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will disappear.\" When Valorum turned back from Amedda and asked the queen if she would defer her motion to allow the committee to do its work, it was the last straw. She had seen with her own eyes that Palpatine had been right\u2013Valorum was ineffective\u2013and she had nowhere left to go.

The senators erupted into a frenzied uproar, calling out, \"Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!\" All the Chancellor could do was to postpone the vote until the following day. When the Senate convened the following day to vote on the no confidence motion, the outcome was decisive. Valorum had few friends left, and the Senate so badly wanted him gone that they did not hesitate.

He contributed where he could and received no thanks for his trouble. After he returned to public life, he spent his retirement working with the Refugee Relief Movement. He also wrote an autobiography, Holding Back the Tide, which was released in 23 BBY to poor sales and little interest. In 22 BBY, he participated in a Refugee Relief Movement project to construct housing for refugees from Separatist worlds on Alderaan, using a power-shovel to dig postholes for the prefabricated structures.

Unfortunately, his more political characteristics were during the conference when in a hushed conversation with his Vice Chairman Mas Amedda and Staff Aide Sei Taria. During this time, Senator Palpatine revealed to Queen Amidala that the leadership of the Galactic Republic was also, aside from their substantial government stipends, on an additional payroll of none other than the Trade Federation.
