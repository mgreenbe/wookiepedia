In 13 ABY, the Endor went on a patrol near the planetoid RZ7-6113-23 and intercepted two TIE/sr starfighters. They followed the starfighters until an ensign detected large energy spike coming from the planetoid and warned the captain, who then realized the trap and ordered a withdrawal. The order came too late as the Endor was destroyed by a single blast from the fully charged cannon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
