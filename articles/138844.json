He served directly under General Grievous, Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies of the Separatists. He served aboard Grievous's Recusant-class light destroyer when the General captured Master Eeth Koth of the Jedi Council, intending to torture him repeatedly and lure the other Jedi to rescue him over Saleucami. Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Adi Gallia came to engage Grievous' forces, unaware of their intended maneuver being predicted by Grievous and the trap set by the General and tactical droid. Confronted by Gallia and Skywalker on the destroyer's bridge and making several attempts to personally execute Master Koth, TV-94 was eventually destroyed in the ensuing battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TV-94 served as General Grievous's subordinate aboard his personal destroyer, overseeing the captivity of Master Koth. He informed the General of their arrival at the Saleucami system, where they were taking their prisoner, and acknowledged his command to begin landing preparations. TV-94 then stood by as three cruiser-class and four escort-class Republic ships came out of hyperspace. From one of the escort vessels, General Kenobi hailed Grievous's destroyer. The tactical droid informed his superior of the transmission, and was promptly ordered to put it through. After a brief bicker with his Jedi nemesis, Grievous cut the transmission and ordered his troops to prepare all cannons for fire. He also told them to be alert, as Kenobi was usually accompanied closely by Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TV-94 noted the Republic vessels' superiority in speed and maneuverability, advising that the General take caution. Grievous ordered that their ships draw the Republic vessels inward, as he desired to kill Kenobi face-to-face. The cyborg then went and boarded the Jedi's vessel, engaging him and his clones as TV-94 stayed on the bridge with their prisoner. With Koth held in electric bindings, the tactical droid wore a wrist gauntlet that controlled the force field used to torture the Jedi. Meanwhile, Skywalker and Adi Gallia were sent in a separate ship underneath Grievous' destroyer in hopes of surprising the droids and rescuing Master Koth. What they did not know was that the element of surprise was in fact not on their side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Grievous's troops fell to Kenobi's lightsaber skills and the cyborg and Jedi Master engaged in a fierce duel, Gallia and Skywalker fought their way to the destroyer's bridge and located Master Koth. TV-94 turned to the bridge door as it was opened, looked down at a destroyed B2 super battle droid as it slid to his feet, and then glared at the Jedi intruders. Skywalker believed that the enemy would be surprised by their arrival, but the tactical droid, undaunted, corrected the Jedi Knight and stood by as several commando droids appeared around him, taking defensive positions and springing Grievous's trap. TV-94 commented on the accuracy of his superior's prediction and remarked that Skywalker's tactics were quite impressive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TV-94 then used his remote control to send jolts of painful energy through the captive Zabrak's body, threatening to kill him if the Jedi made a move. While he was maliciously laughing, Skywalker managed to pull him forward with the Force and cut off the droid's arm with the detonator attached. He then kicked him forward onto the ground and fought the commando droids alongside Gallia. TV-94 attempted to retrieve his arm and detonator, the only leverage he had, during the ensuing fight. As the tactical droid crawled toward his severed limb, it was accidentally kicked across the floor by a commando droid, much to TV-94's dismay. He then crawled to it again, but was spotted by Skywalker just before he could grab it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Warning Gallia, Skywalker allowed her to throw TV-94 backwards with the Force, preventing him again from procuring his detonator arm. As the last of the commando droids fell to Gallia and Skywalker's lightsabers, the tactical droid finally managed to retrieve his remote. He again laughed sadistically as he went to activate the switch and kill Master Koth; however, he then realized that he could not press the button, his right arm being gripped by his left, and groaned in despair before being cut down by Skywalker. His failure allowed Koth to be successfully rescued, and being unable to kill Kenobi, Grievous and his troops were forced to retreat to the surface of Saleucami, pursued by Republic forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TV-94 was the first tactical droid to have red eyes and a red mouth. TX-20, while having white eyes in Innocents of Ryloth, was also given red eyes in Supply Lines. The droid's successor, TV-94B, also had red eyes. He was voiced by Matt Lanter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leland Chee stated that TV-94's markings may be inspired by those worn by Darth Maul."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
