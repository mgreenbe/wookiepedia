Gethul was able to exert mind-control over both sentient individuals and non-sentient creatures, as demonstrated when a team led by Jedi Master Adelade uncovered it in 3630 BBY. Though not yet fully awake, Adelade and her followers heard Gethul's \"song\" and fell under its sway, forming a Cult of Gethul and attempting to fully awaken the creature. Learning of this and fearing that in its full power Gethul could destabilize Makeb's core and obliterate the planet, Eternal Alliance military Admiral Bey'wan Aygo sent a strike team to stop Adelade's plan. After they confronted and killed Chief Engineer Penzaren, Adelade sent Skurr and a Subteroth named Skurr to stop them, but the creatures were defeated and killed as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Velloc appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne as a boss during the \"Destroyer Of Worlds\" Uprising."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
