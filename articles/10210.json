The research station was built by the Army Weapons Research Department of the Galactic Republic and was responsible for the design of the KLR series combat droid. This made the base a target for the Separatists, who attacked and bombarded the base, destroying the garage almost completely before the Republic dreadnaught cruiser Myrkos joined the battle. Though the Myrkos was destroyed, and plummeted into the planet, the Separatist forces were damaged badly enough that they could not continue their bombardment. It was thought that they had decided they had destroyed the base anyway, and simply left."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
