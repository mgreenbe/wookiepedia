The cities were built nearby to larger cities, in a way \"orbiting\" the larger city. Like all other Kaminoan cities, they were built on stilts which descended into the water and made with imported materials. In the case of Tipoca City, Kamino's capital, these satellite cities contained Kaminoan homes and recreation facilities that were not present in Tipoca itself, due to much of the city being a military base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
