Usually working for nobles and corporate executives, locators were hired to find targets such as runaway children, con artists who swindled their client, or gamblers who owed a debt. Unlike regular bounty hunters, locators preferred to use investigation, computer proficiency and a network of contacts to locate their targets. Outsmarting their target was their chosen method of acquiring their quarry rather than using blasters. Locators were consummate professionals who honored their contracts. Locators were fully accredited bounty hunters, carrying an Imperial Peace-Keeping Certificate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
