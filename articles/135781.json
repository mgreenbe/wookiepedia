Designed as a 1-meter tall cylindrical droid on an efficient repulsorlift, the droid was used mainly in the Outer Rim for guarding various garrisons. It was equipped with a light blaster cannon, reflective plate armor, a NeuroSaav sensor suite, and a NeuroSaav biorecognition package. They were slow-moving but had an excellent targeting package not unlike that of the Viper probe droid. It cost 7,500 credits and was only available to the Imperial Military. The model was introduced early in the days of the New Order, then discontinued for almost two decades before being remarketed for the Imperial Navy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
