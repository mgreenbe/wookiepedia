In the year 0 BBY, Ock was present in the partisans' base in the Catacombs of Cadera when a group of captives including Gerrera's adoptive daughter Jyn Erso were brought in. Shortly after their arrival, the partisans were forced to flee when the Empire destroyed the nearby Jedha City with their Death Star superweapon, creating a blast wave that also destroyed the catacombs. Some time after surviving these events, Ock and Kullbee Sperado found their way to the opposite hemisphere of the moon. After discovering a smuggler's guide left behind by Shesslaria, the two left Jedha in a Z-95 Headhunter in hopes of finding Maz Kanata's treasure on Iskalon with their old crew, which consists of Nersiton, Isin, and Rufork Tamson. While initially seizing the treasure, they are soon captured and thrown into Megalox Beta Penitentiary. Ock had a cyber-optic wire connected directly to his brain which granted him sharper vision, allowing him to analyse kyber crystal deposits, examine microcircuitry and throw his vibrorang weapon with unerring accuracy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cycyed Ock first appeared in the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was released in North America on December 16, 2016.
