The Jedi were declared enemies of the state, and Sidious transformed the Galactic Republic into the first Galactic Empire, with himself as absolute ruler. The proclamation was met with widespread support in the Senate and in public, though some\u2014such as Senators Bail Organa and Padm\u00e9 Amidala\u2014quietly watched in disappointment.
