The power typically required extended concentration by the user, normally lasting an hour or more. It was not completely unheard of for a user to spend as many as 20 hours focusing with this ability to remove the most persistent of diseases. The power was limited to only removing the present and future effects of the diseases in one's system; past effects were not healed. Jedi Master Cilghal was known to use this power."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
