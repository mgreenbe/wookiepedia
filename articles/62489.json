It was made from the tail scales of the ferocious horax. The elixir was used to create a barrier of defense around Nelvaanian villages, as horaxes were scared of the scent. One scale could produce a strong enough elixir to protect a village for a year, and so it became a rite of passage for young Nelvaanian boys to venture out and take a scale off the tail of a sleeping horax at the beginning of every year."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
