Her school trained bodyguards who worked for Imperial senators and government officials. One of her martial arts instructors was Juahir Madras, who was part of Nightswan's spy ring on Coruscant. H'sishi was not involved in this conspiracy and was cleared by Captain Thrawn, a rising star in the Imperial Navy. Following the arrest of Juahir and her co-conspirators, Arihnda Pryce advised H'sishi to leave Coruscant for her own safety."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "H'sishi was a martial artist and the owner of the martial arts school Yinchom Dojo on the galactic capital Coruscant during the Imperial Era. Over a five year period, the Yinchom Dojo trained thirty bodyguards to protect Imperial senators and government officials. One of her martial arts instructors was Juahir Madras, a human woman who had decided to leave her waitering job and become a combat instructor. Unknown to H'sishi, Juahir was a member of Nightswan's spy ring on Coruscant. Under the direction of her fellow operative Driller MarDapp, who ran the Higher Skies Advocacy Group, Juahir was tasked with recruiting bodyguards into rebel operatives who would steal data files that were supplied to Nightswan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Circle Bay mayor's office protest, H'sishi was visited by Imperial Security Bureau Colonel Wullf Yularen, Captain Thrawn, Ensign Eli Vanto, and ISB officers Roenton and Brook. Yularen wanted to investigate his theory that Nightswan was recruiting Senate and ministry bodyguards as rebel operatives. During the Imperials' visit, Juahir initially ignored the visitors and continued sparring until H'sishi arrived and ordered her to cease. Juahir's friend Arihnda Pryce, who worked for Higher Skies, was also present."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yularen informed H'sishi that he and his colleagues were doing a routine spot-check of the dojos in Coruscant's Federal District that specialized in government contracts and bodyguard training. H'sishi said she would fetch the records. Before she went to fetch the records, Thrawn asked if he could practise stick fighting with her under the pretext that the Imperial Military was seeking trainers for a possible new urban combat unit. H'sishi offered to demonstrate with Instructor Madras but Thrawn convinced her to let him spar with her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After setting the timer for three minutes, H'sishi and Thrawn sparred. Following the sparring match, H'sishi praised Thrawn's fighting abilities. Though his Chiss style was unknown to her, H'sishi observed that he was well-trained. After handing the sticks to Madras, Thrawn asked if he could train with her in the Togorian form. H'sishi obliged and told Thrawn that she would welcome him both as a student and a teacher. She then went to fetch the data card and handed it to Yularen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the visit, Thrawn explained to Yularen and Vanto that he had engaged in a combat match to check if H'sishi was concerned if he knew of Pryce's connection with Higher Skies. While Thrawn had developed a certain skill for reading human emotions, he was not familiar with Togorians. Though Thrawn cleared H'sishi, he rightfully suspected her employee Madras had something to hide. Thrawn's hypothesis was proven right when Pryce exposed Higher Skies' espionage activities and offered to work as a double agent for the Empire in exchange for immunity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Pryce struck a deal with Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, Pryce and Colonel Yularen visited the Yinchom Dojo and personally arrested Juahir. One of Madras' students, the bodyguard Kaniki, attempted to assassinate Senator Evidorn. Madras had convinced Kaniki of the evils of the Empire. Following Madras' arrest, Yularen asked about H'sishi, who had been standing silently in the doorway of her office watching the arrest. Pryce pointed out that Thrawn had said she was in the clear, something that was confirmed by Yularen's records."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pryce told H'sishi that she had been cleared of any wrongdoing. However, she recommended that she leave Coruscant immediately since her former employee might try to shift some of her guilt onto her.
