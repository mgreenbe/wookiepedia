He was a member of the crew of the FarStar during its hunt for Moff Kentor Sarne.

Acquiring a light freighter, he became a galactic salesman who imported and exported goods from countless planets. He would settle on planets and create buying networks to help him acquire the goods he needed, basing himself near urban centers of starports. Eventually, he would move on to another location and repeat the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During one such transaction, he acquired three Turazza eggs. The eggs hatched, and three Turazza sisters emerged and bonded with Loh'khar. Naming them Rizzal, Vizzal, and Nizzal, the three sisters worked for him, running errands and collecting information."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, he profited from trading with both the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance. He was responsible for assisting in the extraction of a Rebel infiltration team led by Thella from Kelada by arranging transport off the planet via Platt Okeefe and the Last Chance. Business was slower under the New Republic, but not unprofitable. Trading out of his light freighter, Loh'khar stopped on Kal'Shebbol. He attempted to deal with Moff Sarne, only to have Sarne steal his freighter. Thankful for not being imprisoned, he set up a shop in the main starport, trading with the few freighter pilots who used the port."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The FarStar"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the New Republic announced they were looking for a crew to man the FarStar, Loh'khar applied to Lieutenant Judder Page.
