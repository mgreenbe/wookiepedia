The astromech droid T7-O1 served as Shafu's navigator but never entered the cargo hold where the slaves were kept, and so was unaware of Shafu's actual trade. Sometime before 3681 BBY, the Jedi Master Ven Zallow tracked down Shafu. However, instead of arresting the Rodian, Zallow convinced Shafu to give up his career as a slaver and return to Hutt Space, where Shafu freed hundreds of slaves. Giving T7-O1 to the Jedi Master, Shafu went on to work as an undercover operative for Zallow, infiltrating the criminal underworld during the Great Galactic War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the war, Zallow sent Shafu to investigate rumors of an Imperial spy in the upper echelons of the Republic. Shafu intercepted a message from the Alderaanian noble Eckhorn Baliss that contained a list of Imperial sympathizers in the Galactic Senate and revealed Baliss to be an Imperial spy. However, Baliss was killed in 3663 BBY, and Shafu continued his investigations over the next decade, determining that Baliss had attempted to blackmail an Imperial plant in the Senate and was killed for it. Shafu compiled a report on his investigations and submitted it shortly before Zallow's death in 3653 BBY, but Zallow died before seeing the message, and it was deleted from official communications. Shafu was killed himself not long afterward by the bounty hunter Terrin Sandafar, who sabotaged Shafu's ship so that it exploded over the moon Nar Shaddaa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, T7-O1 learned of Shafu's death\u2014which had been ruled accidental\u2014and rebuilt Shafu's report from the deleted files.
