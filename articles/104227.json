During the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and Separatist Alliance, the frigates were used by the Republic Navy as a critical component of its war effort. The most common combat configuration was the Pelta-class strike frigate, while other configurations served as hospital ships, such as the Pelta-class Medical Frigate, which was used to safely ferry injured clone troopers to medical stations for treatment. Pelta-class Transport Frigates also served as supply ships to deliver armaments, medical supplies, and food rations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These vessels were vital to Republic operations during the Battle of Ryloth and the Battle of Christophsis, which saw the use of Pelta-class frigates as blockade runners, supply ships, and medcenters. In the latter role, a number of medical frigates participated in the evacuation of the Republic Kaliida Shoals Medical Center, which was targeted by the Separatist heavy cruiser Malevolence, captained by Supreme Commander of the Droid Army General Grievous. In the second year of the Clone Wars, Geonosian brain worms infected the clone troopers of Tango Company aboard the Pelta-class Medical Frigate TB-73. Following the sabotage of the Venator-class Star Destroyer Endurance, a frigate participated in the recovery and rescue efforts.

Rebels heavily modified Pelta-class frigates into Pelta-class Assault Ships and Pelta-class Command Cruisers. Numerous Pelta-class frigates would go on to serve in the citizens' fleet against the Final Order, a Sith empire that contained a vast armada that threatened the galaxy.

The Alliance also modified Pelta-class Assault Ships and the Pelta-class Command Cruisers, variants of the standard Pelta-class frigate. The Pelta-class Assault Ships were equipped with armaments on their hull, which gave the ship the ability to broadside enemy vessels. The Pelta-class frigate was equipped with sixteen escape pods. Some models of escape pods that the Pelta-class could be equipped with included Republic escape pods and RGC-6b escape pods.

Ray shields were equipped in a passageway to reach the bridge, acting as a security measure. Pelta-class frigates also had a cargo bay for supplies, a reactor control room that included the controls for the coolant and power systems, and an aft communications station.

As hospital ships, the Pelta-class frigates were equipped to transport patients, as well as rescue personnel in stranded escape pods. During the Clone Wars, honorable Separatist generals were known to withhold from attacking the Pelta-class frigates.

The frigates were escorted by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, Admiral Wullf Yularen, and three Venator-class Star Destroyers from Skywalker's task force. Although Skywalker was instructed not to engage the Separatist blockade by Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi, Skywalker decided to engage the Separatist armada regardless and was soon outnumbered and outgunned, as the Separatist fleet consisted of Munificent-class star frigates, Lucrehulk-class Battleships, and the Invincible, a Providence-class Dreadnought.

Soon, the Invincible began bearing down on the Republic fleet unopposed, and Trench ordered his forces to separate the Pelta frigates from their escorts. The Invincible launched a salvo of laser fire at the Republic fleet, resulting in the destruction of a Pelta frigate.

Skywalker reluctantly agreed, ordering the two remaining Pelta frigates to retreat to Kenobi's position behind Leesis, the moon of Christophsis, while Skywalker's Venators covered their retreat.

After failed negotiations with the Toydarians at the impediment of Senator Lott Dod of the Trade Federation, King Katuunko of Toydaria approached Organa and Binks, stating that the Toydarians could not turn a blind eye to the suffering on Ryloth, and that the Republic may use Toydaria as a supply base on the conditions that it would only be the supplies that the Republic have already brought with them and that the Trade Federation would not be aware of the aid mission and Toydaria's involvement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Organa devised a plan which included a special dinner for Katuunko, several of his advisors, and the representatives of the Trade Federation, all of which was a ruse to distract the Trade Federation of the three Pelta frigates which were loading up the supplies and leaving for Ryloth.

The successful attack led to the entire convoy being destroyed, with survivors attempting to flee in escape pods. During the engagement, Grievous was given new orders by Separatist Head of State Count Dooku to target and destroy a Haven-class medical station, the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center, as it housed tens of thousands of wounded clone troopers, making it a target ripe for destroying. With Grievous forced to take a longer route around a large nebula to reach the station, the Republic deduced that based on the previous attack, the medical station was the next likely target, and Skywalker was dispatched along with his padawan Ahsoka Tano, Jedi General Plo Koon, and the BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber Shadow Squadron, to the medical station and destroy the Malevolence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yularen alerted the medical station of the incoming threat, and Chief Medical Scientist Nala Se informed Yularen that even if they had the necessary transports, there would still not be enough time to evacuate all of the wounded.

As Grievous was en route to the medical station, Pelta frigates began arriving and loading the more stable wounded patients to the frigates first, with the more critically injured having to wait. When Grievous and Skywalker arrived, Grievous opted to target a fleeing group of Pelta frigates first, and then deal with Skywalker and his squadron. After Grievous destroyed the fleeing group of Peltas, the Malevolence and its starfighters engaged Skywalker and his squadron; in the ensuing battle, Skywalker lost nearly half of his squadron.

With Skywalker, Kenobi, Unduli, and Jedi General Ki-Adi-Mundi occupied with the aftermath of the battle and the transportation of Geonosian Archduke Poggle the Lesser to Coruscant for interrogation, Skywalker suggested that they let Padawans Tano and Barriss Offee handle the supply mission and use TB-73, a Pelta-class frigate, to pick up the supplies from the Ord Cestus medical station and transport them to Dantooine.

Skywalker interrogated Poggle for information on how to stop the brain worms without the knowledge of the others.
