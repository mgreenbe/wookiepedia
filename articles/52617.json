During the Galactic Civil War, it was occupied by the Galactic Empire. After the Battle of Endor, the burgeoning New Republic got rid of the Imperials on that world. With both the Empire and the New Republic gone, however, the people of Gan Moradir found themselves at the mercy of pirate gangs that seized the food sources. Additionally, the fightings had affected their wells, leaving them without drinking water. The colonists managed to save up enough credits to bring Geeska Dotalo, a Xan male, to Chandrila, seat of the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
