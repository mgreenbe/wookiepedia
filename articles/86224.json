They became standard equipment for Mandalorian police units, and beskar-made manacles were also favored by criminals and enemies of Force-users like the Knights of the Jedi Order. Bogga the Hutt equipped his henchmen with manacles to hold Jedi captive, manacles used to bind Jedi Master Thon during a skirmish on Ambria; Thon was later freed when his student Nomi Sunrider cut the chains with her lightsaber. Millennia later, following the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Imperial government requisitioned beskar equipment including Mandalorian manacles from the MandalMotors company. Mere decades after, when Jedi Knight Jaina Solo came to the Mandalorians seeking aid in capturing her Sith Lord brother, Darth Caedus, Mandalorian manacles were recommended for his incarceration."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mandalorian manacles were forged from beskar iron, a nearly indestructable and rare ore found only on the planet Mandalore\u2014the Mandalorians' cultural homeworld, located in the Outer Rim Territories of the galaxy\u2014and Mandalore's moon, Concordia.

A set of Mandalorian manacles came into the ownership of the Hutt crime lord Bogga, who outfitted his henchman Gudb with the manacles in order to incapacitate the Jedi Master Thon. Shortly after being captured and bound with the manacles, Thon was freed by his student, Nomi Sunrider, who cut through the chains with her lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even as more advanced binder technology developed in the galaxy, the strength of Mandalorian manacles allowed them to remain a competitor in the field. Beskar manacles established themselves as part of the standard equipment available to Mandalorian police units, and they became known for their ability to imprison Force-users. Following the rise of the Galactic Empire, Imperial forces contacted the MandalMotors company in Mandalore's capital city of Keldabe, seeking to contract specialist equipment made of beskar, with a shipment of Mandalorian manacles among the items the Empire requested. Decades later, in 41 ABY, the veteran Mandalorian soldier Goran Beviin recommended Mandalorian manacles to the Jedi Knight Jaina Solo, who had come to Mandalore looking for assistance in capturing her recently-turned Sith Lord brother, Jacen Solo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mandalorian manacles were first introduced to the Star Wars universe in the fifth issue of the Tales of the Jedi comic series, part three of The Saga of Nomi Sunrider.
