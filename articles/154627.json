During the Battle of Ringo Vinda, the shuttle was employed to transport the clone trooper Tup to Kamino after he had suffered a mysterious medical episode which had led him to kill Jedi General Tiplar in the middle of battle. However, the shuttle was ambushed by Separatist forces before it could jump into hyperspace, and the battle droids killed the crew and kidnapped Tup. Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, Clone Captain Rex and ARC trooper Fives subsequently inspected the wreckage and realized what had happened, leading them on a mission to rescue their comrade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
