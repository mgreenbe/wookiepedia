Each Gree had six tentacles and an over-sized head, in comparison to baseline and near-Human body proportions, and stood between 0.8 and 1.2 meters tall. Gree evolved in a Type II atmosphere, and generally covered their lower faces with odd spongy devices (presumably breath masks) in Type I atmospheres."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gree were a six-tentacled race of cephalopod creatures that had an unusual anatomy with gray skin, large sad-looking eyes along with tall foreheads. These features supported an immense brain sac which flopped oddly behind their heads. There was no visible mouth present on their faces though it was thought that multiple fleshy folds beneath the eyes served vocal oral communication needs. Their evolution on their homeworld meant that they were comfortable in Type II atmospheres with Type I being unpleasant to them. As such, when traveling through such an environment, they wore odd spongy communication devices to cover their communication folds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gree possessed multiple tentacles with each holding a particular function. The first pair served as fine manipulators, another as heavy grippers, and the third as ambulators. This last pair was used to help a Gree move about its environment where its appearance was that of a shambling mound of gray flesh. Typically, Gree rarely ever grew more than a meter and a half in terms of height."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ancient Days"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This advanced species was noted as being one of the oldest civilizations and most ancient in the galaxy. Much of their own history was shrouded to the Gree themselves, with the secrets of their origins being lost. Most scholars believed that the Gree developed on their own homeworld of Gree hundreds of thousands of years before the Galactic Republic. Following a long period of evolution, it was thought that they had developed some form of hyperspace technology whereupon they moved to explore the stars. Their initial expansion in ancient times was achieved through their remarkable technology that included sophisticated navigational computers. This ancient era when their civilization flourished was known to Gree historians as \"the most ancient and forgotten days\". The Gree found themselves to be much more advanced than most other races in that era. Few of these species encountered had even entered into the industrial age. In this time, the Gree traded with these worlds and even ruled some of them. However, they formed a policy of never giving technology to a developing civilization unless they were theoretically capable of developing it themselves. At some unknown point in the distant past, the ancestors of the Gree launched an automated exploration vessel known as the Gray Secant that left the boundaries of the Enclave for its mission to study the entire galaxy. In the Outer Rim, the Gree civilization flourished from 100,000 BBY when they reached their apex during the same era as that of the Columi. They were noted to have constructed strange alien marvels that were never duplicated in later years. Whilst a powerful race, the Gree empire faced opposition to their reign in the form of the reptilian Kwa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 100,000 BBY, they shared the galaxy with a number of other races, including the Celestials, Kwa, Sharu, Columi, Taung, and Humans. During these times the Gree, along with both the Kwa and Killiks, became servants of the Celestials. This era saw them aid in building astonishing technological projects. Around 35,000 BBY one of the Celestials' servant races, the Rakata, revolted against their rule and usurped their domain. Afterwards, the Rakata were known to have waged a war against the other Celestial servant races, including the Gree. This saw the Gree encounter the aggressive and militarily superior might of the Infinite Empire. This period also saw the Gree come into conflict with the advanced Kwa holdings, a conflict which stretched for millennia to 27,000 BBY. Eventually, both sides were pushed back to their borders by the aggressive expansions and military actions of the Infinite Empire. Sometime during their history, the Gree engaged in a war with a large saurian species. The war lasted for several centuries, causing such strife and chaos that Abeloth, the Bringer of Chaos, escaped from her prison. In the Histories of the Killik Thuruht hive, a panel depicted a group of Gree sacrificing several members of a large, saurian species to Abeloth on her planet."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Old Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the rise of the Old Republic, the Enclave closed the borders of Asation from the rest of the galaxy when the Gree entered into a cultural retreat that they called the Orange Conic Era. By the time the Je'daii Order formed on Tython, the species had long departed the known galaxy. All knowledge of their existence was so far back in history that it had became near legend or myths. During this era, there was much interest among the Tythans in this ancient race who researched them and their legacy. A number of theories held that the Old City was a settlement inhabited or created by the Gree. By the age of the Old Republic, the Gree were noted for being one of the oldest species in the galaxy and known for both their bizarre as well as wonderful technology. Their glory days of their civilization having ended thousands of years before the rise of the Republic, much of their history was forgotten and their greatest achievements were lost to their people. The majority of Gree lived in seclusion within their territory in the Gree Enclave, a mid-sized region of space that was carefully isolated from outside contact. While isolationist, the Gree were still well known for their reputation as engineers and artisans of unmatched skill."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One instance of limited contact between the Gree and the galaxy outside occurred shortly after the end of the Great Sith War, when several hundred A-series assassin droids designed by Anx scientist Pollux Poi and upgraded by Rakatan technology left Kashyyyk for Gree space. There, a Gree clan employed them as assassins. These droids remained in Gree space for thousands of years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point in history, Gree also settled on Coruscant. In 3643 BBY, during the Old Republic era much of Coruscant's lower level constructions, such as power production and waste processing was still of Gree technology. At the time, there was a delegation of Gree droids present on Coruscant to oversee the maintenance of these machines. The Sith Emperor was noted to have used Gree technology to create a cloaking device for his personal space station. At some point, the Sith Empire managed to recover a Gree computer. It was believed by the Republic Strategic Information Service that the device was recovered from an ancient derelict vessel whereupon it was studied on Dromund Kaas. After recognizing its potential, the Sith were believed to had used it to safely navigate to the Maelstrom Prison following an adaptation of the computer interface for use by humanoid species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Grand Acquisitions Race, it was noted by the Chevin Conglomerate that a Gree fleet was returning to known space for some mysterious purpose. In fact, the legendary vessel known as the Gray Secant began its journey to the planet Ilum as the conflict between the Republic and Sith became subject to its study. Afterwards, agents of the Dread Masters continued their plans by taking control of a Gree Hypergate on Asation where they began transporting hordes of creatures to the planet. As a result, the Gree dispatched their ambassadors to gather help from the galactic powers. Administrator General Lalat'k was sent to the Sith Empire to gather their aid whilst Gatemaster Beltek'k was dispatched to the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the final years of the Galactic Republic, the Gree were still best known as a species that had built a civilization that predated the Republic. As a result, the worlds of the Gree were noted for being a xenoarcheaologist's treasure trove that contained artifacts of exotic and advanced technology.These relics were guarded by a Gree culture which had degenerated to a point where they were no longer able to use much of their own technology. During the Rise of the Empire era, the glory days of the Gree were long over and their history and technological secrets mostly lost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Separatist Crisis, Count Dooku formerly of the Jedi Order was sighted within the Gree Enclave where the Senate Bureau of Intelligence had reports of a man matching his description being onboard the mobile Rokak'k Baran station. There were also claims of him utilizing a vessel with a particle-wake unlike any encountered before that led to Director Armand Isard commenting that contact was being made with Gree crafters to inquire if they knew anything about the technology employed. At this point in their history, the Gree were still able to operate and build some unique items. Count Dooku's personal Geonosian solar sailer was fitted with an ancient, mysterious sail of Gree manufacture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Trident-class assault ships created by the Colicoid Creation Nest were craft that drew upon the ancient designs of the Gree Enclave. Midway through the Clone Wars, the Pollux Poi assassin droids were purchased by Count Dooku from the Gree where they were utilized on Jabiim. The Gree remained an obscure species, known only to specialists in alien cultures such as clone trooper commander CC-1004. CC-1004 adopted the name \"Gree\" to demonstrate his knowledge of galactic species, knowing that anyone who commented on his chosen name would share his interest in sentientology."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the other hand, Gree were almost entirely unfamiliar with standard galactic technology. They were particularly contemptuous of droids, which were not a part of Gree technology. Modern Gree became reduced to being mere caretakers of decaying wonders. First contact with the Gree by the Empire was made by Captain Marrix during a scouting expedition through their sector of space. He was apparently highly respected by the Gree to the point that he was allowed to visit their homeworld once. The Galactic Empire maintained a small consulate on Gree though there was no governor or garrison. The Imperial Consul-General maintained a small force under his command that included a Carrack-class light cruiser. Skalus served as the Imperial Consul-General on the Gree world of Asation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gree marked their foreheads with hieroglyphic tattoos to denote caste and rank. As Gree engineering reached its zenith, the operators came to dominate the other castes. Eventually, the researchers and crafters disappeared entirely. Their society became apathetic, with the operators and administrators concerned only with maintaining their cultural purity and keeping what devices they could still understand in operation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the past, their society was divided into four castes that were roughly equal to one another:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These were the primary castes within the Enclave. The Gree lacked any form of a warrior caste and instead had used droids in the past for such a role. Within each caste were a number of subgroups or guilds that were responsible for their operations in the caste. Whilst initially the four castes were equal to one another, the rise in Gree technology to its zenith meant that the Operator caste eventually began to dominate its counterparts. As a result, the Crafter and Researcher castes eventually disappeared entirely by the time of the Imperial era. The reasons for this were twofold; the first being because there was no need of them within the slowly dying Gree civilization, and secondly because the Gree had forgotten the bio-engineering processes needed to produce members of those castes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The general Gree masses of latter era tended to be near mindless in their actions with few entering the role as operators. Instead, they were willing to aid the master by performing the few services that justified them being clothed and fed. Such individuals were capable of being Gree that were attached to a master due to their caste and guild. However, they tended to had minimal skills, holding short attention spans and only performed brief actions in order to either acquire sustenance or wealth. These members of the race also were able to find employment under Gree traders where they used their small array of talents for some use. The traders, whilst considered a part of these masses, but were actually above the common rabble due to their ability to trade for goods and services. These Gree were looked down upon by the masters, but were accepted as part of their society due to their ability to bring in new clients or goods from the space outside the Enclave. By modern era, a somewhat new group of traders emerged among the Gree known as the Sevarks who acted as translators and intermediaries between a master to alien client."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amongst the highest ranking position for the Gree were those that held the title of grandmaster who were recognized as the prominent master of their field on a world. Beneath them were the guildmasters that headed the local guilds. Beneath them were the masters who dominated their society and were respected by their fellow Gree. As such, they gained a preference over any other being that were seen as a \"lesser\" creature and also held a seat on the local guild of their profession. It was the masters that operated their races technology that maintained the Enclave and thus expected some form of tribute for their knowledge as well as services. It was for this reason that they tended to jealously guard their knowledge, and many secrets became lost as a result of such Gree hoarding their skills instead of passing them on to successors. Beneath them were the potential masters in waiting in the form of senior assistants who had not reached a mastery of their particular field of study. The majority of these individuals tended to be simply waiting for an empty suit on their guild. Senior assistants were responsible for assisting a master in the performance of their work. Students were apprentices junior to them who served and learnt from their experiences that were numerous, but rarely ascended to the rank of senior assistant. Instead, they simply aided the senior assistants and performed the menial tasks of the masters in the operation of a device."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The worlds of the Enclave were governed by a grand council that consisted of members of the local guilds that met when needed. These in turn answered to the grandmaster council located on the Gree homeworld. The guilds themselves served as a regulating group for the local caste subgroups such as constructors, synthesors and textmasters. It was the master on a Gree world that held a council seat of their respective guild. Each guild council only had a limited number of seats that restricted the rise of new masters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gree language made use of metaphors based on geometry and colors which other species had difficulty understanding."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Technology"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Much of the Gree's technology was developed thousands of years ago and was extremely alien to anything known by modern eras. Their ancient technology had millennia ago surpassed that of modern Imperial technology. At their peak, they had mastered stellar engineering, quanta-technology, and dimensional engineering. As such, the oldest Gree technology in existence was remarkably advanced with their high technology on a level far beyond the Imperial equivalent. Much of this consisted of devices that emitted music when operated as they functioned as instruments that needed to be \"played\" in order to function properly. They also created artificial intelligences that could be contained within artifacts and were strong enough to seize control of a starship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The race possessed sophisticated navigational computers that operated on principles that were a mystery to other technologists. These capabilities allowed their vessels to safely traverse turbulent regions of space that included vast asteroid fields and dangerous nebulae. The interface of these Gree computers was designed for the six-limbed cephalopodans. The Gree were marked as one among dozens of alien species that were thought to have developed self-aware automata. In fact, their entire military force consisted of droids that were used by the Gree to combat their foes. However, by the time of the Galactic Civil War, they saw droids as being unworthy technology as they flew in the face of Gree exaltation of personal expertise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Other capabilities achieved through their technology included the capacity to xenoform entire worlds to their standard.
