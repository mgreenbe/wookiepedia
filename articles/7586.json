When activated, the field dramatically improved the integrity of floors, walls, ceilings and other internal surfaces. The projector's umbrella-shaped magnetic fields created a single cohesive anticoncussion field that absorbed and dispersed kinetic energy and was powerful enough to render blasts, collisions, and other impacts inert."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Units"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
