A fair-skinned woman with reddish hair and brown eyes, Tersu wielded a magenta-colored lightsaber in battle like other Scions. After Emperor Arcann ordered the massacre of the Scions around the time of his ascension to the throne of the Eternal Empire, Tersu was among the few Scions who escaped the purge and settled in an enclave on the shadowport Asylum under the leadership of Heskal. In 3631 BBY, the Scions summoned the figure known as the Commander to Asylum and tested the foreigner to determine why they could not see the Outlander's future. Along with other Scions, Tersu attacked the Outlander with Maral in one of a series of combat tests that ultimately revealed the presence of Valkorion, the Immortal Emperor, within the Outlander's mind. The Scions promised their loyalty to the Outlander, but Heskal later betrayed the Scions and the Outlander to Arcann and drew him to Asylum, as his visions led him to believe it was necessary to force a confrontation. Arcann killed Tersu and the other Scions just before the Outlander's arrival, sparking the Battle of Asylum."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tersu appears in Chapter VI: Asylum in Knights of the Fallen Empire, a 2015 Digital Expansion to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
