While stopped over at Kwenn Space Station, the Kowakian monkey-lizard Salacious B. Crumb hid in Jabba's feeding bowl full of Higartha brain-stew. Jabba was enraged when he found Crumb, causing Crumb to dart into the rafters just as Bib Fortuna and Bidlo Kwerve entered in the midst of an argument. Crumb dropped the bowl of brain-stew on their heads, an event that caused Jabba to roar with laughter and earned Crumb a place at the crime lord's side."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
