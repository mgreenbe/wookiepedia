Unlike most other meteorites, they emitted yellow light and a small but considerable amount of heat. Garazeb Orrelios and Agent Kallus found one such rock when they were stranded on the frigid moon. Because of the previous failure of their sole heat lamp, the meteorite saved their lives. Kallus later kept it so that he could remember the experience."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
