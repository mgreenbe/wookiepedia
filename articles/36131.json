In the time following the formation of the Galactic Empire, Separatist battle droids from the Clone Wars were decommissioned and melted down at the facility. The facility was patrolled by police droids and operated by organic workers. Due to the strategic value of intelligence held by T-series tactical droids, two parties both sought to retrieve one from the facility\u2014the unit of former clone commandos known as the Bad Batch, hired by the informant Cid, and the Martez sisters, two smugglers working for a client who intended to use the tactical droid's data to fight back against the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two groups crossed paths inside the facility, initially competing to retrieve the droid's remains, though were forced to work together to fight back the police droids after the facility was placed into lockdown. They eventually managed to use the tactical droid to activate the other battle droids, allowing them to escape. Though the tactical droid's head was hit and destroyed by fire from the police droids, the clone trooper Tech had copied its information to a data rod. The Bad Batch ultimately gave the data to the Martez sisters, believing their cause was more worthy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
