As a result, a civil war erupted between the Mandalorians. By 1 BBY, Clan Kryze and the Nite Owls had joined Clan Wren, the Mandalorian Protectors represented by Fenn Rau, and members of the Rebel Alliance in combatting Clan Saxon and the Empire. Following Governor Tiber Saxon's use of the AT-DP Arc Cannon Prototype against Mandalorians and his subsequent death, Clan Eldar, Clan Vizsla, Clan Rook, and others pledged allegiance to Kryze after she was given the Darksaber and took up the title of Mand'alor. As the leader of the Mandalorians, Kryze led the newly formed Mandalorian resistance in an effort to liberate Mandalore from the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Understanding that they would be unable to control Mandalore, the Empire launched the Great Purge against the Mandalorians. Kryze and her people fought against their attempted genocide, though the Imperial campaign ultimately ended with the deaths of most Mandalorians. Several scattered groups survived, including one led by Kryze, who sought to reunite her people, reclaim the Darksaber from Imperial Moff Gideon, and retake her throne and world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
