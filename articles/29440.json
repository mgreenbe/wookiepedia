The ship was able to carry six Class-A cargo containers arranged equidistantly in arrays of two around the main ship's hull, which gave it a cargo capacity 50% greater than a BFF-1 bulk freighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to its superior hauling capacity, it provided a better degree of protection for its cargo, in the shape of three laser turrets that covered a wide arc and, under skilled control, could even shoot down incoming warheads. The ship also sported quite powerful shields for a vessel of its class."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This type of vessel was commonly found in convoys, where its armaments gave a first line of defense against raiders, and gave escort starships a valuable few seconds to launch starfighters. Its weaponry complemented the capabilities of any purely defensive craft, and gave it a useful role in amongst the undefended freighters. However, it was an unwise shipping agent that relied exclusively upon Container Transports to defend a convoy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
