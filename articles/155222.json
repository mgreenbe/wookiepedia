In 1 ABY, Bossk was hired by Dominic Raynor, the former owner of the settlement, to capture or kill Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian. Calrissian had won the city from Raynor in a game of sabacc, but the former owner accused him of cheating. Under Bossk's leadership, his party infiltrated the city and set up an ambush for Calrissian on one of the maintenance levels. Although the Baron Administrator was lured to the site and immediately came under attack by the Twi'lek and his companions, he fled the ambush through a hangar with the help of his guards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A male Twi'lek worked as a scoundrel in 1 ABY, during the Galactic Civil War. In that year, the former Cloud City Baron Administrator Dominic Raynor lost his mining settlement in a game of sabacc against the professional gambler Lando Calrissian. Raynor accused his rival of cheating and thus hired the Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk to capture or kill Calrissian as part of Raynor's revenge. With the knowledge that Calrissian would be hard to capture, Bossk contacted some mercenaries and cutthroats and invited the Twi'lek, another scoundrel of the same species, a Duros mercenary, and a Quarren assassin to join the hunt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Twi'lek and his companions planned an ambush to capture Calrissian on one of the city's maintenance level. Bossk hacked into the communications system of the city and impersonated the city's chief engineer to inform Calrissian that a primary repulsorlift pod was about to break down\u2014a failure that would destroy the entire floating settlement. In response, Calrissian went to the maintenance level to check the pod in the company of his Twi'lek bodyguard and four Bespin Wing Guards, who came along as a precautionary measure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bossk instructed his companions to stay under cover but remain in sight to lure Calrissian out. Unsure of which turbolift Calrissian would use, the Twi'lek and the others spread out into each room near the lifts. When Calrissian and his guard entered the maintenance level, a blast door was shut behind them, and the ad hoc hunting party opened fire on the Baron Administrator's guards in an attempt to kill them off quickly and capture Calrissian alive. With a long dagger, the Twi'lek attacked his opponents, who decided to hold their enemies off in order to win time for Calrissian to escape through a nearby hangar. A member of Calrissian's party sent a distress call, and another quartet of Wing Guards arrived to assist the Baron Administrator, who managed to escape from the fracas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Twi'lek appeared in Sore Loser's Revenge, a Wizards.com online roleplaying scenario written by Eric Cagle for the Star Wars Miniatures collectible tabletop strategy game in 2004. He was represented by a generic Twi'lek Scoundrel miniature figurine from the Miniatures set Rebel Storm. The survival of the character depends on the players' actions. During the game, the players control every character; one plays Calrissian's squad, and the opponent plays Bossk's squad, including the Twi'lek. There is an alternate ending to the scenario, in which the Twi'lek's party defeats the Baron Administrator's escorts and captures Calrissian. However, the short story Lando Calrissian: Idiot's Array has rendered this ending non-canonical by featuring Calrissian unharmed and free only a few days after Bossk's ambush."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
