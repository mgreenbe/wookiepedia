Shortly before a raid on the Imperial shipyards over the planet Pendari, the Alliance paid the slicer an undisclosed amount to break into the Imperial base command computer and discover the refitting schedule of the Victory-class Star Destroyer Gallant Sun. The slicer was successful, and the information obtained allowed the Rebels to know the precise time the Gallant Sun would be in space dock for repairs. As a result, the Alliance was able to destroy the Star Destroyer with minimal casualties."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The slicer was first mentioned in the roleplaying game supplement Galaxy Guide 11: Criminal Organizations, written by Rick D.
