Upon arriving, they found that the P'w'eck had apparently defected from their Ssi-ruuk masters because of the birth of the Keeramak, a Ssi-Ruu blessed with all the colors of the species. The P'w'eck claimed to have formed the P'w'eck Emancipation Movement and had allied with the Bakurans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the entire act was proved to be an elaborate plan to take over Bakura, as the P'w'eck revolt had actually been engineered by the Ssi-ruuk. Although the original movement was a ploy, Lwothin, the advance leader of the P'w'ecks, took the opportunity and fired upon the Ssi-ruuk, killing the Keeremak and saving Han and Leia's lives. This turned the tide of the battle in favor of the Bakurans and the Galactic Alliance. Thus, the Ssi-ruuvi invasions was stopped dead in its tracks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the battle, P'w'eck Emancipation Movement signed a formal treaty with the Bakuran government which formed an alliance between the two peoples. Some of the terms of the treaty included holding elections in a month, sharing all captured Ssi-ruuvi assets and supporting a liberation struggle for the P'w'ecks in the Imperium. The former Chief of State Leia Organa Solo predicted that there would be an influx of P'w'eck refugees from the Imperium within months and a possible Ssi-ruuvi invasion within a year."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
