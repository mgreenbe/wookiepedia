Although not considered as life-threatening, at least not for trandoshans, a red-pointed viper's venom causes nausea which can be cured with antidote. While hunting on Belkadan, trandoshan Qyzen Fess was bitten by a red-pointed viper which caused him sickness. He quickly approached Jedi Master Yuon Par's camp where she offered him antivenom."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The red-pointed viper was first mentioned in Qyzen Fess' bio entry in the 2012 reference guide Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
