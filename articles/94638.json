In 28 BBY, Padm\u00e9 Amidala was appointed the Senator of Naboo following the end of her tenure as the planet's Queen. When Amidala came to Coruscant to take up her position, she was assigned NON-3 as she prepared to undergo a standard six-week orientation session. Amidala quickly grew to dislike the protocol droid and used it as a target for her frustration with the customs she was required to follow during the orientation. NON-3 also had a malfunctioning vocabulator that made it difficult to understand, yet the problem was never fixed no matter how many times the droid was sent to maintenance, as Amidala was repeatedly told there was no problem."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Near the end of Amidala's orientation session, NON-3 was reprogrammed to lead her into an assassination attempt via an alleged \"private tour\" of the Senate Building's lower levels. Amidala and her handmaidens and guards, suspicious, decided to use the opportunity to test handmaiden Cord\u00e9's skills at impersonating Amidala for the first time, with the Senator accompanying her disguised in handmaiden robes. NON-3 was completely fooled by the deception, and escorted Cord\u00e9 and Amidala to an area of the Senate Building that was scheduled for demolition that day. However, Senator Bail Organa saw Amidala's speeder going below the safety limits and followed, finding the group as Amidala and Cord\u00e9 were attempting to order the droid to leave the area due to the lights being off. After the disguised Cord\u00e9 told Organa about NON-3's malfunctions, he successfully ordered the droid to report to maintenance, after which none of the members of the Naboo delegation saw it again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amidala's apparent incompetence leading her into an \"accident\" became the fodder of sensationalistic news stories. Only the first article on the incident, from a reputable source, even mentioned the malfunctioning droid in the last paragraph, as less reputable publications made Amidala out to be an idiot. Amidala and her staff suspected the vengeful Trade Federation to be behind the assassination attempt, as they were known to have an affinity with droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "NON-3 was a NON unit protocol droid. It was a stickler for protocol and repeatedly pushed Senator Amidala to attend various orientation events. However, it also had a malfunctioning vocabulator that caused the droid to slur its words, making it difficult for Amidala and her staff to understand it, which contributed to their dislike of the droid. The vocabulator was never fixed despite NON-3 being sent to maintenance multiple times.
