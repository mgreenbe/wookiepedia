Imperial construction crews built the many designs of the fortress, while they were defended by Imperial magma troopers. Imperial officers were part of the garrison as well, and the garrison deployed AT-ACTs, AT-STs, and TIE fighters for vehicle reinforcement. An Imperial-class Star Destroyer was also stationed above the fortress in Mustafar's atmosphere at one point during the construction. At this time during the castle's construction, the garrison's commander was Captain Junus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the garrison was wiped out during the Battle of Fortress Vader, it was rebuilt to continue to provide security for the fortress.

In addition to this growth, Karius had under his command a Star Destroyer-sized Interdictor-class, and standard stormtroopers provided security for Fortress Vader as well.

After the Mask of Lord Momin activated and revealed itself to Vader, construction began on the castle. During construction, a garrison was created to provide security for Fortress Vader and construction crews. During this time, the garrison defended the construction site from lava fleas, which attacked more frequently as each design of the fortress was activated and subsequently destroyed. It wasn't until the ninth design of Fortress Vader the the structure maintained its integrity when activating the locus of the Force found in the Sith cave, located beneath the fortress. While Vader activated the fortress, the garrison and castle came under attack by a Mustafarian army led by Father Kkkt, culminating in the Battle of Fortress Vader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Captain Junus recommended that the garrison evacuate, Vader joined the frontlines and belayed his orders, instead leading the garrison against the attackers while Sith Lord Darth Momin was resurrected from the past by his mask when he activated the fortress.
