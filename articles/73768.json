Originally forged by the ancient Sith Empire, the route was lost to history by the time of the Great Hyperspace War in 5000 BBY. However, the route's existence was theorized by researchers under the orders of the Sith Lord Vitiate in 4999 BBY, and the Sith exodus followed this route gradually over twenty years to escape the Republic's counterinvasion of the Sith Empire. The exodus eventually reached safety on Dromund Kaas, and under Vitiate's rule restored the Sith Empire there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
