An unknown species built the planet eons ago, forming the planet to machine-exact specifications that gave it several unique features. It had engines that powered its rotation and had heating that warmed its oceans, which produced massive amounts of radioactive particles. The particles were then siphoned off by the planet's satellite rings, and periodically expelled the material into space. This flow of particles had a high and low tide. At high tide immediately after the particles were expelled into the Chadawa system, the systems of starships could be disrupted unless they were within the rings that surrounded the planet. Even at low tide though, the particles still disrupted scanners and communication systems aboard starships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Galactic Civil War in 5 ABY, a battle took place in orbit of the planet as the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing sought to punish the world in a continuation of Operation: Cinder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chadawa appeared in the 2021 novel Victory's Price, written by Alexander Freed and published by Del Rey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
