By then, Moff Lankin had handed over the planet to his subordinate Governor Serdif Tount, providing him with stormtroopers and Army troops to keep control over the planet. Tount did so by restricting the freedom of the civilian population and their access to information, as well as by monitoring incoming traffic. Tount was believed to have hired former Imperial Security Bureau specialist Victor Grieves, because Grieves had been seen in the Rintonne system. Cracken's spies discovered that the inhabitants of Rintonne did not even know about the fall of the Empire and the creation of a New Republic. They also lacked the value to rebel against Tount because the could not see any hope of victory. However, Cracken's analysts believed that, if the New Republic could take over Rintonne, the victory could motivate other planets in the sector to rebel against Lankin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon afterward, the whole Lambda sector, including Rintonne, stopped being Lankin's personal fiefdom.
