He, alongside his commanding officer, Captain Kael, organized a resistance group against the Federation's battle droid army. Allying themselves with the influential smuggler Borvo the Hutt, Sykes and his comrades performed daring raids on the enemy territory, liberating a number of Naboo citizens from Federation mining camps. Borvo, however, betrayed the resistance, killing Kael and enslaving the Naboo people. Sykes avenged his fallen superior, liberating the Naboo and forcing Borvo to retreat to Nal Hutta. After Kael's death, Sykes briefly assumed a leadership position in his resistance cell and performed a successful raid on the Federation Camp Four, freeing its prisoners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sykes later played a crucial role in Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala's effort to retake the planet. He participated in the diversionary assault on the occupied capital city of Theed and later joined the space battle over Naboo as a member of Bravo Squadron, single-handedly taking down tractor beam generators and deflector shields protecting one of the hangar arms of the droid control ship. This allowed the young Force-sensitive Anakin Skywalker to fly his starfighter into the ship's inner structure and destroy it from within, thus deactivating the Federation's battle droids on the planet. Sykes continued to serve the Royal Naboo Security Forces for many more years, becoming a captain during the Clone Wars. During the Galactic Civil War, Sykes was assigned to the smuggling patrol, serving as a watchman in the city of Keren, while his nemesis, Borvo, returned to Naboo and settled in Moenia. During this time, Sykes employed a spacer to help him take down a Gungan smuggling gang that worked for Borvo and attempted to smuggle animal carcasses infected with a dangerous Berserker Virus to Corellia, where Borvo had hoped to develop a bioweapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gavyn Sykes was a Human male, native to the planet Naboo. Sykes spent much of his youth flying transports around Naboo, in the local system, and, on rare occasions, beyond. During his travels, he witnessed firsthand the damage smugglers and gun runners could do to society if left unchecked. In order to protect his homeworld from such criminals, Sykes volunteered for the Royal Naboo Security Forces. Once the RSF came under the command of Captain Quarsh Panaka, Sykes was quickly recognized and rewarded with an assignment to the Theed Palace security force, where he was trained to fly N-1 starfighters and quickly rose to the rank of lieutenant. Serving under Captain Kael, Sykes patrolled the secret tunnels and outskirts of the capital city of Theed. The patrolling duties honed Sykes' military skills, and whether he was driving a Flash speeder or piloting an N-1 starfighter, he defended the citizens of Naboo and his fellow officers. Among Sykes' other responsibilities was escorting diplomatic missions off-world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During one such escort mission in 32 BBY, Sykes, Kael, and Panaka, accompanied a Naboo delegation to the galactic capital of Coruscant. Once they reached the planet, however, the delegation was attacked by a mysterious starship, forcing Sykes to chase the ship through the streets of the planet in his N-1 starfighter. Ultimately, Sykes was able to drive away the attacker. Subsequent Senate investigation into the origins of the attacker turned up no results. In fact, the attacker had been Sith Lord Darth Maul in his Sith Infiltrator, who had been dispatched by his Master, Darth Sidious, to test the Naboo pilots and their craft in preparation for Sidious' upcoming invasion of Naboo."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle for Naboo"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The invasion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the events on Coruscant, the Trade Federation, secretly led by Sidious, blockaded Naboo, protesting against the Galactic Senate's taxation of trade routes to the outlying star systems. Wary of a possible invasion, Panaka ordered all RSF Flash speeders to be outfitted with their standard blaster weaponry\u2014which was usually kept dismounted\u2014as well as to load the vehicles' short-range rocket launchers. Sykes and other officers were dispatched on patrols all around Theed in order to maintain order and cover Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala's escape should that become necessary. The Federation soon indeed invaded the planet, and their droid army swept into Theed, intent on forcing Amidala to sign a treaty authorizing the Trade Federation's occupation of Naboo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sykes was on patrol in Theed at the time of the attack and was listening on the comlink as Panaka, hoping to prevent an all-out war, ordered all members of the security forces to evacuate from the city and not to engage the enemy except in self-defense. Sykes was then contacted by Kael, who informed him that he was pinned down near the Security Forces headquarters by several droidekas. Kael's Flash speeder had been damaged, and its weapons malfunctioned. Sykes quickly rescued his Captain, and the pair made their way through the city streets in an attempt to escape. They eventually found a pair of Heavy STAPs, but before they were able to utilize them, they were attacked by an Armored Assault Tank. Sykes was able to destroy the tank, however, and joined Kael in using the Heavy STAPs to escape the city. Sykes and Kael were not the only ones to escape, as a significant number of other RSF personnel also made it out of Theed thanks to Panaka's forewarning, using in their escape Flash and Gian speeders, N-X Police Cruisers, civilian transports, or simply running on foot. Meanwhile, the Queen and Panaka escaped to Coruscant with the help of two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sykes and Kael traveled through the countryside, protecting local citizens from the attacking Trade Federation battle droids on STAPs. When faced with heavy resistance from the Federation, however, Kael decided to go to the swamps, hoping to find help from local traders who lived there in a village. Sykes and Kael entered a nearby hangar and obtained two N-X Police Cruisers. They reached the village, only to find it already overwhelmed by Trade Federation forces, as the village leader Rohan Wayside tried to evacuate his people on houseboats. Sykes protected Wayside's boats from attacking Trade Federation gunboats and droid starfighters. Sykes and Kael then rescued one of the village's police officers, Vedd Deviss, who had been pinned down at the far end of the settlement. In gratitude for saving his people, Wayside told the two officers that he had heard rumors of an influential smuggler who had the ability help in their cause. The village leader then sent Deviss to show Sykes and Kael the way to the mountains, where the smuggler was supposedly located."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sykes, Kael, and Deviss soon reached the mountains, where Sykes' Police Cruiser was shot down by a droid starfighter patrol. Sykes was forced to make an emergency landing in a nearby security hangar and changed his damaged craft to a Flash speeder. As Kael and Deviss proceeded to look for the smuggler in their starfighters in the eastern passage, Sykes took the speeder to the northern passage. On his way, however, he witnessed a homestead under attack by battle droids. Sykes dispatched the attackers, and the thankful homestead owner led Sykes to a piece of technology to upgrade his vehicle. Sykes then returned to his original mission and soon found a freighter being attacked by AATs. Contacting the freighter, he discovered that it belonged to the smuggler that Sykes' resistance cell was looking for, Borvo the Hutt. Sykes rescued him from AATs, and Borvo agreed to enter an alliance with the resistance. At this moment, Kael and Deviss finally arrived and joined Sykes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Borvo then requested to be escorted to his base deep in the mountains, where he possessed an N-1 assembly site. Sykes suspected that the Hutt might be leading them into a trap, but Kael convinced him that they should take their chances with Borvo. Upon reaching another hangar, Sykes and Deviss changed their vehicles, with Sykes taking a police cruiser, while Deviss took control of a landspeeder. Navigating through the mined passages in the mountains, Sykes, Kael and Deviss escorted Borvo to his base, which was under attack by Trade Federation forces. After one of Borvo's pilots, Kol Kotha, transferred from Borvo's freighter to his own starfighter and joined the battle, Sykes and the others managed to repel the attack. With the assembly site now in their hands, Kael and Borvo planned to strike back at the Federation."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "On the offensive"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kael and Borvo's plan was to attack one of Trade Federation bases on the planet. The base, however, was controlled by a comm satellite codenamed Comm 4 in orbit of Naboo, and the resistance needed to destroy the satellite in order to disable the base's defenses. Kael, Sykes, Deviss, and Borvo's pilot Adela Tych\u00e9 boarded N-1 starfighters and took off into space, joined by Kotha in his starfighter. However, upon reaching Comm 4, the group found it protected by a powerful deflector shield, which was powered up by three slave satellites nearby. Moreover, the smaller satellites were protected by droid starfighters as well as a mine field located near each satellite. Nevertheless, Sykes and the others destroyed the slave satellites, lowering Comm 4's shield and taking down Comm 4 itself. Sykes and his comrades then headed for the deactivated Trade Federation base, where they hoped to destroy all enemy weapons and craft and to steal a Trade Federation gunboat for the resistance. Once inside the base, the five started methodically destroying everything that belonged to the Trade Federation. Shortly thereafter, however, the base was reactivated, and Sykes and the others had to fight their way to the main gunboat launch site, where Sykes traded his starfighter for a gunboat. Hoping that the enemy would take Sykes as a Neimoidian escaping from the attacked base, Kael sent the Lieutenant up the Andrevea River on a recon mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After carefully navigating through Trade Federation proximity mines laid in the water, Sykes spotted an enemy patrol craft flying overhead. Sykes panicked, but was calmed by Kael and ordered to proceed further. Sykes then reached a mining camp, where the captured Naboo were being used by the Federation as slaves. Sykes destroyed the base's defenses and power generators, liberating the prisoners, who were then picked up by Borvo's transports and evacuated. After witnessing a Trade Federation gunboat sentry blast away to another camp, Sykes feared that it might warn the enemy and chased it, destroying the sentry. Upon reaching the other camp, Sykes received a communication from Deviss, who reported that he had been sent by Kael to provide air support for Sykes. Before he was able to join the fight, however, Deviss requested that Sykes destroy all anti-aircraft turrets in the camp. After Sykes did so, Deviss made an attack run on the camp in his N-1 starfighter, destroying the power generator and liberating the slaves, who boarded several houseboats. At this point, Borvo informed the resistance that he had no more transports to spare, so Sykes and Deviss were forced to escort the prisoners by themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sykes and Deviss planned to rendezvous with Kael at a safe sanctuary at the ancient ruins near the Devils tower mountain, and they soon reached the town of Ferentina which was located on the way there. However, Ferentina was already under attack by the Trade Federation forces; the enemy collapsed a bridge, sealing the nautical way to the ruins, so the rescued civilians needed to make the rest of the journey on land. While the prisoners switched from houseboats to speeders, Sykes traded his gunboat for a starfighter, destroyed several AATs that were attacking the prisoners, and blocked the way for Trade Federation reinforcements by collapsing the entrance to a tunnel used by enemy troops to reach the town. Flying over Ferentina, Sykes rescued another group of civilians, who had been trapped by a collapsed tower, and who then joined the convoy with the prisoners. Sykes and Deviss escorted the convoy all the way to the ruins and sealed the way behind them by collapsing a rock bed, preventing the Trade Federation from following the escapees there. As Sykes and Deviss regrouped at the ruins, however, one of the resistance pilots, Lutin Hollis, appeared. Hollis said that while he and Kael had been protecting Borvo's transports, they had been ambushed, and Kael had been shot down. Certain that Kael was still alive, Sykes immediately boarded one of the Flash speeders and set off to find his Captain, with Hollis and Deviss flying cover for him."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Betrayed"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sykes, Deviss, and Hollis went separate ways, proceeding to look for Kael in different directions. Sykes soon stumbled upon Borvo's ship flying away from a mining camp under attack by AATs. Sykes repelled the attack and asked the mining camp operator about Kael's location. The operator, however, panicked and rudely ordered Sykes to leave, stating that he was performing a legal operation. The camp's defensive turrets then opened fire at Sykes, who destroyed the turrets and witnessed that several cargo transports were trying to escape. Sykes realized that Borvo used the camp to illegally mine crystals, stealing them from the Naboo. After Sykes destroyed the transports, he was contacted by Hollis, who had found Kael's downed starfighter. The Federation had located Kael, however, and began bombing the site of his crash. Sykes dispatched the bombers and reached Kael, who was gravely wounded. With his dying breath, the Captain revealed that Borvo had betrayed the resistance and enslaved the Naboo people; Borvo had also attacked Kael to cover his tracks. Angered by Kael's murder, Sykes decided to go after the Hutt, taking an N-1 starfighter. Sykes requested that Deviss locate Borvo, and the latter told him that he had spotted Borvo's ship heading for Porso Hill. On his way there, Sykes was confronted by Borvo's pilots, who attempted to turn him around. Driven by vengeance, Sykes did not comply and dispatched Borvo's men."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As he closed in on Porso Hill, Sykes was stopped by Kotha. The Lieutenant told Kotha not to try to stop him, but Kotha did not intend to. On the contrary, he, not viewing himself as a slaver, decided to join Sykes. Sykes gladly accepted his help and asked Kotha to lead him to Borvo. He then contacted Deviss and Hollis, telling them to meet him at Porso Hill. Sykes and Kotha reached Porso Hill, but Kotha received major damage to his fighter and was forced to retreat, leaving Sykes to confront the Hutt by himself. Borvo was impressed by Sykes' persistence and offered him a place in his organization, but the Lieutenant declined and Borvo ordered his fighters to attack him. Deviss and Hollis soon joined the fight, and Sykes ordered them to harass Borvo's ship with torpedoes while he took care of enemy starfighters and turrets. The two pilots, however, had run out of torpedoes, so Sykes had to take down Borvo by himself. He inflicted enough damage to the Hutt's freighter, but it turned out that the ship's cranial section could be separated, and Borvo escaped on it to Nal Hutta along with Adela Tych\u00e9. Still, the mission was a success, and Borvo's prisoners were rescued."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Kael dead, Sykes was left in charge of his resistance cell, and he decided to return to their fight against the Trade Federation; however, he had no idea where to start. Kotha, who had investigated several Trade Federation slaving camps, offered to attack one of them, Camp Four, and Sykes agreed. Sykes, Kotha and Hollis located the camp in a nearby valley and traveled there. However, Hollis, believing that his family was being kept in the camp, broke formation and flew right into a Federation installation, giving away the resistance's position. Sykes, Hollis, and Kotha evaded heavy fire, only to find local farmsteads attacked by Federation bombers. After Sykes dispatched the bombers, he located a hangar from which automated carriers delivered prisoners to Camp Four. Programming several unoccupied carriers to travel to the camp, Sykes took a Heavy STAP and followed them in. Once inside the camp, the carriers were scanned by battle droids, revealing Sykes' deception. The Lieutenant was attacked by the enemy, but with some help from Hollis and Kotha, he managed to fight off the Federation and rescued the prisoners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During another mission, Sykes flew cover for a team of Naboo commandos, who had infiltrated a Trade Federation Research Station in order to uncover the Federation's secrets.

After Sykes reached the destination and rescued Panaka from some attacking droids, the Captain ordered Sykes to take his forces and guard the south ridge of Theed while the Queen was preparing for the final battle. However, the south ridge was soon compromised as a large Federation convoy of AATs and Multi-Troop Transports moved through it. The convoy in actuality comprised Trade Federation Army C. It was headed for the Grassy Plains to assist the main Federation army, which the native Gungans\u2014hoping to draw the majority of Trade Federation forces away from Theed in order to leave it vulnerable for Amidala's attack\u2014had engaged in a battle there. Sykes soon received a distress call from Palmer\u2014an RNSF officer whom Sykes had rescued from the Federation\u2014who told him that the forces on the south ridge were under attack by Trade Federation forces. Sykes helped Palmer fight off the attack and switched to an experimental Naboo bomber, using it to destroy the convoy as it was crossing the Widow's Valley."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sykes was then chosen by Panaka to participate in a diversionary assault on Theed. Splitting into several groups, the Royal Naboo Security Forces were ordered to distract the Trade Federation forces left in Theed, allowing Amidala and Panaka to sneak into the Theed Royal Palace and capture the Federation's Viceroy, Nute Gunray. Sykes and Kotha, under the callsign Group 1, traveled through Theed, inflicting heavy damage to the Federation forces. They rescued Palmer, who had been pinned down by droids, and her Group 2. Sykes and the rest soon reached Theed's courtyard, rendezvousing there with Group 3, which included some trained commandos; the commandos blew open the gates blocking the way to the Theed Hangar. Meeting Panaka near the hangar, Sykes destroyed enemy AATs that guarded the building, and moving inside, Sykes partnered with the astromech droid R2-C4 and took an N-1 starfighter into space.

Sykes then destroyed the deflector shield and tractor beam generators protecting the entrance to one of the ship's hangar arms, allowing one of Bravo Squadron's fighters\u2014piloted by the young Force-sensitive Anakin Skywalker\u2014to fly inside the ship's structure and destroy it from within. With the control ship destroyed, all droid forces on Naboo were deactivated, and the planet was liberated. Hailed as one of the heroes of that day, Sykes then attended the victory celebration ceremony, standing beside Queen Amidala and the newly elected Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Shortly thereafter, Sykes explored the Grassy Plains, the site of the battle between the Gungans and the Federation, where he noticed a large amount of blue slime left from the Gungans' boomas."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sykes continued to serve in the Royal Naboo Security Forces and was promoted to captain during the Clone Wars. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Borvo had also returned to Naboo, settling in the city of Moenia, though Sykes kept a close eye on him and fought him on every front. In 1 ABY, Sykes worked in the RNSF's smuggling patrol as a watchman in the Kwilaan Starport in the city of Keren. During this time, the patrol managed to uncover a Gungan smuggling ring that transported animal carcasses off-world. Sykes' men captured several smugglers and confiscated the carcasses, which revealed that the animals had died of an unusual disease. However, one of the captured smugglers also revealed that the Gungan Zim Zam Blattis would try to ship more carcasses soon. Since the smuggling patrol was understaffed at the time, Sykes hired a spacer to stop Blattis, and the spacer killed the Gungan.

The normally harmless beasts suffered from some kind of a virus that drove them crazy. After learning that the smugglers were trying to capture the crazed beasts, Sykes believed that they were hoping to extract the virus to produce a bioweapon. To prevent them from doing so, Sykes once again requested the aid of the spacer, asking the individual to kill a berserk ikopi. The spacer completed the task as well, earning Sykes' gratitude. Sykes' suspicions regarding Borvo soon proved true, as it was found out that the Gungans were taking orders from Haf Mandrox, one of Borvo's lieutenants. On Sykes' request, the spacer located Mandrox and brought him in for questioning. Mandrox revealed that the animals had been infected with the Berserker Virus, which had been created by one of Borvo's scientists. The virus rewired the animals' brain to connect sensory input directly to aggression centers, making them attack everything in sight. The Gungan smugglers were planning another attempt to smuggle the carcasses to bioengineers on Corellia in order to turn the virus into a deadly bioweapon. Having come to trust the spacer, Sykes assigned his new ally to stop this from happening.

He voluntarily joined the Royal Security Forces not for the uniform, the authority, or the chance to make his family proud, but in hopes of keeping his world safe from smugglers and other criminals. Efficient and resourceful, Sykes was an expert pilot with quick reflexes, capable of skillfully handling a variety of vehicles, and he developed a particular liking for the Flash speeder, due to its great speed of over 200km/h, great responses, and computer systems that assisted the pilot. Overall, Captain Panaka found Sykes to be well trained, and Sykes was quickly recognized once Panaka attained command of the RSF. Before Panaka became the leader of the Security Forces, it had a variable reputation, but even at that time, Sykes was regarded as one of the Naboo's finest and represented the very best that the RSF could offer. Due to his desire to protect the citizens of Naboo, however, Sykes occasionally found himself sidetracked from his original mission in an effort to protect yet another homestead, and he had to be reminded by Captain Kael that they were unable to save everyone.

He had some leadership skills, managing to successfully guide his resistance group in the raid on Camp 4 after Kael's death, and eventually earning a promotion to captain. Sykes was an honest officer and did not accept bribes, refusing Borvo's offer to join him.

Simpson was grateful to be featured in Episode I, having dreamed about being in a Star Wars movie since he was a child.

The creation of Sykes' story was a team effort at Factor 5, and the deep and evolving storyline was praised upon the game's release. Sykes acted as the protagonist of the game, which covered his exploits during the Federation's occupation of Naboo and culminated with him destroying the droid control ship's shields. In Battle for Naboo, Sykes was voiced by Matt Walters, a more local actor to California's LucasArts than Simpson was back in London.
