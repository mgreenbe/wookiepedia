It was the primary planet in the Bethal System. It housed the headquarters of Bethal AgriCorp, and its main export was apocia hardwood timber. An infestation of greddleback termites caused the economy of the planet - which was based on apocia hardwood timber - to go under. Imperial Moff Tendd declared the planet a disaster world, and helped bring Imperial funds to the planet in an effort to restore the apocia. The world also diversified its crops in an effort to revive its economy while the apocia forests regrew."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
