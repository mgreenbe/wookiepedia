They resembled a mass of writhing tendrils and multiple toothy maws, quite similar to a sarlacc. The silan lived in a towering earthen structure, with animal skulls strewn about the dank and gloomy vicinity as trophies or offerings from locals. Silans were immersed in the dark side of the Force. Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi killed one of the creatures in 44 BBY, directed by the Living Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Speculation emerged during the reign of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances among experts that the Silan were descendant from the ancient soulworm; the inspiration for a variety of deities and horrors across numerous galactic civilizations.
