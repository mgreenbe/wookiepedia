In reality, she was an assassin who was trying to kill Simon Greyshade, just as she had done to many other notable politicians throughout the galaxy. She was stopped by Anakin Skywalker, Sagoro Autem and Isaru Omin and was arrested. Later, Venco Autem contacted her while she was in prison via the chip in her brain and told her to cause a diversion when he released her. Two assassin droids broke into the prison and, after killing several guards, released Tsian. It was later mentioned that Tsian was recaptured, though it cost a number of Senate Guards their lives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She had a computer chip implant within her brain that allowed her to interface with computers and droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
