Residing on Pakrik Minor, the five men took on identities as the \"Devist brothers\", each using various hairstyles and facial hair to keep from looking too similar. Carib, Dobrow, Hovarb, Sabmin, and Tabric Devist began careers as farmers, marrying local women and having children by them and building an identity as a tight-knit farming family.
