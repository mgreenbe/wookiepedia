BB-8 was in the company of stormtrooper deserter Finn, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and a scavenger named Rey, who sought to return the droid, and thus the map, to the Resistance led by General Leia Organa. In order to have the droid delivered to General Organa, the four stopped at the castle of Maz Kanata on Takodana. At the castle, both a Resistance spy and a First Order informant identified BB-8 and informed their respective allies, drawing both forces to Takodana to recover BB-8 and the map."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the battle, Maz Kanata's castle was attacked by Kylo Ren and First Order stormtroopers after they discovered that the droid BB-8 was at the castle. Flying in with TIE/fo space superiority fighters and Atmospheric Assault Landers, the First Order swiftly laid siege to the castle and leveled it, killing many of its inhabitants. BB-8 followed Rey into the forests surrounding the castle, and the First Order was unable to locate the droid until a stormtrooper officer reported to Ren that the droid had been sighted in the company of a girl. Ren deployed stormtroopers to the woods before heading into the woods himself, hunting Rey down and eventually finding her. Frightened, Rey attempted to shoot him, but Ren reacted quickly. He deflected her blasts with his lightsaber, and proceeded to disarm his target with the Force. Ren proceeded to corner and capture her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the surviving denizens of the castle attempted to defend themselves throughout the ruin, stormtroopers surrounded and overran them as fighters delivered fire from above. During the fighting at the castle, FN-2199 in riot control gear called out to Finn. He called the former trooper a traitor and challenged him to a fight. The two fought down throughout the castles rubble, and the stormtrooper eventually overpowered Finn. FN-2199 was stopped from killed Finn however, when he was shot by Han Solo. Despite killing multiple stormtroopers, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Finn were forced to surrender as full attention was placed on them when the last of the castle residents had been dealt with. The stormtroopers had bigger problems to worry about however, as Resistance T-70 X-wing starfighters led by Commander Poe Dameron soon arrived to fight the First Order. A fierce dogfight ensued and resulted in the destruction of many First Order TIEs and the deaths of many stormtroopers from X-wing strafing runs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back in the woods, Kylo Ren was notified of the Resistance attack by another stormtrooper officer, who asked him to call in more troops. Ren, however, ordered the First Order divison to pull out, saying they had what they came for. As the battle raged on above the castle, the remaining First Order troops boarded their ships and withdrew, taking the captured and unconscious Rey along with them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the battle concluded, the denizens of Kanata's castle had been wiped out and the stormtroopers had suffered heavy casualties from the Resistance starfighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
