They were commonly in use c. 4000 BBY, but had been replaced by the first models of the standard blaster by 3956 BBY. By the time of the Rise of the Empire era these weapons were virtually extinct and considered archaic, however they were still used in the Outer Rim Territories and in Wild Space, particularly on backwater worlds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pulse-wave blasters operated with similar principles to a regular blaster, firing small packets of coherent energy at a target. The energy dissipated as it moved away from the weapon making it largely unsuited for long ranged engagements. This weapon, however, created a spatial distortion when fired, which altered atomic make-up and was thus deadly at close range. This effect was much like that of disruptor weapons, making even the most ancient of models that existed in the modern era illegal. Despite this, pulse-wave blasters were generally less powerful than their blaster successors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The standard pulse-wave pistol cost 200 credits.
