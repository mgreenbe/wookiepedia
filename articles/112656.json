In some cases, the Force user could search a target's memories for specific information. It was easier to use on individuals who were close to the Force user emotionally, and some individuals, such as other Force users, could actively resist the technique. The power could be used against creatures as well, although using it against individuals of a different species sometimes resulted in a difficulty to interpret information if the species processed emotions differently."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
