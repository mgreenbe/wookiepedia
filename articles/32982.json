It had been designed to fire a single planet-destroying superlaser powered by massive kyber crystals which would destroy any planet targeted. It was the pet project of Emperor Palpatine, Director Orson Callan Krennic, and its eventual commander Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin to expound the military philosophy of the aptly named Tarkin Doctrine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some of the earliest plans for a mobile, planet-destroying superweapon dated back millennia to the ancient Sith. Thousands of years later, shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, the Geonosians, aligned with Count Dooku and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, designed the Ultimate Weapon in secret. After the fall of the Confederacy, construction of the Death Star was appropriated by the nascent Empire. It was built in orbit of Geonosis and supported by a complex logistical network of bases. The station, which took many years longer to complete than expected, was eventually moved from Geonosis to Scarif in its final stages of construction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Alliance to Restore the Republic learned of its existence, rogue operatives Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor led a mission to steal the Death Star plans, which the Rebellion against the Empire eventually joined, realizing it was essential for its survival. These plans were ultimately transmitted to Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan aboard the Tantive IV, before her capture and demonstration of the weapon's capabilities on her home planet. After a daring rescue, Organa got the plans to the Rebel base on Yavin 4, from which the Alliance launched the Battle of Yavin with a small squadron of starfighters. The original station was destroyed by a shot fired by Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker with the aid of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The destruction of the Death Star weakened the Imperial Military, and Rebel assaults on Imperial installations prompted the construction of a second Death Star, both as a sign of defiance and technological terror.

A large, concave dish in the northern hemisphere made up the superlaser emitter. The station's command bridge, the Overbridge, was located above the dish of the station's superlaser, within the Northern Polar Command Sector. The war room featured designated posts for Tarkin and other officers, a HoloNet booth for communicating with the Emperor, and large banks of viewscreens. Beside the bridge was the Death Star conference room, inbuilt with a circular table and twelve seats for high-ranking Imperial officers. The Emperor's tower and its throne room also fell within the Command Sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The station's equator comprised numerous docking ports of various sizes, all supported by the extraordinarily powerful tractor beam generator tower,[source?] which utilized several tractor-beam projectors and tractor-beam focusing shafts.

Unused stories in the station's lower levels held backup weapons operators in the event of an emergency. Levels in the station's southern hemisphere extended downward through armories, deep storage, and a southern command sector. Massive girders provided grid-like support to the lower levels. Cranes and other abandoned construction material could still be found within the station by the time of its destruction in 0 BBY. With the exception of the crust, the station's entire interior space was uninhabited, and housed the hypermatter reactor, hyperdrive, 123 Kuat Drive Yards sublight engines, and the station's superweapon. The station's outer hull was made of quadanium steel plates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Death Star featured an entirely man-made atmosphere. A vast, central cylindrical atmosphere-processing unit ensured the air inside the station was regulated.[source?] Several modular artificial atmosphere stations and water-recycling tanks were dotted throughout the station's levels for the creation of air and humidity. Several large, cavernous airways served as means for circulation and as an emergency air dump in case of atmosphere contamination. A large, central airway existed for each sector.

The hypermatter reactor at the center of the station fed energy into the various components of the superlaser, including the primary power amplifier, the superlaser power cell, the firing field amplifier, and the induction hyperphase generators. When firing, the energy was redirected into eight tributary beam shafts located around the perimeter of the superlaser, producing lasers that were converged using focusing coils,[source?] forming one large beam powerful enough to destroy a planet. If the firing-chamber arrays were not precisely aligned, the crystals would burn out and overload, sending dangerous levels of waste heat back into the Death Star's main reactor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to the Death Star's superlaser, its surface was peppered with 15,000 turbolaser batteries along with 768 tractor beam emplacements. As the station's defenses, these were installed in order to repel a large-scale fleet attack, rather than fend off individual starfighters, which the Empire viewed as no real threat. Shield projectors and communications arrays were distributed across the armored surface, analogous to colonies. A network of security stations were situated around the entire circumference and were equipped with holographic maps of the local region of space."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Complement"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For space-based offense and defense, the battle station contained numerous TIE fighters, which frequently patrolled the space surrounding the station. Due to the Death Star's enormous size, it had a heavy gravitational pull, which forced TIE fighter pilots to adjust their ships' thrusters for the kind of takeoff more common within a planetary atmosphere than on a space station. TIE staging areas had twenty TIE craft ready at any time for immediate takeoff."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle station housed 342,953 members of the Imperial Army and Navy, 25,984 stormtroopers, and nearly 2 million personnel of varying combat eligibility. Furthermore, although there were communal barracks, there also were enough private bunks that most people could expect to receive one within three to six months after arrival. While enlisted personnel used walkways or turbolifts that could move both vertically and horizontally, officers had access to a high-speed, officer-only shuttle system that orbited the station. Massive housing blocks for enlisted personnel featured a large atrium for off-duty personnel to walk in. Officers could expect their own exclusive accommodations. Life-support modules inhabited by workers during the original construction of the Death Star could still be used in an emergency. The station featured several hospital wings. Several color-coded life-support modules existed in the station's lower levels: gray for workers, red for overseers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meant to function as a world of its own, the Death Star had creature comforts most other Imperial Military postings did not: decent food, recreation areas, cantinas with latest-model bartender droids, and commissaries with selections of expensive treats and luxuries.

The reactor was connected to various components in the station, such as the superlaser, the power diversion solenoid, and the station's enormous power cells. The Death Star's tractor beam generator was also coupled to the main reactor through seven power generator terminals located throughout the station. Above the reactor were vast water tanks.[source?] The power of the Death Star's superlaser could be controlled depending on how many reactor ignitions were used to power it.

With the Emperor freed from needing to portray this, he and his Sith apprentice, Darth Vader, would have devoted themselves to what Palpatine dubbed \"more pressing matters\" which had little to do with his Empire and that only the two of them could investigate.

The project that would be the DS-1 originated on Geonosis, and plans for what the Geonosians dubbed as the Ultimate Weapon project were given to Dooku, publicly the leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and secretly the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus, by Archduke Poggle the Lesser for safekeeping during the First Battle of Geonosis, in the waning decades of the Galactic Republic. Shortly after the battle, Dooku presented his Sith Master, Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, and publicly Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic Sheev Palpatine, and used the ploy that the Separatists were building their own superweapon, frightening Republic officials and allowing Palpatine to direct full funding towards secretly creating the station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The massive project was funded by a conglomerate of factions, including the Trade Federation, Muunilinst Banking Clan, the Techno Union, and covertly, the Republic itself. During later Republic interrogation, Geonosian leader Poggle the Lesser claimed that the schematics were merely presented to them by Dooku and that the Geonosians had simply refined them. Furthermore, he admitted that the Stalgasin hive hadn't had time to design the station's main weapon before the Battle of Geonosis interrupted development. Its design, centered on a superlaser array using massive kyber crystals, was inspired by technology developed by the ancient Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 21 BBY, the Republic Special Weapons Group developed plans for both an automated battlemoon asteroid and a torpedo siege platform, neither of which made it past the design stage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Those privy to top-secret intel concluded that the plans for the Death Star must have fallen into Republic hands during or shortly after the Second Battle of Geonosis in the same year, with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine presenting the plans to the Republic Strategic Advisory Cell shortly after the battle in the cell's second briefing. The Strategic Advisory Cell planned the construction of the Death Star and regularly met at the summit of the Strategic Planning Amphitheater of the Republic Center for Military Operations on Coruscant. There, a mixed-species gathering of 150 beings from prestigious and influential positions met to discuss progress on the battle station. The meetings included select senators; representatives from Corellian Engineering, Kuat Drive Yards, and Rendili StarDrive; key advisers; the chief of naval intelligence; the director of COMPOR; high-ranking members of the military; members of the War Production Board; structural engineers; starship designers; theoretical and experimental physicists; Dr. Gubacher; Prof. Sahali; Lieutenant Commander Orson Krennic; Vice Chancellor Mas Amedda; and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. The Jedi were not invited to the meetings, nor did they even know about the project under construction over Geonosis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All members involved in the construction of the battle station were required to sign the Official Secrets Oath. Near-unlimited funding was provided to the project owing to Republic fears that the Separatists had their own battle station under construction, which intelligence surmised was the reason Count Dooku failed to attack the station over Geonosis. Geonosian Leader Poggle the Lesser maintained his position that the Separatists had no project of their own in the works. Despite this, most cell members refused to take Poggle at his word and scoured the galaxy to locate the presumed construction site. While the evidence was specious, rejecting the possibility would have jeopardized Republic funding for the project, regardless of the authority ceded to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine by the Emergency Powers Act. Thus, Republic effort into constructing the battle station was viewed as a priority in order to beat the Separatists at their supposed own."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Funding for the project would have been viewed as spurious before the Clone Wars. However, as the war dragged on, more and more research firms were dragged into government contracts focusing on a different aspect of the space station, such as in shielding or power supply, and all unaware of what their research was ultimately for. Researchers involved in defense projects were required to sign the Official Secrets Oath."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Initial construction on the Death Star had been carried out by newly designed machines, some of which were controlled by sentient operators stationed in orbital command habitats. A vast array of ships provided the station with metals, organic materials, and supplies of water. Viable asteroids were towed and tractor-beamed to the station from both around the planet and from fields surrounding the Geonosis system. Once mined, ores were sent to foundries in synchronous orbit for the production of durasteel and other metals. Cannibalized droid factories built by Baktoid Armor on Geonosis's surface allowed additional foundries to go online soon after the start of asteroid mining."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 21 BBY, after the Second Battle of Geonosis and before the first anniversary of the First Battle of Geonosis, the Strategic Advisory Cell announced the completion of phase one of the Death Star's construction. The supports for the station's superstructure at one hundred and sixty kilometers from pole to pole had been completed. The next phase of construction revolved around the fabrication of a temporary equator, along with a series of longitudinal bands to roughly form the sphere. As the bands were secured, construction of the hull commenced, along with the partitioning of individual interior sections. The cabin spaces were to be clad, sealed, and pressurized in order to permit the use of sentient laborers in addition to droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Initial sentient labor estimates were in the millions. A Strategic Advisory Cell subcommittee considered providing the Kaminoans with a template to grow a labor force of clones adapted for deep-space work. Orson Krennic independently negotiated a deal with Poggle the Lesser: in return for his cooperation with the Republic, he would have his Geonosian workers begin construction on the facility. Instead of being punished, Krennic was given greater oversight over the project by Mas Amedda. After several months, workers had completed the station's false equator, with what Krennic described as looking like \"an antique gyroscope\" rather than an actual sphere. Following this achievement, several degrees of the upper hemisphere were outfitted with latitudinal structural members, and rudimentary layout work had begun on cladding a portion of the curved hull. Construction droids devoted themselves to fashioning the first interior spaces meant to serve as placeholders until actual cabin spaces could be bulkheaded. The Geonosians were the first organics planned to inhabit the life-support modules. In the wake of Poggle's announcement of the project to the Geonosians, tens of thousands of drones had been transferred to Orbital Foundry 7, the second-largest structure in view from the command habitat. The drones oversaw the construction of enormous pie-slice-shaped concavities that, when assembled, would form the battle station's focusing dish and power well. By this time, three slices had been completed, and another six were in various stages of completion. The drone laborers were overseen by winged soldiers, loyal to castes overseen by Poggle, who had a lavish suite linked by a series of tubular connectors to the foundry."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The plan for assembling the station's dish called for assembling it in space and maneuvering it by tug and tractor beam into a gargantuan well that had been framed into the sphere's upper hemisphere\u2014the dimple, as some called it. The parabolic dish was engineered to telescope away from the hull to facilitate aiming the early composite-beam proton superlaser design some of the Special Weapons Group scientists had proposed. Because design on the weapon had been incomplete by the time construction had started, most individuals involved in the project held the notion that function would have to follow form. Orson Krennic was placed in charge of the construction, assembly, and installation of the dish."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result of his cooperation, Poggle was allowed a ship to travel between Geonosis and the station. Poggle's production philosophy revolved around forcing the drones to perform work that was beneath their skill or caste level as a means of increasing their final output. As a result, the drones were unhappy with their situation. Weeks later, the last of the pie-slice dish modules had been fabricated, but the dish itself was not fully assembled and the upper hemisphere still undergoing finishing touches. Droid work fashioning cabinspaces in the pole region had proceeded slower than expected. During this time, Geonosians began dying off en masse because they lacked work\u2014a unique physiological trait of the Geonosian species. Poggle insisted that this provided competition and adequate motivation for the laborers to work harder. Marines were required to exterminate workers that refused to follow orders. By 19 BBY, the Geonosian labor force engaged in a full-scale riot, destroying three months of work in the process. During this time, the battle station's parabolic focusing dish was nearing assembly, hull cladding had been added, and interior spaces had been bulkheaded and made habitable. Living conditions for the drones had been improved, and every attempt made to limit overcrowding. In reality, the riot was a diversion to allow Archduke Poggle the Lesser to escape aboard his small craft, which had a hyperdrive secretly installed by his drones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kyber crystals were scoured from across the galaxy in order to construct the station, with the Separatist Alliance doing so by the end of the Clone Wars.

Access to Geonosis was restricted to an inner circle of Imperial scientists and engineers, and very few members of the Imperial hierarchy even knew about the project. A highly secure supply line with various false routes and outposts was developed to ensure further secrecy, and it was during that time that the battle station was given the official name of Death Star and given the hull designation of DS-1, though the early codename, Stardust was still used in design files. Tiaan Jerjerrod, an architect and starship designer from Tinnel IV, was enlisted to help build the megaweapon.

Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit opined that the Death Star might be able to serve for five, ten or even fifty years.

By this time, the focusing dish had been successfully installed. Orson Krennic believed that he was kept off the elite passenger list due to Poggle's recent escape under his supervision. Both Wilhuff Tarkin and Orson Krennic wished to attain control over the entire Death Star project. To further his interests, Krennic had been manipulating his longtime friend Galen Erso since the Clone Wars. By bringing him aboard Project Celestial Power, an Imperial research division dedicated to weaponizing Galen's kyber crystal research, Krennic believed he would be given oversight over the Death Star and promoted to rear admiral. During this time, Krennic began appropriating legacy worlds\u2014worlds legally exempt from exploitation\u2014by using independent contractor Has Obitt to drop off weapons and war materi\u00e9l on the worlds of Samovar, Wadi Rafa, and others for their reserves of doonium and dolovite.

Consequently, Tarkin planned to use Krennic as a convenient scapegoat for every construction delay and issue that was bound to plague the project, well aware that the Emperor was eyeing them both for a promotion. To avoid accepting the privilege prematurely, Tarkin continued to defer to Krennic until the proper time arose to oust him. Krennic also planned to keep Tarkin occupied.

The superlaser was fired by a kyber crystal-assisted twin laser array carefully assembled and calibrated on Hypori, and installed on an Imperial-class Star Destroyer appropriated by the Special Weapons Group. Grand Vizier Mas Amedda wished the test firing to occur closer to the Core, but Krennic urged caution, knowing that a misfire would most likely result in the destruction of the ship.

Almost all research divisions relied on research conducted by Galen Erso, who had an intricate knowledge of crystallography. Galen believed that his research was intended to repair worlds devastated by the Clone Wars by providing inexpensive power to civilian populations. Eventually, Galen, suspicious at the lack of information provided to him by Krennic regarding the implementation of his research, discovered that his work was being weaponized without his knowledge.

The Empire utilized construction modules operated by Wookiee slave laborers and various other species to complete the project. Several manufacturing facilities, such as those on Riosa, were commandeered by the Empire, with their workers pushed to the brink to manufacture components for the battle station. Most of the construction work on the station was done in micro-g, while omni-directional boosters supplied standard gravity to a large cabinspace near the surface of the station that would eventually become the Overbridge. The epicenter of a throng of construction droids, the station was guarded by four Star Destroyers and twice as many frigates and hovered in a fixed orbit above the planet.

Such stations were overseen by Sentinel Base, an expansive garrison base initially deployed from a Victory-class Star Destroyer. Supervision of this clandestine project was entrusted to Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit. However, Wilhuff Tarkin replaced Rancit at some point following the Antar Atrocity, with Palpatine attempting to shield Tarkin from the political fallout exhumed by the operation.

Using minimal power of the superlaser, the order was carried out and Jedha City, along with miles of surrounding terrain were destroyed, including the hideout of Saw Gerrera's extremist group. However, Jyn Erso saw a message from her father, the scientist Galen Erso, that the Death Star had a fatal flaw which he installed, and she and her companions delivered the news to the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Unable to reach a consensus on how to respond to this new threat, the squad team, Rogue One, infiltrated Scarif to steal the plans, which were transferred before the Death Star was used to destroy the Imperial base. With the mission a success, the technical readouts of the battle station were received by Imperial senator and rebel sympathizer Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, who intended to pass them along to her allies. However, before she could do so, the blockade runner she was aboard was intercepted by Imperial forces commanded by Darth Vader, and she was captured, but not before she passed the plans to the astromech droid R2-D2 and sent him in an escape pod to the planet below."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a high-value prisoner, Organa was moved to Cell 2187 of Detention Block AA-23, sub-level five, where she was interrogated in order to learn the location of the Rebellion's secret base. Faced with her considerable resistance to Imperial interrogation techniques, Tarkin opted to try a different approach: intimidation. In a move calculated to force Organa to reveal the Rebel base, Tarkin threatened to use the station's primary weapon to destroy her homeworld. Though she ostensibly relented and supplied the Rebel base's location as Dantooine, Tarkin ordered the attack to move forward in order to demonstrate the military power that the Empire now held. In a matter of moments, the Death Star destroyed the planet Alderaan, leaving no survivors. Nearly all forces on the Death Star were ordered to witness the destruction, including Iden Versio, a Senior Lieutenant in the Imperial Navy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Immediately after the planet's destruction, the Star Destroyer Devastator left the station, and a small Imperial force was sent to investigate Leia's claim under the command of General Cassio Tagge. Upon arrival in the system, however, it was discovered that the base was abandoned.

With R2-D2 having supplied them with the technical readouts of the Death Star, the Rebels identified a weakness in the station's design and prepared their starfighters for a desperate attempt to destroy the station before it could bring its weapon to bear on Yavin 4. The plan, as explained by Alliance tactician Jan Dodonna, called for the firing of proton torpedoes down a two-meter-wide thermal exhaust port in the station's meridian trench. The shaft led straight to the station's main reactor, where the flaw left by Galen Erso would start a chain reaction that could destroy the station. Owing to the Death Star's design philosophy focusing on defense against large-scale attacks, the exhaust port was relatively unguarded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the battle initially appeared in the Alliance's favor owing to the small size of the Rebel ships\u2014granting them the ability to dodge turbolaser fire\u2014the launch of numerous TIE fighters under the personal command of Lord Vader in his TIE Advanced x1 destroyed the majority of the Rebel vessels, but ultimately one proved successful. Piloted by Tatooine native Luke Skywalker, his T-65B X-wing starfighter managed to fire a pair of proton torpedoes down the thermal exhaust port.

In addition, Lord Vader would send pieces of Alderaan as state gifts to seditious worlds needing to be disciplined."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite attempts to devalue the Rebel victory, Imperial statisticians noted a predictable increase in pirate and dissident activity following the loss of such a prestigious weapon. Seeking to punish those responsible for the station's destruction, the Emperor began a culling at the highest ranks of the Empire, executing officials such as Moff Coovern and Minister Khemt, believing that their incompetence was partly to blame for the station's annihilation. As a result, General Cassio Tagge was promoted to the newly created rank of Grand General and given the majority of the powers Tarkin once held, mainly due to his ability to question the invulnerability of the battle station. To Tagge, the Death Star project had been misguided from the start. A strong proponent of the Imperial Navy, Tagge believed that future plans could not be based around an individual asset such as the Death Star, but should instead utilize those assets as a force multiplier, not as a be-all end-all solution to a problem. The Emperor placed his trust in Tagge's new strategy until the second Death Star could be completed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 5 ABY, debris from the Death Star that was collected by the New Republic was given to the Alderaan Flotilla as a gift from Princess Leia Organa to use to build a space station over the ruins of Alderaan.
