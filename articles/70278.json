As governor of Dolla, Jedselk used his influence to smooth over any local unrest caused by Cex's actions while pursuing bounties."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Galaxy Guide 10: Bounty Hunters, Jedselk is described as being \"recently promoted to the governorship of Dolla\". It was unclear as to whether this referred to a star system named Dolla, or merely a planet by the same name. As a result, it remains unclear as to whether Jedselk was promoted to the position of governor over an entire system, or merely to a planetary governorship of a more prominent planet. When The Essential Atlas was published, the existence of the Dolla system was verified, though whether a planet named Dolla exists in the system is still open to conjecture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
