Wong told StarWars.com, \"I think Aphra is a delight. She's out for herself, for fun and profit, and that drives her actions more than any internal moral compass. It makes her really fun to write!\" Wong also enjoys how Aphra's creator Kieron Gillen gave her emotional complexity, and prior writer Si Spurrier made her face the consequences of her actions. As described by Wong, she is \"one queer Asian disaster\" writing another, and she finds that deeply satisfying."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Published works"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
