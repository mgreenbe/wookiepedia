On both ventral and dorsal sides, the ship was bristling with batteries of weapons. On the dorsal side, a central ridge extended to the aft, which supported the vessel's conning tower. Like Imperial Star Destroyers, the Assertor featured a similarly-designed conning tower with two deflector shield bulbs, as well as a large reactor bulge on the ventral side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial Era, the Assertor was part of a battle group in an area of space near a bluish-green celestial body and a smaller, grey astronomical object.
