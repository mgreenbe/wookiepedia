The Rite of Fira required the initiate to swim to the wreck of the kolto harvester destroyed by Revan in the Hrakert Rift in 3956 BBY. After removing a piece of cortosis from its hull plating, the initiate then used the heat from volcanic vents on the ocean floor to craft the cortosis into a fira \u2014 a curved, lightsaber-resistant sword, which members of the Order used to defend themselves against possible threats."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
