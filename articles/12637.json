It was invented at Calcoraan Depot. Significantly more powerful than baradium bisulfate, it was kept in canisters with an outer shell of an unknown toxic coolant which would produce violent irrational psychotic impulses in anyone exposed to it. For this reason, people who transported such an explosive were required to wear hazmat suits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Count Denetrius Vidian had a massive storage of 357 in Calcoraan Depot, which he intended to use to destroy Cynda with a falsified plan to harvest the moon's thorilide-rich core.
