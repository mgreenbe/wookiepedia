The city was full of revelers of the Portage Moon Festival, and the disaster would be blamed on racist Aquala extremists by pre-planted evidence. All of this would be in the Empire's benefit and in exchange, she was to be given complete control of Ando's oceans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The plan was foiled however, when Sissalik took control of the Nanda's Luck and instead, rammed it on the Majestic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
