They held an unyielding honor code, a deep commitment to their families, and a traditional distrust of outsiders. Schenor grouped themselves in social units known as nest-guilds, led by a nest-guildmaster. Their society was highly stratified, with Schenor nobility maintaining great power over the servile peasant and middle classes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Schenor's technology was advanced enough to create reaction cars. Those cars were large, noisy, and inefficient ground-effect vehicles that were fast and powerful, but not particularly safe or nimble.

The Schenor had maintained neutrality during the Galactic Civil War, avoiding allying with either the Empire or the Rebellion, although they eventually allowed the Empire to begin construction of a base on their homeworld. However, at some point between the Evacuation of Yavin and the Battle of Endor, a research station operated by the Schenor came under attack by a heterogeneous group of mercenaries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A team of Rebel agents responded to the station's distress call, only to find an ongoing massacre of station personnel. After a spirited firefight, an Imperial gunboat pinned down the Rebels and collected the mercenaries, leaving before the Rebels could track it. Inside the facility, they found only a single survivor of the dozens of Schenor stationed there, a juvenile named A'kazz."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel team delivered A'kazz to a nearby Alliance base, where Commander Luke Skywalker questioned the Schenor hatchling privately. Believing A'kazz's condition would lead the Schenor to side with the Rebellion, Skywalker directed the Rebel agents to return the young Schenor to his nest-guild. The agents landed at the spaceport of Chafflock on Rhamsis Callo and departed there by reaction car, avoiding being waylaid by local Imperial forces assigned to the partially-completed base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel agents delivered A'kazz to B'karitz, the nest-guildmaster of A'kazz's nest-guild and a figure of influence in a powerful Callo province. Initially suspicious of the agents, B'karitz soon discerned that they were not seeking ransom for the hatchling and questioned the youth in a telepathic trance. B'karitz was appalled to learn of the trauma inflicted on A'kazz and vowed to break the Empire's treaty with his people and drive them from the world. B'karitz, his nest-warriors, and the agents went to the Imperial base, where B'karitz declared to the Imperial ambassador that the treaty was null and void and that the Imperials must leave. The Imperials pretended to cooperate, but only long enough for a detachment of troopers to surround the group and attack. The besieged group was able to break through the encircling forces and make their way to the Rebels' ship, from which B'karitz was able to summon aid from other Schenor nobles. The Imperials attempted to flee, but the Rebels were able to disable and board the ambassador's cruiser, returning the ambassador to the planet for local judicial action."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Schenor appear in \"The Silent Witness,\" an adventure idea from the first edition of Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.
