Several rail speeders were present on the moon Zardossa Stix, and were able to transport individuals from Zardossa Stix Port to the Temple of Malmourral. These rail speeders were used by members of the Frangawl Cult in 19 BBY to take their captive Queen Julia to the Temple in order to be sacrificed to Malmourral. The speeders were used to escape Jedi Master Mace Windu and Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks, the cultists' pursuers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
