They were mined in the Lowick asteroid belt in the Pa'Lowick system. They were deep red in color and glowed due to the internal molecular vibration of the gem. They were typically between four and six centimeters in size, with smooth rounded edges."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War the Empire conducted experiments with Firegems to use them as high-energy power sources. The Pa'lowick system was quarantined and a task force of Star Destroyers and Imperial Customs cruisers patrolled the region to keep out trespassers. They also would detonate to high levels of radiation found in starship reactor cores, making them highly dangerous. This led them to be used to sabotage the engines of starships. The firegem would be smuggled on-board in a radiation-proof magnetic field and inserted in the reactor injector module. When the ship made the jump to hyperspace, the field would break down and expose the firegem to intense radiation. The exposure would create a harmonic resonance inside the firegem and cause an explosion. According to entries in Gundark's Gear Datalog by Yideg and Kollan, the firegems were easier to find after the Galactic Civil War but the NRI and Sector Rangers had raised the threat level of the firegems and were working on new scanning technologies to detect them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
