Unlike many other pure clone or conscripted forces, this division was very mixed in its personnel, meaning it had both clone troopers and other species in the division. The 44th had distinguished actions on multiple fronts including Bassadro, Ando, Atraken and many others."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
