The origin of this joke is that Tom Veitch, author of several Star Wars comic series, was once asked, \"What is that buzzing noise in the background of A New Hope?,\" to which he replied, \"The Nevoota Bee\"\u2014in reality, the noise was likely caused by a bad copy of the film. Unconnected to that discussion, Rich Handley, author of several Star Wars articles, made an April Fools' joke on rec.arts.sf.starwars.misc, announcing a sequel to Veitch's Star Wars: Empire's End comic series involving Emperor Palpatine being reborn in an insane clone of Chewbacca, named Palbacca. The final step in the joke occurred when Mike Beidler, author of the Star Wars Literature Compendium fansite, combined Veitch's and Handley's quips and listed the \"Scourge of the Nevoota Bee\" trilogy as a publication on his website. The fictitious trilogy of novels and accompanying fifty-part comic series was purported to be written by Veitch and Beidler, with audiobook adaptations read by Handley. The joke has since continued to circulate among the Star Wars online fan community."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
