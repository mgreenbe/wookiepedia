She had the bearing of someone who did not make concessions often. A young man belonging to the Great Canyon Clan named Vilas was secretly in love with her, but she either did not know or did not care."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Garowyn was incredibly proud of her status as the pilot of the Shadow Chaser, which she used to deliver supplies to the Great Canyon Clan and ferry new recruits to the Shadow Academy. She would often expound upon the many features of the ship, treating Shadow Academy recruits to personal tours of the state-of-the-art craft. She used the time afforded by the transit through hyperspace to test those who had been selected by the clan to go to the space station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On one particularly eventful day, Garowyn made her usual supply run to Dathomir and after unloading her cargo picked up two new recruits: a young warrior-woman and her slave, a middle-aged man."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "En route to the Shadow Academy, Garowyn decided to test the new students.

Her loss was remarked on by Tamith Kai."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
