The HR-211 went through several upgrades with the first version of the suit only able to protect the wearer from low levels of radiation and heat. This first incarnation was also only able to provide protection for one hour. The HR-211 was eventually upgraded to allow protection from higher levels of radiation and allow for long time use. Unfortunately, the suit would make the user uncomfortably warm. This side effect could be overcome by modifying the suit with myoflex to cover the main temperature sensor causing the cooling unit to be fooled into running more. This technique was first developed by a man named Hogar to make the suit more comfortable to wear."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
