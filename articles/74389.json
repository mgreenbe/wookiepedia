It included parts of the Halla, Kastolar, Lantillian, Mytaranor, Taldot, Terr'skiar and Trax sectors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bordering Hutt Space and the Bothan sector, it encompassed the major trade worlds of Lantillies, Kashyyyk, Bimmisaari, Rorgam and Randon, and was the home of the powerful Wookiees, Bimms and Saurin. Over the millennia, the Kashyyyk system's strategic value resulted in numerous battles and constant intrigue by the agents of various galactic powers, in their attempt to acquire the secret of the Wookiees' private hyperspace routes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The region itself was an arena for competition between various species and power blocs. Several outside powers have long jockeyed for influence in the region, including the Hutts who had interests in it for millennia and the Bothans and Lanniks who long worked to keep the power of the Hutt kajidics in check. It was a region with an unstable mix of legal and illegal commerce. Billions of credits flowed into legitimate investments in the region's giant agriworlds and industrial powerhouses, while the agents of ruthless slave rings prowled its space lanes. Within the Kashyyyk Region were tens of thousands of inhabited worlds, and millions of uninhabited systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
