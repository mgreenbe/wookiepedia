The MD medical specialists were a common sight throughout the galaxy, and while not as advanced as the 2-1B, the MDs were highly respected on medical centers of less-civilized planets, where their low cost and high levels of specialization on specific medical fields were a big help for local physicians. They were also liked for their lower prices, as a standard unit would normally cost around 2,000 credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fact that most MD units were kept in clean medical bays meant that the droids did not need a lot of maintenance, and if proper care was provided they could last for centuries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The series had different models that were identified with numbers ranging from the MD-0 up to the MD-10.
