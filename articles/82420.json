During the War on Shu-Torun, a combat drill carrying the Sith Lord Darth Vader veered of course away from the Shu-Torun Loyalist/Imperial Delving Fleet and into a seam of lithoporoite due to sabotage by his supposed ally Doctor Cylo. The drill dropped through the seam into a cavern below where troops loyal to the rebellious ore-dukes ambushed Vader and his men. The drill's course into the lithoporoite seam was reported to the loyalist Queen Trios by Chamberlain Jooli, and knowing that the lithoporoite could never support the weight of a full combat drill, Trios assumed Vader and his men were lost. The Sith managed to survive however, and eventually managed to have his drill exit the seam to rejoin the fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lithoporoite first appeared in the 2016 comic book Darth Vader 18, which was written by Kieron Gillen and illustrated by Salvador Larroca."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
