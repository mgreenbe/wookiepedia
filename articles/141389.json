They were green-skinned humanoids with small patches of green hair at the top of their heads. Due to their proud nature they rebelled against the Galactic Empire when it became active in the Iskalon system where they lived. The Empire responded quickly to this unrest due to the actions of two Human Rebels from Telfrey, Yom Argo and Tay Vanis, who were spreading unrest throughout the system. A Base Delta Zero attack was used on Telfrey, which killed all life there and rendered it uninhabitable for many years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Telfreyans first appeared in the Marvel comic Star Wars 74, published in 1983, in which they were shown in a flashback detailing the destruction of Telfrey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
