He infected the population of Sedesia with FNV-23, and then had COMPNOR forces routinely give inoculations to the planetary personnel. The inoculation, FNA-23-B, contained trace amounts of FNV-23 while resulted in the inhabitants getting sick again unless they had regular inoculations. Believing the Empire was working for the good of the planet, the Sedresians began to look favorably on their \"rescuers.\" Alliance operatives revealed the truth of Negleem's scheme and the entire planet revolted as a consequence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
