Several known members of the Leonis family included Leo and his wife Tepha, their daughter Dhara Leonis, and their son Zare Leonis. The family was also aided by a nanny droid named Auntie Nags. While Leo was known as a staunch Imperial loyalist, his family members were more lukewarm in their support for the Galactic Empire.
