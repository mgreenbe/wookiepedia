This technique was chronicled by ancient Jedi masters in the sacred texts, in which they described it as Similfuturus. The technique required the user to pour their life essence itself into the Cosmic Force. The technique was used by Luke Skywalker at the Battle of Crait to give the Resistance time to escape the First Order. Luke gave his life to complete the projection, after which he disappeared into the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Fallanassi were first mentioned in Star Wars canon in the 2019 reference book Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, a tie-in book to Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, written by Pablo Hidalgo.
