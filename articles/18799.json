During this campaign, the Bognog attacked an Imperial docking facility stationed in the Yrrna system with its newly commissioned wing of TIE/D Defenders, after having stolen its technology in an earlier raid against the Empire. The Nami intended to demonstrate the starfighter's technological superiority to the Rebels with the hopes of eventually selling the technology to the Alliance. The Bognog carried out its assault with Rebels aboard the Carrack-class light cruiser Jester acting as observers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The base's docking crew immediately fled on the Modular conveyor Ulzepdi and sent a distress signal out to allied forces, prompting a responsive strike led by Tan Maarek Stele in hopes of saving the crew. The Bognog responded by sending out several wings of T-wings and Delta-class DX-9 stormtrooper transports to destroy the Ulzepdi and its escorts before it could escape. However, Stele and his wingman diverted its fighter wings long enough for the Ulzepdi to flee into hyperspace. However, the attack was a success as the Bognog and its wing of TIE Defenders proceeded to wipe out the entire staging area, much to the amazement of its hopeful Rebel buyers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
