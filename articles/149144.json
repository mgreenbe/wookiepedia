As a youth, Duna dreamed of becoming an inventor. However, he later entered politics eventually rising to become the Mayor of Galactic City. Up to that point, the mayor had been seen as a puppet of the Galactic Senate. During his tenure, however, Duna fought for laws to improve the lives of his fellow Coruscanti. Duna displayed an impressive work ethic yet he avoided going after the organized crime present on Coruscant choosing instead to run damage control resulting from their operations. Though some considered him a coward for his stance on organized crime, Duna was well liked. This enabled him to remain mayor for several tumultuous decades under the reign of the Galactic Republic, the Galactic Empire, and the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A round faced man, Duna loved eating grilled mercuryfish fillet at Coruscant's finest restaurants."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trey Duna was given an entry in Coruscant and the Core Worlds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
