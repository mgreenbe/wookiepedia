During the year 32 BBY, the Ciasi pilot Slide Paramita favored the Stinger and owned a yellow one that he was known to modify. The vehicle was notably fragile, and could not sustain the same kind of damage larger pods could. However, that did not stop Paramita from occasionally using his Stinger as a weapon out of desperation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pizer-Errol was first mentioned in the 1999 video game Star Wars Episode I: Racer, where it acted as the manufacturer for the Stinger 627 S Podracer.
