Failing to provide proper Imperial identification, Captain Heliesk sent the TIE/LN starfighters of Twilight Squadron to disable or destroy the Lark, claiming it to be a suspected Rebel ship. Although squadron leader Darklighter ordered the ship to be safely disabled, it was destroyed by Tars Nandy.

According to \"Mutiny on the Rand Ecliptic\", Heliesk was a willing but covert participant in the defection of Klivian and Darklighter. As \"Starfire\", Heliesk was the Rebel contact of Lindy, a friend of Hobbie's with whom the defectors intended to jump ship while the Rand Ecliptic delivered rubindum ore to the Bestine system. In an effort to provide the Rebel Alliance with the rubindum without exposing his allegiance to the Empire, Heliesk led a squad of stormtroopers to Lindy's rebels' and the defectors' rendezvous, bringing the rebels aboard the Rand Ecliptic and giving Klivian a rank cylinder serving as a key to the ship's captain's quarters. There, Heliesk instructed Klivian and Darklighter to stage a mutiny with the rebels as their crew, delivering the ship and its cargo to the Alliance without breaking his Imperial cover."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
