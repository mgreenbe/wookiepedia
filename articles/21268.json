When locked, the firing rate of the weapon was much slower, but allowed more kill power against small targets. These rockets, with a sluggish fly-time, were most effective when they could catch clone troopers off-guard or unprepared. The rockets also had a lock-on function, which was easily defeated by ducking behind large obstacles. This aside, the Bulldog RLR was a formidable weapon in the right hands."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bulldog RLRs were used most notably by General Grievous' personal bodyguards\u2014IG-100 MagnaGuard droids. By the end of the Clone Wars, the Bulldog RLR was employed by many rebels that worked to hinder the rise of the Galactic Empire. The Empire soon acquired this technology and used it in their heavy trooper's weapons, such as the heavy rocket launcher. The Bulldog RLR was almost completely gone after the formation of the Empire, and was seen only in the odd smuggling operation or on the black market. However, Gizor Dellso used one in the Battle of Mustafar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
