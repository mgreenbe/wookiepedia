Circa 1 ABY, a group of hikers disappeared in the mountains, near Jareck Arned's home. Arned was later interrogated by a spacer working for Commander Talte of the Corellian Security Force. The hermit was compliant and gave permission to search the place. However, the spacer discovered, to the great surprise of Jareck Arned, that some items in the house were tied to several kidnappings. Arned confessed that he bought most of these items from a traveling craftsman. He also explained that he found one of the art pieces in the mountains nearby just one day before. The spacer therefore went to investigate these statements. The spacer eventually discovered that the hikers were captured by the criminals known as the cave-dwellers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jareck Arned was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
