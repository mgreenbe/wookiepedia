It was inhabited by several nations and became one of the founding members of the Galactic Republic upon that government's establishment in 25,053 BBY. At some point during the early history of the Republic, Bezha Two became lost to the government, supposedly as a result of a supernova. The inhabitants of the planet, which in reality remained intact and habitable, retained recollections of the early Republic during the subsequent years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 3643 BBY, a new hyperlane was discovered that connected the modern Republic to Bezha Two.
