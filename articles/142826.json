Having been expelled from the now-Separatist planet of Ukio, Jedi General Keelyvine Reus and her Padawan Tyzen Xebec are returning to Coruscant along with Clone Commander Ganch. Accompanying them is AgriCorps worker Sanya, whose help was instrumental in fighting the Separatist forces on Ukio. While their cruiser is docking, Tyzen welcomes Sanya back to her one-time home and Reus proceeds to thank her for her service to the Republic. She assures Sanya that her assistance will be well reflected in her report to the Jedi Council and that it might influence where the AgriCorps send her next. On debarking, the group is met by Captain Rex, who brings a priority message for the two Jedi to report immediately to Master Yoda. He also offers to take Ganch to an RSO Center for some down-time. Initially hesitant, Ganch obliges when Reus insists that he go and stand by until called for. He invites Sanya to go with him and she readily agrees."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reus and Xebec arrive at the Jedi Temple and enter a communication chamber where they are met by Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano. Chancellor Palpatine appears as a hologram and informs the Jedi of a predicament involving the new allies of the Republic\u2014the Hutts. Palpatine was told by Jabba that a distant cousin of his\u2014Torpo the Hutt\u2014ignoring the treaty between the Republic and the Hutts, has sold the Valsedian asteroid belt\u2014a rich trove of ore used in the production of fuel, armor and weaponry\u2014 to the Separatists. Anakin, Obi-Wan, Ahsoka, Reus and Tyzen are to investigate, but without clone or military escort, as any Republic military presence deep into Hutt space could cause a delicate political situation. Anakin proposes they use the Twilight and pass as smugglers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rex, Ganch and Sanya arrive at the RSO Center when Reus contacts Ganch and informs him his services will not be required for their next mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the Archives of the Jedi Temple, talking with Obi-Wan, Reus reveals that she was trained in the lightsaber arts by Dooku."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back at the RSO Center, Rex, Ganch and Sanya meet Commander Cody, who asks them to join him on his table. The clones are having a drink and discussing the war when Sanya accidentally drops a fork on the floor. Picking it up, she discovers there are detonite charges planted under the chairs. A girl from the RSO staff determines the charges are not timer-based and are probably connected to a remote detonator. As it is not safe for the clones to move from their chairs, she proposes the RSO staff should disarm the charges."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, on a landing platform, Ahsoka and Tyzen are bringing supplies aboard the Twilight, talking about Xebec's experience during the battle of Ukio."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, in a hidden facility inside one of the asteroids in the Valsedian belt, a group of pirates\u2014a Gamorrean called Duroc, a blue-skinned male Twi'lek, a yellow-skinned female Twi'lek with an eyepatch and a purple-skinned male\u2014are sitting on a table, enjoying their fortune of being paid to guard a rock that no one visits. Suddenly Duroc starts choking and then flies into a wall. The cause turns out to be Asajj Ventress, who enters the room. Accompanied by the four pirates, Ventress inspects the mining operation taking place inside the facility. Ugnaught workers forced by battle droids do the ore processing. Ventress makes it clear she does not like the pirates and tells them their job is to guard the workers and make sure they stay productive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back at the RSO Center, Sanya reports to Ganch there are charges at every table on the chairs that the clones are using. As the charges are blinking in unison, Sanya is sure they are linked. The RSO staff has to defuse all the charges at the same time. To stay connected they put on the clones' helmets. Cody links his helmet to theirs to see what they see. Then he guides them through the steps of defusing the charges and they succeed. Suddenly, a girl from the RSO staff runs away. Sanya and Ganch pursue her, but just outside the RSO Center she manages to blast a clone trooper, steal a BARC speeder and drive away. Ganch and Sanya quickly hop on another speeder and continue the chase."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Twilight arrives at the Valsedian belt, Anakin, Obi-Wan and Reus are in the ship's hangar next to a red Delta-7B starfighter with R2-D2 in its astromech droid socket.

Ahsoka and Tyzen guide the Twilight amid the floating rocks into a cave inside the largest asteroid where they land. There is stable pressure and trace atmosphere on the asteroid, so the Jedi put on breath masks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the narrow tunnels are making their sensors unreliable, the Jedi split in two groups. The Padawans are to scan the smaller tunnels while the Masters take another route. Obi-Wan and Reus reach breathable atmosphere and take their masks off. They spot a Twi'lek approaching\u2014most likely an administrator of the facility. Reus grabs him and using a Jedi mind trick, she asks him where is his master. The Twi'lek answers he is far away. Reus then asks who is in charge and who does he answer to and the Twi'lek says it is his master, confusing the Jedi. Meanwhile, the Padawans are crawling through a tunnel and as they spot a light underneath they suddenly fall inside a room full of battle droids. Ahsoka and Tyzen activate their lightsabers to engage the enemy. At that moment Obi-Wan senses the young Jedi are in danger.
