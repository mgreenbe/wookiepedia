Atrius used the sabers to strike down many opponents and claim many victories. Over time Atrius' rage infected the saber, causing anyone who wielded it to fall into a frenzy.

She tracked down the sabers and retrieved them, however she had also been been hired by a crime boss on Hradreek to fulfill the same task. Attempting to deceive the groups she gave one saber to each employer, hoping they wouldn't take notice of the missing second saber. First she gave one to the Empire and they were fooled by her trick, she then gave the second saber to the crime boss but was called out on her deceit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The crime boss ignited the blade and began questioning the smuggler on the location of the other saber, he fell into a frenzy and killed all of his men. At the same time an Imperial officer presented the saber to Darth Vader, who planned to hand over the sabers to his Master, Darth Sidious. When Vader learnt of the missing saber he executed the officer and set off to recover the other. Meanwhile the rebel pilot Luke Skywalker entered the room in which the crime boss had slaughtered his crew and found the lightsaber on the floor, he used the weapon to slaughter a squad of Imperial Stormtroopers who discovered him with the corpses. To avoid more Imperial forces Skywalker stole a nearby podracer and fled in it, crashing it shortly after. Realizing he had evaded the Empire, Skywalker decided that the lightsaber was too dangerous to be kept in one piece, and used his lightsaber to destroy Atrius' blade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile Vader ran into a group of thugs who Starros had hired to keep the Imperials off her back, he utilized the weapon to kill all of the thugs.

When Vader escaped the rubble he observed Skywalker leaving.
