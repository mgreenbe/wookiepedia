Tasked with recovering memories of Aphra's superior, they travelled to Skako Minor to search the workshop of Wat Tambor.

There they were mistaken for recruits, before being imprisoned by General Hera Syndulla when she realized who they really were. They managed to break their prison shields, but did not try to escape, impressing Syndulla. When she came to listen to why the mercenaries were at the flight school, Syndulla was stunned by Sister Six, whom stunned the rest of the rebels in the room with her. The mercenaries then kidnapped Syndulla to use her as a bargaining chip to enter Hivebase-1."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aphra's plan to infiltrate Hivebase-1 was successful in the fact they managed to get in undetected. They then conversed a room of rejected prototypes and after consulting with Tolvan by accident, Aphra managed to get their presence revealed to the Imperials. The prototypes were unfrozen and Six and the others took cover. Aphra used Caysin Bog as cannon fodder in order to have Tam Posla fight the prototypes for them. Six then followed Aphra and Syndulla to the Hivebase-1 datacore. Although they were attacked by more Imperials, Aphra managed to use her bugs to have the datacore ripped out of Hivebase-1."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the aforementioned events, Aphra, Six, Posla and Syndulla returned to the flight school and Syndulla congratulated them on stealing the datacore.

The group arrived and began trekking the terrain to reach the workshop, led by Bas. However, Bas led them into a squad of stormtroopers, blocking the entrance of the workshop. Bas revealed himself to be the traitor and demanded the Imperials leave Skako Minor, as they had promised him. The Imperial officer refused, but Aphra gave Bas her Tooka Flufto. Little did Bas know that Tooka was bio-engineered to explode when hearing Aphra's code-phrase. Aphra recited it as planned and Bas and the Imperials disappeared in a fireball."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the explosion, Aphra had Rexa open the crate she had been lugging for the entire journey. Six assumed it was booze, but instead it was sixty more shrink frozen Tookas, all bio-engineered in the same way. Six then noticed a running stormtrooper and Rexa ordered them to stop it. As the trooper passed Posla and Bog, the two refused to get them as they had not broken any law. Ombra, however, killed the stormtrooper when it entered the treeline."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mercenaries entered the workshop, into a room of machines and artefacts. They began examining the objects when a Delta-class T-3c shuttle flew in through the roof. It landed a squad of stormtroopers, led by Lieutenant-Inspector Magna Tolvan. Unfortunately for both sides, though, the commotion awoke the large beast in the center of the room, the Chthonic worm god. It attacked them, killing a number of stormtroopers and forcing the rest of the combatants into hiding. Aphra tried to help with the Tooka she had on her, but the beast trapped her and Tolvan into a small space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the beast distracted, Ombra deserted the group and Six told the other mercenaries that they should try to help Aphra. Posla objected, claiming the monster had broken no law. But Six pointed out to him that Bog was lying lifeless behind them. Furious of his soulmates demise, Posla mobilized his cybernetic missile launchers and fired at the monster. Bog then got up again and Posla calmed down and embraced him. Dek-Nil then fired a shot which caused one of the remaining stormtroopers to fire their rocket launcher at the ceiling, sending rubble down onto the beast, killing it. Aphra declared victory over it and congratulated the others, prompting them to continue looting. While Six and the others did that, Rexa went to investigate what Aphra was doing behind the rubble. The others eventually heard an abrupt gunshot, but Aphra reappeared and told them to keep looting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they returned to their gunship, Six found Ombra returning to them.

The Alliance officer Bini thought they were recruits and took them to see their general, Hera Syndulla. During their walk, Six asked Aphra where Ombra had gone, which Aphra replied that she had ran off again after they landed. When they approached the control core, the Tooka Aphra was holding was attracted to it, and ran in. Aphra followed, but Syndulla shot the Tooka. Bini introduced the group, still sure that they were recruits. Posla, though, revealed that they were not and Syndulla realized they were mercenaries. As the rebels pointed their guns at them, Aphra asked Six their odds of taking them on and reaching their ship in time. Six claimed it was possible, but with sacrifices, so Aphra had them surrender."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mercenaries were put into the brig, detained behind energy shields. While Six sat around with Posla and Bog they heard a commotion in Aphra's cell. Indeed, Ombra had entered it through the vent. Aphra realized she was Magna Tolvan wearing the Defel's skin and Tolvan pointed a blaster at her. Dek-Nil, who sat at the other side of Aphra's cell, stunned Tolvan, who accidentally shot the shield generator and deactivated the energy shields. The mercenaries were now free and Aphra told them to help her stuff Tolvan back into the vents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the rebels found Six and the others, they were still at their cells. Syndulla respected this and decided to listen to why they were at the flight school. Posla was about to explain his plan to get into Hivebase-1 when Bog opened his neck compartment and four blasters flew out. Six caught them and, in a matter of seconds, she stunned Syndulla, Bini, and every other rebel in the hanger. As the mercenaries carried Syndulla into their ship, Posla was furious that he did not know of their plan. Bog tried to ease his anger, but he pledged to quit. Aphra was about to leave him to the reinforcements when he changed his mind and climbed aboard the ship."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Infiltrating Hivebase-1"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they left the Lucehulk Prime, Aphra borrowed a transmitter from the others and contacted Hivebase-1, offering to trade Syndulla. Later on, Aphra was running tests on Bog's diagnostics when she asked Posla about the cyborgist he was obsessed with. Together, Bog and Posla told her about Doctor Cornelius Evazan and Posla's hunt for him. Six called him obsessive, but Bog corrected it as attached. As they finished explaining their intentions, their ship drew closer to Hivebase-1. The officer over the comms confirmed their deal and gave them a flight path to use. Aphra, though, was using Syndulla's general plaque, which had a tracker on it, to lure in the Lucrehulk Prime. With the rebels arrival, Aphra used the chaos to sneak their ship into one of Hivebase-1's hangers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mercenaries departed their ship and began snooping around. They entered a room of frozen prototypes which had been rejected before they could be mass produced. Afraid of these suddenly defrosting, Six suggested giving Syndulla a gun, which Aphra denied. As they looked around, Aphra tapped into the Lucrehulk Prime's comm channel and discovered that Tolvan had commandeered the control core.

Thus Six continued shooting at the prototypes until Aphra ordered the group to return to the ship. Bog, however, instead ran towards the rejects, being shredded apart by the blaster fire. Posla watch his partner die and, in a fit of rage, he revealed his cybernetic weapons and faced off with the prototypes. Six felt sorry for him, but Aphra pulled her away and they left the room, leaving Posla to fight the rejects alone."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Stealing the datacore"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aphra led Six and Syndulla to the datacore of Hivebase-1.

Posla then caught up with them, mourning Bog's death. As Syndulla and Aphra argued, the latter let Six give Syndulla a gun. Syndulla then tried to shoot Aphra when Commander Yewl arrived and intervened, zapping Syndulla. He ordered his forces to capture her and kill the others."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yewl's forces engaged the mercenaries but only Six fired back. Posla was still traumatized from his partner's death and Syndulla was using Aphra as a shield. Aphra picked up Syndulla's blaster and gave it back to her so she could cover her. Aphra then used her AJ^3 cyborg construct and the terminal to connect with a bug she had planted in the Lucrehulk Prime's control core during her visit there. She had the flight school latch onto Hivebase-1 and rip the datacore\u2014with Aphra, Six, Syndulla and Posla inside\u2014out with its tractor beam and X-wing starfighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Simultaneously, the sixty shrink-frozen explosive Tookas escaped their crate and left Aphra's ship to roam the rest of Hivebase-1.
