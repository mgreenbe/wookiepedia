Following an attempted assassination on Darth Vader on Cabarria by bounty hunters, Vader ordered his droid to conduct an analysis of the origins of the kill contract as they were arriving on Coruscant. The droid stated that the contract came from the highest levels of the Imperial Executive Building, including the offices of Emperor Palpatine. The droid continued, and stated that there was a 97% probability that the signal originated from there, and that there was no evidence of slicing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader then requested a list of individuals with access codes of Imperial systems that were above Level 1A1. On the list provided, Bingan's name was listed there, along with the names of Corin Ferro, Wilhuff Tarkin, Cassio Tagge, Jer Croteau, Tomas Azoras, and Joon Strephi. Following a second assassination attempt in Coruscant's orbit that resulted in Vader and the Ninth Sister crashing their starship, Vader met with the Emperor and meditated and discovered that Barokki was also involved, an officer he had force choked some time before.

Of those killed, Barokki was one of two officers that were involved in the conspiracy, the other, who was an individual with two missing fingers was not selected and thus spared."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bingan's last name is misspelled \"Bingaw\" on Vader's list."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
