Ezra tells her he saw something, and she responds that this is his mission and she needs his full attention. Hera tells Ezra that his mission involves slipping into the Lothal system and studying the Galactic Empire's orbital defenses. She adds that the rest of the team will wait for not more than a day. Ezra's mission is to collect intelligence on Star Destroyer positions, TIE fighter patrol routes, and transport movements.

At that point, Ezra hears Maul's voice growing louder and sees Maul walking behind a pilot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Kanan asks Ezra what's wrong, Ezra sees Maul sneaking past Rex. When Garazeb Orrelios notices that Ezra is unwell, Ezra sees Maul walking past the Lasat and points in that direction. Zeb turns and, seeing nothing, asks Ezra what he's looking at. Hera and Kanan remark that Ezra is not looking very good. When Kanan asks Ezra what he sees, the boy hears Maul saying his name, and turns to see the darksider right behind him. Frightened, Ezra faints and falls onto the conference table. Kanan and Zeb attend to him.

Sabine is perplexed, and asks if he saw Maul at the briefing. Ezra recalls that Maul uttered his name and was standing right behind him.

Before Ezra can kill the false \"Maul,\" Sabine and Kanan intervene and force him away. Ezra attempts to strike Maul with his green lightsaber, but Kanan uses the Force to restrain Ezra's arms. Ezra demands that Kanan let him go, but the older Jedi snaps at Ezra to look, as it's not Maul.

Maul tells Ezra to trust him, because he only wants the answers that he deserves and nothing more.

The beams of light form a green cloud. Maul says that he now understands, while Ezra sees a familiar figure but can't remember his name.

Once Ezra and Maul exit the cave, Ezra asks why the possessed Kanan and Sabine aren't following them out.
