A droid with an exceptionally complaining personality, he was disliked by his fellow battle droids, and was sent to execute military duties while the other droids used their time by playing cards. During the Clone Wars around 22 BBY, Asajj Ventress moved her droid forces on the planet of Rodia, to secure an item called Death Brick. Unit 2953 was stationed on the planet, to patrol against the forces of the Galactic Republic. Left out of the card game and ordered to destroy any Republic clone troopers he would encounter, the droid used a Single Trooper Aerial Platform to scout the planet. While complaining about his poor treatment, he failed to notice an All Terrain Tactical Enforcer of the Republic, and crashed against its mass-driver cannon. He survived from the hit, but got his head stuck on the cannon. While hanging helplessly, he asked help from a OG-9 homing spider droid, which arrived instantly. Before the spider droid could attack the AT-TE, however, the clone trooper, who controlled the mass-driver cannon, quickly targeted the weapon against the spider droid, and launched Unit 2953 against it. The spider droid collapsed from the blast, but Unit 2953 survived again, although he got his head stuck on the spider droid, and was left to struggle to detach himself by the AT-TE."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Errand boy of the droid army"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Created by Baktoid Combat Automata, Unit 2953 was a B1-Series battle droid who served in the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars.

Mounted by a Single Trooper Aerial Platform, he traveled to fulfill the task. Flying across the jungled areas, Unit 2953 once again expressed his anger, thinking that he finally had enough of his comrades. He was so focused on complaining about his fate that he failed to notice the Republic All Terrain Tactical Enforcer, which was transporting three Jedi, High General Obi-Wan Kenobi, General Anakin Skywalker and |Commander Ahsoka Tano, who were returning from a duel with Ventress. Before Unit 2953 could sight the walker, he flew straight to the AT-TE's mass-driver cannon, and his head got stuck to it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hanging helplessly in the cannon, Unit 2953 tried in vain to free himself. When this failed, he asked help, which immediately arrived in a form of OG-9 homing spider droid, which jumped behind the nearby trees, ready to attack the AT-TE. However, the clone trooper who controlled the AT-TE cannon quickly turned the massive weapon against the spider droid and opened fire. The shot released Unit 2953, and sent him flying for the spider droid. He hit the spider droid, and although he survived, he got his head once again stuck, this time inside the spider droid which collapsed due to the damage it received from the blast. The AT-TE continued to move forward, leaving the frustrated battle droid to struggle to detach himself. The STAP he had used to patrol continued to fly by its own, and later bypassed a camp where two of his colleagues were playing cards with Clone trooper commander CC-2224 and his comrade clone trooper. Unit 2953's absence was noticed by the another B1, who asked has anyone see him, but the other B1 questioned the importance of the location of the said droid, stating that Unit 2953 was always complaining about things too much anyway."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unit 2953 was a B1 battle droid who was usually left to do the military tasks while his fellow droids were playing cards. The other droids believed that he was always complaining about something, and would deny him for playing cards with a false sympathy by telling that there were not enough seats for him. This greatly upset Unit 2953, and during his time on Rodia he stated that he had had enough of how he was treated, and while waving his fist in rage, he promised that the things would change. While flying his STAP, the droid spoke by himself, and did not oversee the area for the Republic forces very vigilantly, as he was more focused to complain about his status on the droid army. This led him to get his head stuck on the AT-TE's cannon he had not noticed in time, and when his efforts to detach himself failed, he asked for \"little help\" from the OG-9 homing spider droid. When Unit 2953 was shot out of the cannon and ended up crashing against the spider droid, he merely expressed his feelings by saying \"Ouch\". His head again trapped, he yelled at the AT-TE when it left to move on, and tried repeatedly to get himself off the spider droid, again with no results."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unit 2953 made his first and only appearance to date in Sith make the best pancakes, a comic in the LEGO Star Wars website, which was released in early 2009.
