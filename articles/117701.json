In ancient times, several Rozzum were stranded on PL-40112-CE-021105, a planet of the Wild Space. Some time later, during the Empire's reign, Imperial surveyors encountered that group of Rozzum after having inadvertently awakened them. The Imperials allied with the local people to fight the monsters off, which left only two survivors.

Some had bat-like wings, others looked like multi-eyed octopuses. Still others resembled reptiles or giant insects. They moved by skittering and fluttering around on the floor.

Pe\u00f1a, who first mentioned them through their language in the 2008 sourcebook Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide. In 2013, Pe\u00f1a first described the Rozzum as inter-dimensional monsters in part 1 of Barely Tolerable: Alien Henchmen of the Empire, a series of reference articles currently ongoing at the StarWars.com blogs. He explicitly pointed out the connection between the two sources on the Jedi Council Forums. In the same post, Pe\u00f1a hinted that the Rozzum may be related to Waru and the Charon, other inter-dimensional beings who appeared in the earlier Expanded Universe. He also implied that the aforementioned aliens may all have to do Cult Encounters of the Star Wars Universe, a yet unpublished article written by Joseph Bongiorno and Rich Handley. Some time later, Pe\u00f1a revealed that the Rozzum were in fact the monsters Luke Skywalker encountered in Blind Fury!, a 1982 Star Wars comic story written by Alan Moore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
