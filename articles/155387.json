Once there, Greedo told this Weequay, who was standing at the bar, to go get the prisoner. Meanwhile, one of the bounty hunters that accompanied Greedo in his kidnapping earlier was also at the bar, soon becoming suspicious when he noticed Greedo and Ion and Baron Papanoida, who pretended to be agents from the Trade Federation. Seconds after, this Weequay came back to the bar with Papanoida's daughter, who immediately called him \"father\" which destroyed his cover, causing a massive bar shootout to ensue. This Weequay was the first victim, being shot by Ion Papanoida before being able to react."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
