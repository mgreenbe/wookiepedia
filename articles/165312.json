When they enter the system of the unknown planet on which the factory is located, they receive an advertisement from a certain \"Gears\" Gilhooey from a nearby beacon. Leia realizes that the advert is a message for those intending to buy the T-65 X-wing starfighters, and orders Han to follow the coordinates sent by the advert."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The coordinates take them to an unknown planet, where Han is confronted by \"Gears\". \"Gears\" bests Han at hand-to-hand combat, and reveals his true identity\u2014Vors Voorhorian, the designer of the X-wing. He takes them to the Incom factory, where Leia is taken to a conference room to negotiate price."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Han and Luke, along with Artoo, discover that the X-wings in the Incom Hangar are nothing more than empty shells. Setting off to confront Voorhorian, they are confronted by four guards. The three manage to disarm the guards and burst into the conference room. Voorhorian sets them straight, informing them that even the Incom Factory might not be safe from the Empire. At that very moment, four Imperial TIE Fighters attack the base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fearing destruction if they take off in the Falcon, Luke causes a distraction by using a piece of flexible metal as a trampoline, flipping through the air and cleaving through the underbelly of the lead fighter with his lightsaber. The damaged TIE crashed into another, buying the Falcon time to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While flying away from the planet, Voorhorian directed them towards an old, hollow, derelict GR-75 medium transport. He revealed the contents: an entire fleet of X-wings crammed in tightly. Just as the fighters were revealed, the remaining TIEs found the transport, and attacked it. The Rebels acted quickly. Han boarded the Falcon and used it to ward off the fighters while Leia and Voorhorian drained power from the new X-wings to get the transport operational. Due to the GR-75's lack of proper armament, the Rebels improvised and caused the TIEs to crash into the ship's shields. The Falcon then towed the transport back to Yavin 4."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}]}
