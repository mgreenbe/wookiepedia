Because of the low level of technology of Tasariq, the Protector lagged behind the galactic standard of most \"modern\" slugthrowers and lacked the punch of comparable slugthrowers. This severely limited its ability to damage heavy armor; though the weapon remained deadly to medium and lighter armors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
