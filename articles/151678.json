Their priests, called the Apostles of the Undying Flame, usually mutilated their bodies so that one side appeared male, representing Yun-Txiin, and another side female, representing Yun-Q'aah. The Undying Flame counseled those who had found love, but if this love was between those of different castes, the Apostles would immediately sacrifice the unlucky lovers to Yun-Txiin and Yun-Q'aah."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
