The weapon requires a player of the Munitions Trader profession to craft. The player must learn the looted schematic before he or she is able to craft it, and may only craft one before needing another schematic. The DE-10 requires special gun barrels looted from enemies within the Death Watch bunker. Although the player may choose whether or not to craft one of the weapons, this article assumes such a path as representative of full game completion. While Galaxies places no restrictions on which professions may use the DE-10, OR-5's version is restricted to the Spy profession. The DE-10 blaster pistol was mentioned in two strategy guides released for the game in 2005\u2014Star Wars Galaxies: The Total Experience: Prima Official Game Guide and Star Wars Galaxies: The Complete Guide: Prima Official Game Guide, both of which list the DE-10 in an index of the various weapons available to players and provide the weapon's general statistics."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
