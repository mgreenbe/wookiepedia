It crashes on the ground, and rebel heroes Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, Han Solo, and the Wookiee Chewbacca pop out of the vessel and land in a large pile of gifts and decorations. They quickly get up, brush themselves off, and get set to begin decorating the Falcon, along with the Ewoks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker begins by using the Force to levitate a training remote to his sister Leia, who hangs it on an array of greenery that had been hung on the Falcon. At this point, Wicket, who has been observing the decorating, trips and gets tangled in the string lights. While he is trying to get himself untangled, Skywalker uses the Force to lift the lights onto the Falcon, along with Warrick. He then begins to lift a large red ribbon to place on the top of the Falcon. Warrick, alarmed that the ribbon would fall on top of him, is able to untangle himself from the lights and falls off of the Falcon onto the ground. Solo excitedy connects the wires, and the Falcon lights up brightly. The Ewoks, including Warrick, dance with excitement, and the humans need to put on glasses to shield their eyes from the brightness, looking on in awe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
