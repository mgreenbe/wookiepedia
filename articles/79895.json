He attempted to dissuade Talon Karrde from entering the ThrusterBurn Tapcafe while he was searching for Jorj Car'das in the Kathol Outback, claiming that the cantina in question was in-use, presumably for a swoop gang meeting. When Karrde refused to be persuaded to leave, Langre attempted to run over his bodyguard, Shada D'ukal, with his bike, only to be thrown from it, leaving his riderless bike to wreck itself on a nearby wall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
