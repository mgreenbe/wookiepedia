The average Chubbit stood shorter than a fully grown Human. Their skin was green or yellow, although some featured red or black spots. Their nervous system was easily crippled by ultra-strong frequency waves. On their dry homeworld, the Chubbits made use of indigenous technology such as wind-runners, wheeled vehicles that were propelled by large sails."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chubbits suffered after the rise of the Galactic Empire. In 19 BBY, numerous Chubbits were held as slaves by gangs on the planet Telerath and one of its moons. The fugitive Jedi Dass Jennir freed many of these Chubbits. Meanwhile, Imperial troops on Aridus found valuable natural resources there. However, when mining outfits attempted to extract these raw materials, Aridus's ionized atmosphere rendered their equipment inoperable. The Empire thus approved construction of the Iron Tower, a massive power transformer and signal amplifier to rectify the technological problems; the Empire paid little heed when the tower's strong frequency waves crippled the nervous systems and even killed many of the planet's natives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chubbits responded by waging a guerrilla war on the Empire, armed with blasters, repulsor tanks, and crawler tanks supplied by sympathetic Yutrane-Trackata workers and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Other offworlders provided support as well, including the Human Wrenga Jixton and a man who claimed to be the Human Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. In 0 ABY, the Kenobi impersonator destroyed the Iron Tower when the devotion shown him by the Chubbits and the Rebel Alliance hero Luke Skywalker prompted him to thwart a ploy by the Sith Lord Darth Vader to lure Skywalker into a trap at the Iron Tower. In the aftermath of the structure's fall, Jixton swore his services to Vader in exchange for an Imperial retreat from the Chubbit homeworld, and in 4 ABY, the New Republic sought an alliance with the species.

The Chubbit body followed a roughly humanoid plan, with a head, torso, two arms, and two legs. Each hand featured either five or four digits, including an opposable thumb, while their feet gave the species a digitigrade gait on wide, splayed toes. While some Chubbits sported a stocky build, others had a lanky frame. Skin coloration varied from light green to yellow, with the top of the head often sporting mottling of another color, such as red or black."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each Chubbit possessed a broad, flat head that tapered to a blunt snout in the front. Two nostrils pierced the top surface of the muzzle, and a wide mouth split its anterior surface. This toothless maw housed a pointed, green tongue and pink gums. The two Chubbit eyes were placed far apart on either side of the head. They were colored either white, green, or red and their pupils could appear as either small circles or vertical slits. With some Chubbits, a red tympanic membrane was visible directly behind each eye. While many Chubbits were bald, others sported a tuft of hair at the back of the head, tresses that came in shades of black, red, blond, or white."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chubbit anatomy included a nervous system that was susceptible to powerful technological emanations of the sort given off by the Iron Tower, a structure built by the Galactic Empire on the Chubbits' homeworld of Aridus.

Members of the species traveled the sands on domesticated long-necked lizards known as droffi steeds, which Chubbit riders controlled via saddles, stirrups, and bridles. Others used wind-runners, large, ground vehicles that rolled about on wheels and were propelled by winds caught in their large sails. By 0 ABY, the Chubbits were at ease with advanced weaponry, including blaster rifles and proton grenades, although these arms had to be smuggled onto their world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Aridus, Chubbits often wore loose-fitting clothing, which included cloaks, cowls, baggy trousers, headwraps, and boots. Others wore clothing typical of spacefaring species, including long-sleeved shirts, trousers, vests, and boots. Offworld Chubbit regalia was similar, with the addition of loose tunics, belts, short pants, and slippers. Chubbits who grew out their hair often bound it into a topknot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chubbits could be suspicious of outsiders, but they were intensely loyal to those who earned their trust.

The system was first reached by galactic explorers during the Great Manifest Period; it had become part of the known galaxy by 15,000 BBY. The Chubbit homeworld eventually became part of the Narvath sector of the Expansion Region, and it was reachable via the Gamor Run hyperlane. From 1004 to 1000 BBY, as the New Sith Wars raged, the Chubbit home planet was located in territory controlled by the Galactic Republic. Centuries later, during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Aridus was again allied with the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic's fall and resurrection as the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY brought Aridus to newfound prominence. The Chubbits could only stand by idly as the Empire scouted out valuable mineral resources on Aridus and then sent teams of miners to exploit them. When the offworlders discovered that their equipment\u2014everything from mole miners to comlinks\u2014was useless on the world due to the planet's ionized atmosphere, they obtained Imperial approval to construct an enormous structure, dubbed the Iron Tower, to act as a signal amplifier, power transformer and power source for Imperial hovertrains, which transported the ore. Mining started back up, and the Chubbits discovered that the Iron Tower's emissions had a devastating effect on their nervous systems; the neurological effects were so critical that many Chubbits even died."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rather than remain passive victims, the Chubbits formed a resistance movement to fight the Empire and drive it from Aridus. They struck a deal with the Alliance to Restore the Republic, which clandestinely smuggled weapons and munitions to the Chubbit freedom fighters. Some of the board members of the Aridus-based company Yutrane-Trackata secretly supported the Chubbit resistance after taking clandestine payments from the Alliance; while the company made mining gear specifically for Imperial operations on Aridus, it provided T2-B repulsor tanks and other mat\u00e9riel to the Chubbit freedom fighters by turning a blind eye when Chubbit forces raided its factories.

Vader had an actor surgically altered to resemble Obi-Wan Kenobi, Skywalker's deceased Jedi Master. The actor then joined the Chubbit resistance and ingratiated himself with the reptilians. The Chubbits accepted the fake Kenobi as the genuine article, and his exploits with them earned their awe and admiration. When Imperial stormtroopers broke up a Rebel arms deal with the Chubbits, Vader's gambit escalated; the actor stepped in, apparently to let the Rebel gunrunner escape. In reality, the man's escape enabled him to flee back to the Rebel base on the moon Yavin 4 and to tell Skywalker about his encounter with \"Ben Kenobi.\" Skywalker took the bait and traveled to Aridus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a band of Chubbit resistance fighters attempted to assault an Imperial hovertrain, Skywalker and his protocol droid, C-3PO, joined them and threw bags full of proton charges at the target, causing it to crash.

To that end, he ordered the Chubbits to bring C-3PO back to Skywalker's starship lest the droid detect the technological fakery that enabled the actor to approximate the real Kenobi's Force powers. The gambit was designed to bring Skywalker to Vader, who was waiting in the Iron Tower, but the awe shown Kenobi by both Skywalker and the Chubbits caused the actor misgivings about the plan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chubbits ignored the actor's orders to stay behind to instead secure an elevated position and attack the Imperial forces at the tower to provide cover for the two infiltrators. However, the Chubbits failed to spot an incoming Imperial landspeeder headed for their location. Although the actor urged Skywalker to hurry into the tower, the Rebel's insistence on saving the Chubbits broke the actor's resolve; since the real Kenobi would help the small reptiles, he disabled the speeder and saved the freedom fighters. During the subsequent mission within the Iron Tower, the actor's betrayal of Vader was complete: to help the Chubbits, he pulled a control lever and disabled the tower's systems. The decision cost the actor his life."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Later history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ensuing explosion knocked Vader unconscious from his perch within the tower.

The Human diplomat Leia Organa, daughter of the deceased Vader, led the delegation, fully aware that the Chubbits were still wary of offworlders due to the turmoil they had experienced under Imperial rule. Vader's other offspring, Luke Skywalker, also accompanied the expedition, and during initial talks, Organa learned that many of the Chubbits still fondly remembered Skywalker's exploits on Aridus.

During Jennir's first encounter with the Chagrian slavers, he feigned interest in joining them. When Jennir met the gang's leader, the Chagrian Mors Demanna, a Chubbit slave carried Demanna's sword; another Chubbit later ran to the aid of the Human fisherman Dado when Demanna chopped off the boy's hand for daring to think he could join the gang. When Jennir began to suspect that the spice-runners kept slaves as well, he infiltrated one of their camps on Telerath's second moon, where he found large numbers of Chubbits and Nosaurians forced into hard labor. The Jedi wreaked havoc on the gang's spice refineries at the base, making the destruction seem like a gang attack. The Chubbit and Nosaurian captives fled in the slavers' ships upon Jennir's urging. Jennir later returned to Demanna's slaver gang and asked to join; the same Chubbit retainer took his sword from him before his meeting with Musori, the gang leader. However, the Musori gang discovered Jennir's machinations and beat him severely. Meanwhile, Ken-Kiba's gang took the offensive and captured and killed all of Musori's gang but Demanna himself. When Ken-Kiba's T'surri gangmembers herded various townspeople and the prostitutes who worked for Chankeli into Chankeli's brothel; there enslaved Chubbits continued to serve their T'surri masters.
