Forces of the reborn Darth Krayt launched a massive assault on the Temple, and were also prepared for a counterattack from Roan Fel's Empire-in-exile and the Galactic Alliance Remnant.

Her close friend, Tholme, had stepped down from that post, so as to take Quinlan Vos as his Padawan. Later, Master Saa assisted Quinlan Vos in defeating Volfe Karkko's Anzati uprising on Kiffex. As she made her way to Kiffex, Tint\u00e9 Vos had failed to tell the Kiffu Guardians of her passing, which Saa suspected was on purpose. The Guardians then opened fire on the Jedi Master and after a struggle her ship was brought down. She survived the crash landing and was soon contacted by the Jedi Council and told about Volfe Karkko. T'ra Saa avoided detection in tree form and when Quinlan Vos was captured by feral Anzati she freed him and helped him destroy his captures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just then Jedi Masters Tholme, Zao and a Devaronian appeared. T'ra Saa told them all about Karkko and his wicked history and that Vos had to choose to either stay and fight or return to Coruscant, he chose to fight. After failing to convince Vilmarh Grahrk to join them, Saa led the three Jedi in the direction where she saw Aayla Secura and her Anzati forces travel. Master Saa, Tholme and Zao fought off many Anzati while Vos engaged Secura and Karkko. After the Anzati were defeated the three powerful Jedi Masters joined their minds and went into a Jedi meld to help Quinlan Vos, who then killed Karkko and saved Secura.

Tholme's task force disguised themselves, with Secura acting as a rich Twi'lek's daughter, and the remainder of the team as her servants, all the while staying with Devaron Senator Vien'sai'Malloc. Kuro and Tholme attempted to discover the Separatist base, only to fall into the trap of Aurra Sing, who had been assisted by Senator Vien'sai'Malloc, who was revealed as the traitor.

To protect the injured, Saa was compelled to put on a masterly display of her skills with the Force, to down trees and protect against the approaching blaze. However, Saa was grievously injured, saved only by the timely arrival of Master Windu, who had her placed in a bacta tank to recover. Windu then led a mission to the Rig, which led to destruction of the Crimson Nova, during which he recovered Saa's lightsaber from the Nova's leader, Mika."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After returning to Coruscant, Windu located Saa in the Temple meditation gardens. There she was with a comatose Depa Billaba, trying to restore to her mind, which she had lost after falling to the dark side during her last mission on Haruun Kal. Windu asked her if it was best given her recent injuries, but Saa replied that she would heal in time. After Windu returned her weapon to her, she asked him what was troubling him. He told her of Quinlan Vos' apparent defection to the Sith on an operation that he had supported, and that he felt guilty for Billaba's condition, as it was he who had sent her on the mission and was her Master when she was a Padawan. Saa, however, who was one of Windu's masters when he was a Padawan, retorted that the two made their choices, and that they were responsible, not him. Windu noted his perception of shatterpoints was often misshaped by hope, and that some, like Billaba, just could not be reached. Saa replied there was nothing they could do but to trust in the Force and believe they would find their way back."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Saa was on Nar Shaddaa with Tholme and the pregnant Khaleen Hentz in the final days of the Clone Wars, where they evaded Order 66.

Saa, along with the rest of the Council, listened to Princess Marasiah Fel's offer for the Order to join forces with Roan Fel and the truth that Fel was not responsible for the war or the Massacre at Ossus. Saa saw the truth in her words but believed the Jedi needed to regroup and increase in numbers before confronting the Sith again. Master Saa refused to believe Skywalker when he said that Darth Krayt was really A'Sharad Hett, but K'Kruhk believed it, saying that there was always a darkness in Hett and that the Clone Wars had changed many Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At this point, Skywalker suggested assassinating Krayt. Master Saa was stunned by the suggestion, saying that the Jedi hold all life sacred, and that actively seeking to destroy it was not the Jedi way. Despite this, the Council agreed to discuss it. They spent the night discussing Skywalker's suggestion with Nat Skywalker. Saa said that they had to help the Mon Calamari fight against the genocide the Sith were wreaking on them, but was concerned because they didn't have enough Knights and Masters at the Temple, and was worried if the Galaxy would be given to the Sith if they acted now. After long deliberation and meditation, Masters Qua, K'Kruhk and Saa unanimously decreed that the Jedi would play no part in the assassination of Krayt; they felt it would be wiser to give the Order time to grow stronger, while the Sith undermined each other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Skywalker continued with his plan to assassinate Krayt despite the Council's decision; the plan ending with the Dark Lord's death, though it was his most trust adviser Darth Wyyrlok III who ultimately murdered and replaced him as the new Dark Lord.

When Imperial Knight Antares Draco revealed the location of the Hidden Temple under torture, the Council discussed how best to repel the imminent Sith attack. Saa implored to evacuate the younglings before the battle began, but Skywalker exclaimed that they, and any safe location they would head to, would become vulnerable and destroyed. He explained that everyone had their part to play, and that if victory was to be attained, risks would need to be taken. They ultimately decided to follow through with Skywalker's plan and fought side by side with Roan Fel's forces and the remnants of the Galactic Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "T'ra Saa proceeded to direct the Jedi's defense with Battle meditation from the Council chamber. When Krayt's Sith Troopers launched their trap, Nat and Cade Skywalker as well as the Jedi Masters Sayar Dun'La, Te Corso, and Drok stayed to protect her until the evacuation of the Hidden Temple could be completed. Finally, all of her defenders had fallen except for the Skywalkers, the older of the pair Force-pushed his nephew away from the building just as a crashing Annihilator-class starfighter rammed into it. The chain reaction created a blast that killed the two Jedi Masters, but with their dying thoughts T'ra Saa and Nat Skywalker focused the energy into a massive beam of light.

The remaining Jedi, Imperial, and Alliance forces regrouped at Bastion, where they decided to launch an attack on the vulnerable Coruscant. There Cade Skywalker killed Darth Krayt, while Roan Fel was killed by his own Imperial Knights for attempting to wipe the planet of all life. With Krayt's Empire in shambles, the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances reemerged as the dominant galactic government, with T'ra Saa's long time comrade K'Kruhk as one of its Triumvirs.

When Saa fought she seemed to stay in the same place and never give up her ground. T'ra Saa proved to also be a skilled pilot as she managed to survive the attack of the Kiffu Guardians.

When designing her, Duursema tried to maintain most of the phenotypical characteristics exhibited by Ood Bnar, while still making her younger and more attractive.
