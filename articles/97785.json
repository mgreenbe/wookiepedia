It depicted a stylized close up of a stormtrooper helmet with the phrase \"No Division\" written across the bottom in Aurebesh, a writing system used to represent the Basic language. The helmet was bisected vertically with the standard black and white coloring of it reversed on the left side. While the text was white on the left side, it became black at that line of symmetry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "No Division was a poster that appeared in Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released for the PC in 2003, where it could be used in the player character's home as decoration. The poster was originally available as loot from the corpses of stormtrooper enemies in the game, but it was removed with the release of the Combat Upgrade in 2005. The poster was reintroduced to the game as part of the \"rare loot system\" in the Hotfix 17.10 game update on October 7, 2010. The system allowed players to receive increasingly rare items as loot from any defeated enemy in the game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
