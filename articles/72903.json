Dick. Due to its violent and sexually-provocative content, it took Jeter approximately ten years to find a publisher for it. Jeter is also the first to coin the term, \"Steampunk\", to describe the retro-technology, alternate-history works that he published along with his friends, Blaylock and Powers. Jeter's Steampunk novels were Morlock Night and Infernal Devices. Current projects include the dark fantasy novel \"The Kingdom of Shadows,\" \"Death's Apprentice: A Grimm City Novel,\" with Gareth Jefferson Jones, and the \"Kim Oh\" thriller series,"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As well as his own original novels, K.
