Valorous deployed Green Squadron in nimble A-wings to intercept the Imperial fighters, while Red Squadron, piloting T-65 X-wing fighters escorted the Delta-class DX-9 space transports of Val Group in their mission to transfer the cargo containers to the Calamari Cruiser's hangar bay. The Imperial fighters were tasked with destroying as many cargo containers and Rebel transports as possible, but if they did not succeed, they were to engage the Valorous directly\u2014a considerably dicier proposition."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fortunately, the Imperial Navy was holding a squadron of lethal TIE Avengers in reserve.
