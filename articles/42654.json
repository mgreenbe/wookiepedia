Although author John Jackson Miller intended for the dialogue to refer to \"ecliptic\" as an astronomical term, the word was italicized in the finished issue, leading some readers to conclude it was a starship. Additionally, all letters in the issue were capitalized, leading to further ambiguity regarding the question of whether or not the word was used as a proper noun. Later, the word \"ecliptic\" was no longer italicized when the Days of Fear arc was reprinted in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: Days of Fear, Nights of Anger, corresponding with Miller's original intention. However, this change was later contradicted by The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, where it received an entry, thus canonizing the Ecliptic's existence as a starship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
