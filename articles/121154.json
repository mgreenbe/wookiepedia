He was known to be arrogant and extremely skilled. He lost his left eye in a swoop racing crash and had it replaced with a cybernetic photoreceptor enhancement. He flew a Shock Hauler 33 named the Goonga Munt Goonga."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Harter and his rival, Servid Norn, devised a race to pit their best pilots against each other in order to determine whose pirate gang had the best pilots in their employ.
