One of the Rebel pilots, Homack, was shot down in his X-wing starfighter during the battle and crashed on the planet's surface. He was pursued by Storm commandos, elite stormtrooper units specially trained in commando tactics, but was able to successfully evade them with the help of a set of Creshaldyne Industries Scout Armor. Stored in his starfighter's survival gear kit, the suit was capable of mimicking surrounding terrain by generating a small holographic distortion, thus enabling Homack to avoid capture long enough to steal a ship and escape the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Atrivis was mentioned in Gundark's Fantastic Technology: Personal Gear (1997), in an in-universe message board post by Homack. \"Atrivis\" had only applied to a system and sector in Star Wars canon; however, the context here makes a clear reference to a planet. Later, the novel The Cestus Deception refers to the planet Atrivis 7, reinforcing this understanding."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An earlier West End Games sourcebook, the The Rebel Alliance Sourcebook (1990), mentions an Alliance battle in the Atrivis sector; given the significant cross-referencing that occurs within West End Games products, it is likely Homack's crash occurred as a consequence of this battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
