He accompanied the Emperor and his apprentice Darth Vader on a visit to the planet Ryloth in the Star Destroyer Perilous. When the Perilous was attacked and destroyed above Ryloth by the rebellious Free Ryloth Movement, Deez evacuated with the Emperor and Vader in a shuttle, but their craft crash landed on Ryloth, leaving them stranded in the wilderness. Deez, Vader, Palpatine and a captain of the Royal Guard made their way across the terrain searching for civilization, encountering a nest of native lyleks which they destroyed at the cost of the captain's life. They then came upon a Twi'lek village, where they were welcomed and rested before being attacked by Free Ryloth movement members. The trio fought off the attackers, aided by Imperial reinforcements who soon arrived to collect them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
