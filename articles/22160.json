The CR-2 primarily fired bolts of charged plasma energy, but a secondary firing mode allowed the weapon to discharge electrical stun charges capable of stunning most living targets. It had a high rate of fire, crossing into the realm of fully-automatic. The CR-2 pistol became an antique on most Core Worlds long before the Naboo Security Forces adopted it as the standard-issue sidearm for its Security Guards and police officers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ranchers and wilderness guides were also known to have used the CR-2 as added protection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dengar used this as a secondary weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The CR-2 is a cosmetically modified Calico M960 pistol without the retractable stock."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
