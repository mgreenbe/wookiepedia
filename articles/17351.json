They had a leather-like skin protecting them from physical damage. The color of that hide was typically sandy pink or a rusty brown, but variations were wide, including tan-colored Bitth\u00e6vrians living in equatorial areas and dark brown or black Bitth\u00e6vrians living in the north. The species also had a row of six sharp fang-like teeth, similar to those of the aquatic frist shark from Trandosha, which jutted from their mouths. These fangs were used in personal combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The knees and elbows of Bitth\u00e6vrians were covered with sharp quills used in personal combat as piercing weapons. The quills were not particularly hard, and they were often broken or lost, but they were constantly replaced. As the Bitth\u00e6vrian aged, those quills became more resilient and larger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bitth\u00e6vrians' vision ranged into the infrared, allowing them to see heat sources (such as living beings or recently fired sidearms) in complete darkness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bitth\u00e6vrian culture was based on personal combat and fighting readiness. The status of a Bitth\u00e6vrian was based on his or her personal skill as a fighter, with the greatest warrior becoming the leader of their people. The leader was absolutely respected. People dishonoring a leader would be chased by Bitth\u00e6vrians even if they left Guiteica. Being highly isolationist, Bitth\u00e6vrians tended to leave only to pursue the most serious offenders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The personal weapon of a Bitth\u00e6vrian was commonly the dematoil, a customized morningstar with Bitth\u00e6vrian joint quills attached to the ball. Every time a Bitth\u00e6vrian was defeated by another in personal combat, the winner was allowed to take the loser's biggest quill from his arm and attach it to his dematoil."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Naming convention"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bitth\u00e6vrian naming convention was atypical, with a Bitth\u00e6vrian having three or four names. The first name of a Bitth\u00e6vrian was the season when he or she was born. There were seven seasons in Guiteica: Giil, Quul, Aul, Zoul, Tweil, Jael and Quaal. The second name was the family name, which was inherited from the mother's maternal surname. A male Bitth\u00e6vrian adopted a third name when married: his wife's surname. The fourth name (third in females and single males) was the Bitth\u00e6vrian's personal name, used normally only as a form of familiar address, by friends, family, and cohorts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At least five decades before the Battle of Yavin, the Bitth\u00e6vrians started a war[source?] in protest of Republic interference in the Kadok Regions. From the start the Republic played up the threat posed by the Bitth\u00e6vrians in order to gain allies to bolster its increasingly small armed forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At length the Republic defeated them with an army of Jedi and Kaleesh. The m'Yalfor'ac Order, one of the biggest Bitth\u00e6vrian armies, killed several Jedi Knights, but they were eventually defeated. The Bitth\u00e6vrians afterward hated the Republic as a whole, despising its values and methods. Although they were also unhappy with the Galactic Empire, they considered it to be the lesser of two evils."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bitth\u00e6vrians also felt hatred towards any Force-user, due to the Jedi implication in their defeat, and towards Bothans because of the Bothan tendency to mislead, lie and avoid direct conflict, behavior which was anathema to the Bitth\u00e6vrian beliefs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bitth\u00e6vrian planetary defense force, the Guiteica Militia, was rebuilt around 2 ABY, led by Colonel Quaal Tavier Catharius of the m'Yalfor'ac Order as a continental army in l'Quar'ta with support from the other fifteen continents of Guiteica. The m'Yalfor'ac Order considered the Rebel Alliance, as official heir of the Old Republic, to be an inherited enemy. However, their isolationist tendencies and use of obsolete equipment made them little threat to the Rebel Alliance; they mostly just became a headache for Moff Rhain Towith of Kadok Regions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vulca Minerals tried to mine yttrium in Guiteica, but the pushy attitude of Vulca officers led to a more aggressive attitude from the m'Yalfor'ac Order. The crisis was witnessed by a Vulca officer and later Rebel lieutenant Ayla Shar. After that crisis, Kadok Resources, a Bitth\u00e6vrian-controlled operation, managed all of Guiteica's exports."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
