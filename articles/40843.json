Following the Galactic Empire's defeat at Endor in 4 ABY, he was involved in the theft and sale of stolen starship and weapons technology to Kuat Drive Yards. Antig stole that technology from Slayn & Korpil's facility in the Roche asteroid field and murdered his accomplices, dumping their bodies and thereby receiving the whole payout for the job. Antig's crimes put him on the radar of the New Republic General Airen Cracken, who was concerned that Kuat Drive Yards would use the technology to benefit the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life and smuggling career"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Nalroni male, Drolen Antig was born on the Outer Rim world of Celanon. He became a smuggler and con artist in his adult life, and worked\u2014and survived\u2014smuggling routes such as the Kessel Run, the Sisar Run, and the Sanrafsix Corridor. By the age of thirty-two, Antig had smuggled a diverse variety of goods including spice and jellied canron, as well as ferried weapons to a Rebel Alliance cell in Corint City on the Outer Rim planet of Pirik. Antig also worked with a group of Advosze thieves during a job on the Core World of Fresia. He ran with a crew of thirty lowlifes and criminals, who were loud and crude but worked well together\u2014however, none of them entirely trusted the Nalroni. At one point, Antig stole a pair of trousers from a Corellian."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A lucrative contract"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Galactic Empire's defeat at Endor in 4 ABY, Antig returned to his homeworld of Celanon, where he relaxed for a while before returning to smuggling. Before long, Antig was contracted by starship and walker manufacturer Kuat Drive Yards. The corporation needed new technology to optimize much of its output as the Galactic Empire lost\u2014and therefore needed\u2014more ships. Antig was recruited to obtain that valuable resource, so he set out on a recruitment drive of his own."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to rumors circulating around the bar scene, the group of Advosze thieves with whom Antig had collaborated with on Fresia was planning a heist on the Mid Rim Roche asteroid field, which had allied itself with the ascendant New Republic.
