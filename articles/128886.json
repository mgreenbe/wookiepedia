During the siege, two aerial, Basilisk war droid-riding Neo-Crusader patrols directed the gunship Moomo Williwaw to be taken to the staging area. The passengers of the starship, including Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick, were attempting to meet with the local resistance and did not want to be discovered by the Mandalorians. Demagol, a rogue Mandalorian accompanying Carrick under false pretenses, was piloting the Williwaw and convinced the patrols that the ship did need not to be diverted by feigning ignorance as a Mandalorian drafted from the front lines and unfamiliar with local operations. Later, the leader of the Neo-Crusader forces on Taris at the time, Cassus Fett, ordered the Kandosii-type dreadnaughts Parjai and Gratua to also take starships captured by the Mandalorians to the South Orbital Area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The South Orbital Area was first alluded to in the 2007 comic book, Knights of the Old Republic 22, authored by John Jackson Miller.
