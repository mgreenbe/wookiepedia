While this Treadwell droid survived the hijacking with a number of other droids, all clone personnel on board were killed. When D-Squad arrived on the Renown, they ran into BNI-393 who brought them back to their shuttle where the surviving droids, this Treadwell included, were. The group later followed a buzz droid out of the shuttle and through the ship but this droid could not get through the door. Later, after the buzz droids were defeated, the group of droids ran into a group of battle droids in the corridor of the Renown which opened fire. While most of the droids got away safely, this Treadwell was too slow and was shot apart. What remained was eventually destroyed when the Renown exploded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
