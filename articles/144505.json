Stackpole, the writer of the X-Wing: Rogue Squadron comic series, created the character of Baron Soontir Fel, an Imperial ace. Fel defected to the titular squadron, and Stackpole has indicated that he intended to explore Fel's story further in the X-wing comics, telling the story of his return to Imperial service. Though he had the story ready to tell, the series was canceled before it could be published. That story, The Reenlistment of Baron Fel, had been created with Zahn as a six-part comic. When the X-wing series was canceled, the storyline was reworked as a four-part short story, a format in which Stackpole and Zahn had collaborated before. While both versions remain extant, in Stackpole's and Zahn's possession, neither has been sold and the story so far has not seen public light."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
