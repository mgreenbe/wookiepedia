The Drum Corps took part in Admiral Cha Niathal's funeral in 43.5 ABY; their large barges followed Niathal's casket. As the procession passed under Medway Avenue's pedwalk, the drum corps began playing a percussion arrangement of the Alderaanian air 'Tialga Hath Fallen.' The Alderaanian flutes were replaced with sequential bells for the arrangement. The funeral was narrated by journalist Javis Tyrr, who identified the air played by the Drum Corps."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
