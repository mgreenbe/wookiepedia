As with many Koorivar, he had a large spiraling horn on his forehead, which was covered by a cloak. This Koorivar Jedi was known to wield a blue lightsaber. In 1032 BBY, he took part in Operation Influx, an ill-fated Jedi mission to sabotage baradium production in the Daimanate, a fiefdom in the Grumani sector ruled by the Sith Lord Daiman. During the Raid on Chelloa, the Koorivar Jedi and several of his companions were killed during an attack by the rival Sith Lord Odion, whose kinetic corruptor destroyed a large area of the spaceport and surrounding town. The sole Jedi survivor of this mission was Kerra Holt, a novice Jedi Knight who would play an important part in the Chelloan affair."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
