Lethagoes were Human in form but quite tall and thin. Nevertheless, they possessed a titanic strength that belied their thin frames. Their faces were thin and pale with a sharp nose, severe eyes and a jutting chin. Their appearance struck some as being quite birdlike, causing a theory to arise that the Kalai were an avian species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not much was known about them, and often their Human parents were unaware of the existence of the Lethagoe offspring as was the case of the news reporter, Horatio Varn-Kezzler, who learned that a Lethagoe interviewee of his was actually his own son."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lethagoes were primarily encountered at Zirtran's Anchor where they served as representatives of the mysterious Kalai."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
