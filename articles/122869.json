Ripoblus modular conveyors Asbo and Lambda-class T-4a shuttles Bezil, Gamu, and Bredis found themselves under fire from Dimok BTL Y-wing starfighters, escorted by Assassin-class corvette Falx, Cargo ferries Delphine, Mangonel, and MC40a light cruiser Falaricae."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Protector launched two flight groups of TIE/LN starfighters to drive off the Dimok attackers, while a single group of TIE/sa bombers attacked corvette Falx. Imperial TIE fighters quickly began to drive off Dimok raiders with superior firepower. While Dimok and Imperial starfighters clashed, a single fighter inspected the contents of transports Asbo, revealing Imperial arms and other munitions.

The initial Ripoblus attack consisted of two Assassin-class corvettes and six Gamma-class ATR-6 assault transports. The Dimok XQ1 Platform Youst only had a handful of Z-95 Headhunters and escort shuttles and soon its defenses were exhausted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aboard Protector, Imperial leaders insisted control be established swiftly, fearing that the Sepan conflict could begin spilling over into neighboring star systems. Pilots received orders to destroy the Ripoblus raiders, but only sufficient numbers to drive off the attack. Secret Order agents again tasked select Maarek Stele to inspect the station, dubious of the station's purpose, furthermore to be observant of other strange activity. Hoping to send a concise message, the Protector deployed TIE fighters and bombers to thwart the Ripoblus strike, beginning with making an example out of one of the Assassin-class corvettes. Midway in the battle, the Ripoblus Nebulon-B2 frigate Dromon exited hyperspace and attacked Protector. The frigate, however, was outmatched and destroyed by the Victory Destroyer and TIE bombers who turned back to deal with the new threat. Bombers from Beta group succeeded in destroying Ripoblus corvette Galliot and several assault transports, causing the Ripoblus to withdraw."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Ripoblus forces began to leave the system, TIE bomber Beta 2 inspected the nearby Station and cargo containers, proving Ripoblus claims that Station Youst conducted weapons research.

Chiefly scientists, the refugees had hijacked an IPV-1 System Patrol Craft and a couple of Lambda-class shuttles, yet lacking hyperdrive, could not flee the system aboard the patrol craft. Protector accepted the refugees' request, deploying TIE fighters and interceptors to cover docking operations between the Protector and patrol craft Glas, while expecting reprisals from the Ripoblus government. As expected, the Protector arrived near the Glas as Ripoblus shuttles and Y-wings began an assault to foil the refugee escape into Imperial hands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial TIE interceptors easily bested the initial attack force, only to discover additional waves of Ripoblus and even Dimok forces attempting to stop the docking operation. With secure space around the Protector, patrol craft Glas succeeded in transferring refugees over to the Protector. Refugee shuttles Nazaar 1 & 2 took sanctuary inside the Protector's hangar, but not before a final raid of Ripoblus escort shuttles arrived. Imperial fighters promptly put down the futile attempt by the Dimok raiders, aided by the decimating support of the Protector's turbolasers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Capture enemies"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the refugees safely aboard the Protector, Admiral Harkov could return to pacifying the Sepan system. Imperial Intelligence discovered plans of a deep space rendezvous between Ripoblus and Dimok leaders near Sepan 8.

Two transports from Omega, escorted by eight Alpha-class Xg-1 Star Wing assault gunboats, entered the system where the meeting was taking place."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gunboats disabled Dimok shuttle Keydon, and Ripoblus shuttle Phantele.

Gunboats succeeded at repressing enemy fire from Omega 1 & 2 while docking completed. Transports Omega slipped into hyperspace with cargo aboard, leaving intercepting forces to Imperial gunboats."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the hostilities, Cargo Ferries Godendag and Glaive arrived, accompanied by Assassin-class corvette Runka. Gunboats Mu disengaged from the dogfight to inspect these new craft, discovering Imperial arms within.

Gunboats Mu succeeded in destroying Ferries Glaive and Godendag before returning to the Protector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the raid, Imperial forces discovered the occupants of the Dimok and Ripoblus shuttles to be merely the children of conflict leaders. Further interrogation revealed that conflict leaders intended to use their children as a cynical attempt to keep either side in adherence to a new treaty.

Maarek Stele, despite piloting a standard TIE Fighter, was instrumental in ensuring the safety of the Avengers and Tropsobor, and even aided in the destruction of Ben Het."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reportedly, all of the TIE Avengers arrived safely aboard Protector, thanks to their speed and deflector shields.
