During the Clone Wars, Dak was contacted by the scientist Blayne regarding the possibility of acquiring a new piece of weaponry that Blayne had developed, and the gang set a course for Blayne's asteroid base aboard the Talon's Wing. However, the ship was boarded en-route by the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, who captured Dak and his crew and dumped them into an escape pod.
