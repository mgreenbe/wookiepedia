Merrick led the Rebels through the asteroid field, destroying any mines they encountered along the way. The group cleared the outer perimeter but soon came under attack from numerous TIE interceptors. Rece scored multiple kills as the Rebels fought their way through the Imperial starfighters, including destroying one interceptor that Rookie One was unable to shake from his tail. The Rebels eventually reached the mining facility, built into one of the larger asteroids. The group entered the facility through a transport corridor designed for shuttles and cargo drones, in which Rookie One destroyed the shield emitters at an exchange junction, providing access to the reactor core.
