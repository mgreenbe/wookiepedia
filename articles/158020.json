Graduating and selected to train by a Jedi Master, Unskette eventually passed the Trials of Knighthood and was made a Knight. After years of additional training the High Council declared Unskette a Master, reaching the highest formal rank of the Order. At some point after that event, Unskette selected Initiate Thame Cerulian to become his Padawan and travel the galaxy by his side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the pair's travels, Unskette and Cerulian faced three chain-sickle wielding assassins on Filve. Together, the Master-Padawan duo was able to overpower their adversaries, just barely. Assigned a mission on Orto, the two Jedi were forced to contact the Acquisition Division after being denied permission to take a Force-sensitive infant for training. After many years together, Unskette recommended his faithful student for consideration to take the Trials. Passing each test presented by the Council, Cerulian and Unskette parted ways, their time as Master and Padawan at an end."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
