It had several pockets, pouches and strap allowing the wearer to carry up to twenty-four individual items, each of them weighing up to one kilogram. Due to the nature of the garment, the total weight would be distributed evenly through the wearer's torso, reducing the real strain to her muscles. An empty vest weighed 0.5 kilograms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tracker utility vest could be manufactured from several materials, but it was commonly made from a naturally leathery and hard one such as the hide of a Bantha. That hide would then be treated so it can resist rips, tears and corrosion, and to be impermeable to both stains and water. The vest provided a slight amount of protection against damage, enough for it to be considered a light armor, and at the same time it rarely hampered the movements of the wearer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tracker utility vest was designed by the Ayelixe/Krongbing Textiles company to give comfort to hunters and guides needing to carry an amount of small tools.
