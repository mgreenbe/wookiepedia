At the start of each month, Taug would transfer funds to a Hutt-controlled company on Junction, which would then be passed on to the Zygerrians. A year after making the deal, he was arrested by intelligence officers on Coruscant as part of a long-running sting, and charged with fraud. In an attempt to reduced his sentence, he told his captors about the deal he had made with the Zygerrians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
