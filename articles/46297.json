After the Battle of Yavin, she was part of a group of thugs who lived in the slums of Mos Espa. This group also included Hilbrun, Tiomvo and Guz'Ordnak. Circa 1 ABY, they bought the booster controller of the R2 unit motivator to the junk dealer Watto. One of them left his swoop bike as collateral but they never paid Watto for the booster controller. Since this R2 unit was wanted by both Imperial Commander Barrezz and Rebel Captain Bastra, a spacer later tried to recover the motivator booster controller.
