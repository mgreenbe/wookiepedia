The delegation was made up of the Jedi Masters Everen Ettene and Ludwin Katarkus, along with their respective Padawans, Halagad Ventor and Danyawarra. Upon arriving in the Virgillia system, the envoys' transport was attacked by dissenters, and destroyed. The four Jedi were presumed dead by the High Council of the Jedi Order, and a memorial service was held at Coruscant. However, Ventor and Danyawarra had actually survived the crash. Three weeks after the accident, the two Padawans were rescued by Jedi Master Ashka Boda, the Galactic Republic senator Bail Prestor Organa, and the latter's weapons master Giles Durane."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
