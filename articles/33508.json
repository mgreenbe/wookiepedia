It had a single rainforest continent, Kavila, and the planet was 7,000 kilometers in diameter. It was originally a penal colony. Due to the planet being largely ignored by the Galactic Empire, it became home to many beings fleeing persecution. The local architecture was old-fashioned, but the technology was of modern levels. Voyager's Rest was located on Kavila. A popular local sport was Trophy Chase, in which the locals rode nephs. The planet's Governor-General was Lira Rimrunner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
