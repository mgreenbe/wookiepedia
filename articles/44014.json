Prior to the rise of the New Order, the office served as Palpatine's workspace during his time as Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. It was located in the well-guarded Senate Office Building, a government complex on one of the highest levels of the capital world of Coruscant, and comprised of several rooms, such as a ceremonial office which contained the Chair of Office and the Chancellor's official desk. As leader of the Republic, the Chancellor often held meetings with members of the Galactic Senate as well as the Jedi High Council in the formal, ceremonial office. It was the Chancellor's prerogative to decorate the office as he saw fit; as such, Palpatine's Sith-inspired preference for the color red was evident in the d\u00e9cor of his office, which also contained bronzium statues of the Four Sages of Dwartii (one of which concealed a lightsaber in both the main office and connecting anteroom, along with such relics as a pair of bas-reliefs depicting struggle between Jedi and Sith minions on an ancient battlefield, found in an archaeological expedition to an unknown world, and a Sith Chalice; a form of incense burner used in ancient meditation rituals, recovered during an expedition to Malachor. The office complex's security was provided by the Chancellor's Red Guard sentinels, who were stationed at the entrance of the ceremonial office during the waning days of the Separatist Crisis.

Behind the area was the Chancellor's Archives, containing holodisc files and correspondence of former chancellors. Although Palpatine owned private apartments in the exclusive 500 Republica residential tower, the Chancellor's office included a small accommodation suite for his personal use.

During the early years of his chancellorship, Palpatine became invested in the career of Anakin Skywalker, the prophesied Chosen One who began training as a Padawan in the Jedi Order shortly after the Battle of Naboo.

During the political upheaval, the Chancellor's office was where Palpatine conducted official meetings with the Loyalist Committee and the Jedi High Council, both of which served in an advisory role to expedite the Chancellor's negotiations with the Separatists. Windu voiced his concern for the Republic's security, noting that the Jedi were not an army and, therefore, could not guarantee the safety of the state in the event of open war.

After Vice Chair Mas Amedda suggested that the Chancellor could unilaterally authorize the creation of a Republic Military, Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks successfully proposed a motion in the Senate that granted emergency wartime powers to Palpatine.
