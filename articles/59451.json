At some point after the Battle of Yavin, during the Galactic Civil War, Loftus was an agent for the Alliance to Restore the Republic, holding the rank of captain. He became aware of an Imperial initiative named Project Lasercutter, which aimed to capture smugglers sympathetic to the Rebel Alliance in order to undermine Rebel supply lines. Setting up a temporary base of operations in a hotel complex in the settlement of Mos Entha, Loftus ordered a number of missions designed to foil this project. Initially, he recruited a spacer to intercept and kill an Imperial agent targeting a smuggler on Tatooine. Shortly afterward, Loftus received word that the Imperials were targeting Jaxa Lian, one of his most reliable smugglers. Enlisting the spacer a second time, Loftus paid for Lian to be escorted back to his base of operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the safe return of Lian, Loftus focused on uncovering the source of the Empire's accurate information. Eventually, Loftus discovered a spy placed in the Alliance recruiting program, a native of Naboo known as Lidek Baws. Baws was to meet his Imperial overseers out in the desert, prompting Loftus to send the spacer after him. The spacer directly confronted Baws and killed him and the other Imperials. Until then, Loftus had believed the Imperial Security Bureau was responsible for Project Lasercutter; however, he then discovered that it was actually directed by members of the Inquisitorius, a top-secret division of Imperial Intelligence. Loftus knew that if they could kill the Project's lead Inquisitor, the loss would set Project Lasercutter back by months, if not permanently derailing it. Therefore, he sent the spacer on another mission to kill the lead Inquisitor, after warning the spacer that the Inquisitors were deadly opponents and rumored to be able to use the Force. With these warnings in mind, the spacer was able to kill the Inquisitor."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "New Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Rebel Alliance transitioned into the New Republic, Loftus became a member of the New Republic Intelligence Service, the successor to earlier Rebel spy networks and the Senate Planetary Intelligence Network.
