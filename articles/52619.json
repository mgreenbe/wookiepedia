Lavin mistakenly believed them to be waiters, insulting their choice of clothing and demanding to know why her order had not yet arrived. Revan apologized and attempted to explain that he wasn't an employee of the cantina, but Lavin refused to listen and threatened to use her father's influence to have Revan dismissed. Revan persuaded her not to become upset and agreed to bring Lavin her order. At that point, a waiter arrived bearing Lavin's and her friend's drinks, defusing the situation and allowing Revan and Onasi to leave."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lavin commonly used her enforcers and her father's reputation to threaten others.
