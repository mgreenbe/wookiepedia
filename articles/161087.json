Sunrider focused her lightsaber with Adegan crystals that once belonged to her late father, Andur Sunrider. Upon its completion, the weapon produced a brilliant green blade. She continued to use her newly-created lightsaber for the duration of her apprenticeship under Qel-Droma."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lightsaber of Jedi apprentice Vima Sunrider consisted of an assortment of metallic parts. When assembled, the lightsaber was multifaceted and segmented into three sections, the smallest at the base of the hilt. Four protruding shrouds surrounded the blade emitter. It was focused by a green Adegan crystal, which produced a blade of the same color upon activation. When not in use, the lightsaber was usually worn on Sunrider's hip."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3986 BBY, Vima Sunrider, apprentice to the reluctant self-exiled Jedi Master Ulic Qel-Droma on the ice-planet Rhen Var, was presented with the final task of her Jedi training: the creation of her own lightsaber. Sunrider sat before a table, on which all the necessary components for her project were laid. Also included were three green Adegan crystals, numbered among the cache once owned by her late father, Andur Sunrider. Under guidance from Qel-Droma, Sunrider constructed her lightsaber, which she immediately activated upon completion. Much to her satisfaction, it operated without flaw and produced a bright green blade. The ignition of her weapon was met with the same gesture made by her Master, whom Sunrider then challenged to a practice duel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sunrider wielded her lightsaber in her first combat lesson, during which she was taught to respect her weapon. She next put the lightsaber to use alongside Qel-Droma, as the pair carved gigantic ice sculptures into a frozen cliff face; Sunrider's of her father, and Qel-Droma's of his deceased and nonetheless beloved Jedi Master Arca Jeth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of their second training bout, however, Sunrider had become reckless with her weapon, much to her Master's chagrin. A careless maneuver made, despite Qel-Droma's order to hold, resulted in the inadvertent severing of an extremely precious pendant worn round his neck. Vima soon afterward showed the lightsaber to her mother, famed Jedi Knight Nomi Sunrider, as a symbol of her excellence as an aspiring Jedi. Six years later, via the Great Holocron, Vima Sunrider recollected her time with Qel-Droma and how despite his inability to touch the Force, he was able to successfully instruct her in the creation of her own lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vima Sunrider's lightsaber only appeared in Trials of a Jedi and Master, the fourth and fifth comic issues, respectively, in the Redemption story arc of the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi series. The lightsaber was penciled by veteran Tales of the Jedi artist Christian Gossett in both appearances. The scene in which the lightsaber is created, as well as subsequent scenes in which it is depicted, were all part of months of close collaboration between Gossett and writer Kevin J. Anderson, who worked hand-in-hand with the intention of producing a very emotional storyline throughout the entire Redemption arc."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cover of Master, drawn by Igor Kordey, incorrectly portrays Vima Sunrider's lightsaber with a vivid magenta blade. Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force, which includes an in-universe mention of the lightsaber made by Sunrider, also shows an image of her and her weapon, again drawn incorrectly, now with a blue blade by Tommy Lee Edwards. An image of Sunrider with her lightsaber from Trials of a Jedi is included in her personal entry within The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, along with a brief mention. The lightsaber is also spoken of briefly in the StarWars.com Databank entry for Ulic Qel-Droma."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
