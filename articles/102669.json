Assisted by a Twi'lek female helper, Pablo sold many different items, and was visited by a disguised Obi-Wan Kenobi, Cad Bane, and Moralo Eval, the two former purchasing a helmet and a wide-brimmed hat. Bane noted that Pablo's supply of blasters wasn't up to snuff, and a Phase I clone trooper helmet was dubiously on display inside. A B1-Series battle droid's head was also in the shop."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
