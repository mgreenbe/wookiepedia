Their belief in rule by the strong led them to be fiercely loyal to the Galactic Empire, though Palpatine and other Humanocentric Imperials held the Ailons in contempt. The Empire often hired the Ailon Nova Guard as mercenaries, and sent them into battle expecting them to be slaughtered. Such missions were usually described as glorious battles \"which only the Nova Guard could perform.\" During The Yuuzhan Vong War, they switched their allegiance to the Yuuzhan Vong, aiding the invaders in their conquest of the Inner Rim. Following the war, the planet Ailon was subjected to crippling economic sanctions for their actions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
