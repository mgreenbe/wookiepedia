Almost as soon as word of the droid reached the Exchange, Zhen Mirat snatched the droid up and had it reprogrammed for his own use. X was known to carry around several weapons on his body which included a blaster pistol, a magnablade propeller, and a vibroblade. He was an efficient killer with all of these weapons.
