As soon as Boba saw the maze-like structure of the planet, he began to plot his escape, thinking that he could lose Aurra Sing by leaving her in the maze-like pyramid. There was an incident at customs in which Sing protested leaving her weapons behind, but the presence of an IG-series Assassin droid convinced her to comply.

As soon as he had the card, he began to walk away, towards the turbolifts that gave access to the lower levels, with somebody following him.

However, Sing later arrived at the turbolifts looking for Fett."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once again, due to his uncanny luck, Fett dodged Sing, and she grabbed the young clone, who was known as CT-9779. Boba soon walked away from the scene, and began to search for the bank where his father's money was kept. Before he did anything, he opened the \"book\" Jango gave him, which told him to \"Never seek out help.\" While he was pondering what to do, a supposed Bimm named Nuri approached him. They conversed, and while they were talking, Boba noticed that Aurra Sing was in the same area that he was. Nuri led Boba to the Undercity, where he claimed his father's fortune was. Eventually they arrived at a machine where Nuri attempted to remove all the money from Boba's account. However Boba was able to stop Nuri. Nuri then revealed himself to be a Clawdite, took some of his money and ran off. Boba then learned where to get the rest of his money from and raced off to find it and after outsmarting Aurra Sing, he got the rest of his money and left Aargau in Slave I."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Star Wars: The Clone Wars TV series, Boba Fett is seen with Aurra Sing, but she is playing a role as his mentor.
