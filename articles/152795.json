When the Gungan Jar Jar Binks ran into the street without looking for oncoming traffic, the Gotal narrowly avoided a collision with the Gungan. The speeder bike rider yelled angrily at Binks to get out of the thoroughfare. The Gotal, who had shaggy, brown fur, light brown skin, and long, brown claws, was considered ugly by Anakin Skywalker, Binks's Human companion, who had opted to stay on the sidewalk. The Gotal wore olive-green trousers, brown and black boots, and a fuzzy, black collar with white trim."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gotal appears in the 1999 childrens' book Anakin to the Rescue, written by Cecilia Venn and illustrated by Chris Trevas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
