Eventually, she grew weary of the never-ending conflict and, after witnessing a vision of a Jedi temple covered in blood, Master Isa repurposed a Hammerhead-class cruiser into a traveling temple and hospital, designated \"Sanctuary\". Taking her students with her, she intended to withdraw from the galaxy at large, intending to preserve the teachings of the Jedi regardless of who won or lost any of the wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, conflict soon found its way to her. With the advent of the Mandalorian Wars, battles raged throughout the galaxy once more. Initially providing rescue and medical services to those left in the wake of the destruction, the Sanctuary soon attempted to flee and hide itself in the Koler system. Unfortunately, a Mandalorian strike team found the ship and assaulted it, damaging the ship greatly and taking the lives of those aboard; though Master Isa managed to hide away a valuable holocron and join the battle, she too perished. Thousands of years later, her spirit would help a small group of Force-sensitive individuals rediscover her ship and retrieve the holocron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
