A face was carved into the cliff, something that was common for Nightsister structures. On the top was a room filled with many Nightsister relics, where Nightsisters would go and practice magicks together. Under the cliff was a cave in which the chirodactyl Gorgara fought Cal Kestis. A Nightsister there made potions and elixirs. Some were medicine, while others were poisons. By 14 BBY, the carved-in face was covered in moss and vines."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
