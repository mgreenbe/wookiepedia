In the year 40 ABY, Bralor attended a meeting of Mandalorian clan leaders on behalf of his clan at MandalMotors Hall in Keldabe, the capital city of the planet Mandalore. Along with several other chieftains, mercenaries, and heads of Mandalorian corporations, Bralor met with reigning Mand'alor Boba Fett to discuss the place of Mandalore and its people in the course of the galaxy's latest conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Corellian-led Confederation.
