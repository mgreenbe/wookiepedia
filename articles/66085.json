It was divided into two separate spaces by a curved partition. The main area was an office that contained a large table surrounded by large chairs, one of which had a high back and control panels set into the armrests. An array of artworks and statues were positioned to catch the light of Imperial Center's rising or setting sun through the many windows that provided a view for hundreds of kilometers in every direction. The other space, hidden by the curved partition, was the Emperor's personal quarters. A circular balcony located above the main level housed many cases of texts and storage devices."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
