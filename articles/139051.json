Honna speaked with the Savrips and understood their language using her own Force abilities. The Savrips, feeling sorry for the children, promised to protect them: Should anyone try to take the children against their wills, the Savrips would defy the energy bars of their cell to stop the evil-doers. Honna was glad that it did not happen, because the energy bars could have easily wound or kill the Savrips."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Phylus Mon surgically inserted an explosive near the heart of each of his slaves.
