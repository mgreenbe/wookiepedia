In 43.5 ABY, the conclave of the Raining Leaves Clan and the Broken Columns Clan was moved to this hill due to Nightsister attacks on the conclave. The hill was initially under the control of Jedi Ben Skywalker and his assistant, former Jedi candidate Dyon Stadd, so that neither clan would be represented above the other. When the two clans united to form the Bright Sun Clan, the hill was renamed Bright Sun Hill and the Jedi gave command of the hill to the Clan. The Hill was then attacked by Nightsisters; however, the Nightsisters were defeated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
