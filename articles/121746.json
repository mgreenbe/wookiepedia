The Jedi Order had been destroyed by Order 66. Junda and Kestis' efforts to restore the Jedi Order brought them into conflict with the Inquisitorius of the Galactic Empire. During the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Eno Cordova, former master of Junda, had a Force vision foretelling the doom of the Jedi Order. Cordova sought to safeguard the Order's future by warning the Council, but most of his warnings fell on deaf ears. Jedi Chief Librarian Jocasta Nu, however, heeded Cordova's warnings, providing the Jedi Master with a holocron containing the locations of the known Force-sensitive children of the galaxy, who could be trained as Jedi Initiates to rebuild the Order. Cordova locked his holocron in a Vault on the remote Outer Rim world of Bogano, which could only be opened by a force user with an artifact known as an astrium."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY, Kestis outed himself as a Force user by using telekinesis to save his friend Prauf from falling to death on Bracca, which was recorded by an Imperial viper probe droid. This led the Inquisitorius to track the former Padawan down. The Inquisitorius dispatched the Inquisitors Second Sister and Ninth Sister to Bracca, which in turn led Junda and her Lateron captain Greez Dritus to Cal as they monitored Inquisitorius communications. Cere and Greez rescued Kestis from the Second Sister aboard the Stinger Mantis. Cere recruited Kestis to their secret mission, hoping the young Padawan could succeed her former master. Unbeknownst to Kestis at the time, the Second Sister had once been Junda's Padawan, Trilla Suduri."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the course of the mission, Kestis befriended Eno Cordova's droid companion BD-1 and eventually the Nightsister Merrin, one of the last survivors of the Nightsister massacre by Separatist forces during the Clone Wars. Together, the Mantis crew traveled much of the galaxy, seeking to find an astrium to open the Bogano Vault and retrieve Cordova's holocron, with which they planned to rebuild the Jedi Order. However, upon successfully acquiring the holocron, Kestis' rare power of psychometry caused him to have a Force vision that disabled him long enough for the Second Sister to steal the holocron. After her theft of the holocron, the Second Sister brought it to the Fortress Inquisitorius on the aquatic moon of Nur in the Mustafar system. Although Kestis felt dejected at the loss of the holocron, Cere saw his valor up to that point as demonstrative of passing his Jedi Trials, and thus bestowed on Cal the rank of Jedi Knight. The Mantis crew then went to the Fortress Inquisitorius to rescue the holocron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the Fortress Inquisitorius, the newly Knighted Cal Kestis defeated the Second Sister in one last duel before retrieving Cordova's holocron. Kestis unsuccessfully appealed to the Sister to let go of her hatred, when Junda appealed to Trilla for forgiveness. Just as Trilla came to terms with her past and became ready to forgive Cere, Darth Vader appeared behind her, executing her for her failure. Vader pursued the new and former Jedi Knights, who narrowly escaped with Cordova's holocron. Back aboard the Mantis, Kestis realized that if he contacted the younglings listed in the holocron, he would risk their death and torture at the hands of the Empire. He thus decided to destroy the holocron rather than endangering the younglings, trusting their fate to the will of the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the end of the Clone Wars, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine branded the Jedi as enemies of the state, accusing them of treason, ostensibly for the arrest attempt they conducted against him. Palpatine, whose true identity was the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, initiated Order 66; thereby commanding all clone troopers to murder their Jedi Generals and Commanders, and ordered his new Sith apprentice, Darth Vader, to conduct a Siege of the Jedi Temple. Sidious then reorganized the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire and declared himself Galactic Emperor. The Jedi Order was destroyed through Order 66. Any surviving Jedi were hunted down during the Great Jedi Purge, the efforts of which were overseen by Vader and the Inquisitorius, an organization of former Jedi that turned to the dark side of the Force and were tasked by Emperor Palpatine with killing all surviving Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of these surviving Jedi was a Padawan named Cal Kestis. Kestis was aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer the Albedo Brave with his Lasat master Jaro Tapal in orbit of Bracca when Order 66 was proclaimed. The clones of Tapal's 13th Battalion betrayed Tapal and Kestis. Tapal fought off his former clones, allowing Cal to escape to the planet below, but the Lasat succumbed to his injuries while Cal escaped. Kestis went into hiding after Order 66, finding work with the Scrapper Guild on Bracca, where he was able to live low as a rigger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a worker on Bracca, Kestis's only true friend was a fellow worker, Prauf. During one job, a Venator-class Star Destroyer being scrapped became loose, causing Prauf and Kestis to slip and fall. Kestis managed to hang onto the ship, but his friend Prauf was unable to hold on. Acting desperately, Kestis reached out and used the Force to save his friend, an act witnessed by an Imperial viper probe droid. Prauf realized that Cal had the talents of a Jedi and cautioned Cal to be careful as there were bounties out for \"people like him\". Cal responded angrily, informing Prauf that he already knew that.

Stormtroopers brought them outside, where they were confronted by Purge Troopers, the Ninth Sister, and the Second Sister, who informed the workers that they were looking for a Jedi and failure for them to step forward would result in all of them facing execution. Prauf stepped forward, and, in an effort to protect his friend, spoke out against the Empire. The Second Sister killed him with her lightsaber. Kestis responded by striking at the Second Sister's lightsaber with his lightsaber, but the Second Sister used the Force to push the Padawan towards the Ninth Sister, who dropped him from a ledge onto a moving train after Kestis activated his lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First mission to Bogano"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thereafter, Kestis fled aboard the Stinger Mantis, joining Cere Junda and Greez Dritus on their mission to rebuild the order.

Kestis and BD-1 entered the Bogano Vault and found Jedi Master Eno Cordova's message about the Jedi holocron enclosed within.

Upon entering Eilram's burial chamber, BD-1 showed Kestis a recording of Jedi Master Eno Cordova visiting the tomb.

Kestis and the Partisans successfully freed the Wookiees being held at the Imperial Refinery, and Kestis made contact with Tarrful, by then leading the Kashyyyk resistance.

There, BD-1 discovered climbing claws on the corpse of a Nightbrother. Kestis went to pick up the claws so they could climb out of the Swamp, but the pair were attacked by the Gorgara. Kestis managed to fend off the Gorgara long enough for the chirodactyl to retreat, allowing them to climb towards the Strangled Cliffs.

In the vision, Tapal's specter crushed Kestis' lightsaber, which had been a gift from Tapal. Shortly after, Malicos questioned Kestis about going into the ruins, but Kestis didn't want to talk to him.

Cal felt despaired, but soon realized he could use the two halves of the original crystal to construct a new lightsaber.

As Kestis and BD-1 moved into the Tomb of Kujet, they came upon Merrin. This time, however, she was willing to talk. Attempting to reason with her again, Kestis insisted that Malicos had lied to her about the Jedi. Naturally, the Nightsister was skeptical, so Kestis disavowed Malicos as a fallen Jedi and passed her his lightsaber as a show of trust, stating that possessing such a weapon doesn't make one a Jedi, and explained the Order's role as peacekeepers before they were betrayed and hunted to extinction. In turn, Kestis learned that she might be the only survivor of the Nightsister massacre carried out by General Grievous during the Clone Wars.
