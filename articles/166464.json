They were native to the planet Absit, located in the south-western portion of the Outer Rim. During the Galactic Civil War, the Yatir were sympathetic to the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The Galactic Empire became aware of that sympathy and tried to suppress the humanoids, initially without full success. Ultimately, the Hell's Hammers, under the command of Colonel \"Rancor\" Johans, traveled to Absit and finally subjugated the Yatir. Shortly after that battle, Johans was promoted to High Colonel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Greg Gorden created the Yatir for the Imperial Sourcebook, which was published in 1989 as a supplement to the West End Games' roleplaying game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
