These parasitic worms absorbed components, such as batteries, as they grew along electrical conduits, which were then turned into organs. They had eye threads and resistor segments, as well as capacitor beads to store energy, extending from body core segments. A conduit worm's feeler threads could grow hundreds of meters long, and mouth cups often grew at their ends. They had gray-and-brown skin and black eyes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Conduit worms were known to sneak aboard ships and eat their electrical wiring while the vessel was still in flight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Conduit worms in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thousands of years of urbanization on the planet Coruscant led to the evolution of many unique forms of wildlife in its underworld, including conduit worms.
