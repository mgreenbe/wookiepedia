The weapon had a maximum range of three hundred and fifty meters; however, the greater range of the weapon meant that the Model G8 was more expensive than equivalent blaster rifles, retailing for between 1,100 and 1,250 credits. Weighing four and a half kilograms, the Model G8's housing was also more fragile and did not stand up to extensive wear and tear."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Produced during the last decades of the Galactic Republic, the Model G8 was a weapon popular with police forces and authorities around the Tion Hegemony and Hutt Space.
