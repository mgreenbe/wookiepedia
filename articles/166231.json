Centuries before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the neighboring Arkanians, known for their genetic experiments, implanted the naturally dim-witted species with cybernetic implants. Some Arkanians saw this effort as beneficial to the Yaka, while other socially-conscious Arkanians questioned the ethical implications of such an act."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yakas appeared as tall, brutish-looking, near-Humans with obvious signs of possessing cybernetic implants. Their average height was around 2 meters and they possessed a large frame with limbs to match. A cybernetic brain was implanted in each Yaka at birth, giving them genius-level mental abilities. This modification was what made the Yaka one of the most intelligent and technologically advanced species in the known galaxy and universe. Also due to this, a Yaka's face commonly lacked any expression."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A sometimes dangerous side effect from the cybernetic tinkering done in a Yaka's brain was all Yaka were left with a severely twisted sense of humor. Their minds raced with accelerated thought processes and were quickly bored by their own thoughts. They kept themselves occupied by making sarcastic comments and playing practical jokes on others. They also seemed to have an uncanny ability to find irony in grim situations when others did not."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yakas bore children like most humanoid species and chose to implant their children themselves, desiring them to have the same intelligence they possessed. Their cybernetics had a similarity to those of Ganks, although they were far more advanced. Senior Anthropologist Mammon Hoole was noted to have made a comment about Gank circuitry being the beta testing for the final implementation on the Yaka."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
