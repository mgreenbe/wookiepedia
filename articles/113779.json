Renalda asked a Republic-allied individual to rescue Braedon, but Braedon told the hero that the Justicars would simply capture him again if his name remained in their file of curfew violations. While the individual destroyed the files, Braedon went into hiding and told them that he would contact Renalda when it was safe.
