Flekk entered the Imperial Academy at age seventeen and eventually rose to the rank of lieutenant. Flekk was highly decorated during his time in service and was eventually transferred to the YT-2400 light freighter Predator's Beak. However, it crash-landed on the planet Yorgraxx and was left with no functioning engines of communication systems, while Flekk and Vor Harkass were the only survivors. After they had been there over a month, they encountered the surviving crew of a crashed Rebel Alliance ship and they joined forces.
