Headdresses had snake like appendages growing out of them, and had a rudimentary connection to the Shaper's mental state. Shaper headdresses could take various forms, usually linking together into a ball (giving an appearance similar to the turbans used by the Intendant caste) or would simply stick out (making them look similar to Ho'Dins)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
