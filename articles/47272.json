They had a vaguely humanoid figure, being bipedal with a single pair of upper manipulative appendages. They had a double set of eyelids, light-colored eyes, and pale blue-gray skin. They had long, humanoid faces with slanted, almond-shaped eyes, a long nose, large ears and a cranial ridge. It is unknown whether females of the species share this trait or if it is exclusively a distinguishing attribute of the males. Doctor Nuvo Vindi was a member of this race."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jason Fry, the author of Star Wars: The Clone Wars: The Visual Guide, stated on the Jedi Council Forums in August 2009 that this species was called the Faust.

This reference was removed from the final version of the book, and according to Fry, Vindi's species was unclear at that time. The June 2010 publication of Fry's Star Wars: The Clone Wars Character Encyclopedia, stating that Vindi was a Faust, made the name official."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
