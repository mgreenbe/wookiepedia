The Jedi had recently discovered the wreckage of a Hutt Clan starship attacked by the Nihil in the Kazlin system, which had been carrying a load of Vratixian barley that originated there. Jedi Master Sskeer was dispatched to investigate, accompanied by Ceret, but the Kotabi Jedi went missing after venturing into a field, which was only noticed by Terec, Ceret's bond-twin. Subsequently, Marshal Avar Kriss and Jedi Knight Keeve Trennis ventured to Sedri Minor themselves, only to encounter the Drengir, dangerous sentient plants."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
