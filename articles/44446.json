They were used to keep a vessel steady in turbulent environments. A vessel that used an energy tether was commonly anchored to a larger vessel to keep it steady as it entered turbulent environments. The tether was usually controlled from the smaller vessel and could be lengthened or shortened. If an energy tether was broken, it could be easily restored by increasing energy output to the tether's projector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
