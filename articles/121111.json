With its repulsorlift ability came a higher financial cost and a reduced carrying capability: Only two metric tons, compared to the SRV-1's three. In addition, the power generator was only able to power either the repulsorlift or the blaster cannon at any one time, which forced the SRV/R-1 to stand still and fight when confronted, or retreat without being able to fire back."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
