Upon impact they exploded into sticky acid globs that ate through the metals of the hulls of spacecraft, making them more vulnerable to laser fire. This made breachers effective even when the missiles were destroyed en route to their targets, because the acid would keep going for a certain range where it could still damage enemy starships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
