During the Galactic Civil War, Baht flew it to Tatooine, where he was hoping to supply the Rebel Alliance with blasters. However, upon arriving in the Tatoo system, the ship was attacked by an Imperial customs ship and Baht could only evade it by flying into a dust storm. The storm was very violent and the Savrip had suffered damage to its stabilizers, which caused it to crash into the surface of Tatooine, near Anchorhead. Baht was killed, but not before sending an emergency transmission to his Alliance contacts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
