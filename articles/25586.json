One gambit in the game was to move out the Empress, the most powerful piece; however, such a gambit was not advisable unless no other option was available. Several months after the Battle of Endor, General Jylia Shale compared moving the Galactic Empire's last Executor-class Star Dreadnought Ravager to the planet Akiva to moving the empress in a chatta-ragul game, claiming it should be held in reserve. She also compared Galactic Emperor Palpatine's use of the Death Star at the Battle of Yavin to an unsuccessful Empress gambit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chatta-ragul was first mentioned in the novel Aftermath, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released in 2015."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It appears to have been similar to chess, based on the names of the pieces: minions and scouts equivalent to pawns, knights being the same in both game, pontiffs being equivalent to bishops (both \"pontiff\" and \"bishop\" are titles of clergy), alcazar being the rook (\"alcazar\" means \"fortress\"), and the empress being equivalent to the queen, both in name and in the fact that these are the most powerful pieces in the respective games."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
