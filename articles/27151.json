They used their secret police, the Absolutes, to keep the inhabitants of the Worker sector under control. In 47 BBY the Workers rebelled against the Civilized government. The Workers managed to win and a democratic government was installed. An energy wall dividing the two sectors was taken down. Many people in the Civilized sector still supported the Absolutists and the old government. When Qui-Gon visited the city in 41 BBY he thought that the poorer Worker sector was in stark contrast to the Civilized sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
