By 3 ABY, it was involved in an accident when it was carrying volatile cargo while under the command of a drunk captain, leading to the deaths of numerous crew members. Everi Chalis, an emissary to the Imperial Ruling Council, subsequently punished the crew of the Mandible during the Belnar Insurrections, having those responsible for the accident executed. Rather than admitting this act of incompetence on the part of one of its officers, the Empire instead credited Chalis for her ruthless punishing of the crew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, Chalis, who had since defected to the Rebel Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry and while still pretending to be a member of the Empire, cited her punishments on the crew of the Mandible as a threat to the crew of an Imperial heavy freighter in the Redhurne system. This was done in order to make the freighter change its course, intending for the starship to fall into a trap set by the 61st. Chalis then briefly told the story of the Mandible to Hazram Namir, a First Sergeant in the rebel company, shortly thereafter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mandible was mentioned in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
