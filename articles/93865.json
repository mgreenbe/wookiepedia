The mechanical tools of the multitool could not be used for long periods of time, since doing so could overheat the multitool. Despite their drawbacks multitools could be found in the tool kits of both aspiring and professional mechanics alike."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A typical personal multitool came with 5-cm vibroblade, a low power hydrospanner, a small hydrogrip, a toothpick and a small set of eating utensils.
