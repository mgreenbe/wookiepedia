Rol and the others stayed with 8t88 as he worked for the Galactic Empire on the moon Sulon, and worked out of the Sulon Government House.

Rol, unable to tell the difference between a tuning stylus and a testing probe, handed 8t88 a testing probe. 8t88 angrily threw it back at him, took the right instrument, and proceeded to wonder how a biological like Rol could live."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The coatroom debacle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once 8t88's arm was fully installed, the droid sent Rol to find the majordomo, as 8t88 had come to realize that his supposed VIP suite was a coatroom. Rol found the majordomo, only for him to take his time in actually heeding Rol's call. When the majordomo did answer, he preceded Rol up the stairs that led to 8t88's quarters. 8t88 and the majordomo discussed the latter's duplicity on the nature of their coatroom suite, which led 8t88 to eventually execute the man; the majordomo's death ended up invigorating the rest of the staff.

Rol was subject to 8t88's abuse, simply because Rol was a biological being. 8t88 also referred to Rol as an idiot for not being able to identify a tuning stylus. However, when 8t88 demanded that Rol fetch the Government House's majordomo, Rol shrugged the reasoning for the demand off as one of 8t88's eccentricities. Rol became uneasy when the majordomo first presented himself to 8t88, and wrinkled his nose at the smell of the majordomo's urine as it pooled at the man's feet as he died."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rol first appeared in the 1998 novella Dark Forces: Rebel Agent, which was written by science-fiction author William C. Dietz. Although Rol is identified as a male in the novella, Rol's voice in the audio adaption of the novella is distinctly feminine. However, as the novella explicitly refers to Rol as a male, this article treats Rol as a male individual. In addition, Rol has no dialogue in the novella. Another difference between the audio drama and the novella is how Rol retrieves the majordomo. In the novella, Rol leaves 8t88's quarters to personally find the majordomo, whereas in the audio drama Rol sent for the majordomo, who then arrived without Rol ever leaving the room."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rol's voice actor in the audio drama was not credited."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
