Despite that, they managed to hide in their native oceanic depths. Sandos had heavily muscled bodies that looked almost feline, with strong limbs ending in finned claws that propelled them through the depths. Their front legs ended in hands that could be used to grasp prey."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their huge mouths allowed them to swallow most other creatures of the Abyss in a single gulp. Using their razor-sharp teeth, they were also the only predators capable of biting through the hard shells of the opee sea killers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their life-spans typically reached one hundred standard years. However, a sando aqua monster killed by Darth Vader was estimated to be approximately 932 standard years old. According to ZED-6-7, their life cycles were glacially slow and their population was incredibly small.

Although the Gungans, the sentient amphibians native to Naboo, rarely encountered living specimens, there were reports of washed-up sando corpses on beaches. For most inhabitants of Naboo, the sando aqua monster was more of a terrifying myth than a reality."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 32 BBY, a sando aqua monster attacked and killed an opee sea killer and a colo claw fish that were chasing a Gungan sub."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point during the reign of Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, two poachers captured a baby sando aqua monster and hid it in the royal boathouse, prompting its mother to lay siege to the building. The Queen herself intervened, setting the young creature free so it could swim away with its genitrix."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the duel on Cloud City, Darth Vader visited Naboo with Sab\u00e9 in order to track down security footage from Padm\u00e9's Coruscant apartment, which would lead him to the people who hid his son's birth from him. In reality, this venture turned out to be a trap set by the Amidalans: a group of rebels who believed Vader was responsible for Padm\u00e9's death, as well as the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. After bringing Vader below the surface, they used a device to summon a sando aqua monster to devour him. However, Vader killed the beast, becoming the first person on record to kill one. ZED-6-7, a forensics droid, calculated that the creature's death increased the odds of the species' extinction by eighty-three percent due to its small population and glacially slow cycle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sando aqua monsters in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sabine Wren painted a stylized sando aqua monster on the Phantom's hull."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
