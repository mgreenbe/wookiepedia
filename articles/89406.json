The crane, like most other cranes, had a claw like arm which it used to grab objects and place them somewhere else. The vehicle also sported the Metalorn crest on both its sides. The crane was painted yellow, and had room for just one driver towards the front on the vehicle, and had no room for any passengers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 19 BBY, Senator Bail Organa traveled to Metalorn to tour the world and find out how the operations on the planet were run. Earlier, Organa had duped the Foreman of the Techno Union, Wat Tambor, into thinking that Alderaan wanted to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems, as well as telling him that he wanted to convert Alderaan into a factory world like Metalorn, and wanted to receive a tour of the world. In reality, Organa was journeying to Metalorn to free the imprisoned Jedi Master Shaak Ti, who had been captured by the Techno Union. During the tour, Organa and company witnessed the Metalorn garbage cranes hard at work in the Wasteland of Metalorn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
