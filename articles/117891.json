While she was particularly friendly to humans, Ruku could barely tolerate her coworker, Mannee. Unbeknownst to her companions, \"Ruku\" was not her real name, but rather a false identity she had lived under for years. She belonged to a clan that was sentenced for extermination by Navik the Red. During a hunting outing with her coworkers and business associates, they were ambushed in a cavern and Ruku was killed by a group of Rodian bounty hunters. The rest of the hunting party were forced to leave her body behind in order to beat a hasty retreat. It was later revealed to her companions by Navik's Protectors that Ruku was \"a criminal\" and thereby sentenced to death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ruku, however, had faked her death, later stowing away in a weapons crate for a safe passage off Rodia.
