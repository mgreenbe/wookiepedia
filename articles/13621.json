It wasn't easy as the field was filled with Heavy Anti-Air turrets, which would destroy the fighters and the rest of the force very quickly. Fortunately with Confederacy cruisers, which were brought to assist Tann, she was able to slowly make way to the asteroid with facing a little resistance from the Republic fighters.\nEventually making it to the asteroid, she ordered to destroy the supply depots, so she could get enough resources to set up a base on it. Meanwhile the Republic troops stationed on the asteroid led a periodic attacks to the enemy base, though it didn't faze them at all.\nThen, after gathering enough troops, she devastated the rest of the Republic forces and destroyed the power relay to Sarapin's shield."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the collapse of the planetary shield at the hands of the Confederacy, Sarapin was then left for the taking."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
