Led by OOM-9 and assisted by Darth Maul, a contingent of battle droids and aquatic destroyers attacked and besieged Otoh Gunga. Demoralized and defeated, Boss Nass informed the Rep Council of the situation, trying to convince the Reps they needed to evacuate soon before the city was destroyed. Many members of the council wanted to stay, but Rep Been finally convinced them to go.
