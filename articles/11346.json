Some of those appendages were identical to the arms and hands of the typical B2, though the droid possessed more than two of them. The other ended with buzzsaws and could be used by the droid in hand-to-hand combat. One such droid was spotted on Simocadia, when the Separatist Droid Army attempt to take over the clone troopers guarding a Republic agrocite mine. The droid used his multiple hand appendages to wrestle with the clone trooper, while using his buzzsaws to inflict damage to him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
