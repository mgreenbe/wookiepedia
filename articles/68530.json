At some point, Bowmani married to Letta Turmond. Bowmani was originally working as a man in charge of maintenance in the temple platform. According to Bowmani's wife, it was his dream to work for the Jedi and he had passed all of the entry tests with \"flying colors\". In 20 BBY, Bowmani was fed Nano-droids by his wife, and was used to blow up the Temple's hangar, killing six Jedi, clones, and other hangar workers in the process and destroying all but his hand. At first, it was assumed that Bowmani handled the action of the attack willingly until Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano went to his home and arrested Turmond after she attempted to flee and admitted to putting the nanobots in the food to turn Bowmani into a walking bomb. Turmond, prior to her death, later stated that she had been requested to do so by a disgruntled member of the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the upper limbs of an Abyssin normally end in two claws and an opposable thumb, the hand of Bowmani shown in \"Sabotage\" was Human-like in appearance, with four fingers and no claws."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
