Close to a century and a half later, in 60 BBY, the title of Mand'alor\u2014the traditional leader of the Mandalorian clans\u2014was claimed by a charismatic soldier by the name of Jaster Mereel; a respected and highly principled man, formerly a Journeyman Protector of Concord Dawn, Mereel sympathized with the clans' dissatisfaction and set out to institute a reform. He revived and modernized the ancient Canons of Honor that the Mandalorians of the past had once followed, creating a series of several hundred commandments governing moral Mandalorian behavior, which he entitled the Supercommando Codex. The Codex, like the Canons before it, drew heavily from the Resol'nare, the six central tenets of the Mandalorian culture.

More dangerously, though, were the Mandalorian rogues Mereel had sought to reign in: immoral mercenaries who enjoyed their lives of lawlessness and unaccountability, and would-be revanchists, conspiring against the peaceful New Mandalorians who they saw as an affront to the Mandalorians' warrior traditions. Under the leadership of the barbaric Tor Vizsla, these outlaws banded together in order to oppose Mereel's reforms, calling their new splinter faction the Death Watch; Death Watch dreamed of a return to the ways of the ancient Mandalorians and the downfall of the hated New Mandalorians, and plotted to eventually wage a second war of conquest across the galaxy. From numerous clans and Mandalore's full-time army, those who were most loyal to Mereel and his ideals rallied to their leader, recasting themselves as \"True Mandalorians\" in opposition to the Death Watch outcasts.

There, the True Mandalorians engaged the Death Watch in a lengthy firefight, but were ultimately forced to withdraw, scattering their forces while retreating into the fields of crops belonging to the local farmers. Mereel and his troops found refuge on the homestead of the Fett family, but Death Watch soon followed, intent on destroying the True Mandalorians. They savagely interrogated the father of the family and threatened the life of his young son, Jango Fett, if he refused to provide Death Watch with the True Mandalorians' location. Chaos broke out when the boy's mother attempted to defend her son and husband with a blaster rifle, leading to the death of the young Fett's parents and the kidnapping of his sister, Arla, when Death Watch struck back.

In the belief that they had been victorious in finishing off the True Mandalorians, the Death Watch rode into the town with intentions to pillage as they pleased before moving on, but when a Death Watch soldier accosted an older man with a walking stick on the street, the individual revealed himself to be a True Mandalorian in disguise, throwing aside his cloak and stick as he opened fire. From the overhead balcony of a nearby building, the True Mandalorian soldier Montross fired down on the Death Watch, his shots providing cover as the young Fett planted an explosive mine on the underside of Death Watch's armored transport; as soon as Fett was clear, the mine was detonated and the tank was destroyed.

In 52 BBY, six years after Death Watch's defeat, the True Mandalorians were contracted by the Korda Defense Force to extract a team of rookie security personnel pinned down under fire on the planet Korda Six by a group of local hostiles. Intelligence collected by the Kordans indicated these native fighters were poorly armed and without a formal army, and upon accepting the job, the True Mandalorians traveled to the Korda system in the Inner Rim. En route to their destination, the members of the True Mandalorians were briefed for the coming mission, first by Jaster Mereel, who outlined the objective and the mission parameters, and then by Montross, who issued assignments to the troops. For the Kordan job, the forces of the True Mandalorians were divided into three units: Vertigo Company, a jetpack-equipped aerial unit under Montross' command; Headhunter Company, the armed extraction team under Jaster Mereel's command, tasked with recovering the security personnel; and Jango's grunts, a rear-guard unit assigned to defend the landing zone and provide cover fire, under the command of Jango Fett.

With the True Mandalorians gone, Fett grew distant from the rest of the Mandalorian people and his role as Mand'alor, assuming a solitary life as a lone bounty hunter until his death."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Montross"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Mandalorian soldier with a fearsome reputation, when the Death Watch formed in opposition to Jaster Mereel, Montross was one of many who rallied to the Mand'alor, proclaiming themselves to be the True Mandalorians. Montross was one of several Mandalorian hardliners who demanded Mereel take definitive action against the Death Watch, and as civil war broke out, Montross followed Mereel into battle against Death Watch. On Concord Dawn, Montross took part in an ambush that devastated Death Watch forces and nearly saw the death of the rogue sect's leader, Tor Vizsla; even as the victorious True Mandalorians made to depart the Outer Rim world, Montross lagged behind, shooting down fleeing Death Watch stragglers until Mereel ordered him to stand down. Montross and Mereel were often at odds over issues of tactics and Montross' own tendency to inflict levels of collateral damage that Mereel found unacceptable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, during the True Mandalorians mission to extract a security team under fire from local hostiles on Korda Six, Montross was placed in command of Vertigo Company, a unit of jetpack-equipped troops tasked with providing air support for True Mandalorian forces on the ground. Though the True Mandalorians incurred severe casualties due to the overwhelming hostile Kordans, Montross and Vertigo Company pressed their attack, disobeying Jaster Mereel's orders to fall back. Mereel personally rescued Montross from the Kordans, but when the Death Watch revealed their presence on the planet and attacked the True Mandalorians, Montross left Mereel to die to enemy fire, having grown tired of taking orders from him. Falling back to the True Mandalorians' landing zone, Montross insisted the Mandalorians retreat in accordance with Mereel's last order, and presented himself as the best choice to succeed Mereel as leader. However, when Jango Fett\u2014Mereel's surrogate son and fellow True Mandalorian\u2014arrived back at the extraction point carrying Mereel's body, he revealed Montross' betrayal. The True Mandalorians rallied behind Fett and appointed him the new Mand'alor, while Montross was forced into exile. Banished from Mandalorian society, Montross became a bounty hunter known for his ruthlessness. He later competed with Fett for a bounty on the leader of the Bando Gora cult after Fett, too, became a bounty hunter following the destruction of the True Mandalorians on Galidraan. In a final confrontation between the former allies-turned-enemies, Fett defeated Montross on Bogden's moon of Kohlma, and left him to be torn apart by mindless Bando Gora cultists."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Silas"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Human male Mandalorian, Silas grew up among the forces of the True Mandalorians. At a young age, he maintained a friendship with Jango Fett, the young surrogate son of Mand'alor Jaster Mereel, whom he respected and admired greatly. When the True Mandalorians were contracted to extract a security team pinned down under heavy fire on Korda Six, Silas and Fett fought alongside each other in the fierce battle that ensued, moving to rescue the security officers while the bulk of the True Mandalorians engaged the native Kordan warriors. At the extraction site, however, Silas and the other members of his unit were ambushed by a resurgent contingent of the Death Watch splinter group; though Silas was unfamiliar with the group, having joined with the True Mandalorians some time after the Death Watch's assumed destruction on Concord Dawn, he quickly adapted and engaged their new enemy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Jaster Mereel came under attack by the Death Watch, Jango Fett rushed to his adopted father's aid, with Silas close behind. Upon reaching the battlefield, the two soldiers found that they were too late: in a hail of cannon fire from an armored tank, Death Watch leader Tor Vizsla struck down Mereel, while Silas was forced to restrain Fett from running to Mereel's side and joining the Mand'alor in death. When Vizsla departed, satisfied that Mereel was dead, Fett and Silas recovered Mereel's body, and returned with it to the True Mandalorians' landing zone. There, they found Mereel's traitorous second in command, Montross, attempting to succeed Mereel as the new Mand'alor. Fett objected, on the grounds that Montross had abandoned Mereel to die alone on the battlefield, and Silas rallied to his comrade, insisting that if anyone should take Mereel's place, it should be Fett. With the backing of Silas and the other True Mandalorians, Fett became the new leader of their group, as well as the new Mand'alor. Silas followed Fett faithfully, but when the True Mandalorians were destroyed at Galidraan, Silas was absent from the battle. Years later, he was captured by the former Jedi Master Dooku and brutally tortured for information on Jango Fett. Upon finally relenting and relating his time with Fett to Dooku, Silas was subsequently killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The True Mandalorians first appeared in Star Wars canon in the 2002 comic series Jango Fett: Open Seasons, written by W.
