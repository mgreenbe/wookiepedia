The atmosphere of the tapcafe was light and airy, and dimly lit booths lined the walls. The middle of the tapcafe was filled with freestanding tables and chairs, and a long bar dominated the wall opposite the main entrance. The tapcafe could seat over two hundred individuals, and a small orchestra and dance floor was set up at the front of the main bar. The bar was made of exotic woods and polished stones set on a raised platform. A casino was located behind the bar area, with sabacc tables, dice games, and Lady Luck. Considered the most popular tapcafe in the spaceport, it was owned by Crev Bombaasa. In 8 ABY, it was managed by Breslin Drake. Shada D'ukal and Talon Karrde visited here in their search for Jorj Car'das during the Caamas Document Crisis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
