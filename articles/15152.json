The Confederate General Grievous and Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress planned to attack the Wild Space planet Kamino in order to end the Republic's production of clone troopers based there, but a Republic listening post on the Rishi moon near Kamino prevented their fleet from entering the system undetected. Grievous therefore decided to capture the post before attacking Kamino to avoid alerting the nearby Republic fleet to his invasion. He deployed BX-series droid commandos to the moon in a boarding ship, and the inexperienced Republic troopers at the base failed to spot the approaching Confederate ship within a meteor shower. The battle droids then attacked the clones, taking them by surprise and hot-wiring the base's all-clear signal so that they were unable to send word to the Republic fleet of the attack. While the droids overran the base, clone troopers Echo, Fives, Hevy, and Cutup fled the base through a ventilation shaft. Outside, however, Cutup was killed by a Rishi eel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Clone Commander Cody and Clone Captain Rex arrived for a routine inspection of the base. They were ambushed by the droid commandos but managed to escape and soon found the three surviving clone troopers. The clones then tricked the droids into opening the main doors of the listening post and quickly retook the base. When the commando droids stopped responding, Grievous sent a group of battle droids to investigate. Realizing that they couldn't defeat all of the reinforcements, the clones devised a plan to destroy the listening post with liquid Tibanna in order to shut off its hot-wired all-clear signal and warn the Republic fleet of the attack. Before they evacuated the base, however, Rex noticed that the remote detonator wasn't responding, so Hevy stayed behind to address the problem while the other clones escaped the base through a ventilation shaft. The invading battle droids entered the station's command center and opened fire on Hevy, injuring him. Hevy then manually detonated the explosive, sacrificing himself to destroy the droids and listening post to cut off the all-clear signal. Alerted to the attack, the Republic fleet arrived and intercepted Grievous's fleet, forcing the Confederate ships to retreat. Following the Republic victory, Echo and Fives were both inducted into the 501st Legion, and the late Hevy was honored for his bravery and sacrifice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, during the Clone Wars, the Galactic Republic began to utilize listening posts in the Outer Rim Territories to monitor Confederate activity. Due to the high amount of casualties suffered by the Grand Army of the Republic, new clone troopers were assigned to these stations without undergoing the customary intensive training most clones experienced before beginning duty. A number of these rookie clones, nicknamed \"shinies\"\u2014a derogatory term referring to the troopers' spotless armor that had not yet seen action in battle\u2014were assigned to Rishi Station, a crucial listening post located near the Wild Space planet Kamino on the moon of Rishi, under the command of Clone Sergeant CT-19-7409, nicknamed \"O'Niner.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seeking to end the production of the Republic's clone troopers on Kamino, the Confederate General Grievous planned to invade Kamino with the Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress and a fleet of Munificent-class star frigates and Lucrehulk-class Droid Control Ships. However, Rishi Station played a key role in the protection of the area of space around Rishi and Kamino, and as long as the station was active, the Republic fleet would be warned of any Confederate activity in the area. In order to overcome this obstacle, Grievous decided to capture the station before continuing with his plan to invade Kamino."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Confederate assault"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grievous deployed a squad of elite BX-series droid commandos in a Droch-class boarding ship to the Rishi moon to capture the base there. While the incoming pod hid within a meteor shower, the clone troopers inside the listening post raised the outpost's shields to avoid meteor damage. After landing with the meteors, the droid commandos emerged from their pods and stealthily made their way to the base, killing CT-327, a clone deck officer who was keeping watch outside the station, along the way. When the clones in the base lost contact with CT-327, Sergeant O'Niner sent clone troopers Nub and Droidbait to search for him, but the two clones were quickly killed by the attacking droids. O'Niner left the command center of the base to repel the invading droids and ordered trooper CT-782, nicknamed \"Hevy,\" to sound the alarm and alert the Republic fleet.

Meanwhile, the leader of the commando droids contacted Grievous via hologram and informed him of their success. The cyborg general ordered the droids to leave the station's all-clear signal on, which, if turned off, would alert the nearby Republic fleet to the Separatist presence in the system. This kept the Republic oblivious to the attack and unaware of the incoming Confederate fleet's continued journey toward Kamino. Through a hologram transmission, Ventress reported to Grievous that she had infiltrated Kamino and that everything was ready for the invasion. Meanwhile, the rookie clone troopers emerged from the other side of the ventilation shaft and became situated underneath the listening post's landing pad.

After Cody contacted the base, a commando droid, disguised in clone trooper armor, answered the transmission. The commando droid told the clone officers that the base didn't need an inspection, but the clones were unconvinced, and continued to fly toward the listening post. They landed their Nu-class attack shuttle, the Obex, near the base's entrance, and were greeted by a commando droid disguised in clone armor. After the rookie clone troopers launched a droid attack flare, Rex noticed the flare in the distance and promptly shot the droid in the head."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Rex took off the clone's helmet, revealing that the clone was a droid, commando droids stationed behind the crates surrounding the clone officers emerged from their hiding spots and began to shoot at them.

Cody and Rex found the surviving rookie clone troopers\u2014Echo, Fives, and Hevy\u2014and ordered them to take off their helmets, believing that they were droids in disguise. After the clones complied with the order, Rex began to address them with the derogatory \"shinie\" slang. When a Rishi eel again appeared, Rex quickly dispatched the creature with a single blaster shot to the eye.

Commando droid units 07, 08, and 09 noticed that there was something different with Rex's vocabulator and ordered him to take off his helmet for identification. Rex took of his helmet but propped up a droid head in front himself to trick the droids into opening the door. When the commando droids opened the blast doors, the clones ambushed the droids and destroyed them, continuing on to ambush the other droids stationed inside the listening post's main control room. After retaking the listening post, the clones found that the commando droids had hardwired the station's all-clear signal.

After Echo recalled to the clone captain that their duty was to protect and defend the base, Rex dismissed his concerns, stating that if the base was destroyed, it would deactivate the signal and alert the nearby Republic fleet of the impending Separatist invasion. To destroy the base, Echo offered the use of highly explosive liquid Tibanna, which was used as a fuel source at the station when the Rishi moon entered its freezing cycle. While Rex and Echo went to retrieve the base's plunk droids that stored the liquid Tibanna, Cody, Hevy, and Fives grabbed weaponry from the listening post's supply room."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Outside, Cody, Hevy, and Fives began to fire at the approaching droids. The clones tried to hold off the droids before they could enter the base, but the droids' fire overwhelmed the clones and forced them to retreat back into the listening post. When the clones attempted to detonate the Tibanna inside the plunk droids, they found that the remote activator did not function properly. Hevy offered to stay behind and correct the problem before joining the other clones as they fled the listening post through a nearby ventilation shaft. After hearing the invading droids, Hevy left the control room and hid in an adjacent hallway to avoid detection. Meanwhile, outside the base, Rex found that Hevy hadn't yet evacuated the listening post. He contacted Hevy via comlink, but Hevy refused to evacuate the listening post until he was able to repair the detonator. Unwilling to accept Hevy's decision, the clones ran to aid the rookie trooper. Hevy, who had been hiding from the droids, utilized his Z-6 rotary blaster cannon to fire at the battle droids.

As the all-clear signal was cut off from the listening post, the nearby Republic fleet\u2014under the command of Admiral Wullf Yularen and Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker\u2014was alerted to the danger.
