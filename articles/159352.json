With the time sensitive nature of the distress call, Admiral Gial Ackbar ordered Echo Squadron to intervene, deploying them as the first wave. The squadron arrived at Fostar to see the refugee convoy being harassed by Imperial TIE fighters and a blockade of larger ships, including the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Vigilance. In the chaos of the battle, Echo Squadron managed to hold off the enemy forces until the rest of the Alliance Fleet arrived. Worried about the safety of the refugees, Imperial defector Lindon Javes requested Echo Four's assistance in an attack run on the Vigilance. The pair successfully destroyed the Star Destroyer's targetting system, allowing the convoy and the fleet to jump to hyperspace. Echo Four was commended for this act of bravery, and rewarded with a safe posting on Chandrila."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Vanguard Squadron"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle of Endor, Lindon Javes, now a ranking officer of the New Republic, requested the pilot to be assigned to Vanguard Squadron aboard the Temperance.

Antilles had worked with Talus Group to chase away the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Victorum from a medical convoy, pinning it in Yavin's upper atmosphere with a non-functioning hyperdrive. However, the Star Destroyer's complement of fighters proved too much for Talus Group alone, and they required the help of Vanguard Squadron to capture it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Antilles briefed the squadron on the situation, and the plan to disable the Star Destroyer and seize control of it. During the mission, Vanguard Five would once again prove invaluable, breaching the Star Destroyer's hull, taking out many of it's gun emplacements, and escorting the boarding party into position.
