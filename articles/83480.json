In these efforts, it worked in conjunction with the Inquisitorius, as certain local rebels were believed to be Force-sensitive. In 2 BBY, the governor of the Lothal sector, Arihnda Pryce, grew frustrated with the lack of progress against a group of insurgents in her sector and so requested the assistance of the Seventh Fleet led by Grand Admiral Thrawn to deal with the rebels instead. After Thrawn became involved in the campaign against the rebels, Konstantine tentatively served under Thrawn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
