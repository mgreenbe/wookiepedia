The outpost consisted of several 1.4 FD P-Towers, DF.9 Turrets, and one v-150 Planet Defender with trenches over the area. During the Battle of Hoth, Blue Squadron was assigned to defend the post, and the outpost's troops were commanded by Trey Callum. Outpost Beta was the first to confirm the presence of Imperial troops on the ground. The station was the first sentry base destroyed during the battle, after being annihilated in half a dozen laser blasts from an All Terrain Armored Transport walker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Outpost Beta was featured in Star Wars Battlefront, a video game published by Electronic Arts on November 17, 2015.
