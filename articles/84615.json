The Chelidae engineering staff, after becoming aware of the droid's presence and threat, retreated into their shells to avoid the danger. After the Colossus dropped out of hyperspace, it suffered from numerous mechanical failures including the long-range communications and the gravity generator, prompting Xiono, Torra and CB-23, along with Neeku Vozo, to head down to engineering and the hyperdrive chamber to fix the problem."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once in engineering, Xiono and company discovered the Chelidae in their shells, and, not knowing of MB-13A's presence, assumed them to have been frightened by the station's flight. They began repairing the communications and gravity, unaware that the enemy droid was monitoring them. It took out CB-23 first, after Xiono sent her to repair some systems in a separate, darkened room. Eventually, when Xiono wondered what was taking his droid so long, Vozo went after her and discovered her floating and deactivated, before he was attacked and trussed-up by the enemy droid. After the communications had been repaired, Xiono and Torra went to see why their friends hadn't returned, and found Vozo and CB-23. Vozo warned them to go, but MB-13A arrived before they could. Xiono attempted to distract the enemy droid while Torra tried to untie Vozo, but he was shocked unconscious by the droid and Torra escaped with him.

Yeager quickly realized that a remaining First Order infiltrator had to be responsible. Xiono jumped down to pull the droid away from the console to prevent it from sending its transmission to Castilon, and, after they were joined by a reactivated CB-23, Xiono and Torra opened a hatch in the floor to blow the infiltrator into space.
