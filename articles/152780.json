To try to make sure he and his partner won the bet, he acquired Aayla Secura's lightsaber and a set of robes similar to a Jedi's. They used these to pretend to be a Jedi to fool Vos into trusting them so that they could more easily kill him at the time they had bet on his death taking place. However, the criminal Vilmarh Grahrk recognized the pair and told Vos they were merely other gamblers attempting to cheat. This angered the pair and they attacked Vos and Grahrk. The Gotal was slain when Vos, having retrieved his lightsaber from the Gotal's fallen partner, slashed him across the chest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
