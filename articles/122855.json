During the time, a two-headed Troig named Dwuirsintabb, who lived on his species' homeworld, Pollillus, made headlines at HoloNet News when one of the two heads, Dwuir, requested surgical separation from the other, Tabb, whom Dwuir claimed was suicidal. Senya Velop commented on the story for HoloNet News; the doctor stated that galactic medical technology was not sufficient to allow both heads to survive a head-separation procedure, yet leaving the heads together left both at risk of death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
