They had six limbs, a long tail, big ears and green eyes. Their fur was mostly orange, with occasional black and white patches. The momongs were carnivores and aggressive hunters, preying on the yellow birds known as the convorees. They were at least semi-sentient, as proven by their ability to use simple tools or weapons. During the Clone Wars, at least one momong had found its way offworld. That creature was seen in a slave market of Zygerria, where it dueled with a Kowakian monkey-lizard with miniature swords."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The momongs first appeared in \"Wookiee Hunt,\" the twenty-second episode of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series' third season.
