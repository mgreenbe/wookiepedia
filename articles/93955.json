The Nihil Tempest Runner Kassav Milliko attempted to extort Governor Veen when Eriadu was threatened by one of the Emergences of the Great Hyperspace Disaster, claiming to be able to prevent the imminent Emergence from harming Eriadu. After two fragments of the Legacy Run entered the Eriadu system, one hitting a cluster of lommite cargo transports, Veen acquiesced, transferring the credits that Milliko demanded. However, Milliko failed to prevent the third and final fragment in the Emergence from colliding with the inhabited moon of Eriadu. Enraged at having been apparently double-crossed, Veen vowed to wreak vengeance upon Milliko and his ilk, personally leading an Eriaduan fleet into the Battle of Kur against the Nihil of Milliko's Tempest alongside the Republic Defense Coalition. Near the end of the battle, Veen requested to board Milliko's flagship, the New Elite, shooting and killing Milliko personally."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
