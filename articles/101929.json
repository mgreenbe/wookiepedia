During the War, when Boss Gallo tried to unite the Gungan villages and defeat Boss Rogoe, Otoh Langua was led by Boss Hantic, and the city included a Command center. The city of Otoh Jahai battled Otoh Lungua because Boss Tenko claimed Langua had taken their Sacred Staff. Langua also fought Jahai because their city's funds were stolen by Rogoe and fighting was the only means of profit. Boss Gallo and Captain Marsune found the staff in a forest and returned it to Jahai, ending the fighting. They also had a skirmish against several of Rogoe's soldiers at a small base of his and liberated the nova crystals Rogoe's thieves stole, ending Langua's economic troubles. Langua gave Gallo and Marsune military support after their troubles were fixed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Otoh Langua appears in the Gungan campaign in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its 2002 expansion pack Clone Campaigns."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
