They consisted on a number of blossoms, called 'spikes', that grew on a vine. Spikes produced a strong, pleasant smell. Each spike could grow into a large fruit, but if a vine had too many spikes, the fruit that grew would be small and sour. Hence, Bakuran gardeners would trim excess spikes from cloudberry vines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The concept of pruning being necessary for an agreeable end result was used as an allusion for followers of the Cosmic Balance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
