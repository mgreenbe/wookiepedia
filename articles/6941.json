His weapon's scope was extremely misaligned. During the Battle of Hoth, Ked took orders from Sergeant Trey Callum and fought alongside Private Emon Kref. As the troops began to engage approaching snowtroopers, orders came in to retreat. Ked and the others fell back to the South Ridge, but on the way there, Ked was shot in the back and wounded. As Kref came to help him, an All Terrain Armored Transport approached them, but was taken out by a T-47 airspeeder that crashed into the walker and destroyed it. Ked was then assisted by Kref to a transport, where a medical droid assessed that Ked would make a full recovery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
