Regulars on the \"Hot List\" included Zayne Carrick, a former Jedi Padawan wanted for allegedly killing his Jedi class in the Padawan Massacre of Taris; Marn Hierogryph, a Snivvian criminal and Carrick's supposed accomplice; and Kelven Garnatrope, feared as the so-called \"Corellian Strangler.\" During Noblis' career at The Adjudicator, Noblis reported on events such as the effects of the Mandalorian invasion of Republic space on the bounty market, the proliferation of droids entering the bounty hunting trade, and the strange effect the war was having on corporations that dealt with bounty hunters. Noblis cultivated a network of sources and informants that provided the editor with information on companies such as Czerka Arms and Adascorp, inside knowledge that Noblis passed on to the audience at The Adjudicator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Through all this, Noblis still found the time to be an active bounty hunter during the Mandalorian Wars era. At one point, Noblis captured a bounty on the planet Wayland\u2014however, the world was under a Mandalorian attack, and when Noblis brought the target to the Constable, the hunter found the lawman leaving with his family. When Noblis asked the Constable for a voucher to take to the nearby Lhosan Industries building, Noblis was told that the building was full of Mandalorian Basilisk droids. On another occasion, Noblis decided to set out after a \"Baron Hyro Margryph,\" who had a bounty on his head for 100,000 credits, but as soon as Noblis reached the Inner Rim, the hunter found that there were multiple autonomous HK-24 assassin droids also out for Margryph. Soon afterward, the bounty was canceled."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite being an active bounty hunter at the time of the Mandalorian Wars, Krav Noblis was willing, through the hunter's stewardship of The Adjudicator, to pass on knowledge to others in the same field. Noblis was concerned with the effect the Mandalorian invasion would have on the bounty hunting market, considering them \"spoilsports\" only on par with the Jedi Order. Noblis willingly admitted to being in the field for the money and held a deep distaste for assassin droids\u2014although Noblis considered it a smart move for bounty hunters to use droids as backup, Noblis despised autonomous droids that the hunter felt were out to take Noblis' livelihood. Noblis frequently penned columns for The Adjudicator and wrote with a very informal, conversational style. Noblis had pointed, fuzzy ears."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Krav Noblis first appeared as the author of The Adjudicator Special Report: The Outer Rim, an in-universe newsletter appearing on the last page of Knights of the Old Republic 14, a comic book written by John Jackson Miller and released in 2007.
