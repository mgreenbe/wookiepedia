The elegant ships were among the few types of heavy battleships that the Rebel Alliance possessed. The MC80 Liberty cruisers were produced by Mon Calamari Shipyards initially intended for long-range exploration or pleasure craft, designed for civilian use to explore the galaxy or carry passengers in luxury. Each ship was unique, and handcrafted to exacting specifications. They rivaled the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer in length and mass, falling into the hands of the Alliance when the Mon Calamari were freed from the oppression of the Empire. Being sturdy, well built, and over engineered, they could stand the rigors of the constant interstellar travel, taking surprisingly well to combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beneath the graceful surfaces were frightful amounts of heavy weapons, and because of their firepower and sturdy hulls they had surprised the Imperials on numerous occasions.
