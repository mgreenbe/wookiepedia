While Zeen looks for her friend Krix, Farzala asks Lula what they should do. She responds that they do not have a choice: they must fight. A pirate boasts that they will crush the \"tiny Jedi\" \u2014 only to be interrupted by a voice from behind: the diminutive Grand Master Yoda, who suggests that if they are looking for tiny Jedi, he may be of assistance. Accompanying him is Chagrian Jedi Master Torban Buck, who loudly declares that \"Buckets of Blood has arrived on the scene!\" The Padawans are momentarily discomfited by the nickname, but all of the Jedi quickly leap into battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Above, at the base of the Nihil Spider Cruiser, Krix, alongside Elder Tromak, worries that Zeen is down there in the middle of the fighting. Tromak asks him if Zeen really did use the Force just now, but Krix is uncertain of what he saw. However, Marchion Ro interrupts, coldly pointing out that they all clearly saw that Zeen is a Force user, something that is against the rules of the sect Tromak belongs to, and that she has already sided with the Jedi against them. Ro adds that Krix will be left to the chaos since he continues to defend his \"heretic\" friend. Tromak speaks up, insisting that the boy is his assistant that he cannot do without, and that obviously the girl is nothing to him. Krix is hesitant, and Tromak adds that he will not be able to find the information Ro sought him out for without the boy's help.

Yoda overrules her, stating he will find the boy, and orders Buck to get the apprentices to safety. Buck is uncertain, noting that he is a healer, not a combat Jedi, and was only along to teach the apprentices basic first aid. They are interrupted by a warning shout from Farzala, as a Gigoran pirate hurls a deadly projectile their way. Yoda swiftly dispatches the object, to Lula's amazement, before asking Zeen if he can borrow Cham Cham, her pet cru. Zeen warns the Grand Master to be careful with him, and Lula reassures Master Buck that they have \"got\" the situation. He hopes she is right."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ro, however, recognizes Yoda upon seeing him approaching, and hurriedly boards the starship, giving orders for the forward team to crush the approach, since they have what they need and can leave. He also orders them to make sure Yoda does not get near the ship, since he could ruin Ro's plans. Tromak is ordered to follow, but he insists that they cannot leave Krix behind.

The Spider Cruiser takes off, concerning Zeen as Cham Cham, Yoda and Krix are still onboard. Buck notes they will not get far as the Republic is setting up a blockade to escort in the medical frigate. Yoda appears behind them, stating that the ship must be stopped.

As the Vectors converge to assist the damaged frigate, Ro orders the cruiser taken into hyperspace. Krix is shocked that they are leaving the Trymant system, because he does not want to leave Zeen behind, but Ro coldly retorts that she lied to him and sent a Jedi who put half of Ro's crew in the medical bay. The ship enters hyperspace, and Krix lies that Zeen is no one to him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aboard the Star Hopper, Lula comforts a crying Zeen.

Lula says that she left her home so long ago she does not remember it, but she found a new home with her friends. Farzala and Qort back her up, saying that they have \"got\" Zeen.
