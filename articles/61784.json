Many worlds had strict legislation about the possession and use of arms, and civilian hold-out blasters were designed to be tolerated by such restrictive regulation. Hence, they fired relatively underpowered bolts, had a poor effective range, and could fire only five or six shots before being depleted. This was seen as sufficient for scaring would-be attackers off, without delivering too much firepower in the hands of a random individual. However, due to their ease of concealment, hold-out blasters were associated with more nefarious characters, and they were still outlawed on some worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Military hold-out blasters, on the other hand, were designed to be weapons in their own right. They were still smaller than the heavy-duty sidearms, but the high-quality military hardware used in their fabrication meant they lacked neither range nor killing power. ISB agents and stormtrooper scouts were issued hold-out pistols as standard weapons, for ease of concealment, and because a heavier weapon would have been too bulky and ungainly to wield while riding a speeder bike."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hold-out blasters saw widespread use in weapon-restricted areas and were commonly found in the possession of undercover agents, gamblers and other scoundrels, or nobles seeking to protect themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hold-out blasters were sometimes carried by more lethal characters for backup firepower. Iella Wessiri Antilles, Mara Jade Skywalker, and Han Solo were among the many to use hold-out blasters.
