In 18 BBY, she and several other younglings were smuggled to Plett's Well on the planet Belsavis, under the guidance of Jedi Master Plett. However, their refuge was discovered by Emperor Palpatine, who sent the dreadnaught Eye of Palpatine to wipe out the Jedi. Although the weapon was disabled, Roganda was captured by Imperial Inquisitors during the evacuation of Belsavis. Taken to Imperial Center, Roganda integrated herself into Imperial society, growing into a beautiful woman. Using her good looks and Force-sensitivity, Roganda was able to infiltrate the exclusive Imperial Court, eventually becoming one of the Emperor's concubines. During her time as Palpatine's consort, she began an affair with another court member, Sarcev Quest. When she became pregnant, Roganda submitted herself to the Emperor's mercy, becoming an Emperor's Hand and training in the dark side of the Force. In 4 BBY, Roganda gave birth to her son, Irek Ismaren, and began to train him as a possible heir to the Emperor. However, upon Palpatine's death in 4 ABY, Roganda did not have the necessary support to make a play for the throne.

Her son, who had been implanted with a subelectronic converter, used this device to summon the disabled Eye of Palpatine to Belsavis. With the promise of the warship at her command, she made overtures to various nobles in the Senex and Juvex sectors to gain backing for her son as the new Emperor. However, when the ship arrived above Belsavis, Irek found that he could not control it, and the plot fell apart. Roganda and her son made their way back to Coruscant, where she continued Irek's training, recruiting Lord Cronal to train her son. However, in an argument with his teacher, Irek was stabbed through the head with a lightsaber, rendering him brain-dead. Devastated, Roganda refused to accept the loss of her boy, placing him in suspended animation and trying to repair his brain with cybernetics. She also augmented him to become the most powerful darksider imaginable, installing lightsabers in his wrists, elbows, and knees and using growth hormones to increase his size to three meters in height. In an attempt to bring back Irek's mental faculties, she prepared operational programming and prefabricated memories to install into his destroyed brain. However, before this could be implemented, a groundquake awakened Irek from stasis.

Roganda and her brother Lagan were the offspring of members of the Jedi Order. Roganda had been trained in the Jedi Temple until the rise of the Galactic Empire and the onset of the Great Jedi Purge. To escape the purge, Roganda, her brother, and her parents were taken to the world of Belsavis and hidden in Plett's Well, a village founded by the Ho'Din Jedi Master Plett as a refuge against the newly founded Empire. While there, Roganda continued her training under Master Plett, developing her Jedi powers. As members of the \"Children of the Jedi,\" Roganda and Lagan hid from Imperial agents until 18 BBY, when the Jedi refuge was discovered. Galactic Emperor Palpatine sent a colossal asteroid shaped dreadnaught, the Eye of Palpatine, alongside a fighter wing escort of TIE Fighters, to Belsavis to wipe out the refugees. Although two Jedi, Callista Masana and Geith Eris disabled the weapon, the TIE fighters attacked Plett's House and the refuge hidden under it, causing minor damage. With the Eye of Palpatine out of commission, the Jedi were able to defeat the fighter wing, but since the Empire now knew their location, Plett and the Children of the Jedi were forced to abandon their home. In the chaos of the evacuation from Belsavis, Roganda and Lagan were kidnapped by Imperials, stolen away from their parents. The siblings were presented to the Imperial Inquisitor Ameesa Darys who executed Lagan, forcing Roganda to watch. Traumatized by the death of her brother, she resolved to gain enough power that she would never be subject to the same fate as her sibling. Roganda was able to use her fledgling Force powers to escape the Inquisitors and integrate herself into the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Roganda came of age, she developed into a beautiful woman and quickly realized the effect she had on men. While living on the Imperial capital world of Coruscant, she used seduction and the promise of carnal pleasures to become involved with the elite of Imperial Center. Roganda was able to infiltrate the Imperial Court, using her beauty and seeming naivety to play into the court's chauvinistic attitudes. Roganda eventually set her sites on Emperor Palpatine himself, becoming one of his many concubines and a favored member at court. Due to her Force-sensitivity, she distinguished herself as one of Palpatine's foremost courtesans. As a mistress of the Emperor, Roganda was lent to Imperial dignitaries as a temporary gift. During this time, Roganda met Sarcev Quest, a servant of the Emperor and a staple of the court. Handsome and charismatic, Quest became involved with Roganda, and she became pregnant. Knowing that her pregnancy made her a liability due to her role as Palpatine's mistress, she devoted herself to becoming a servant of the Emperor and less disposable to His Imperial Majesty. Her resolve and dedication eventually saw her promoted to one of the Emperor's Hands, elite dark side users that reported directly to Palpatine. As an Emperor's Hand, Roganda was assigned to seduce Palpatine's enemies and learn their secrets, also working as an assassin. In 4 BBY, she gave birth to her child, Irek back on Alderaan, and began to groom him as Palpatine's heir. She believed that placing her son on the throne would be adequate revenge for the death of her family at the hands of the Empire."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "End of the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the birth of her son, rumors abounded that Irek was the Emperor's progeny, and Roganda did not deny them, concealing the identity of his true father to garner further support for her son as a possible heir to the throne. Even while Irek was still a child, Roganda began to train her son in the dark side of the Force, hoping to develop him into a talented Force-user. During Irek's training, Roganda came upon the scientific articles, \"The Light Side of the Subelectronic Force\" and \"The Universal Energy Field\" by the Imperial scientist, Nasdra Magrody. In the articles, Magrody speculated about the possibility of implanting a device into a Force-sensitive's brain to allow that person to manipulate technology through the Force. Desiring this power for her son, Roganda kidnapped Magrody. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, when Irek turned five, Magrody implanted his invention, a subelectronic converter into Irek's brain, allowing the young boy to manipulate technology through the Force. Two years later, at the age of seven, Irek began further training in the dark side of the Force, overseen by Magrody, who had a modicum of Force-sensitivity. Magrody also schooled Irek in scientific lessons, using accelerated learning techniques that he had developed at Omwat orbital station. Roganda claimed to Magrody that this training was at the Emperor's command, but the Imperial scientist was skeptical that Palpatine knew anything about it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, Roganda attended a senatorial banquet on Coruscant, commemorating Princess Leia Organa as the new Senator from that world. Organa became familiar with Roganda and learned of the rumors about her son from her aunt Celly. However, Organa was not allowed to speak with Roganda during the banquet, kept from doing so by her other aunt, Rouge Organa, who disapproved of the Emperor keeping a harem of concubines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, Emperor Palpatine was killed in the Battle of Endor. This destroyed Roganda's plans for her son to take the throne, as he was only eight years old, and Roganda did not have the support to repel others who were vying for the Imperial throne. Roganda also feared that Grand Admiral Thrawn had DNA evidence that Irek was not the Emperor's son. When Trioculus was crowned Emperor by the Central Committee of Grand Moffs on the claim that he was Palpatine's legitimate son, Roganda knew that she had missed her chance, and she departed Coruscant with her son. Roganda later claimed that she sold all of her possessions to escape Coruscant, keeping only a small topaz ring. She attempted to find refuge on a number of worlds still loyal to the Emperor's memory, but persons there remembered her days as Palpatine's concubine, and she was abused and taken advantage of. Roganda also claimed that her unhappiness during this time caused her to make several bad decisions. By 5 ABY, Roganda had made her way back to Belsavis to bide her time until the right opportunity presented itself."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "On Belsavis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the years since Roganda had resided in Plett's Well, the village had become a hub for smuggling activities based on the wealth of supplies left behind in the abandoned settlement under Plett's Well. Now known as \"Plawal\", the operation was led by the town boss, Nubblyk the Slyte, who maintained control over the salvage by concealing the tunnels into the underground city. Roganda arranged Nubblyk's disappearance and took possession of his home, a place on Painted Door Street. To keep the smuggling business of Plett's Well from drawing attention to her location, she orchestrated the disappearance of several smugglers who had worked for Nubblyk, including Mubbin the Whiphid and Drub McKumb, crippling their operation and ensuring that Plett's Well would be left in obscurity and the abandoned settlement left to her devices. Those in the smuggling operation were brainwashed and drugged to use as guards in the tunnels and keep anyone from investigating the abandoned Jedi settlement. Roganda continued to train her son, using Magrody, forcing him to continue Irek's training by imprisoning him on Belsavis and threatening his wife and daughter, Elizie and Shenna. Drugged with telezan, Magrody was unable to resist Roganda's orders. By 8 ABY, Irek was well versed in Magrody's lessions, talented enough for an advanced degree in subelectron physics or a position as a droid motivator technician."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this time, Roganda had recruited around a dozen military-types to support her on Belsavis. These soldiers were drawn to her through persuasion and blackmail and worked to protect Roganda's interests. She was also able to rebuild a semblance of her privileged life that she had enjoyed on Coruscant, obtaining vine-coffee and expensive perfumes such as Lake of Dreams and Whisper. By the time Irek had turned thirteen, his control over droids and other technology through the subelectronic converter implant was considerable. He was able to alter sensor fields and stayed abreast of all new standard droid models. Roganda brought her son various artifacts of the Jedi from the abandoned settlement, which he was able to master. As a mother, Roganda was a strict taskmaster, pushing her son to continually develop his powers. Her efforts formed Irek into a powerful Force-user, with abilities that far outstripped her own. As a form of rebellion against her demanding nature, Irek would occasionally cause droids in Plett's Well to malfunction and dabbled in substances such as yarrock that he knew his mother would disapprove of. After Irek had learned all that he could from Magrody, Roganda ended her relationship with the Imperial scientist."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ismaren plot"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 12 ABY, Roganda was ready for an attempt at placing her son on the Imperial throne. To do so, she developed a plot involving the aristocratic lords of the Senex and Juvex sectors. Using Irek's mastery over machines, she ordered her son to bring the Eye of Palpatine to Belsavis. The Ismarens recruited Ohran Keldor, the original designer of the vessel, into their scheme, so that he could school Irek on the schematics of the Eye of Palpatine, which would allow him to take control of it. From a great distance, Irek was unable to take direct control of the battlemoon, but he was able to activate the signal relay that had been damaged, sending the Eye of Palpatine back onto its automated mission. The Ismarens hoped that once the device was in range of Belsavis, Irek could take full control over the ship. To keep their plan secret, Roganda arranged the deaths of those who might warn the New Republic about the awakening of the long dormant superweapon. Among those killed was Stinna Draesinge Sha, after Roganda hired the assassin Phlygas Grynne to eliminate the scientist and former student of Nasdra Magrody."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using the promise of control over the Eye of Palpatine as a bargaining chip, Roganda requested financial and military support from Senex-Juvex in a campaign to reunite the fractured Empire and place her son as the new Emperor.

Upon their arrival, the group investigated Plett's House, discovering the drugged and brainwashed smugglers protecting the tunnels beneath the house. Worried that Organa and her group would uncover her plot, Roganda had Irek take control of R2-D2 to assassinate the group. However, the plan failed, and Organa recognized Roganda as she spied on them. When Organa confronted the former concubine, Roganda lied to the woman, claiming that she had become a fruit picker, and that her young son had died. Organa was suspicious of Roganda's claims, including her assertion that she had left the Empire behind, but she agreed to conceal Roganda's location on Belsavis, on the belief that she was truly attempting to live in peace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Organa's curiosity eventually uncovered Roganda's plotting, and she pursued the Ismarens and their allies, Drost Elegin, Ohran Keldor, and Garonnin, into the tunnels below Plett's Well. Roganda and her group captured the Chief of State, but her droid, R2-D2, escaped from their grasp when Irek was unable to control the droid due to it being rewired following the first attack. Irek wanted to kill Organa, but Roganda and her allies knew that the Chief of State would be much better use as a hostage, imprisoning her in the tunnels. As more financial backers arrived on Belsavis, Roganda was forced to drug Organa to keep her from interfering. The large contingent of potential supporters included Lady Theala Vandron of Karfeddion, Lord Vensell Picutorion, Lady Carbinol, one of the lords of House Sreethyn, representatives of the Mekuun Corporation, and the president of the board of directors of the Seinar Corporation.

Unknown to the Ismarens, the Jedi Master Luke Skywalker had damaged the computer core, keeping Irek from tapping into the battlemoon's systems. The Ismarens believed that Irek's inability to control R2-D2 earlier was tied into his struggle to control the Eye of Palpatine, and they summoned Organa to interrogate her. The Alderaanian princess revealed that R2 had been rewired, which caused Keldor and the Ismarens to surmise that the battlemoon had been damaged.

Organa called out to the man, claiming that the Ismarens were abandoning Belsavis to the Eye of Palpatine. Irek killed the man with his lightsaber, and in the chaos, Organa escaped. Irek and Keldor pursued the princess through the tunnels, but the intervention of Han Solo resulted in Keldor's death. Without Keldor's help, the Ismarens could not fix the Eye of Palpatine, and they were forced to abandon their plans and their potential supporters. Making their way out of the tunnels, Roganda and her son incapacitated the guards watching over Lady Vandron's Tikiar starship and used it to depart Belsavis. Following their departure, the Eye of Palpatine arrived above Belsavis, ready to shell the planet to cinders.

In a laboratory inside the Bluenek Section Pasarian Memorial Atmospheric Reclamation Complex Project on Coruscant, Roganda hired Lord Cronal, a former Prophet of the Dark Side, and Emperor's Hand to continue Irek's training. In an effort to make her son more powerful, Roganda had a group of scientists place her son into stasis. While in suspended animation, Roganda had the scientists add muscle mass and bone to his frame and also implanted lightsaber blades in his wrists, elbows, and knees. Fearing that other Force users might discover them, she arranged to bring ysalamiri from Myrkr to mask their presence.
