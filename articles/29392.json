The defensive fleet, renamed the Grand Imperial Navy, was reorganized to enmesh both officers and other ranks in a network of patronage and clientele, while a militia known as the Red Police was established to provide security for loyalists and their families. A low-value local currency was introduced in place of Imperial Credits, although at higher levels of society, an essentially separate system developed, based on bullion and valuable goods not readily available on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nevertheless, Prakith was not completely cut off from the rest of the Galaxy. The Moff's position was further secured by the fact that a major headquarters of the Inquisitorius was located on the planet, and by a continuing alliance with the Mining Guild. The planet's industry was sustained by the conscription of workers, and there were reports of mass executions of homeless vagrants, but on the whole, Imperial discipline kept disorder to a minimum, and Rebel activity was almost nonexistent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prakith eventually joined the New Republic after Foga Brill was killed by his own officers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
