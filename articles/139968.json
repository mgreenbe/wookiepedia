Ebenn Q3 Baobab once provided Tanner with funds to smuggle medical supplies past Imperial blockades and into the Outer Rim, though Baobab oddly claimed that the funds were for deceased Supreme Chancellor Valorum to assist the defunct Galactic Republic.

The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. Due to the nature of many older quests in Star Wars Galaxies, the species, gender, and appearance of Tanner Helton changed each time a player performed this quest. Therefore, it is impossible to verify the canonical species of Helton. However, the quest dialogue given by Baobab indicated that Tanner Helton was a male. Although not mentioned in the quest dialogue, examining Helton consistently identified him as an Alliance SpecForce urban guerrilla."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
