It pitted the clan of the warlord Malkhan against other factions that sought to control Crucival. Eventually, Malkhan died, and his lieutenants each staked a claim to his cache of offworld weapons. An unprecedented bloodletting ensued, and all the former warriors of Malkhan, who now lacked an army to serve, fell into misery and deprivation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
