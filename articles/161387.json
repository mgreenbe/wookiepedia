They spent their time at sea as hunter-gatherers using hand-crafted boats to sail along the rough seas. The Visitors came back to shore monthly with a large enough haul to keep them fed until the next gathering of food and resources. In this time the Caretakers and Visitors celebrated and old relationships were mended in this short but important time period."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
