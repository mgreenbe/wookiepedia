During the Clone Wars, the planet was located within Separatist space. During the Imperial Period, it contained an Imperial shipyard that was kept under tight control. The shipyard produced exclusively Imperial-class Star Destroyers. By 4 ABY, Thanos had become an Imperial fortress world. After the Battle of Endor, the planet and its shipyard fell under control of High Admiral Treuten Teradoc's Greater Maldrood. Thanos was eventually captured by the New Republic in 8 ABY.
