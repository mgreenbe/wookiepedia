Va'ran was the second-best Kubaz chef in the Empire, though few knew that the best Kubaz chef was actually on Emperor Palpatine's personal staff. While usually only responsible for creating the restaurant's fine culinary delights, Va'ran ultimately answered to the demands of the woman who had personally hired him: Guri, part-owner of the Manarai and chief lieutenant to Prince Xizor, leader of the powerful Black Sun crime syndicate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Guri never let Va'ran forget that he was in her debt, and Va'ran knew that Guri would not hesitate to eliminate him and encourage the Manarai's management to fill his vacancy with the galaxy's third-best Kubaz chef should he be uncooperative. So it was that Guri came to Va'ran on one busy night at the Manarai in 3.5 ABY with orders to secretly murder patron Fendrilon Koozar, one of the Emperor's Advisors who had meddled in Black Sun's affairs. Guri instructed Va'ran to give Koozar the \"house special,\" a code phrase meaning a combination of ingredients\u2014both natural food seasonings and nearly untraceable chemicals\u2014that would be added to a victim's dish throughout the meal. The poisoned recipe was designed to interact with the meal's natural oils and spices, as well as the victim's own digestive system, eventually resulting in painful death some hours after ingestion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To accommodate Guri's desire for a discreet recipe that might cause Koozar to hallucinate and plummet to his death from some great height, Va'ran considered the various chemical combinations and spices in Koozar's food and his own knowledge of Human physiology. He decided to add a dose of tasteless thetametabuterin to Koozar's Wroonian flycatcher filet appetizer, a hybrid mold on his bowl of sufar greens and mecolar briddlings, and some collafa spice in his main dish of fleek-eel broiled in zaffa oil. Va'ran's recipe produced the desired effect\u2014the following evening, the Master Chef saw on the newsnets that Koozar had been killed after throwing an uncontrollable fit while riding in his luxury airspeeder, seizing the controls from his droid pilot and slamming the vehicle into the Ministry of Land Management in a fiery explosion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tavvar Va'ran was nervous about having been given the responsibility of murdering Imperial Advisor Fendrilon Koozar on Black Sun's behalf, knowing full well that his own life hung in the balance if he did not cooperate.
