A highly-trained, expert scout from the Outer Rim Territories planet Kal'Shebbol, Alder served with Major Bren Derlin for many years during some of the Rebel Alliance's most dangerous operations of the war before receiving assignment to the Alliance High Command headquarters of Echo Base on the ice planet Hoth by 3 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alder was responsible for patrolling Echo Base's outer perimeter under Derlin's command, and he was the officer to inform Derlin that fellow Rebels Luke Skywalker and Han Solo still had not reported in to the base after Skywalker had gone missing during a routine scouting mission one day. Despite their absence and its worrying toll on Princess Leia Organa, Derlin tasked Alder with closing the base's shield doors for the night, reluctantly trapping both missing men out in the Hoth cold."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the subsequent Battle of Hoth, Alder helped to direct Rebel snowspeeder groups against the invading Imperial forces and survived the engagement.

He was originally from Kal'Shebbol, the capital planet of the Kathol sector, located along the Trition Trade Route in the Outer Rim Territories at the edge of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time Alder eventually received assignment to the Alliance High Command headquarters of Echo Base on the remote ice planet Hoth, he had already served for years with Major Bren Derlin in the Alliance Army, fighting in some of the Rebel Alliance's most perilous campaigns of the Galactic Civil War, including the battle of Nentan, an effort to evacuate refugees from Imperial forces. Alder's expertise in terrain scouting and native creatures impressed Derlin, and his abilities made him among the first to arrive at Echo Base. As one of the finest forward scouts present, Alder's duties included patrolling the facility's outer perimeter on the planet's icy wastes under Derlin's command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When base personnel Luke Skywalker and Han Solo went missing out in one of Hoth's brutally cold nighttime blizzards during a routine scouting expedition in early 3 ABY, Alder coordinated a search party for the two men. Although Echo Base waited as long as possible before closing its protective shield doors for the night, in hopes that the two would return safely, Alder's responsibilities required him to report to Derlin that with Hoth's dropping temperatures threatening the conditions of the base's interior, Skywalker and Solo had still not reported in. The situation forced Derlin to inform worried base leader Princess Leia Organa that the doors would have to be closed for the night, to which she reluctantly agreed. With her approval Alder carried out Derlin's order to close the base's shield doors, effectively trapping Skywalker and Solo out, leaving them to their fates. Further search efforts rescued both men the following morning."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Hoth and New Republic career"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alder later fought during the subsequent Battle of Hoth, the large-scale Imperial invasion of Echo Base, serving along the main Rebel defensive perimeter, where he helped to organize snowspeeder groups against the attacking line of Imperial assault walkers. Despite the heavy losses that the Rebellion suffered during the battle, which proved to be the Alliance's worst battlefield defeat of the war, Alder survived the engagement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, in 8 ABY, Alder helped plan the DarkStryder Campaign in his home sector of Kathol under the leadership of New Republic Special Forces agent Lieutenant Judder Page to topple the rogue Imperial warlord Moff Kentor Sarne.

Glut's 1980 novelization of Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, released just prior to his inclusion in the film. Actor Jack McKenzie portrayed Alder on-screen, credited only as \"Deck Lieutenant\" in the film. However, this crediting should not confuse Alder with the character of Tamizander Rey, also an Echo Base deck officer, whom Han Solo actually addresses as such in the film. According to the book The Making of The Empire Strikes Back, the Alder scene was filmed between May 22 and May 29, 1979. The Alder character was first identified by name on the \"Cal Alder\" card as part of the November 1996 Hoth Limited expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An image of Alder was featured on the packaging of an action figure entitled \"Rebel Soldier (Echo Base Battle Gear),\" included in Kenner's 2011 Star Wars: The Vintage Collection toy line.
