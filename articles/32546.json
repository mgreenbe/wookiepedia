Having spoken out against the Yuuzhan Vong War, Czulkang Lah was usurped by his son as warmaster. The warrior was relegated to the position of a teacher of military strategy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the aged warrior's classes, it became customary for a wrong response to a question to be punished by a swift strike into the student's body, administered by Czulkang Lah's specially grown amphistaff. Lah was accustomed to deliver blows for timidity and fear among his students; those who had the courage to tender an answer at all were often treated more favorably than those who kept their silence. Thus it became so that if a warrior had only a few Czulkang Lah pits upon his person, they were considered badges of honor. If a warrior had too many, however, he was considered inept."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Czulkang Lah's classes were legendary, and many of his former students went on to command respected positions in the Yuuzhan Vong fleet. Supreme Commander Maal Lah bore the scars of several Czulkang Lah pits from his education under the former warmaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
