The three shapes were \"lizard,\" \"toad,\" and \"snake.\" Other than a tie, the game had three possible outcomes: A player who decided to play lizard would beat another player who had chosen snake but would lose to one who played toad, while a play of toad would lose to a play of snake. Each play was accompanied by a phrase such as \"lizard ate snake\" or \"snake ate toad\" to signify the winner.
