Sev, coordinating the attack from his command ship, instructs Sah to secure an outpost. The obedient Padawan, along with clone Sergeant Remy, discovers that the locals are not friendly to the Republic and so must take the outpost by force. Walking into the small town, they are met by a group of townspeople, only a fraction of their force, the rest lying in wait atop the buildings preparing to spring their ambush. Before anything can happen, Remy receives Order 66 and promptly fires upon Sah. Realizing that the Jedi is siding with them, the townspeople spring their ambush upon the clones, obliterating the force. Contacting Sev, the Padawan is shocked to find that there is no answer, something that can only mean that his Master has been killed. Clone reinforcements are sent down, and Sah proudly fights with his new allies\u2014the order of outcasts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
