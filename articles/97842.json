It banished the accused from ever returning to the Gungan city of Otoh Gunga, on threat of being \"pounded\" to death should they ever return. Ten years before the onslaught of the Clone Wars, Boss Rugor Nass placed Jar Jar Binks under the nocombackie law after a destructive accident involving the boss's personal heyblibber. When Binks returned to Otoh Gunga with the Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Gungan outcast only managed to escape his execution because he had pledged a life debt to Jinn per Gungan tradition."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
