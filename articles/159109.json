And in pre-production photos, Dengar is seen with a slightly modified MG 34 (Maschinengewehr 34), which is the base weapon identified 'in universe' as both the W-90 concussion rifle and DLT-19 heavy blaster rifle. When it came time to shoot the movie, however, the MG 34 ended up in the hands of 4-LOM. Neither of these weapons, though, is explicitly identified as the Valken-38."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
