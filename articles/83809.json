After the Battle of Yavin, General Hera Syndulla was overseeing this training, alongside Alliance officer Bini. At some point, a team of mercenaries, led by the rogue archaeologist Chelli Aphra, located the ship using jump signatures in Wat Tambor's files. Bini assumed they were signing up, but when Syndulla came to see them, the former Milvayne Authority officer Tam Posla made it clear that they were not. Syndulla realised that they were mercenaries and had them put into cells."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mercenary team managed to disable the shields around their cells, but did not attempt to escape. This won over Syndulla's trust, and she was willing to hear about why they came. Aphra, Posla and Caysin Bog told her they knew how to get into Hivebase-1, the R&D headquarters of the Tarkin Initiative, but as Posla began to explain, Bog ejected a number of blasters, set to stun, out of his head compartment. The assassin Sister Six caught them and stunned the entirety of the Alliance personnel in the room. The mercenaries then took Syndulla onto their ship and escaped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aphra offered to trade Syndulla with the Imperial officers on Hivebase-1. She also activated the tracker on Syndulla's general plaque, luring the Lucrehulk Prime in their direction. Shortly after Aphra's team reached Hivebase-1, the Lucrehulk Prime arrived out of hyperspace. However, the battleship soon found itself under attack from the scaraphyte swarm around Hivebase-1. This distraction allowed Aphra's team to sneak into the base without the Imperials knowing. The Lucrehulk Prime's situation gradually became dire and their outer decks became damaged beyond repair. When Bini tried to deploy the X-wing starfighters from the ships core, he was knocked unconscious by an Imperial infiltrator, Lieutenant-Inspector Magna Tolvan. She contacted Hivebase-1, telling them that she had gained control of the ship's core. But when they told her to destroy it, she used Imperial protocol to save the Lucrehulk Prime from being reduced to wreckage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short while later, inside Hivebase-1, Aphra used a control terminal from inside the datacore to get across to the Lucrehulk Prime. She had bugged the control core during her visit there and used this to take control of the ship. She had it barge through the scaraphyte swarm and latch onto Hivebase-1. X-wings then deployed from the ship and, using tow cables, pulled the datacore from Hivebase-1 and over to the Lucrehulk Prime. Inside the ship, troopers rushed to the control core and found Bini and some of his men unconscious, with Tolvan sneaking away into the vents. The Lucrehulk Prime then withdrew from Hivebase-1. As it did so, the base exploded, due to sixty explosive animals released inside the complex by Aphra."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY, Syndulla recalled her training of cadets aboard the Luchrehulk Prime and noted that it taught her that weapons of oppression could become symbols of hope."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
