It was commonly installed on military bases and other strongholds. It included a powerful full-spectrum transceiver that could scan effectively up to near-orbit range, which could be increased by deploying Sensor Relay Satellites at a cost of 2,000 credits. The array also had a dedicated energy receptor for detecting energy use and fluctuations within its range along with a Hyperwave Signal Interceptor. A popular add-on was a life form indicator for an additional 1,000 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
