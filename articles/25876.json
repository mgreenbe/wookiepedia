The RA-7 droid had been dispatched to translate by the scout commander and he is perturbed that they have ceased communication. Kai thinks that the Star Destroyer's superstructure is interfering with the antenna. However, he is proven wrong when a stormtrooper helmet rolls out of the gangplank. Inside, Chewie and Zarro knock out the stormtroopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon exiting the gangplank, Chewie also beheads and rips apart the RA-7 droid. Before the fight can escalate, Zarro addresses the Imperial commander and tells him that she is here to help the Empire. She tells Kai that Jaum is a gangster who is running a scam and that he is a rebel spy. Zarro claims that Jaum does not own an operation and that his R5 repair droid \"Boomer\" is loaded with explosives. Shortly later, Jaum arrives with two stormtroopers carrying boxes of sample. He is planning to leave so that he can settle other debts. However, Zarro tells Jaum that she has told the Empire the truth about his \"scam\". Shortly later, the Imperial landing craft carrying the Andelm beetle larvae and Boomer go up in flames. The explosion damages the ship's force-field."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chewie and Zarro take advantage of the chaos to flee on a TIE/sa bomber. After some difficulty, they manage to free the ship by starting the launch cycle. However, Zarro accidentally releases a thermal detonator which damages the right-wing of the bomber. Despite the bombing catching fire on re-entry, Zarro and the Wookiee still manage to crash-land the craft. Shortly later, the two walk back to Chewie's RZ-1 A-wing interceptor. Chewie plans to leave Andelm IV to complete a special mission. While Zarro is thankful to Chewbacca for saving her planet from Imperial conquest, she is sad that he is leaving. She also notices that the Wookiee is transporting a box. Before leaving, the two embrace and Chewie gives her his gold medallion that he received for his services during the Battle of Yavin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back aboard the Star Destroyer, Commander Kai dismisses Jaum's mining deal as a scam. As punishment for endangering Imperial personnel and trying to scam the Empire, Kai has Jaum tortured by his IT-O Interrogator. With the ship's main hyperdrive damaged by the explosion, Kai tells him that it will be a long journey back to the nearest Imperial base and that the interrogator droid will be his companion. Stealing Jaum's green landspeeder, Zarro returns to her family home and tells her dad Arrax that the Empire had taken care of Jaum. When Arrax asks about her friend, she tells him that Chewie had to leave for an important mission. This \"mission\" turns out to be a family reunion back to the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk.
