Near the monument's center, the words \"Battle of Geonosis\" were etched in Aurebesh, and above which the Galactic Roundel was inlaid. The First Battle Memorial was placed at the heart of the Republic military base's outdoor plaza on Coruscant, where it stood between two large, grey obelisks bearing sculpted clone trooper statues.

Though the Republic would ultimately emerge victorious, thousands of clone troopers perished in the fighting. From the battle on Geonosis, the galaxy became embroiled in a conflict that came to be known as the Clone Wars, as the Galactic Republic and Confederacy fought across a multitude of worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To honor the clone troopers who fell in combat during the Clone Wars' first battle, a memorial was commissioned to commemorate their service.

That year, the fugitive Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano fled the Republic military base where she had been incarcerated on false charges of murder, running along the top of the First Battle Memorial to evade pursuing security forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the days that followed the Clone Wars' end, the Mandalorian military contractor Kal Skirata\u2014a former member of the Cuy'val Dar and military adviser to the Republic's Grand Army during the war\u2014began to formulate plans for a new memorial for fallen clone troopers.
