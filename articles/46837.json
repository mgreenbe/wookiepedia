Around that time, chokeroot was considered an old family standard on many worlds, but Tuggs thought the root lacked flavor and was not suitable for use in his cooking. Upon a visit to Saleucami, he discovered a creamy mashed chokeroot recipe that used falumpaset cheese and spices to enhance the underlying sweetness of chokeroot. When Tuggs wrote his cookbook, he included the recipe for mashed chokeroot and his entr\u00e9e that included it, Fried Endorian Tip-Yip."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 34 ABY, Tuggs brought Tuggs' Grub to Black Spire Outpost on the planet Batuu and worked as one of the rotating guest chefs at Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo.
