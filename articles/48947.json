The robes were designed by the handmaiden Yan\u00e9 to complement several of the queen's outfits and help the handmaidens fade to the background. They were worn by the handmaidens throughout Amidala's term as Queen of Naboo, including during the Invasion of Naboo, when Amidala escaped the planet hidden among her handmaidens."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The robes enjoyed an enduring life as a wearable garment: robes in the same style were also worn by Amidala's handmaidens during her tenure as Senator in the Galactic Republic Senate, and by the handmaidens of at least one later queen of Naboo, Sosha Soruna. Flame-colored robes were immortalized in artworks depicting Amidala after her term as queen ended, and their image reached beyond Naboo in pin-up posters displayed in cantinas, barracks, and public locations all over the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The flame-colored robes featured a yellow-to-orange ombr\u00e9 outer robe over an orange under-robe made of Karlini silk.

The handmaidens often wore hoods, which quickly touched off a trend for wearing similary styled hooded garments among the Naboo people. Flame, however, quickly became the handmaidens' signature color, and they found that the saturated hues drew attention away from the individual wearer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The handmaidens typically wore matching robes, chosen to complement the queen's outfits. During Amidala's term as queen, the flame-colored robes were paired with at least two different gowns: they provided a stark contrast with a black traveling gown and matching feathered headdress and complemented a somber purple traveling ensemble in similarly rich hues."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fire of defiance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As part of their invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, the Trade Federation occupied the city of Theed in an attempt to force the queen into signing a treaty.

She continued to wear them and go by the name \"Padm\u00e9\" while on the royal starship. The robes also came in handy while Yan\u00e9 and Sach\u00e9 were trapped in the Trade Federation's prison camp; Yan\u00e9 shredded their under-robes and used them to weave coded messages."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Amidala's time as senator, the disguise was used against her when the Clawdite bounty hunter Cato Parasitti shape-shifted into one of Amidala's handmaidens and attempted to disrupt a delicate negotiation with the Arthurian delegates.

By the time of the Clone Wars fought between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Theed palace also had a stained glass window picturing a lone figure in profile wearing the flame-colored robe and a painting of a group of eight figures dressed in flame-colored robes crossing a courtyard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A pin-up poster featuring a woman wearing the robes was also widely available in the galaxy during the Clone Wars. Copies of the poster hung in places as far flung as a Weequay pirate lair on Florrum, in the clone troopers' barracks on Christophsis, and on the outside of a building on Iego, all in the Outer Rim Territories, and a cantina on Coruscant's lower levels in the Galactic Core."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At least one other queen's retinue also wore similar robes. In 4 ABY, an agent of the remnant Galactic Empire executed Operation: Cinder on Naboo, activating a climate disruption array which caused hurricanes and dangerous electrical storms across the planet. As Queen Sosha Soruna prepared to launch an attack on the array, she was aided by two handmaidens who wore robes identical to the flame-colored robes worn by Amidala's handmaidens."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Continuity and name"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Flame-colored robes were created for the prequel trilogy film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, released May 19, 1999.

His Naboo costume designs deliberately obscured details like size, shape, and age because they would be used for disguise. Working with McCaig, costume designer Trisha Biggar turned the sketches into outfits that would work on screen. Biggar envisioned a dress code and a specific style for ceremonial regalia for queens and handmaidens which included common silhouettes and motifs. The handmaidens' outfits were dyed to complement the queen's ensembles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hooded dresses were originally made in white silk and viscose velvet, then disassembled and ombr\u00e9-dyed so that the depths and levels of the colors matched when the handmaidens stood side by side.

Antique guipure lace motifs were dyed to match and used to trim the sleeves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
