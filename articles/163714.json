In 22 BBY, a Wetakk was present in Cuipernam, a city on the planet Ansion. It was part of a multi-species group hired by the Hutt crime lord, Soergg Vosadii Bezhin, to attack the Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and her Padawan Barriss Offee, and derail their attempt to keep Ansion as a member of the Galactic Republic. Attacking Offee with a hooked blade, the Wetakk had one of its arms severed. While the attacking group almost got the better of the two Jedi, the arrival of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker tipped the balance towards the Jedi woman, and the Wetakk's group eventually fled. Despite this attempt on their lives, the Jedi succeeded in negotiating with Ansion's representatives to stay part of the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alan Dean Foster created the Wetakk for his novel The Approaching Storm, published by Del Rey in 2002 as a lead-in to the release of Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.
