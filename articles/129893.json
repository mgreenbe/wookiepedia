Sprantal are massive amphibians with thick hides, long legs, and longer necks. They are typically a deep mottled-green color that helps camouflage them, particularly underwater. Their four strong legs can raise their stout bodies three meters off the ground. Their four meter long, rope-like neck ends in a head with three large eyes in a triangular arrangement on top and one eye below a fang-filled mouth, giving them a 360 degree view around their head. When they hide underwater, their heads are just under the surface, allowing their dark colored eyes to remain above the water to watch for potential prey and enemies. These fearsome predators typically ambush their prey when they come for a drink from their ponds, but sometimes they attack those that are just passing by. The additional, forward-facing eye below their wide, toothy mouth allows them to see underwater as well as giving them a better view when attacking prey. Their stout bodies are approximately three to four meters long and half again as wide. Their necks can extend in a highly flexible manner, allowing sprantals standing at full height to attack creatures everywhere except directly to the rear."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
