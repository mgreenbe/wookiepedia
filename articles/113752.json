After Karrst hesitated when Ren informed him that entry into the Knights of Ren required the death of his brother, Filin instead killed Karrst and requested to join in his place.

Ren did so and then told Ren and his Knights that Tai, Voe, and Hennix engaged him in a duel to interrogate him about what had really happened with the Jedi temple.
