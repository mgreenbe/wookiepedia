The settlement consisted of a central building surrounded by three autoturrets on rock plateaus, and a series of walls. At some point between the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Hoth, the Sith Lord Anakin Skywalker contacted a gang of mercenaries and asked that they help the local Imperial garrison destroy the camp. The mercenaries agreed and were provided with three All Terrain Scout Transports, which they used alongside two Imperial TIE/ln space superiority starfighters to attack the settlement. Seven Tusken Raiders and the autoturrets attempted to defend the camp, but were unsuccessful and the camp was entirely destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The camp first appeared as a map in Star Wars: Commander, a mobile strategy game released in 2014 by Disney Interactive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
