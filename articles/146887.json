They were known for their poison-sacs and habit of preying on starships imprudent enough to cross their frontier. By the 6100s BBY, they had been exterminated by the Mandalorian Crusaders. Prior to their extinction, the Tl\u00f6nians crafted a particular type of shield. By the time of the Clone Wars, one of those Tl\u00f6nian shields ended up in the possession of a genetic decoy of the terrorist Zeta Magnus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
