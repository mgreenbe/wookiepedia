The mine mainly produced only azurite. Named for the Home Planet Party, it was working with the Arcona to restore the ecosystem on Bandomeer in the years prior to the Battle of Naboo. The Dark Jedi Xanatos had attempted to sabotage the mine, planting a bomb within, hoping to lure his former Master, Qui-Gon Jinn to his death. However, it was discovered that a large vein of ionite existed in the mine; this metal both nullified the bomb and ensured that the mine would not be closed by Offworld Mining Company."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
