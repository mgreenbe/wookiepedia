Sometime after the Battle of Exegol, the elder was walking with an etobi through the Great Chott salt flat of the Jundland Wastes when she found the Jedi Padawan Rey outside the abandoned moisture farm which once belonged to the Lars family. The elder remarked that it had been a long time since anyone was seen on the farm and asked the visitor for her name. Rey offered her first name, and in response the elder asked for Rey's surname. After spotting the Force spirits of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa from a distance away in the desert, Rey provided the name \"Skywalker.\" After the introduction, the elder questioned if she would see her around, and departed on her way."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tatooine elder first appeared in the 2019 film Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, the third and final installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy.
