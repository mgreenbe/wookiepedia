While the other two fleets attacked Corellia and Giju, Delvardus conquered Kaikielius and Alsakan in quick succession, and moved to the energy-producing world of Metellos. Annihilating the New Republic fleet launched to stop him, Delvardus initiated an intense orbital bombardment, resulting in over five billion civilian casualties."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "But as the New Republic launched a second fleet to stop Delvardus, they were caught by surprise when an additional two fleets sent by the Imperial Ruling Council from the Outer Rim Territories arrived at Coruscant, while a third launched attacks in the Borderland Regions.
