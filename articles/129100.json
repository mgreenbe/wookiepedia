The spaceport covered a larger area than many cities, although little of it expanded above or below the planet's surface. There were numerous shipbuilding and refitting yards, dock facilities for barges and bulk freighters, an Espo command center, an Authority Merchant Marine academy, and the postmaster's headquarters. Added to that were passenger terminals, maintenance depots, ground transport installations, warehouses, and living and recreational arrangements for the thousands upon thousands of Humans and aliens who lived there or were just passing through."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
