That was also present in the Neimoidian Inner Circle, the government/legislature of the planet. The Neimoidians established purse worlds on nearby Cato Neimoidia, Deko Neimoidia, and Koru Neimoidia. Neimoidia was populated by the less capable and aggressive members of the species, all others moving off-world as soon as possible. Many low-level worker drones were kept malnourished so as to never reach full mental maturity. Combined with the planet's natural unpleasantness, it was usual for Neimoidians to choose not to return home unless absolutely necessary."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Biosphere"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Neimoidia was known for its manax tree orchards and fungus farms, tended by harvester beetles.

The genetic differences from the Duros that the Neimoidians developed were attributed to the features of the planet, including its heavier gravity, dimmer sun, humidity, and perpetual fog and mist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 4800 BBY, the Neimoidians locked up the distribution rights of newly-discovered ryll spice from Ryloth.

Fearing an attack from the Republic if they would not comply, the Trade Federation leaders seemingly complied by 29 BBY, but fled Neimoidia for the three purse worlds to continue the development of their army well into the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars Neimoidia was in an arms race with neighbouring Kuat. Unlike Separatist shipyards at Sluis Van and Foerost, Neimoidia's shipyards weren't protected by distance from the frontlines. As orbital screens were erected around Kuat's most guarded shipyards, Neimoidia took similar sensor-baffling measures to protect its shipyards from Republic intelligence gathering. The Republic took Neimoidia and its purse worlds from the Separatists in 19 BBY. During the battle, Neimoidia was ravaged, and the destruction of many Neimoidian grub hatcheries would affect the Neimoidian species, in a more positive way."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Viceroy Gunray and Settlement Officer Rune Haako were killed on Mustafar by Darth Vader. A few days after the Separatist Council was massacred, with the rise of the New Order, the Trade Federation was made a puppet government to the Empire after Acting Viceroy Sentepeth Findos signed a treaty on Neimoidia. The Neimoidians began to adopt the culture of the baseline Duros to disassociate themselves with the Trade Federation's shameful legacy, where they presumably changed their culture, first by destroying the remaining grub hatcheries and burning down all the fungus farms. Afterwards, Neimoidians rarely travelled, unless shifty dealings were afoot. In 0 BBY, the Trade Federation was officially disbanded with the Imperial Senate, but there was still some of the militia that had remained."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Later History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 6 ABY, Neimoidia was quarantined due to viruses. This was not the first time such a precaution had been taken; numerous diseases and viruses originated on the planet, with the Neimoidians propagating them throughout the galaxy.
