During the Galactic Civil War, Phramp participated in a sabacc tournament held in the High Card Casino on the planet Danteel in which a rare Tchine statue had been offered as a prize, playing on behalf of the Twi'lek Arvakke. Using a skifter, Phramp cheated and threw every hand that he dealt to the Rodian Mensant, and Mensant soon built up a lead. However, the rival player Zerba Cher'dak began subtly cheating so as to counteract Phramp's efforts. Phramp realized that someone was working against him, but was unable to tell exactly which player it was. Cher'dak later directly accused Phramp of cheating and the Human was thrown out of the casino."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
