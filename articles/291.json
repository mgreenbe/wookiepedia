After being left to wander about the laboratories and galleries, 11-4D returned hours later to report to Plagueis. The droid inquired whether the data related to Plagueis's project would be available to upload, as the droid was unfamiliar with many of the things he had seen. Plagueis tasked him with scanning most of the data, starting with the history of the Sith, the sect to which he belonged that was comprised of Force-sensitives who utilized the dark side of the Force for their own benefit.

Venamis was another apprentice of the Sith Lord Darth Tenebrous, Plagueis's Master, and had attacked the Muun in retaliation for Plagueis's killing of Tenebrous on Bal'demnic. In one of Plagueis's laboratories, 11-4D, newly refitted with medical appendages, assessed the condition of the comatose Bith, who was suspended in a bacta tank. The droid found that the patient's physical state was stable. 11-4D and the Muun hacked into the databanks of the ship on which Venamis had traveled to Sojourn, which Plagueis had also brought to Muunilinst, where they found entries on six Force-sensitive beings whom Venamis had been monitoring as potential Sith apprentices. However, the droid soon discovered that three of the beings whom Venamis had hoped would protect the Grand Plan, a centuries-old plot by the Order of the Sith Lords to destroy the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order, had died from various causes.

With 11-4D's surgical appendages replaced with a pair of utility arms, he and Plagueis arrived at Colliders, where the Sullustan manager of the casino ferried them to a large office after being informed that the Muun was Magister of Damask Holdings. As Plagueis was inquiring about a massive winning streak the casino had seen recently, a Kubaz gambler hit a winning streak, prompting Plagueis to investigate. After Plagueis returned, he, 11-4D, and the manager viewed a databank containing images of gamblers whose winnings had heavily damaged multiple casinos' earnings. As 11-4D and the Sith came out into the main section of the casino, 11-4D remarked that all of the gamblers, including the Quarren whom they were tracking, were 1.8 meters tall, even though they were of different sexes and species.

The Kubaz never did; rather, a burly Askajian appeared, an individual whom Plagueis correctly identified as the Shi'ido in a new form. The pair followed the Askajian to an InterGalactic Banking Clan kiosk, where he deposited the credit chit that contained his winnings.

In mid-shapeshift, the changeling reverted to his natural Shi'ido form. 11-4D and Plagueis interrogated the shapeshifter and learned that Santhe was millions in debt to members of the Black Sun crime syndicate, and that the Shi'ido, who was affiliated with Santhe, had been attempting to pay some of the debt off bit by bit to prevent Black Sun from going public with information about the financial troubles, which would most likely cause Santhe to be ousted from power by members of his company. Plagueis let the Shi'ido go, as the being was not dangerous to the Sith and their plans, though the Shi'ido lost the ability to shapeshift due to 11-4D's tightbeam attack.

The pair also learned that the places to which Lare could have escaped were limited to the worlds of Felucia, Caluula, and Abraxin due to the small amount of starships leaving Bedlam. The Ithorian added that the Jedi Order had been informed of the disappearance because of Lare's gift with the Force.

During the meeting, Palpatine expressed his anger at his father, and he also revealed that he had known the two would come for him, despite the fact that the visit was supposed to be a surprise.

A communication from Palpatine interrupted 11-4D and Plagueis's work to inform them that the youth had killed his own parents using the Force in a fit of anger. 11-4D supplied Palpatine's location by request and accompanied a squad of Plagueis's Sun Guards to help the young Naboo noble.

In a question session on Facebook, Luceno commented that 11-4D was present when Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker was fitted with his armor as he became the Sith Lord Darth Vader, a scene from 2005's Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. Luceno also stated that it was possible that 11-4D was one of the droids that ambushed the elite Republic squad Aurek Team as they neared Palpatine's secret lair on Coruscant, an event which happened in Luceno's own book, Labyrinth of Evil, also in 2005. However, neither of Luceno's theories have been confirmed as canon. Despite Darth Plagueis more commonly referring to 11-4D as an \"it,\" this article assumes that the droid has masculine programming due to the book occasionally referring to it as a male."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
