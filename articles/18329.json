It consisted of bunches of long, thin blue leaves and was named for the similarity in appearance its leaves bore to the tongues of the Hutt species, despite Hutt tongues being pink. The plant collected water in the conical fronds of its leaves, which formed protected pools that breeding amphibians would then use. During the Onderonian Civil War in the year 20 BBY, it could be found growing in the forests surrounding the world's capital city Iziz as well as those close to the camp maintained by the resistance movement fighting in the war. The shrub also grew in the mountain region where the insurgent fort known as the nest was built."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Blue Hutt's tongue first appeared in \"A War on Two Fronts\" the second episode of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television show's fifth season, which aired on October 6, 2012.
