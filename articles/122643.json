Though the two sectors were nominally independent of each other, with both the Senex and Juvex sectors returning senators to Coruscant, in practice they were culturally and politically identical, together making up the Senex-Juvex. The sector was long independent of the Galactic Republic, ruled by an alliance of \"Ancient Houses,\" including Elegin, Garonnin, Taneel, and Vandron (which was the oldest and noblest)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sector was originally settled after the Ruusan Reformations, by a group of settlers under the leadership of Thull Vandron. Vandron and his followers desired to keep central government control to an absolute minimum, and when the Ruusan Reformations failed to meet their standard, they abandoned known space and settled the Senex-Juvex, where the highest form of government would only be that of the houses controlling individual planets. In 553 BBY, a conflict known as the Crimson Days broke out in the sector, but was ended by the Third Nantama Synod."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sector was self-supporting, but desired open trade with the Republic and at the Fourth Nantama Synod, the Houses decided to make peace with the Republic. They tried to establish commercial links with Republic mega-corporations, but the Galactic Senate stopped this, due to the widespread use of slavery in the Senex sector. It gained the right to trade after aiding the Republic in cracking down on the Nebula Front, which was based on the Senex planet Asmeru. At some point prior to the end of the Clone Wars, the sector was finally permitted into the Republic, and represented in the Galactic Senate by Terr Taneel. The Galactic Empire maintained only a token presence in the sector, and it never joined the New Republic. It was the center of the Ismaren plot. The Herzfall Communications Corporation was based in the sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to Asmeru, planets in the sector include Hutlar, Karfeddion, Neelanon, Yetoom Na Uun, Mussubir Three, and Senex itself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Children of the Jedi seems to imply Picutorion is in Senex sector, but The Hunt Within: Valance's Tale places it in Kwymar sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
