During his rule, the export of lu-ramin from Ebra was heavily restricted. Though the native Ebranites had formerly sold most of their lu-ramin to the Carosites, Jenton's regime cut this trade off in favor of exclusive exports to Imperial-authorized corporations and cultures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial repression of the Ebranites went far beyond trade restrictions. Governor Jenton assumed absolute control over Ebran politics, supplanting the traditional clan-based government of the Ebranites. Any Ebranite suspected of seditious sentiments was exiled to the lu-ramin mines of Grythsorin. Hundreds of Ebranites took up arms against Imperial rule, becoming part of the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
