In her free time, Doza enjoyed playing and relaxing with Buggles. BB-8 once encountered Buggles loose in the Colossus marketplace, and was followed by Buggles into Aunt Z's Tavern. Buggles subsequently nearly tripped up Lin Gaava while she was exiting her booth."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Torra's gilded cage"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later Torra, annoyed at being confined to her bedroom by her father, used Buggles to escape from the droid 4D-M1N by giving him to her, explaining that he needed to be take out or else he would have another accident indoors. After 4D-M1N left, Torra slipped out of her bedroom as she had deduced the passcode, but her presence in the hallway was given away when Buggles saw her over 4D's shoulder and reacted. The droid was prevented from chasing after Torra, however, when Buggles then urinated on the floor. When Torra later returned to her room, accompanied by Kazuda Xiono, Buggles was present while they played Flight Simulator Squadron. After Xiono left Doza Tower after a series of events, Torra cuddled her pet while wondering what he was hiding."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Running circles around Xiono"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later Torra asked Xiono to watch Buggles at Jarek Yeager's Repair Station while she was busy. However, the Voorpak escaped Xiono, first eating the contents of a bowl before running outside and hopping onto the precarious structures at the very edge of the platform, with Xiono in pursuit. He nearly managed to catch Buggles before the pet bounded off again, to his dismay. When Torra returned in search of Buggles, Xiono evaded her question of where he was. The voorpak had gotten into the cockpit of the Fireball, and managed to launch the starship by randomly pressing buttons. Torra asked who was piloting the ship, and Xiono was forced to admit it was Buggles, to her horror."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Torra's kidnapping"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Buggles was present when Torra brought her friends Kaz, Tamara Ryvora, and the undercover pirate spy Synara San to her room for a game of Drone-Blaster.
