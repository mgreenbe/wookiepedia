Sab\u00e9 gathered alongside Captains Tonra and Gregar Typho of the Royal Naboo Security Forces, and numerous others loyal to Amidala in the former queen's apartment on Coruscant, pledging to hunt down and kill whoever was responsible for her death. By 3 ABY, Sab\u00e9 and her team were still active, having come to the conclusion that Amidala was killed by the Galactic Empire enforcer Darth Vader\u2014who was, unbeknownst to them, Amidala's husband and the former Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. On Naboo, the Amidalans called an Sando aqua monster; as Vader was eaten by it, he stabbed it through the upper-mouth, being the first person to have been known to kill a sando aqua monster. Sab\u00e9 soon encountered Vader on Vendaxa, leading him back to Naboo, where she, Tonra, and Typho attempted to kill him. However, Vader managed to use the Force to choke each of them and escaped. Luckily, each of them survived, but Vader was soon met by an army of Amidalans led by Captain Ric Oli\u00e9 waiting for him and his death troopers. Vader managed to subdue each one, however, and stabbed Oli\u00e9 through the shoulder, wounding, but not fully killing, him. On Polis Massa, Vader encountered the Amidalan Fleet, who tried to kill him, but Vader either used the force to blow up their engines, or his saber to cut them off, he defeated the fleet, and returned to his master Palpatine, leaving the Amidalans there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
