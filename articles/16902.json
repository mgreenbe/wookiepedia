However, it featured a much larger base, allowing it to target starfighters over top of the buildings on Gerrard V. It also had a much thicker armor than the XX-9 Turbolasers, and a larger field of view, allowing it to hit targets closer to the ground. It fired in volleys as opposed to steadily like typical turbo-lasers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Big Gun Turret destruction was one of the objectives for Rogue Squadron during the Liberation of Gerrard V.
