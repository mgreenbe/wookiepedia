It came in many different varieties, like armguards. Since the impurities of the ore were removed, they were as good at repelling lightsabers as cortosis weave armor. Like cortosis weave, a lightsaber impact against the substance would shut off a lightsaber. The lightsaber would then have to restart in order for it to work properly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Desolous and his army of Pau'an soldiers used cortosis alloy shields in countless battles.
