Toa resided on the Nautolan homeworld of Glee Anselm and was at some point discovered to be Force-sensitive.

At some point, Toa was found to be sensitive to the Force, information which was eventually obtained by the Jedi Order. The Order entered Zinn Toa's identity into the memory device known as the Kyber crystal, a database that contained the names of all known Force-sensitive infants in the galaxy. The crystal\u2014which was highly valuable, as it was used to recruit the future Knights of the Jedi Order\u2014was protected by Jedi Master Bolla Ropal during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the Order's attempts to keep the crystal safe, the crystal eventually came to the attention of the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious. Sidious plotted to use the crystal to identify Force-sensitive children that he could use to create an army of spies and assassins proficient in the dark side of the Force that would carry out his will throughout the galaxy. To this end, the Dark Lord hired the infamous Duros bounty hunter Cad Bane to retrieve the Kyber crystal and use it to kidnap Sidious's future agents. After hunting down Master Ropal on Devaron and killing him, Bane took the crystal and supplied Sidious with the information on it."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Kidnapped"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the Dark Lord's orders, Bane set out to capture several Force-sensitive children and deliver them to Sidious's secret installation on the volcanic Outer Rim world of Mustafar. Bane's first target was Toa, who was taken from Glee Anselm and delivered to Sidious's base, where he was tended to by the Sith's nanny droids. Toa's kidnapping was seen in a Force vision to Jedi Master Mace Windu during a meditation session by the Jedi High Council to ascertain Bane's targets, but Windu received this vision only after the kidnapping had taken place."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Toa was soon joined by Wee Dunn, a Rodian infant that had also been captured by Bane. Together, the two were watched over by several nanny droids, including RO-Z67, and the holographic form of Darth Sidious. The Dark Lord planned to have the nannies perform a surgical slave conditioning operation on the infants that would bind them to his will, despite RO-Z67's warning that the operation would likely kill Toa and Dunn. Before the droids could begin the operation, however, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, arrived at the base, having identified it as Bane's drop-off location, to rescue the children."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the holographic Sidious was alerted to the Jedi's presence, he ordered that Toa and Dunn be moved to a secondary facility and that the gravity supports for his base be turned off in order to destroy the evidence of his involvement in the kidnapping of the infants. The nanny droids complied and seized the children before the Jedi arrived. Hoping to avoid detection, the droids shut off the lights and hid in the shadows of the nursery room as Tano and Skywalker entered and inspected the room. Skywalker could still sense Toa's presence, but before he could continue searching, the droids attacked the Jedi, brandishing the infants as shields. As the nanny droids struggled with Skywalker and Tano, the base began to break apart and fall into the lava flow beneath it. The droid carrying Toa was quickly destroyed by Tano before falling into the lava, leaving the Nautolan safe in the Padawan's arms. Skywalker and Tano then rushed out of the crumbling facility and fled Mustafar with the infants in tow. Neither Toa nor Dunn were returned to their parents, as the Jedi Order believed that the ultimate results of the traumatic ordeal that the infants had endured could not be determined. They were instead raised as Jedi from that point onward."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zinn Toa first appeared in the third episode of the second season of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series, entitled \"Children of the Force.\" While the episode itself does not describe Toa's experiences following his rescue, both the \"Children of the Force\" episode commentary and the \"Drawing Jedi Younglings\" article on StarWars.com indicate that the young Nautolan was taken into the Jedi Order in the episode's aftermath."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
