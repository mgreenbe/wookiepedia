The creature possessed claws, moving on four legs. The being had been trapped within ice within the Shrine inside the caves of the planet Rystan, guarded by droid attendants and revered by the ancestors of Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro, who were unaware that the Leveler was not its true name. Ro visited Rystan with the Force-sensitive Talortai Udi Dis and was guided to the Shrine by his cousin, Kufa; by that point, the Leveler had not been visited for some time. As they approached the Shrine, Dis began to be overwhelmed by the Leveler. Ro, who had brought Dis as a test of the Leveler's power, killed both the Talortai and Kufa, retrieving the Leveler and containing the creature aboard his flagship, Gaze Electric at the Nihil marauder base on Grizal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aboard the Gaze Electric, the Chadra-Fan doctor Kisma Uttersond fabricated a heating rig for the ice block, as well as grafting a camera into the Leveler's back so that Ro could view the creature's movements. Some time afterward, during a Jedi attack on the Nihil's camp, Ro used two halves of an artifact to control the Leveler, freeing the creature, which leapt from the starship, having become insatiable due to its time in the ice. Though Ro soon used the artifact to call the Leveler back to the Gaze Electric, which escaped into hyperspace, it left the the Padawan Bell Zettifar overwhelmed and the Jedi Master Loden Greatstorm turned to stone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
