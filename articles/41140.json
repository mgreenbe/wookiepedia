As a result of podracer crash, Swiftbird became injured and Ducky's neural net was scrambled, rendering the droid inoperable. Swiftbird subsequently gave up her career as a podracer and enlisted into the Antarian Rangers; she took Ducky's remains with her, and the droid's chassis lay among a pile of droid parts inside the Rangers base Mountain Home on the planet Toprawa. In about 18 BBY, Ducky's chassis was repaired by the Rodian mech-tech Geri and used to temporarily house the droid brain of the droid I-5YQ, whose own body had been destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
