Overconfident in his abilities, Lok ventured into the Chasm, a rent in the surface of the planet Tython that drove mad all who dove too deep into its depths. There, Lok witnessed a vision of an army of dark warriors wielding blades of fire, and the vision drove the Je'daii mad, driving him to the dark side of the Force.

However, as Lok gazed deeper into the darkness, both he and Ryo were overcome by a Force vision of an army of dark warriors wielding blades of frozen fire marching across Ska Gora, led by a being with one red eye.

As a result, both Lok and Ryo were exiled to the moon of Bogan, where the two were ordered to meditate on the Force and restore their inner balance. Ryo came to deny his vision and found balance once more, but Lok refused to forsake his vision and the dark side. Over the next seven years, Lok figured out how to remove the cuffs that kept prisoners separate, and he also discovered a crashed Pho-V fighter that had escaped the Je'daii's notice.

A few days later, the dark warrior arrived on Bogan, having been exiled there by the Je'daii. Two months after that, Lok decided to test the stranger's powers and attacked him, using a mind twist to manipulate his opponent's mind.

As Xesh continued his efforts to restore power, he soon began to overload the reactor, and Lok angered the young warrior when he pulled Xesh away from the cells.

On Krev Coeur, Lok sought out Slug, who was on the world, and he called in the favor Slug owed him from Sunspot. Slug led them to a particularly valuable reserve of crystals, which Xesh began to peruse to find the crystals necessary to create Forcesabers. When Slug objected to Xesh's selection, Lok mind-tricked Slug into accepting the deal\u2014but when Slug began to discuss the rumors that Lok had gone mad and asked for payment so that he would not tell the Je'daii about his presence on Krev Coeur, Lok threw Slug off of the nearby cliff."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fortunately for Slug, a Je'daii Ranger named Bel Zana reached out with the Force and saved him, and Zana then ordered the two fugitives to stand down.

Lok's power over her mind was so total that Zana's body itself believed it was on fire and began to manifest burn marks, though Temple Master Jake Fenn and Je'daii Journeyer Sek'nos Rath arrived to support Zana. Fenn engaged Lok in battle, and though Fenn scored an early strike on Lok, the mad Je'daii gained the upper hand over the Temple Master by pretending to be weakened.

When the process was complete, Xesh gave one of the weapons to Lok and told him how the blade was powered by the dark side, though Lok showed himself perfectly capable of igniting the blade. The next stage of Lok's plan involved gathering an army, so he and Lok sought out Hadiya's four remaining generals\u2014Bakko, Shri-Lan, Gav Vannar, and Ka'un Damm\u2014in Skrag's Cantina in the city of Boneyard. A hooded Lok introduced Xesh to the four criminals before revealing his face, and Xesh and Lok made quick work of the slugthrowers that the four drew on Lok when they recognized him.

Locating Baron Volnos in his personal chambers, Lok explained his plans to unite the remaining Hadiya loyalists on Shikaakwa into an army, and Lok countered Ryo's exclamations of belief by reminding the baron how he himself had had a hand in Hadiya's death by helping Lok infiltrate the Despot Army. An angry Ryo deployed a security droid that targeted both Xesh and Ryo with lasers, but when Ryo implied that Xesh was Lok's servant, the infuriated Force Hound pulled Ryo into the line of fire with the Force before using his Forcesaber to bat back the droid's fire and destroy it.

As he knelt over the downed Je'daii and prepared to toy with her mind, Hawk Ryo delivered a flying kick to Lok's jaw to knock him away. Drawing their Forcesabers, the two began to duel as Lok pried into Ryo's mind and overwhelmed him with memories of the vision they shared in the Chasm. Ryo disrupted Lok's attempts by throwing him against a nearby wall with the Force, and Lok expressed his fury and disgust with his former friend about how he had refused to acknowledge the truth of their vision\u2014and how he refused to acknowledge the fact that the Je'daii would only survive if they embraced the dark side. Xesh's arrival gave Lok the time he needed to recover his Forcesaber, and he sliced off Ryo's leg below the knee as the Ranger was battling Xesh.

Lok discovered the main Rakatan position, but when he encountered a number of large walkers, he fled their destructive firepower and encountered Xesh. Xesh identified the attackers as Rakatan annihilators, and at Xesh's instruction, Lok ordered Hawk Ryo's squadrons to conduct a strafing run on their position despite the presence of Je'daii in the area.
