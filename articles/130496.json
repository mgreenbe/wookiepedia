In the Anaxes War College System, any warship that was between 1 and 2 kilometers in length qualifies as a Star Destroyer, excepting cases where the vessel, despite its length matching that of a heavy cruiser or battlecruiser, had less or more armaments than their class or role. Examples include the 900m Victory-series of Star Destroyer and the 2.2km Secutor-class Star Destroyer.

Destroyers could usually carry 10,000 or more people aboard it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Star Destroyers were considered medium-weight warships. With the increase in warship-sizes during the time of the Empire, Star Destroyers were sometimes denoted as smaller vessels in the Imperial Navy. In combat, Star Destroyers usually surpassed contemporary destroyer designs, similar to how the star frigates eclipsed most contemporary frigate classes. The Star Destroyer designation was usually used for warships ranging from about 500 meters to about 3.8 kilometers in length, but the general term was used for much larger vessels as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the formation of the Anaxes War College System during the early stages of the Galactic Empire, Star Destroyers were classified as generally being between 1000 to 2000 meters in length.

Other Republic Star Destroyers, like the Imperator- and Tector-classes, became infamous for their service in the Imperial Navy. The new Star Destroyer designs were born from the success of the Acclamator-class assault ship. In addition, then-Supreme Chancellor of the Republic and future Galactic Emperor Palpatine mentioned in his Sith compendium, the Book of Sith, that the Star Destroyers developed during this time also shared similarities with the Harrower-class dreadnought."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial and New Republic usage"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Empire, many smaller and less independent dagger-shaped ships, such as the Immobilizer 418 cruiser and the Broadside-class cruiser, were often compared to small Star Destroyers without being classified as one themselves. In the Broadside's case, it was downgraded from 'Star Destroyer' to 'cruiser', due to its lack of defensive power and mobility. In large part because of a Star Destroyer's capabilities, Mon Mothma, the leader of the Rebel Alliance, noted that if the Empire fragmented after Endor, it would pose the risk of any Imperial commander with access to a Star Destroyer becoming a warlord."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Star Destroyers served as the heaviest combatants in many fleets composed of frigates and down-scaled cruisers, they performed an escort role when in the presence of specialized battleships found in the Republic Navy, or larger Imperial warships such as the Executor-class.\nBoth the Republic and the Empire maintained a higher-tier system of vessels heavier and more powerful than Star Destroyers, categorized from Battlecruisers to Star Dreadnoughts. Building on the popularity the Star Destroyers gained in the Clone Wars, and the name of the \"Super-class Star Destroyer\", many of these heavy vessels were referred to in military colloquialism as \"Super Star Destroyers\" (sometimes omitting the \"Super\" prefix).
