Leaving Tano with Turmond, the shock troopers returned to the guard post. Meanwhile Turmond revealed that a Jedi had showed her how to make the bomb in an effort to make a statement against the Jedi being involved in the war. Before Turmond could give Tano the name, Turmond was Force-choked, unknown to all, by Jedi Barriss Offee. However, the view from the security cameras made it appears as if Tano was the one choking Turmond. The trooper notified Fox of Turmond's distress. They quickly rushed into the cell, only to find Tano, apparently distraught, bending over Turmond's dead body. Fox, while not blaming Tano for wanting revenge on a traitor, placed her under arrest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
