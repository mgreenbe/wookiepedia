They had truces with the other criminal groups of Corellia, including the Mourner's Wail Syndicate, who broke the truce, hiring a number of bounty hunters to attack the Unbroken Clan sanctuary. The Unbroken Clan's leader became ineffective in the time after the mission, keeping to himself and grieving in the aftermath of the mission, which led to the death of his daughter, Krynthia. General Vukorah of the Unbroken Clan eventually took control of the syndicate, eliminating those with loyalties to the old line and becoming its leader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
