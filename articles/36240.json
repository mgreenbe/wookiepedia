They blamed the Mon Calamari for the arrival of the Galactic Empire, and fought the occupiers. Deep Hunters preferred to live off the ocean's bounty, using their tools and skills to survive. They occasionally worked as guides and guards to undersea explorers. Deep Hunters usually wore deepsuits, and were armed with a speargun. They also generally maintained a two-man submersible."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
