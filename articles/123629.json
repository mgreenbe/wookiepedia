Unbeknownst to the Rebels, the droid in fact served Imperial Intelligence and revolted once they were onboard the frigate, managing to take control of the ship as it began drifting toward a black hole. TJ-11, leader of the droids, intended to escape the doomed ship with rebel Captain Hylo Sortuli and navigator Tay Coomsay, but the agents who had delivered the droids were able to successfully defeat the tactical droid, rescue the captives, and retake the ship, saving it from the black hole."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
