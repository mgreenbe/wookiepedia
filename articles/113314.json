While many refugees elected to simply move to a less dangerous region of their homeworld, as seen on Ord Mantell during the Cold War, many others were forced to flee their planets altogether. Such mass exoduses were seen during the Mandalorian Wars, when the surface of Serroco was blasted into glass craters by Mandalorian nuclear warheads. On worlds that were common hosts to refugee populations, specific regions became dedicated to their housing and shelter. The Refugee Sector on Nar Shaddaa served this purpose, as did the Old Galactic Market and Underworld on Coruscant. During the final decades of the Galactic Republic's reign, the Refugee Relief Movement operated with the intent to aid refugees fleeing from violence or coping with disaster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The refugees of Nar Shaddaa were a loosely knit group of asylum seekers from the Mandalorian Wars and the Jedi Civil War, led\u2014unofficially\u2014by Hussef, consisted of civilians and ex-soldiers the Republic, Mandalorians and Sith. They were forced to live in horrendous and cramped conditions in a small maze of cargo containers and prefabricated structures in the Refugee Sector of Nar Shaddaa, and were constantly harried by the exploitative schemes of the Exchange and the aggressive Serroco thugs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Jedi Exile visited the Refugee Sector in her search for Jedi Master Zez-Kai Ell in 3951 BBY, she helped the struggling refugees greatly by 'persuading' both factions to give the refugees more living space, as well as aiding several of the refugees with their individual problems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
