Initial comments made by author John Ostrander via the Jedi Council Forums in 2002 initially placed Rite of Passage circa 29 BBY, while both the first and second edition trade paperback collections, released in 2004, place Rite of Passage: \"approximately twenty-eight years before the events in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.\" 2007's Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force further corroborated the 28 BBY date through the inclusion of comments, specifically dated at 28 BBY, attributed to Tholme, shortly before Quinlan Vos became a Jedi Master, as depicted in Star Wars 45. Both Star Wars: The Comics Companion, published in 2006, and 2010's Star Wars Omnibus: Quinlan Vos: Jedi in Darkness once again erroneously placed Rite of Passage in 30 BBY. The in-universe quotes by Quinlan and Tholme, both dictate that Rite of Passage takes place in 28 BBY. The scenes of the Part 1 flashback that depict the Force-sensitive Twi'lek infant Aayla Secura's discovery by Vos were conceived in their timeline placement to occur two years before the Stark Hyperspace War, in 46 BBY, when Secura was two years old."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
