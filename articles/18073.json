The Imperial Navy used Interdictor cruisers and sensor nets to block all the hyperlanes leading through the sector. The Rebel Alliance launched an operation to destroy the blockade control center on Argovia. The cargo ship captain Leona Makk managed in forcing the blockade and drove an Alliance strike team to the planet.
