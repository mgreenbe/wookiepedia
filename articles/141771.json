Designed to be as much of a weapon as a reinforcement for his gnarled frame, Sinube only exposed the duplicity of his stick when armed combat was the necessary course of action. When needed, he would activate his lightsaber by separating the handle and collar from the shaft to produce a pale blue beam of plasma. Sinube used his saber during the Clone Wars, a conflict that pitted the Republic against the Separatists, when he wielded it to great effect against the thieving Terrelian Jango Jumper Cassie Cryar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to his age, Jedi Master Tera Sinube utilized a cane lightsaber, a specialized device that was both a crutch and a lightsaber in one. The handle of Sinube's lightsaber was T-shaped, and along with a collar, connecting the weapon to the shaft. Powered by a kyber crystal, the saber emitted a very light blue plasma that almost appeared white. The intricately carved collar was connected to a shaft that finished with an enlarged ferrule, the size of which provided increased stability and support for the aged Cosian as he moved about. The rounded ferrule had a flat bottom and four symmetrically placed protrusions. In its completed form, the lightsaber was roughly half the height of Master Sinube."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Force-users advanced in age and became less able to sustain themselves physically, they made use of devices to help lessen the burden on their bodies. In situations where a peaceful approach was less practical and therefore required more aggressive negotiations, some chose to abandon their walking sticks entirely in favor of lightsabers. Master Sinube, however, fought with both his cane and lightsaber, as they were one and the same. He surprised his opponents, who attacked Sinube as though he was unarmed, by separating the lightsaber from his cane and wielding both parts in concert, with the lightsaber in place as the bladed weapon while the ferrule at the end of the shaft\u2014which Sinube brandished in a reverse grip\u2014served as an effective bludgeon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi investigator Tera Sinube's lightsaber was crafted some time before the battle of Saleucami, a conflict during the pan-galactic Clone Wars which pitted the Galactic Republic against the Separatist Alliance. Sinube utilized his lightsaber while on a quest to find the missing lightsaber of Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano in the year 21 BBY. The two Jedi traversed the lower levels of the galactic capital world of Coruscant and eventually found the Terrelian Jango Jumper Cassie Cryar in possession of Tano's weapon. They were forced to give chase and were able to eventually corner Cryar on a train. When Cryar attempted to attack Sinube with Tano's lightsaber, the Cosian Jedi Master separated the shaft from the handle and collar, from which he then produced his lightsaber blade. Wielding shaft and saber in either hand, Sinube proceeded to battle Cryar with both parts, parrying several of her ripostes with his lightsaber before using the cane extension like a cudgel and striking Cryar in the head with it. The Jedi then retrieved the lightsaber from Cryar, letting the unconscious thief get arrested by the police droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the Clone Wars, in the year 19 BBY, Sinube was overseeing a group of younglings training in the courtyard of the Jedi Temple when Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Padawan Barriss Offee's duel spilled out of the Temple corridors.
