In 44 ABY, the dark side being Abeloth, who had achieved control over the native Theran Listeners Force organization, drew the Listners there and began feeding off of them. However, Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker, his son, Jedi Knight Ben Skywalker, and their friend, Sith apprentice Vestara Khai tracked Abeloth there and confronted her. Luke defeated Abeloth, tearing the spirit of the Jedi Knight Callista Ming\u2014whom Abeloth had consumed and killed years previously\u2014from Abeloth. The Master of the Theran Listeners, Nenn, who had also fallen under Abeloth's control, then committed suicide, further weakening Abeloth. As she fled, however, a group of Sith led by Sith Saber Tola Annax attacked the Jedi in the pumping station, but Khai killed a tsil\u2014a native sentient crystal\u2014creating a massive death convulsion that allowed them to flee from the Sith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
