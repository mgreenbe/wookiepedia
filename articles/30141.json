Shortly before the siege of Inyusu Tor, Malaqua's name was given alongside fellow Rebels Nunb and Sian Tevv as potential infiltrators that Imperial forces located in the city Pinyumb should be on the look out for. It was believed that the three may smuggle arms and equipment in for a full-on revolution."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short while later, the Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry found themselves stranded on Sullust at Inyusu Tor. Their Captain, Hazram Namir, then went to Pinyumb to find the Sullustan resistance for support. He and his men were ambushed before Nunb saved the expedition group and took the team to Corjentain, who was with two other Humans within the resistance. She explained her resistance's role on Sullust and stated that she could only help him return to the rest of the Sixty-First. The aground Sixty-First later successfully defended the captured factory on Inyusu Tor, hence allowing Nunb to take the opportunity to rally the Sullustan resistance along with the Cobalt Laborers' Reformation Front to wrestle Pinyumb from Imperial occupation, instigating a planet-wide uprising on Sullust."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
