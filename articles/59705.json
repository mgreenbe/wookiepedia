During the course of the battle, Harm reported that the bases shields were still at one hundred percent, despite being bombarded by the New Republic Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Emancipator. At this point, General Evir Derricote, commander of the Imperial base on Borleias, ordered him to begin stepping the power back in random amounts. As Derricote had anticipated, the Emancipator scaled back the bombardment of the base as soon as the shields dropped, allowing Derricote's forces to launch a successful counterattack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Harm first appeared in the 1996 novel X-Wing: Rogue Squadron, written by Michael A.
