She ruled a region of the Grumani sector known as the Arkadianate, which was governed according to a philosophy of ordered chaos which involved rotating her subjects in different jobs to keep them perpetually distracted. Those living on her capital, the icy world of Syned, were expected to be familiar with a wide variety of professions and prepared to be appointed to any particular job at any given time. In 1032 BBY, Arkadia invaded and annexed the Dyarchy world of Byllura, which was ruled by her younger siblings, and took them under her custody. Her conquest was inadvertently assisted by the efforts of Jedi Knight Kerra Holt and the mercenary leader Jarrow Rusher who had fought of the Dyarchy's attempts to assimilate them into a Force-induced mental thralldom."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the battle, Arkadia attempted to win over Kerra and Jarrow by providing them with refuge at her capital city of Calimondretta; intending to keep the student refugees aboard their ship Diligence as her new subjects. Later, she tried to persuade Kerra to assassinate her grandmother, Vilia Calimondra, supposedly because she believed that Vilia had her father murdered. Vilia would later, while neither confirming nor denying that she had killed Chagras, note that Arkadia herself was an equally likely suspect. When Holt refused, Arkadia had her imprisoned, intending to extract information from her and then kill her. However, Narsk Ka'hane, an independent operator for several Sith Lords, secretly freed Holt while Rusher helped destroy much of the complex to ensure they and their refugee charges' escape from the Arkadianate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rise to power"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arkadia Calimondra grew up in the Calimondra family during the Republic Dark Age, a period when various Sith Lords controlled large areas of the galaxy. The Calimondra family was one of these powerful Sith dynasties and ruled the Grumani sector in the Outer Rim. Her father was the Sith Lord Chagras who ruled the Chagras Hegemony, one of the feuding remnants of the Sith Empire which had sparked the Fourth Great Schism in 2000 BBY. Her grandmother Vilia Calimondra who occupied a managerial position as the family matriarch. Due to the competing claims of seven children, she devised an armed contest known as Charge Matricas whereby the heir that conquered the most territory would inherit her vast holdings. Beginning in 1066 BBY, the Charge Matrica lasted several decades and laid waste to large areas of the Outer Rim. This conflict when one heir alone\u2014Chagras\u2014emerged victorious; heralding a shaky peace which depended on the cooperation of his nephews and nieces. Chagras became the titular ruler of a Sith dynasty known as the Chagras Hegemony, which bordered his mother's empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1040 BBY, Chagras was killed during an attack involving nerve gas, which led to the collapse of the Hegemony into several warring factions. This coupled by rival Sith Lord Xelian waging war on the Chagras Hegemony brought about a second series of conflicts known as the Second Charge Matrica, which was fought among Vilia's numerous grandchildren. Following the death of her father, Arkadia established her own state known as the Arkadianate with her capital being Calimondretta, a new settlement on the frozen planet of Syned. She saw herself as a benevolent autocratic dictator and implemented a policy of continuously rotating her subjects in different jobs throughout their lives. For example by 1032 BBY, the Herglic mother Seese had worked in at least five different occupations including teaching, algae-processing, metallic reclamation, as a tactical officer on Arkadia's flagship New Crucible, and a tour guide on Calimondretta. She justified this policy on the rationale that it instilled flexibility and versatility among her subjects by providing them with experience in different lines of work. However, it was designed to prevent the emergence of any potential domestic threats to her rule since it kept even her most skilled subordinates perpetually preoccupied with new assignments."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In contrast to most of her contemporaries, Arkadia was seemingly open to dialogue and criticism when the situation was in her favor. Unlike other Sith Lords who neglected the social welfare of their subjects, Arkadia invested substantially in providing extensive social services like education, food, and even clothing. She established several schools throughout a realm known as Promisoriums, which were open to individuals of diverse species and also boasted extensive dining facilities. Under Arkadia's regime, students would work to become as versatile as possible so that as adults they could contribute to her state. This contrasted with her cousins Daiman who exploited children as forced laborers and Odion who had all the children in his realm imprisoned in a series of planet-sized orphanages known as cloisters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Her capital Calimondretta was known to import large stocks of food to sustain its population. Arkadia also implemented a policy of making her subjects wear bright clothing allegedly under the pretext of helping them become more \"noticeable and memorable\" individuals. The Arkadianate was also comparatively more enlightened than other Sith states since it did not utilize violence in coercing people into work. Despite its positive aspects, the Arkadianate still remained an authoritarian dictatorship centered around the personal philosophy of its titular ruler Arkadia Calimondra. She had her enemies imprisoned in harsh conditions at the Impound on Calimondretta, where they were also subjugated to much physical discomfort and torture. Finally, Arkadia harbored ambitions of killing her grandmother Vilia as part of her irredentist ambitions of enlarging her own empire within the Grumani Sector. She also invested much resources into the development of a deadly nerve toxin called Chagras's Blood, which was harvested from Synedian alga. She planned to deploy the bioweapon for assassinations and military offensives."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Annexing the Dyarchy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 1032 BBY, Arkadia had turned her attention to the Dyarchy, a small Sith principality centered around the planet Byllura. The planet was nominally ruled by her younger twin siblings\u2014her brother Quillan and her sister Dromika\u2014but real power actually lay in the hands of their Krevaaki Regent Saaj Calician. The two Sith twins had powerful mental telepathic powers which they used to enthrall the planet's population into mindless slaves. Under the guidance of Calician, Quillan had created an organic mental telepathic network spanning the entire planet with a network of enslaved Celegians serving as conduit points to relay the twin's commands. Due to its secluded location, the Dyarchy remained isolated from other developments occurring within the Grumani sector and the wider galaxy. By that year, Calician had also assembled a fleet of newly-constructed battleships known as the Dyarchy Fleet for an invasion of the rearward systems of the Daimanate, the state ruled by Xelian's younger son Lord Daiman."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the collapse of the Bactranate, the Jedi Knight Kerra Holt and the Brigadier Jarrow Rusher fled to Byllura aboard the modified troopship Diligence, which carried over a thousand student refugees who had escaped from the Battle of Gazzari.

Bereft of one of its twin \"strongmen\", the highly-centralized Dyarchy was unable to function since there was no one to give instructions. His sister Dromika had descended into a comatose state and Calician lacked the means to communicate with his fleet of battleships. The Dyarchy Fleet's warships were captained by Celegians and were intended to operate as an organic extension of the twin's planet-bound command. Without its centralized leadership, it could not function. This scene of chaos enabled Akadia's fleet to enter the Bylluran system and easily wipe the fleet and occupy the capital city Hestobyll with minimal resistance. Arkadianate forces freed the enslaved Celegians and imposed a military occupation which heralded a transition to Arkadianate rule."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Narsk was present when Arkadianate soldiers executed the deposed Regent Calician who calmly accepted his demise. He later presented these findings in a report to his employer Arkadia who justified Calician's death due to his role as the mastermind who manipulated the twins' powers. During the battle, Arkadia's fleet also intercepted the Diligence and made contact with Kerra and Rusher, offering to provide help and shelter to their refugee passengers in exchange for handing over Quillan.

Arkadia stated that she was here to help and offered to give shelter for the refugees aboard the Diligence. She also requested that Lord Quillan of Byllura be handed over to her custody. Kerra was initially apprehensive until Arkadia revealed that Quillan was her brother and professed to care for the well-being of her younger brother. Kerra and Rusher quickly produced Quillan, who remained in a semi-catatonic state, and was accompanied by the teenaged Sullustan girl Tan Tengo and one of Rusher's mercenaries: the Duros Beadle Lubboon. Arkadia then took her visitors on a tour of her capital city Calimondretta.

During the tour, Arkadia praised her guests for \"making history\" by helping her to bring about the defeat of the Dyarchy. She complimented Kerra by remarking that she was a destabilizing factor wherever she went in Sith Space. She also attributed her recent victory to its leader Quillan's dependence on using a physical linkage to maintain his power, since that linkage could be attacked.

Arkadia remarked that she had arranged for the twins to separated permanently due to the strong Force connection between them. With Dromika free from the domination of her twin brother Quillan, Arkadia expressed her hope that she could now have a better life.

Narsk demands to have his stealth suit returned to him. She then allowed her to go on a tour of Calimondretta with the Herglic tour guide Seese. During the tour, Kerra became acquainted with ordinary life within the Arkadianate. While she liked Arkadia's socially progressive policies and the absence of violent coercion within her domain, Kerra felt uncomfortable about the former's policies of rotating people through different occupations throughout their lives. Meanwhile, the Sullustan student Tan was completely bought over by Arkadia's charismatic personality and \"utopian\" society particularly its well-run Promisoriums. Due to her impoverished background growing up in the Daimanate, Tan had little exposure to other parts of the galaxy. At one point, the teenaged Sullustan gave Arkadia a hug, which pleased the Sith Lord but caused Kerra to wince."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arkadia saw this as an opportunity to promote a favorable image of her realm by inviting Tan to tell her friends aboard the Diligence about the supposedly \"good life\" waiting for them in the Arkadianate. Arkadia also sent one of her Twi'lek assistants Warmalo to help Rusher replenish his stock of food for the refugees. Rusher himself was surprised by the wide variety of food available within the Arkadinate. Sensing that the Twi'lek had outlived his usefulness as a cargo worker, Arkadia had him reassigned to a new position as the director of metallurgical operations on Syned. When Kerra queried on whether the Twi'lek had any training in metallurgy, Arkadia merely replied that Warmalo had the same grounding she expected from all her people.

She also claimed that constant revival was needed to ensure that a Sith Lord's rule lasted forever.

Her more skilled underlings never became rivals because they were always having something new to do in order to maintain their place in society. While, Arkadia offered sanctuary to all the refugee students on Syned, Kerra still did not trust the Sith Lord. She sensed that Arkadia wanted to utilize her services in return for guaranteeing the safety of her student refugee charges. In the case of Rusher however, Arkadia was not interested in recruiting mercenary groups like Rusher's Brigade because she regarded their thinking as too narrow. Finally, Arkadia departed to prepare for a meeting at her museum in Calimondretta."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Kerra remained aloof and suspicious of Arkadia, Rusher by contrast was completely taken in by Arkadia's personality and utopian policies. He revealed that the Arkadianites had offered to provide a big icecrawler to transport the Diligence and all its passengers to Calimondretta, where they would be given refuge. He also argued that they should remain on Syned since they lacked any knowledge of reliable hyperspace routes that would allow them to travel back to the Republic safely. Kerra then criticized Rusher for her willingness to work for different Sith Lords. This led to a heated argument between the two erstwhile allies with Kerra arguing that Rusher should put his energies into working for the people. Rusher responded that he had to care for the lives and well-being of his crew and passengers. One of Arkadia's Citizen Guards then interrupted their conversation to summon Kerra to participate in a meeting at the museum. Meanwhile, Rusher was instructed to wait outside for a meeting at Arkadia's Museum. Brigadier Rusher is instructed to wait outside once he had finished work with the Arkadianate engineers.

The first topic they discussed was a handcrafted branding tool on display that had been crafted by a single artisan who had worked in that field for thirty years. She was driven out of the market by a Republic company which was able to replicate the tools at a hundredth of the price. Out of humiliation, the artisan committed suicide by throwing herself into the sea. After smashing the branding tool, Arkadia surmised that the idea of spending a lifetime in a single pursuit was a recipe for stagnation, for obsolescence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Kerra suggested that Arkadia's policies were running her people to their deaths, Arkadia pointed out in response that the Galactic Senate was also dominated by commercial interests. They created occupations but did not guarantee them since the Republic's capitalist economy allowed competitors and new technologies to prosper without any regard for those whose livelihoods were disrupted. Kerra replied that the Republic's citizens chose to face those challenges. Arkadia defended her system by claiming that under her rule, her people at least knew when change was coming. For the Sith Lord, change in the Arkadianate had meaning and served a cause, which happened to be her own. While Kerra regarded Arkadia as misguided, she had to concede that Arkadia was logical.

Acknowledging that Kerra had come into Sith space to fight the Sith and to help some of the people under their sway, she rightfully sensed that Kerra wanted an explanation for the internecine conflicts occurring throughout the galaxy. Arkadia added that she needed Kerra's help but first she had to show something that no one outside Sith space knew: the Bequest. After explaining the intricate family dynamics of the Calimondra family and the complex histories of the two Charge Matricas, Arkadia allowed Kerra to observed the proceedings provided she remain hidden behind the shadows.

She divided up the territories of the former Bactranate to the Sith Lords Daiman, Odion, Lioko, and Malakite\u2014those four warlords who had been situated nearest to the former Bactranate. During the bequest, Daiman inherited Bactra's corporate assets including Industrial Heuristics and its affiliated enterprises. While Daiman was pleased with his acquisition, Odian objected and claimed that he had a rightful stake to the company since it was based in Jutrand, the former Bactranate capital which had fallen under the Odionate. In an attempt to appease Odioan, Vilia allowed him to keep Jutrand but ordered that he allow the company's executive staff enough time to relocate to Daimanate territory.

When Odion dismissed corporations as mere tools of the Republic, Arkadia herself responded to her cousin Odion that the Republic was controlled by corporations. As quid pro quo, Vilia proposed a deal where she would compensate Odion's loss by sending two legions of Trandoshan slave warriors from her own forces to augment Odion's forces. They would arrive in the Odionate within the span of three days just as the Industrial Heuristics staff departed for the Daimanate.

Arkadia assured that they were being well taken care of and that she had kept them apart. Vilia granted Arkadia complete jurisdiction over Byllura and the former Dyarchy territory. Arkadia and her grandmother discussed about the future of the two dysfunctional Sith twins, explaining that it was best that the twins be kept apart for their own safety.

Following the end of the Bequest, Kerra confronted Arkadia about the power dynamics of the Calimondra family, expressing her shock that Matriarch Vilia had the power and influence to make her grandchildren stop fighting. Kerra then asked why the various Sith warlords did not work together for all the time. Arkadia explained that any cooperation between members of her Sith family was brief, often lasting barely ten minutes. She explained that her grandmother held significant leverage due to her own conquests and various marriages to several deceased husbands who died under suspicious circumstances. Since Vilia held a large amount of wealth, military power, and corporate holdings, she was able to keep her descendants in line by doling out presents to keep them in the political game.

As part of the plan, Kerra would serve as her personal courier to transport Quillan to Vilia, and would then assassinate the matriarch of the Calimondra family. While acknowledging Vilia as her grandmother, she attributed the endless fighting within the sector to the former's alleged madness. Arkadia tried to justify her conspiracy to assassinate her grandmother by arguing that Vilia was so preoccupied with power that she staged the Charge Matrica as a means of preventing the emergence of a successor. Arkadia resented the fact that her grandmother had been subtly encouraging her descendants to attack each other. She derided the Bequests as a farce meant only to exacerbate the competition within her family.

Finally, she tried to play on Kerra's personal feelings by claiming that Vilia had authorized the invasion of her homeworld of Aquilaris Minor; sensing that the young Jedi woman was a guerrilla operative for her own cause of protecting the common people and fighting for justice against the Sith warlords. However, Kerra unequivocally turned down Arkadia's offer, stating that she was a Jedi and would never work for a Sith.

She promised that she would only then allow Rusher and his mercenaries to leave Syned, handing him a set of secure coordinates in a datapad. In reality, she intended to kill them by sending them on a one-way journey to the Nakrikal Singularity, a black hole. When Rusher queried about Kerra and offered to take the Jedi offworld, Arkadia replied that she would be imprisoned at the Impound and then executed as a threat to the Sith. Due to the historic animosity between the two Force-wielding orders, the Sith Lord was unwilling to allow an enemy Jedi to create havoc in her domain, just as she had done so earlier in the former Dyarchy.

Unknown to Arkadia, Narsk had always been secretly in the services of Vilia Calimondra, his true master.

These nerve toxins had been harvested from Synedian algae, a flora indigenous to the planet Syned. Upon arriving on Vilia's world, he would slip out of the vessel unseen, shadowing Quillan. Once he located both Quillan and Vilia, he would activate the nerve toxins hidden in the chair; killing both targets and plunging her empire into anarchy. Arkadia hoped to benefit from this chaos by annexing other territories, thus furthering her larger ambitions of galactic dominance.

When the ground crew realized their mistake and attempted to stop the shuttle, the Bothan spy activated the nerve toxin assembly system within the burgundy hoverchair; killing them and covering his escape.

Kerra parried with Arkadia but the novice Jedi Knight was unable to match the lightsaber dueling skills of the Sith Lord. The two Force-wielders also goaded each other with Arkadia deriding Kerra as a Padawan while the Jedi Knight in return labeled the Sith Lord as a petty dictator. Arkadia was angered by this comparison, voicing that the Arkadianate was an enlightened regime. Kerra retorted by asking what \"enlightened Sith\" would want to kill their grandmother.

Kerra criticized Arkadia for her willingness to use her own brother as collateral damage. However, their duel was interrupted by the Diligence releasing its second cargo pod assembly on the remaining tractor beam emitter.

The Brigadier had known that his erstwhile ally was still in Calimondretta and found out that she was at Arkadia's museum due to a tag planted on the latter's lightsaber. Kerra escaped onto Syned's frigid surface where she was rescued by Rusher. After evacuating five hundred defecting Arkadianate citizens who were unhappy with life under Arkadia, the Diligence escaped into hyperspace.

Kerra's successful escape meant that the lone Jedi Knight still posed a threat to Sith interests within the Grumani Sector. Adding insult to injury, Kerra also took Arkadia's prized twin-bladed lightsaber as a personal souvenir. Most importantly, Arkadia's plot to assassinate her grandmother Vilia failed completely.

Vilia portrayed Arkadia as an ambitious younger daughter who feared that her father's legacy would go to younger, and more favored siblings. She also cited Arkadia's expertise in nerve toxins, the weapon that had brought the death of Chagras, as circumstantial evidence.
