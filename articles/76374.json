With Pestage, Doriana conceived a strategy to weaken the campaigns of Palpatine's primary rivals for the chancellorship: Senator Ainlee Team's protection of a Dug associate of Gardulla the Hutt and the Bando Gora would be exposed to Bail Antilles, who would in turn appear to be an overzealous reformer.

In his position within the Supreme Chancellor's Office, Doriana worked on Sidious's behalf to shield the Trade Federation from prosecution for its actions on Naboo. At some point, Sidious and Doriana became aware of a mysterious group of extragalactic beings known as the Far Outsiders, who appeared to be making preparations for a future invasion of the galaxy. Concerned that the Far Outsiders' efforts would accelerate if they were able to intercept the upcoming Outbound Flight mission, Sidious and Doriana arranged for its destruction.

Palpatine and C'baoth were receptive and agreed to follow Doriana's suggestion. Dismissed by Palpatine, Doriana then returned to his apartment, where he made contact with Darth Sidious via holoprojector and informed the Sith Lord of C'baoth's impending departure for Barlok.

Events occurred as planned at the negotiations, with Doriana observing the scene from a hotel room balcony, and Doriana subsequently made contact with Sidious via holoprojector again to report the operation's success.

Doriana traveled by shuttle to the Yavvitiri Spaceport, where he passed through security to reach the restricted zone on the far side of the spaceport where his ship was berthed. Inside his ship, Doriana met with Trade Federation Vicelord Siv Kav before making another report to Darth Sidious, whom Doriana informed of the additional Jedi on Outbound Flight. Sidious initially ordered Doriana to ensure Anakin Skywalker was removed from the ship, but to Doriana's relief, he then decided to deal with Skywalker himself.

Doriana privately worried that Sidious intended to eliminate any survivors of the mission, and he felt that the reduced crew sizes would work in Sidious's favor if this was indeed the case. Outbound Flight was expected to arrive at the location in a little over eleven days, and Doriana convinced Kav to ensure their task force's preparedness for the upcoming attack by running training exercises over that time. Prior to Outbound Flight's arrival, however, the task force was discovered by a group of Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet vessels led by Commander Mitth'raw'nuruodo, who hailed the fleet and demanded that they identify themselves and state their intentions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hauled out of bed, Doriana reached the bridge of the Darkvenge ten minutes after the Chiss established contact.

Doriana, unlike Kav, did not perceive the Chiss fleet as a definite threat, and introduced himself to Thrawn under the alias of \"Commander Stratis\" through an open hailing channel. Refusing to disclose any details regarding their mission, Doriana failed to convince Thrawn that his task force posed no threat to Thrawn or his people.

Chiss fighters then used Conner nets to create a gap in the task force's defensive screen of starfighters, and Doriana demanded that Kav activate the rest of their starfighters. Kav obeyed Doriana's command, only for the Chiss to jam the task force's communication signals, taking all their starfighters offline. All vessels in the task force except the Darkvenge were subsequently destroyed or disabled, and Doriana directed Kav to surrender to the Chiss attackers. Commander Thrawn then boarded the Darkvenge and met Doriana and Kav on the ship's bridge. Thrawn was accompanied by two Chiss guards and a Human named Jorj Car'das, whom he introduced as a prisoner and a suspected spy.

Noting the presence of Car'das, Doriana attempted to portray the Jedi in a negative fashion while avoiding any falsehoods that would be obvious to a being who was familiar with them. After Doriana finished speaking, Thrawn ordered him and Kav to remain on the bridge of the Darkvenge, and informed Doriana that a Chiss team would soon board to examine the ship and its equipment. Doriana agreed to cooperate, overruling Kav's protestations.

Thrawn ordered Doriana to begin unloading the battleship's droid starfighters for transport to a nearby asteroid. Curious as to why Thrawn wanted the starfighters removed from the Darkvenge, Doriana asked Thrawn if he intended to stop Outbound Flight. Thrawn, who suspected Doriana's task force had been allied with Outbound Flight rather than seeking to destroy it, stated that he would only do so if Doriana revealed his true motivations. In response, Doriana led Thrawn into the office where they had conferred before, where he revealed his true identity, his dual allegiances to Chancellor Palpatine and Darth Sidious, and his knowledge of the Far Outsiders.

Doriana complied with Thrawn's orders, though he suspected that Vicelord Kav would be displeased by such concessions. Doriana also advised Thrawn not to attempt to adapt the droidekas' force shields for use by his warriors due to the hazardous magnetic fields and radiation involved with the technology. Later, after the last group of droid starfighters had been deployed to the asteroid, Doriana went to the Supreme Officers' dining room of the Darkvenge to get something to eat.

Though disgusted by Kav's intent to prove himself superior to Thrawn at the potential expense of their mission, Doriana decided that the vicelord's plan would probably result in success. Doriana ultimately agreed to Kav's plan, but pointed out that they would need to be on the bridge of Thrawn's ship when the battle with Outbound Flight began. By this time, Doriana had come to the conclusion that, as a witness to Sidious's plans, Thrawn would have to be eliminated.

In defiance of Thrawn, Kav immediately moved to launch the droid starfighters by activating his secret programming layer. Fearing that Outbound Flight might escape if Kav interfered with Thrawn's plans, Doriana attempted to grab Kav's comm activator.

Kav, who had expected the starfighters to be used against Outbound Flight, argued with Thrawn, who reminded Kav that the starfighters were not the only Neimoidian technology he had seized. This statement startled Doriana, who feared that the droidekas Thrawn had taken from the Darkvenge had been placed behind him and Kav.

Thrawn repeated his previous ultimatum, eventually receiving a response from an injured Jorus C'baoth. Seeing C'baoth still alive, Doriana urged Thrawn to simply destroy Outbound Flight. Thrawn, however, unsuccessfully attempted to reason with C'baoth, who began choking him through the Force. Doriana reflexively grabbed at Thrawn's collar in a futile attempt to free him from C'baoth's hold before being pushed aside by the bridge crew of the Springhawk.

With Outbound Flight destroyed and its Jedi dead, Doriana decided that eliminating Thrawn was the only task that remained before his mission was complete. Doriana thought he might be able to kill Thrawn undetected amidst the confusion of shipboard fighting, and after apologizing for his unauthorized redirection of the starfighters, he requested and obtained permission from Thrawn to join the Chiss forces in their attack on the Vagaari remnants\u2013ostensibly out of a desire to observe Chiss soldiers in action."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Completing the mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Traveling to the Vagaari fleet, Doriana donned a vac suit and joined Thrawn and others in rescuing Jorj Car'das from captivity.

Car'das then inquired about the fate of Outbound Flight, and Thrawn and Doriana informed him of its destruction, with Doriana admitting that he had pressed the button that triggered the final starfighter attack.
