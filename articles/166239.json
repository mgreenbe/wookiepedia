The planet possessed a wide selection of edible fungi, and as such was host to the annual Fungi Fest, attracting thousands of visitors to Yakorki every cycle. Yakorki's own exports were limited, so travelers were required to visit the planet if they wished to experience its delicacies. One such item was a mushroom sauce served with the dish known as Ithorian Garden Loaf on the nearby world Batuu."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, the Separatist Alliance freighter Larkrer, bound for Mokivj, included Yakorki in its datafiles, among several other locations on the route between Batuu and the planet Cermau. When investigating the freighters datafiles, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Chiss Ascendancy Commander Mitth'raw'nuruodo deduced its true location, disregarding Yakorki. Skywalker considered the descriptions of the locations in the datafiles similar to that of a travel brochure. The author and historian Eloc Throno listed Yakorki as a destination that could be visited with a short flight from Batuu in his book Traveler's Guide to Batuu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yakorki was first mentioned in the 2018 novel Thrawn: Alliances, written by Timothy Zahn.
