The strategy consisted of hiding starfighter bases in gas giants, within asteroid fields, on planets with large oceans, or on planets with thick cloud cover within or around the planetary system to be defended. Starfighter groups would operate in tandem from these bases, attacking isolated ships during the orbit phase of a planetary invasion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Naval strategist Michael Unther of the Galactic Empire encountered this strategy during the battle of Gorbah which cost him at least a squadron of fighters and several starships before the enemies fled the system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
