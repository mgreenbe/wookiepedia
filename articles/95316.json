Long before the Cold War, it became a Hutt colony world and its human colonists were enslaved and consequently subjected to years of exploitation and suppression. Following a gang war within the Hutt cartels that left the world in disarray, the humans overthrew their overlords and struck out on their own. Tasu Leech, the nominal leader of Kanjiklub, a gang of renegade slaves from Nar Kanji, grew up on this world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nar Kanji was first mentioned in the 2015 reference book Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, written by Pablo Hidalgo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
