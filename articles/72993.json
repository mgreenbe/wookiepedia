It was a favored weapon of law enforcement agencies throughout the galaxy's Core Worlds, and although it was large and intimidating, the KO-2 was manufactured from lightweight but durable alloys and plastics, which gave its frame a sleek, stream-lined appearance. In the hands of a trained professional, the KO-2 was powerful enough to put down a Wookiee in one or two blasts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While it was a rare sight in the more lawless Outer Rim Territories, the KO-2 gained a reputation among bounty hunters, who often referred to them as \"coma blasters.\" Its low cost of 650 credits, reliability, and non-lethal stopping power made it invaluable for live-capture contracts. Bounty hunters also appreciated that the KO-2 required no additional Imperial permits for personal use, which made it an easy weapon to carry in public."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
