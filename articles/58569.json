While this was safe in theory (the booster was supposed to moderate engine output), in practice there was a very real chance of overload and serious system failure due to the energies involved. In general, the HD 5-D could not be installed on starships with greater than a 100 metric ton cargo capacity, and once installed could not be un-installed and transferred to a different hyperdrive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
