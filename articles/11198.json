The abandoned monastery was taken over by Asajj Ventress and the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars, and they used it to hide Rotta, the infant son of the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, as part of their plan to make the Hutt Clan believe that the Jedi Order had kidnapped the Huttlet. This led to the Battle of Teth between the Separatists and the Grand Army of the Republic, with Jedi General Anakin Skywalker leading Republic forces to take the monastery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
