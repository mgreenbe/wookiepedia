A scientist and an inventor, he was responsible for a number of major advances in the field of droid engineering. Doctor Oggurobb lived sometime before the renewed war between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire, and was a five-time recipient of the Bao-Dur Science Prize. He accompanied the Supreme Mogul Toborro to Makeb during the Hutt Cartel's takeover in 3638 BBY. Years later, he would become the Head Scientist of the Eternal Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Born to the Illip Hutt clan, Juvard took on the profession of a droid engineer, considered an odd career choice for a Hutt. Oggurobb soon made several major advances in droid engineering and was a five-time recipient of the Bao-Dur Science Prize. His achievements were quickly noticed by the Hutt Cartel's new Supreme Mogul, Toborro, and was hired to aid the Cartel during their invasion of the planet Makeb."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Makeb"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Galactic Republic came to the aid of the people of Makeb against the Hutts and the InterStellar Regulators, Makeb's former defense force, Oggurobb pleaded with Toborro to see reason when the Republic forces captured the Ark in order to evacuate the people of Makeb when it became clear the planet was in its death throes. Toborro, paranoid and insane, refused, leaving Oggurobb no choice but to offer his services and knowledge to the Republic in exchange for getting off Makeb. He revealed to the Republic the nature of isotope-5, the rare substance discovered during the Hutts' deep-core mining operations, and revealed that the Ark would not fly without the isotope-5 fuel rods that Oggurobb had crafted for it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Republic forces prepared to take on Toborro himself, Oggurobb revealed that he had constructed a secret entrance into Toborro's Palace, one not even the Hutt leader himself knew about. With Oggurobb's aid, the Republic team was able to enter Toborro's palace, defeat the mad Hutt and his monstrous droid creation, and retrieve the fuel rods for the Ark. Oggurobb was onboard the craft, maintaining its power levels, as it blasted off from Makeb's surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the conflict, Oggurobb became the official liaison between the Cartel and the Galactic Republic, something he found irritating."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Eternal Alliance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Five years later, Oggurobb joined the Alliance to contribute his scientific expertise in combating the Eternal Empire, as well as recruiting individuals specializing in different sciences. Oggurobb petitioned the Alliance Commander for permission to run non-lethal tests on C2-N2 and 2V-R8 with isotope-5 to create droids to combat skytroopers. In the course of his experiments, Oggurobb's team was able to recover the critically damaged and deactivated HK-55. With a few modifications to the chassis, they were able to reactivate the bodyguard droid. Unfortunately, they were unable to repair his memory core and were forced to replace it. This lead to the droid having no memory of any of his adventures prior to his reactivation within Oggurobb's lab."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Oggurobb was instrumental in designing the Eternal Alliance's planetary shield. Its strength was tested after Bey'wan Aygo of the Alliance's Military Operations challenged Oggurobb to a bet. If Aygo's strongest battleship could not break through Odessen's planetary shield, then Aygo would would have to pay Oggurobb a debt. The planetary shield held the assault, thus Oggurobb won the bet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Juvard was a masculine Hutt who became a doctor/scientist, something uncommon for Hutts, a species whose members usually became crime lords.
