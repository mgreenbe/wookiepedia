Unique for allowing a trained marksman to virtually ensure a one-shot attack, the HB-4 fired special projectiles which trailed by a mono-filament trace-wire, allowing it to receive flight adjustment codes from the rifle. Boba Fett owns and has mentioned this weapon in his book, providing insight and tips to help the user with controlling it and using it most efficiently. The marksman had to maintain line-of-sight (and a steady hand) of the target in order for the bullet to make course corrections, and the system had a minimum range of one kilometer, but when used by a trained operator the HB-4 could take down most big game in one well-placed hit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
