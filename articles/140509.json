Autem, a captain in the Imperial Navy, had been slated for purging from the Imperial Military, but had managed to escape before Stormtroopers could apprehend him. Tartuta, a Shistavanen named Severian, and a masked Human named Evan Hessler, were told by the Sith Lord Darth Vader to apprehend Autem, alive or dead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rather than waste time tracking Autem himself, Tartuta followed the Shistavanen bounty hunter, reasoning that they were excellent trackers. His gambit paid off as Severian found the target within a few hours, leading the Dug right to Autem. Before Severian could take the bounty, Tartuta attacked him and lopped off his right hand, sending him tumbling off the walkway he was perched on. The Dug turned his knives on Sagoro, using his acrobatic skills to dodge defensive blaster fire. As he closed on Autem, however, he was shot in the back and killed by Evan Hessler. Sagoro, unaware of how the Dug had died, took one of his knives for extra protection and continued on."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
