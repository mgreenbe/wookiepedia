A Human male, Dorja embraced the tenets of Emperor Palpatine's New Order and took command of the Relentless prior to 4 ABY, during the Galactic Civil War between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. He was known for a cautious command style that saw his ship suffer no casualties, and he held his Star Destroyer back from the main combat lines at 4 ABY's Battle of Endor, an engagement with the Rebels that saw the Emperor killed and the Empire splinter into warlordism. Over the next five years, as Imperial Space was greatly diminished by the Alliance's successor state, the New Republic, Dorja plotted to seize control of the fleet from Captain Gilad Pellaeon. His plans were foiled, however, when the tactically gifted Grand Admiral Thrawn returned from the Unknown Regions in 9 ABY and was given control of the Empire. Dorja and the Relentless were put in command of the navy's secondary force, and Dorja saw his exclusion from the Grand Admiral's primary armada as a personal slight against himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Thrawn's campaign against the New Republic, the Relentless came across several high-profile enemy targets on the planet New Cov, and although they escaped from the Star Destroyer, Dorja captured the ship thief Niles Ferrier and presented him to Thrawn. Ferrier tracked down a number of dreadnaughts for the Grand Admiral that proved to be a turning point in the campaign, but Thrawn was later betrayed and killed by his bodyguard Rukh. His campaign came to an end, and by 19 ABY Dorja was serving the reorganized Imperial Remnant. When Pellaeon decided to sue for peace with the New Republic, his plans were sabotaged by a group of treasonous Imperials who included a con artist named Flim. Posing as a reborn Thrawn, Flim recruited Dorja to capture Pellaeon's courier before he could make any overtures to the New Republic. As Pellaeon waited in seclusion for peace talks that would not actually occur, Flim took to using the Relentless as his flagship while \"Thrawn\" expanded Imperial influence throughout the galaxy. When Dorja intercepted a covert New Republic strike at Imperial-held Yaga Minor, Pellaeon suddenly walked onto the ship's bridge and brought the ruse to an end. Peace accords were signed with the New Republic, and in the following years, Dorja's daughter Vana became a commander in the Imperial Navy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cautious command"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Human male by the name of Dorja was born on the planet Coruscant in or before the year 65 BBY to a wealthy family with a long tradition of military service to the Galactic Republic. His father, grandfather, and four more preceding generations had all been naval officers, with two of them having commanded a ship of the line and at least one having reached the rank of admiral. Dorja followed the family tradition and joined the Navy of the Galactic Empire at some point after the Republic transitioned into the Empire in 19 BBY. Around 2 BBY, Dorja had a daughter, Vana. Embracing the tenets of Galactic Emperor Palpatine's New Order, Dorja became the captain of the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Relentless before the year 4 ABY. He became known for a cautious tendency to not engage an enemy in direct combat, and for no casualties being suffered under his command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, as the Galactic Civil War raged between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance, Emperor Palpatine drew the Rebels into a trap at the forest moon of Endor, where his massive Death Star II battlestation was under construction. Death Squadron, a task force of more than thirty Star Destroyers and support ships\u2014the Relentless among them\u2014was hidden behind the far side of Endor, and when the Alliance Fleet arrived in the system to destroy the incomplete Death Star, the trap was sprung. The Imperial fleet converged on the Rebels, who were contained in-system by interdictor cruisers. Dorja kept the Relentless removed from the Battle of Endor's main combat and thus suffered no casualties, but the Rebels won the day when a strike team blew up the shield generator on\\ the moon's surface that was protecting the Death Star, in turn allowing Rebel fighters to enter the battlestation and completely destroy it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Emperor was dead, but the Imperial fleet continued to fight for nearly four hours. Imperial morale became extremely low, and after the destruction of Death Squadron's flagship, the Executor; the battlecruiser Pride of Tarlandia; and sixteen additional Star Destroyers; Captain Gilad Pellaeon of the Chimaera ordered a retreat to the planet Annaj. Dorja almost refused to follow Pellaeon, an officer junior to himself, but he agreed with Pellaeon's bleak assessment of the situation. After a two-day trip to Annaj, a council of war disintegrated when no clear chain of command could be established in the wake of Palpatine's death. Several officers deserted with their forces and declared themselves independent warlords."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aspirations crushed"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial throne was taken by Grand Vizier Sate Pestage, who chose to fortify strategic systems and fortress worlds, thereby putting the numerically and economically stronger Empire on the defensive. Pellaeon held the fleet together for the next five years, during which time Dorja conspired to wrest control from him. On several occasions, Dorja came close to taking action and seizing command of the Empire, but the rest of the fleet officers respected Pellaeon and believed that he was worth following. Nevertheless, Dorja was finally ready to make his move in 9 ABY, when Imperial Space had been reduced to a quarter of its former size by the Alliance's successor, the New Republic. However, his plans were halted by the return of Grand Admiral Thrawn, a highly gifted tactician, from the Unknown Regions. Thrawn was given control of the Empire by its remaining Moffs and by the Imperial Ruling Council. He was also put in charge of the military forces of two warlord fiefdoms: the Pentastar Alignment and the Ciutric Hegemony. The Grand Admiral left an adequate reserve of ships to defend the Moffs at the Imperial capital of Orinda, but he also took the twelve Star Destroyers remaining from the Battle of Endor. Thrawn formed a personal fleet from six of them and left the other six, including the Relentless, as a secondary force under Dorja's command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dorja saw the exclusion of the Relentless from Thrawn's primary armada as a personal slight against himself. He was also unhappy that a non-Human such as Thrawn was in command of the Empire, but he kept his head low and his opinion private, waiting for the opportunity to seize control. Thrawn spent six months reorganizing the fleet and performing strategic raids along the Imperial\u2013New Republic border before stepping up his campaign. During the campaign, the Relentless was sent to the planet New Cov on a regular tax collection raid, but the Imperials discovered two noteworthy ships docked in the planet's capital city of Ilic: the Lady Luck, a yacht belonging to former New Republic General Lando Calrissian, and the personal X-wing fighter of the New Republic Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. Several dropships containing stormtroopers and army troopers were sent to the surface to search for the high-profile enemies of the Empire, and when Skywalker, Calrissian, and Han Solo\u2014a famous New Republic captain\u2014escaped from the planet, Dorja pursued and dispatched TIE fighters. The sudden arrival of three dreadnaughts from hyperspace turned the tide of the battle, as the newcomers hit the Relentless with an ion cannon barrage before escaping along with the New Republic team."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On New Cov's surface, Dorja's troops arrested the ship thief Niles Ferrier for attempting to steal a load of biomolecules. Soon afterward, Thrawn contacted the Relentless and asked to speak to the prisoner, and Dorja brought the shackled Ferrier to a holocomm unit and called the Grand Admiral back. After making a point to remind Dorja that he had let Solo, Skywalker, and Calrissian escape, Thrawn instructed Ferrier to track down the dreadnaughts that had attacked the Relentless at New Cov. He then told Dorja to provide Ferrier with an unmarked freighter as a means of completing the task and ended the call. The dreadnaughts in fact belonged to the legendary Katana fleet, and when Ferrier uncovered the armada's location, Thrawn acquired 178 of the fabled warships. With his own fleet greatly bolstered, the Grand Admiral changed tactics and began to attack and reclaim territory from the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn took the Chimaera to capture the planet Ukio while other Star Destroyer captains of the fleet, including Dorja, were sent to make feints at various other targets in order to draw away the New Republic Defense Fleet. Dorja spoke to Thrawn and Pellaeon via hologram while en route to his target and was given the command to strike. Not long after the successful operation, when the Chimaera was at the Bilbringi Shipyards, Pellaeon contacted Dorja and requested a 500-man caretaker crew for the following six hours. The request came after the insane Dark Jedi Joruus C'baoth\u2014whom Thrawn had recruited to aid with his campaign\u2014used the Force to take control of the minds of everyone on the Chimaera's bridge in a display of power to the Grand Admiral, and left the men limp and exhausted.

An Imperial Civil War soon broke out, however, and although the feuding factions were united into a Dark Empire by a reborn Palpatine, the Emperor's final death saw the fleet once more splinter into warlordism. In 11 ABY, the last vestiges of the Empire ceased to exist, but in 12 ABY Pellaeon unified various warlord fleets into the Imperial Remnant. In 19 ABY, Dorja was serving the Remnant\u2014led by Admiral Pellaeon, its Supreme Commander\u2014from the bridge of the Relentless. The Star Destroyer fell within the Braxant Sector Fleet, which was under the direct command of Moff Vilim Disra, but it was also one of the primary ships that Pellaeon used to patrol Imperial Space. Dorja's stances toward both Pellaeon and Thrawn had changed radically in the intervening decade\u2014by 19 ABY, he trusted Pellaeon's word and judgment and considered it an honor to have served under Thrawn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Remnant having been pushed back to just eight backwater sectors in the Outer Rim, Pellaeon realized that the war was lost and decided to sue for peace with the New Republic. Although he convinced the Remnant's ruling Council of Moffs to support his plan, the Sinister Triumvirate of Moff Disra, former Emperor's Royal Guard Grodin Tierce, and the con artist Flim\u2014the latter of whom was posing as a reborn Grand Admiral Thrawn\u2014set into motion a plot to thwart Pellaeon's plans and seize control of the Remnant. Disra summoned Dorja and three other Star Destroyer captains to his palace on the Remnant's capital world, Bastion, and in his office, he gave them each a datapad full of instructions. Captain Trazzen of the Obliterator and Captain Argona of the Ironhand felt that removing four Star Destroyers from the sector fleet for any length of time was a poor tactical move, while both Dorja and Captain Nalgol of the Tyrannic questioned Disra's authority to send them to Morishim and Bothawui\u2014planets outside of his sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Disra indicated that he would thus choose other captains to take part in a \"history-making military campaign,\" but Flim, dressed as Thrawn, walked into the office and stated that he had chosen the four present captains for a reason. The four stunned captains quickly recovered themselves and stood at attention, and the man they believed to be Thrawn told them that for the time being, he could not answer any questions about how he had survived. The captains pledged themselves to his leadership and agreed to keep his survival a secret. Dorja asked no questions about the courier that he had been assigned to intercept at Morishim, and he told the Grand Admiral how pleased he was to again serve under his command. Although Disra feared that Dorja would see through the fa\u00e7ade, Major Tierce believed the ruse would only work if they could fool someone who had served directly under Thrawn in the past. After the captains departed, Dorja vouched for Thrawn's military genius to a still-skeptical Nalgol."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the CR90 corvette of Colonel Meizh Vermel, Pellaeon's peace messenger to the New Republic, arrived at Morishim, the Relentless dropped out of hyperspace right behind it and began to fire on its target. Vermel's attempts to transmit an offer of parley to New Republic General Garm Bel Iblis were jammed by Dorja. Lando Calrissian and the New Republic's Rogue Squadron were in-system at the time, however, and managed to dilute the jamming enough to receive a garbled, nonsensical recording of Vermel's message. The corvette was then brought aboard the Relentless via tractor beam, and the Star Destroyer jumped to lightspeed to return to Bastion. Dorja contacted Flim, who reprimanded him for allowing even a fragment of Vermel's recording to reach New Republic ears. He then interrogated the corvette's crew, who had no inkling of what Vermel and Pellaeon were up to. Vermel was eventually taken to a holding cell at the Remnant's Rimcee Station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Triumvirate was ready to reveal \"Thrawn\" to the New Republic, Dorja took Flim and Tierce in the Relentless to an area of deep space and used an interdictor cruiser to intercept the Lady Luck from hyperspace. The Triumvirate had caught wind that Calrissian was giving New Republic Senator Porolo Miatamia a ride from Cilpar to Coruscant, and the two were brought aboard the Relentless to speak with the Grand Admiral. The New Republic was dealing with a major internal crisis following the discovery of a partial copy of the Caamas Document, a datacard which revealed that several Bothans were responsible for the long-ago destruction of Caamas, and Flim told his guests that he was willing to personally sit down with the Bothan clan leaders and discern specifically whom was responsible.

Dorja ferried them to the planet Kroctar, deep in New Republic territory, where the Kroctari Lord Superior Bosmihi contacted the Relentless's bridge and asked \"Thrawn\" for readmission into the Remnant. A Kroctari delegation arrived aboard the Star Destroyer, and under Flim's orders, Dorja personally met them and escorted them to a conference room. The ship's next stop was the planet Ruuria, where Dorja met with the Ruurian ambassador Amisus, who was also interested in switching sides. After the ambassador's shuttle left the Relentless, eight Marauder-class corvettes jumped into the system and attacked. From the secondary command room, Flim instructed Dorja to launch six Preybird-class starfighters to intercept, and Disra quickly realized that the attackers were Diamalan, enemies of the Ruurians. Flim took credit for the discovery and had the Relentless execute a Tron Boral maneuver, followed by the Preybirds doing a full-closure Marg Sabl sweep\u2014the pair of maneuvers had been used to great effect by the real Thrawn in a previous battle with the Diamala, and as such, the corvettes fled without any shots having been fired. Dorja informed the Ruurians that an attack on their world had been averted, and then took the Relentless back to Bastion.

Dorja took them there in the Relentless so that they could provide a demonstration of \"Thrawn's\" tactical genius to the Mistryl Shadow Guards, a group of mercenaries whom they hoped would ally with the Remnant. At the Ubiqtorate station, Dorja contacted Thrawn in the secondary command room and notified him that the Tyrannic was approaching the base. Since the Tyrannic was actually away on another mission, the Triumvirate knew that it was Bel Iblis's Star Destroyer with false transponder codes; Dorja accordingly told the base's General Hestiv to allow the warship to pass the station's outer perimeter before putting all defenses at readiness for battle. On Flim's order, Dorja also placed the Relentless between the station and the incoming Destroyer. The false Tyrannic was caught in a number of the station's tractor beams and began firing on them, and Bel Iblis's task force, hanging back from the station, emerged from hiding and began to attack.

Dorja protested that Nalgol had performed a positive DNA test from one of Thrawn's skin samples, but Pellaeon countered that records could be altered. Tierce tried to appeal to Dorja, claiming that Pellaeon was jealous that Thrawn had spurned him in favor of Dorja, but Pellaeon revealed the final card up his sleeve: Tierce was a clone of the original Grodin Tierce and existed as a failed genetic experiment of Thrawn's. Karrde's associate Shada D'ukal killed the furious Tierce before he could attack Pellaeon, and the Supreme Commander told Dorja to call a medical team to the bridge.

On paper, his prudence was not misplaced; the Relentless suffered no casualties under his command up to and including the Battle of Endor, although he was removed from that engagement's main battle lines.
