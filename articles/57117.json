He screamed a stream of nonsensical words at cops who were alerted to his home after two women rang them claiming he was holding his roommate against her will. Armed Special Weapons And Tactics teams joined the stand-off which eventually ended when a seemingly inebriated Greg Burson surrendered following hours of negotiations. Cops later discovered a collection of guns in his home. One officer says \"He was so drunk we couldn't tell if he was trying to do one of his voices or was just slurring his words.\" Officer Rudy Villarreal has confirmed all three women involved in the incident lived with Burson. None of the women were harmed in this incident.\nHe died on July 22 2008, and Kevin Michael Richardson took over the Boss Nass role.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
