It featured a hexagonal command tower, which contained the ship's bridge. In turn, the bridge featured a sunken pit for crewmen and multiple trapezoidal viewports with controls beneath. On top of the tower sat a communications tower, with two deflector shield generator domes flanking it. The ship was armed with three dual laser cannons, which were located below the bow, and propelled by sublight engines."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 ABY, over a month after the Battle of Yavin, which marked the Rebel Alliance's first major victory against the Galactic Empire, the Razor-class frigate was in use by the Imperial Navy. At this time in the Galactic Civil War, the rebel pilot Luke Skywalker was assigned to recover Imperial communication logs. After traveling to the remote Tertiary Usaita system in his BTL-S3 Y-wing Starfighter, Y 4, Skywalker was ambushed by the Razor-class frigate Kreuge's Revenge, which was commanded by Lieutenant Pyparr and backed by three TIE/ln space superiority starfighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pyparr contacted Skywalker, informing him that the system was restricted and that his fighter should prepare for inspection. However, the rebel chose to fight for the minute it would take for his droid, R2-D2, to calculate a hyperspace route. Skywalker managed to evade the fighters, even destroying one of them, but then his Y-wing was hit, killing his deflector shields. The frigate itself then started firing on the trespassing starfighter, allowing the TIEs to hit Skywalker's starboard engine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just before the rebel vessel would be destroyed, R2-D2 engaged the fighter's hyperdrive, bound for Devaron. On the Kreuge's Revenge's bridge, an Imperial ensign desperately ordered other officers to find the escaped craft. However, Pyparr reminded the ensign that the rebel ship had been badly damaged, accurately predicting that Skywalker would be going to the nearest spaceport.

Considering that the ship would only appear in a few panels, Coleman sought to make it instantly recognizable as an Imperial craft, which is why he gave it a characteristic command tower. The artist admitted on Twitter that the bottom part of the ship looks more like a freighter than a frigate, and that if given the chance to do it again, he would give the vessel a sleeker design with far more weapons emplacements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
