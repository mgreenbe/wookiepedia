The report briefed the colonel on Operation Death-Hunter, a secret Imperial project based in the Outer Rim Territories. Madine had contacted Conegan because one of his Core World spies had filed a report that a large order of Tech 4 PDVs with connections to the Death-Hunter project was being sent to the Jaemus shipyards. Madine wished for Conegan to assemble a team to investigate the shipyards and pinpoint the location of the project."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Madine clarified the report by explaining that the source of the information, the spy known as \"Tigress\", had broken off contact with Alliance Intelligence for a time before re-establishing contact. The troubling thing was that after this incident, the accuracy of the spy's reports dropped by 20%. Due to this, Madine warned Conegan that the Death-Hunter project might just be a ruse by a double agent. The truth of the Imperial project was eventually revealed by Conegan's team."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
