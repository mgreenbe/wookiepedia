They had many pockets for carrying tools and equipment. Shipsuits were fireproof, although wearers could still be harmed and killed by raw heat, and electrically non-conductive. Fitted shipsuits could be used as the internal body sleeve for a enviro-suit, allowing the wearer to change into EVA equipment quickly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Bakura Incident, Rebel Alliance personnel, including Commander Luke Skywalker, Captain Tessa Manchisco, and Princess Leia Organa wore white-, cream-, or gray-colored shipsuits while on the planet Bakura."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
