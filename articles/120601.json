They were the main predators of shiros, capable of breaking through the shell with their large, crushing jaws; sometimes, though, shiros that had formed symbiotic \"shiro-trap\" relationships with tooke-trap plants could easily camouflage themselves from granks and certain other lethal predatory animals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They would also occasionally hunt narglatch cubs, though they would fear predation from adult narglatches."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gungans found the taste of granks very appealing and would fry them. The toenails of granks were used to create Bongo engine parts, while their meat was a delicacy served in high-end restaurants. To hunt, they sensed vibrations through their hair from both the air and ground."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Coruscant, imported saw-toothed granks are sold as zoo animals.
