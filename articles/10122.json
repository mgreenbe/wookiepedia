Sarn Starbreaker, a Cloud of Pan Eyta's Tempest, wanted to make a strike against the Galactic Republic by destroying the Innovator, an Elite-class vessel being built at the shipyards which was to be a showpiece of the upcoming Valo Republic Fair. The Cyclorrian workers, alongside Jedi Knight Indeera Stokes and her Padawan Bell Zettifar, fought back against the attackers. After the Cyclorrians managed to get a signal for help past the Nihil's scrambler droids, a drift of Jedi Vectors led by Jedi Master Porter Engle arrived from Derra to reinforce them. Ultimately, Zettifar was able to destroy Starbreaker's Cloudship despite having been shot in the gut with a harpoon, killing the Cloud amidst the defeat of all his forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
