Along with other orphans, Garr traveled on the Republic starship Candaserri to an orphanage on Bespin. Boba Fett, who came aboard shortly after the Conquest of Raxus Prime, was the same age as Garr and they quickly became friends. They parted on Bespin when Aurra Sing caught up to Fett, and Garr sought help from the Jedi Glynn-Beti and Ulu Ulix despite Fett's hatred of the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Garr was born in 32 BBY on the mining planet Excarga to a mother and father who were ore traders. As a ten-year-old Excargan in 22 BBY, Garr's gender had not yet been determined; until Excargans experienced physical changes around age thirteen, they were genderless. Compared to Boba Fett at the same age, Garr had shorter hair and Garr's skin was darker than Fett's tan-colored skin. Garr had brown eyes that Fett thought had a merry look."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Raised to respect the Jedi, Garr wished to be Force-sensitive and train as one of them. When the Confederacy of Independent Systems invaded to take control of the mines, Garr's parents hid their child while they themselves were made prisoners. After a counterattack by the Republic, Garr's parents could not be found and were presumed dead, though Garr believed they were alive and would return for their child. The orphan was taken to the Republic starship Candaserri which was journeying to an orphanage on Bespin with other younger children."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fellow ten-year-old Boba Fett came aboard the ship at Raxus Prime. He had been saved from the Conquest of Raxus Prime by a group of clone troopers and the Bothan Jedi Glynn-Beti. He had never had a friend before, but Garr quickly became his first and best friend. Despite that, Garr only knew Fett by the alias \"Teff\" which he used to avoid being identified by the Jedi; he hated them after recently witnessing Jedi Master Mace Windu kill his father, Jango Fett. In addition to keeping his name a secret, Fett concealed or lied to Garr about other personal details, such as when Garr would make observations about the clones being creepy. After several days of friendship, Fett asked if Garr was a boy or a girl, and Garr explained the difference in their species. Garr found it frustrating that other children would not simply treat each other as people instead of girls and boys. Fett said that the other kids were stupid and should just treat Garr as a friend like Fett did."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Both children loved to explore the Candaserri despite the prohibition against orphans roaming the ship unattended. Garr did not share Fett's interest in space, but both children were interested in starships and observed them being armed and serviced by droids in the rear docking bay. Fett unthinkingly revealed that his father had taught him how to fly, which was something Garr's mother would have had a fit over. In all of their explorations of the ship, Garr and Fett had been unable to access the bridge. Their curiosity almost resulted in being left floating in space when they went on a spacewalk to look into the bridge from the outside."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving at Bespin, Fett tried to escape from the Jedi at the orphanage. He was followed by Garr, who brought to Fett his flight bag that he had forgotten. While trying to persuade Fett to come back, they were interrupted by the bounty hunter Aurra Sing. Sing grabbed Fett and Garr began kicking her to get her to release him. In response, Sing dangled Garr over a kilometers-long drop, but pulled the child back after Fett called Garr his friend. Despite that, Fett then acted cold and repeated to Garr that he had no room for friends. Garr still would not leave him until Sing's hand went to her blaster. Garr fled and told the Jedi about Fett and Sing. Garr was present on a cloud car with Glynn-Beti and her Padawan, Ulu Ulix, that pursued and fired upon Sing as she flew Fett's stolen ship, the Slave I. Flying between Slave I and the cloud car to prevent Sing from firing upon them almost resulted in Fett losing his life. Though Fett considered involving the Jedi to be a betrayal, he recognized that Garr had just intended to help."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
