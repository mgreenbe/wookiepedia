Sidious' reign brought the galaxy under the rule of the Sith, which lasted for a generation until the Emperor was killed in 4 ABY. Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax seized power in the ensuing crisis, becoming Emperor in all but name while Grand Vizier Mas Amedda was forced to serve as a figurehead for Rax's regime.

Officially, he continued to recognize Amedda as the leader of the Empire, but in reality Rax had the Chagrian imprisoned within the Imperial Palace.

In addition to his role as Sidious' proxy in power, Snoke was made to be the final test in the ascendancy of Kylo Ren. As the grandson of Darth Vader, Ren was the heir to the powerful bloodline of the Skywalker family. The Sith Eternal cultists designed Snoke to groom Ren into a worthy successor to the Sith legacy.
