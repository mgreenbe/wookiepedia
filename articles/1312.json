He and the other troops in the regiment battled Amidala's force for some time, with neither side making any progress in particular.

The Droid Control Ship was later destroyed by Anakin Skywalker, which resulted in the deactivation of all the Federation's forces on Naboo, as the droids were all directly controlled from the ship itself.
