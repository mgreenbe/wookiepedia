The base had access to several vital resources, including food, carbon, nova crystals, and ore. The layout of the base was initially composed of a command center, three prefab shelters, and an animal nursery, and was expanded to include several resource storage and military buildings. One of these buildings was a shipyard on the bank of a nearby river, where several transport ships were built and used to launch an attack on the Trade Federation outpost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The base was one of several constructed by workers of the Wookiee species on the moon Alaris Prime. The initial layout of the base included a central command center with a line of trees on its north-facing sides, an animal nursery near the command center, and three prefab shelters. The base was expanded to include enough prefab shelters to house at least twenty-nine Wookiees, a food processing center, a carbon processing center, a nova processing center, an ore processing center, multiple farms and troop centers, a mech factory, and an aquatic shipyard on the river on the western side of the base. At least one power core supplied energy to the buildings, and at least one sentry post was built in the wide open space to the north of the base. The immediate vicinity of the base featured several important resources; muja fruit bushes and nerf animals, and small nova crystal and ore deposits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The base was built between the years 39 BBY and 36 BBY during a war between Wookiee colonists and the Trade Federation for the right to colonize Alaris Prime. The location was chosen for its proximity to a Trade Federation outpost, which the Wookiee leader Chewbacca planned to destroy. Chewbacca and two Wookiee workers were present at the base for the initial preparations, with Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, an advisor to the Wookiees, asking them to recruit twelve more workers to the base. One worker built a power core to the north of the command center while another constructed prefab shelters to support the arriving workers. The nerfs near the base were also herded into the animal nursery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As more workers arrived and began gathering food from fruit bushes, Jinn recommended the construction of a processing center to store food more efficiently and to support the creation of farms within the base. The next buildings to be added were a troop center, where two Wookiees were trained as bowcaster troopers to protect the base while Chewbacca explored the surrounding area, and a shipyard, from which a utility trawler was built to gather fish from the river. A sentry post was then built north of the base, and Jinn recommended that centers for storing carbon\u2014which could be gathered from trees, nova crystals, and ore\u2014be constructed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to gather additional food, an AquaHarvester was built on the river by the utility trawler. After the base's technology level had been sufficiently improved, Jinn had the Wookiees build a mech factory, which allowed for two HummBike speeders to be assembled. Two Wookiees rode these speeders to explore the open space north of the settlement and found no trace of the Trade Federation outpost, leading Jinn to determine it was on the other side of the river. At the shipyard, a transport ship was built, which the speeder scouts boarded and traveled across the river to explore the other side. When the outpost was located there, Jinn asked the Wookiees to gather an army of twelve Wookiees. This force included Chewbacca, several bowcaster troopers, dragon troopers, and grenade troopers, as well as a Wookiee medical droid built at the command center. The Wookiees built a second troop center to train the fighting Wookiees more efficiently and created enough transport ships to cross the river. Once all were ready, Chewbacca and his forces destroyed the outpost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The base appeared in the 2001 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, as the center of operations for the player in the fifth level of the tutorial campaign, entitled \"Exploration and Transport.\" At the start of the level, the base only has the five buildings and the player has to acquire the resources to create more buildings following Jinn's recommendations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The game's strategy guide, which was published by Prima Games before the release of Galactic Battlegrounds, has several differences concerning the base when compared to the finished game. At the beginning of the level, Jinn recommends creating twelve workers, whereas the guide states that nine will be sufficient. The guide also recommends attacking the Trade Federation with an army of fifteen, while in-game Jinn suggests at least twelve. This article assumes the game's portrayal of events to be correct."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
