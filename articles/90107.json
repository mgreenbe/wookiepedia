During the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire, the latter had just received a giant blow to their forces, and their Imperial Strategist; Arkos Rakton set in motion a new strategy. While attacking several Republic aligned worlds, he called for a diplomatic summit on Outpost 256 with several of the governmental figures. Milarzen was one of these. It was however a deception as Aarkos took them all hostage and threatened their lives if they would not join the cause of the Sith Empire. Two of the figures eventually succumbed and decided to take up on the offer, but at the same time the Major of Havoc Squad bust into the room and shot down all the Imperial troops. While the recent traitors were remorseful of their actions, Milarzen would not stand for such behavior and condemned them both. In the end he had gained a strong opinion of how evil the Empire was, and that any that sets foot on their worlds would be met with death. The Major of Havoc Squad then left and Milarzen was left on the station with his fellow dignitaries."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Prime Minister stood fast in his principles, both political and moral as he demonstrated when he condemned his fellow government figures that had decided to side with the resurgent Sith Empire and used their own people as an excuse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Prime Minister had a pink skin color and green eyes with sand blonde hair.
