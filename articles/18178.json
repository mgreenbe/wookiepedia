It was built to serve as the flagship of Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon. By 44 ABY, the ship was commanded by Admiral Vitor Reige and Head of State Jagged Fel, who succeeded Pellaeon as leader of the Remnant after the Second Galactic Civil War came to an end."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bloodfin was smaller in comparison with other Star Destroyers of the time. Despite its physical deviation from the traditional design of Star Destroyers, the vessel possessed a greater capacity for maneuverability. Although it was meant to perform as a \"pocket destroyer,\" the Bloodfin still retained much of the impressive weaponry that could be found on the more common destroyers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bloodfin entered its first military engagement at the Second Battle of Fondor in 41 ABY. When Gilad Pellaeon refused to comply with the Sith Lord Darth Caedus' orders to ignore the ceasefire and attack Fondor, Tahiri Veila assassinated him with the support of the Moff Council, including Quille and Rosset. Although they ensured that the Remnant remained loyal to Caedus, the Bloodfin was boarded by Mandalorian Protectors, which then resulted in the deaths of most of the ship's crew. After the battle, the Bloodfin was added to Natasi Daala's Maw Irregular Fleet, under the command of Admiral Vitor Reige. After the conclusion of the Second Galactic Civil War, the Bloodfin returned to the service of the Imperial Remnant while still under Reige's command. In 44 ABY, it was part of a large task force that was led by Jagged Fel in a preemptive strike on Daala's insurrectionist fleet. During the Battle over Exodo II, the destruction of the Gilad Pellaeon forced Fel to transfer the status of flagship over to the Bloodfin as the fighting intensified between the Remnant armada and the Maw Irregular Fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
