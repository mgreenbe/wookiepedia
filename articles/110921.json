A group of Pro-Separatists launched a missile strike at this base, and one of the missiles directly hit the front entrance of the base near the mess hall, the resulting explosion flung shrapnel which killed many clone troopers. The Republic forces managed to track the trajectory of the missile and located in the city of Hadde, a supposedly Republic friendly city."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The raid"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Delta Squad and Omega Squad, Clone commando units, were deployed to find the launchers of the missiles, lead by Jedi General Etain Tur-Mukan. Supported by Nek Pups from the 85th Infantry Brigade, they located the missile's origin at a large house within Haurgab. RC-1136 blew down the door with a Merr-Sonn Breaching grenade and Omega Squad, minus RC-1136, charged through the door followed by RC-1262, nicknamed Scorch. The Maujasi inside were quickly defeated, and the three dead and the four captured were brought outside. After a brief interval after the initial assault, a Maujasi took aim and fired at the commandos from a roof top. The commandos returned fire, but not before a round hit RC-3222, although this round was stopped by his Mark III Katarn-class commando armor"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
