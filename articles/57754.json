As he was not a member of the Order during the Clone Wars, Dunrik did not fall victim to the Great Jedi Purge. When the oppression of the Empire spurned rebellion, Dunrik joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic as a medical officer and was stationed at the Alliance's bases on Aargonar 3. During his time with the Alliance, Doctor Dunrik longed to see the Order restored, and would try and intercept any Force-sensitives that he detected. Using his minimal knowledge in the Force, Dunrik sought to unlock the hidden potential within his patients with the thought that one day they could pose a threat to the Galactic Emperor himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
