It occurs in 1032 BBY in the Republic Dark Age during the last century of the New Sith Wars and is largely narrated through the point of view of the Jedi Knight Kerra Holt, a knight errant Jedi who operated in Sith territory. In the Aflame arc, Kerra survives an ill-fated Jedi mission to Chelloa, where she establishes contact with the Chelloan resistance leader Gorlan Palladane, a former Jedi. She takes on two rival Sith Lords Daiman and Odion, while thwarting their schemes towards Chelloa. Kerra discovers her true mission is to save the civilians from Sith rule rather than taking on the Sith themselves. Following a climatic apocalypse, Kerra and Gorlan succeed in evacuating Chelloa's population to the safety of Republic space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aflame was first released on October 13, 2010 and ran through to February 16, 2011.

The Jedi Master Vannar Treece launches Operation Influx, a hit-and-run raid with the intention of disrupting the export of baradium from Chelloa. The Jedi infiltrate Jenith Spaceport in a cargo liner, quickly killing and immobilizing the Daimanate Sith troopers guarding the port facilities.

Vannar had intended to launch a hit and run raid to disrupt the distribution of baradium, a volatile compound used in munitions. In contrast, Gorlan had envisaged an invasion to drive out the Sith. As a compromise, the Jedi agree to evacuate some of the civilians. However, this victory is interrupted by the arrival of another invasion force led by Daiman's rival and estranged older brother, Sith Lord Odion. Odion's forces engage the Jedi while Gorlan evacuates the civilians onto a cargo liner.

Lord Daiman himself arrives, determined to find out how his enemies Odion and the Jedi learnt about the baradium mining project. He accosts Gorlan and then fondles with Kerra, unaware of her being a Jedi. Showing little concern for his people, Daiman leaves them to their devices. Kerra learns that Gorlan is a former Jedi who left the Order because he was more concerned with looking after ordinary people. He also introduces her to his family.

Meanwhile, Kerra infiltrates the mobile station and enters the vast factory sector where several kinetic corruptos are being assembled. She also ambushes and reprograms a labor droid known as GAD-3.

During their duel, Kerra reveals that Daiman is moving his munitions factories to Chelloa. Odion refuses to leave Chelloa because it has too much baradium which upsets the balance of the Force. Before Odion can kill her, Kerra escapes by ordering Gad-Three to deactivate the containment fields, exposing the interior to zero-gee space.
