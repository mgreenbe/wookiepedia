He adopted Fenig Nabon when she still was a child living on the street of Coronet. He was known as a man of great compassion, and had worked with the Mistryl Shadow Guard on several occasions. He was murdered around 1 ABY in a bar on Ord Mantell. After his death, he was remembered fondly by the leaders of the Mistryl for the trade he brought to their world and gave Fenig guards after his death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
