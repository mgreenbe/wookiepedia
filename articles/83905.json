Upon realizing that their laser cannons were completely ineffective against the walkers' armor, Luke ordered Dak to fire the harpoon and tow cable to ensnare the walker's legs; Dak was shot and killed by the AT-AT before he could do so. Luke ordered the other pilots to take a shot. Shortly thereafter the airspeeder shot down by an AT-AT. Luke managed to safely crash land the vehicle in the snow. He salvaged the harpoon and cable and escaped from the wreck just before it was crushed by an AT-AT's footpad."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
