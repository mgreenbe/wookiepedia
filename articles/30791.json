Afterwards, he proceeded to have the Empire initiate a manhunt for all the Jedi involved in the rebellion. This eventually led to conflict within the Aquilaean System, the sole remaining system that was independent from the Empire, where several of the Jedi were hidden. He attempted to personally request that the Aquilae sign the Treaty of Alliance. However, as they remained undecided for a long period of time, he decided to conquer the system by force instead. He then gave his announcement regarding the Empire's campaign against Aquilae to the Imperial dignitaries and military personnel at the Plaza of the Daders in the Imperial City of Alderaan. He also publicly promoted then-governor Crispin Hoedaack to the position of First Lord of the Aquilaean System and Surrounding Territories for the campaign during this speech. Unbeknownst to Dashit, however, Hoedaack, a member of the Supreme Tribunal alongside Darth Vader and Vantos Coll, had secretly plotted to usurp Dashit's authority, with the Aquilae campaign being the deciding factor on how to implement it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dashit was a thin, older Human, with a mustache that hung over his lips, as well as slightly pointed ears.
