When worrying about the consequences of her Imperial-class Star Destroyer Vigilance destroying two New Republic RZ-1 A-wing interceptors in the star system of the planet Akiva, Imperial Admiral Rae Sloane realized that the New Republic might not immediately assume that it had been that Empire that had destroyed the starfighters, as a volatile oort cloud or unexpected debris field could just have easily led to the vessels' demise."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An oort cloud was first mentioned in the Star Wars Legends novel Shield of Lies which was written by Michael P. Kube-McDowell and released in 1996. In the novel, the Oort Cloud is referred to as a single location surrounding the planet Atzerri. Oort clouds were then referred to in canon by the novel Aftermath, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released in 2015. Unlike Shield of Lies, Aftermath appeared to imply that Oort cloud referred to something that could occur in multiple locations as opposed to being the name of a single location. In reality, the Oort Cloud is the name given to a hypothetical cloud of comets which surround our sun."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
