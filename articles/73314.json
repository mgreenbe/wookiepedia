By the time following the Battle of Yavin, cerca 1 ABY, Oladi could usually be found near the bank in Mos Eisley, a city on the Outer Rim Territories planet of Tatooine. While there, she created two paintings, one titled Mon Calamari Eye 1, and another titled Mon Calamari Eye 2, both of which depicted a closeup of a Mon Calamari's eye."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, in Tatooine's Imperial capital of Bestine, curator Lilas Dinhint oversaw the Museum of Tatooine, which served as the planet's only museum. Dinhint sought to enhance the museum's collection by offering visitors something new. To that end, the museum selected a small number of artists who would be approached for an opportunity to have their art featured in Bestine. Kahfr Oladi was one of the artists to be considered, along with Vanvi Hotne, Giaal Itotr, Klepa Laeel, Boulo Siesi, and Kolka Zteht. In order to have her paintings featured in Bestine, however, Oladi required enough votes to win over her fellow artists. Lilas Dinhint held a Bestine Museum art competition every thirty days, allowing for a period of fifteen days in between in which individuals could vote for their favorite artist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the course of her artistry career, Oladi was approached by a number of spacers, many of whom voted for her as their artist of choice. Oladi won the art competitions at various times, allowing her the opportunity to display her paintings in Bestine's museum for a period of thirty days. During the time her paintings were displayed, the corrupt curator Dinhint offered schematics of the artworks in exchange for a \"modest donation\" of 48,000 credits. This allowed the opportunity for architecturally-inclined furniture makers and traders to mass-produce copies of Oladi's paintings so that they could be purchased, collected, or displayed for personal use."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kahfr Oladi had purple skin with green stripes, blue eyebrows, and yellow-colored eyes. A conceited individual, Oladi always referred to herself in the third person. She believed herself to be a great artist, and felt that the honor of having her artwork displayed in Bestine was well deserved, and long overdue. She considered herself to be a busy individual, and did not appreciate being bothered by passersby. She specialized in creating paintings of people, specifically the faces of people, which she believed could be quite abstract when taken out of context."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During her time as an artist in Mos Eisley, Oladi wore a black and yellow Lekku Ys'rak, a type of headpiece with ornate metal attachments. She also wore a black intricate dress, and black sandals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kahfr Oladi was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. She was added to the game on February 11, 2004 as part of Publish 6 The Imperial Crackdown. The update featured a new Bestine Museum event, in which players could vote for a number of NPC artists in order to have one of their paintings put up for display in the museum. Kahfr Oladi was one of these artists, and players who chose to vote for her were required to first converse with her in Mos Eisley. If Oladi got the most votes, one of her paintings, either Mon Calamari Eye 1 or Mon Calamari Eye 2, would be displayed for about a one month period, and players could purchase schematics of the paintings during a two week period for a fee of 48,000 credits. The winning artist depended on the player's input, however as the competitions were held monthly, this article assumes 100% game completion, and that Kahfr Oladi won the right to display both of her paintings on at least several occasions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
