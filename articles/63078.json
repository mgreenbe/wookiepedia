Stationed on the planet Ryloth with his squad, he worked with Senator Orn Free Taa and the former Twi'lek Resistance leader General Cham Syndulla to help maintain peace on the planet. Howzer stood with Syndulla when he implored the former resistance members to trust the Empire's protection. Later, the captain returned Cham's daughter, Hera Syndulla, to the general after she was caught trespassing, choosing not to report the incident."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Hera and two Twi'lek Resistance fighters were caught smuggling weapons, Howzer arrived after their arrest and helped oversee their transportation. However, Cham and some other Twi'lek militants intercepted their HCVw A9 turbo tank to rescue their comrades. They defeated Howzer's forces and held the captain and his colleagues, Vice Admiral Rampart and Senator Taa, captive. Howzer advised against Cham killing Taa before Imperial reinforcements arrived and captured the Twi'leks excluding Hera. Rampart thus ordered the captain to find Hera."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Hera having not been found, Howzer joined Rampart at Cham's prison cell, where the admiral exchanged barbs with the general and his wife. Rampart then ordered the captain to round up the Syndullas' supporters, although Howzer believed the arrests were unnecessary. Howzer soon joined the admiral for an address to the people of Ryloth. Not long after, the pair argued about the necessity of the arrests, as the captain feared an uprising. Howzer soon approached Cham's cell and requested Hera's location in order to protect her, only to be denied by Cham, who did not trust him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rogue elite clone unit known as the \"Bad Batch\" attacked Ryloth's Imperial doonium refinery, and Rampart left Howzer to guard the Capitol building in Ryloth's capital, Lessu. Members of the Bad Batch broke out Cham and his fighters, and Crosshair set a trap outside the Capitol after suspecting their breakout. Howzer stopped Cham's group from falling into the trap and confronted Crosshair's troops instead, openly defying the Imperial occupation of Ryloth and inspiring six other clones to join him.

Holding the rank of Clone Captain, Howzer was deployed to the Outer Rim planet Ryloth, the homeworld of the Twi'lek species, to free the world from a Separatist occupation. The Republic and the native Twi'lek Resistance, led by General Cham Syndulla, eventually joined forces against the Separatists under the agreement that the Republic would withdraw from Ryloth after their common enemy was usurped. The coalition succeeded in overthrowing the Separatists on the world, Howzer taking part in the fighting and befriending Syndulla."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, the Clone Wars came to an end with the fall of the Separatists and the reorganization of the Republic into the Galactic Empire. Howzer then continued to serve as a stormtrooper officer in the new Imperial Army, retaining his rank of captain. He led a squad of clones within a battalion on Ryloth who had fought with him during the Clone Wars. The Empire failed to leave Ryloth as the Republic had promised, and established its own doonium refinery on the world.

The captain spoke with Cham Syndulla while Ryloth's Senator, Orn Free Taa, conversed with Cham's wife Eleni Syndulla. Vice Admiral Rampart, who had been viewing the crowd, questioned the loyalty of Ryloth to Taa, Eleni, and Cham, who each cooperated with the Empire's presence. As Taa went over with Rampart and Eleni to begin his speech, Howzer asked if Cham was okay, to which the general expressed worry about his people not embracing peace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Howzer assured Cham that Ryloth was safe as the Twi'lek fought for, and the pair joined their cohorts for the speech. Taa implored his people to step down from their military posts and allow the Empire's clones to protect them.

Howzer and his troops returned the young Twi'lek to Cham, explaining what the general's daughter had done. After Hera dismissed the incident as \"exploring,\" the captain took Cham aside. Howzer explained that he was in a tough spot and promised not to report the incident, but said it could not happen again.

The unit soon intercepted the Twi'lek militant, who was accompanied by Hera and the Twi'lek Serin, when he returned to Ryloth with purchased weapons. Howzer joined Rampart and Taa aboard a HCVw A9 turbo tank which traveled to Crosshair's position with BARC speeder escorts. Disembarking, the captain flanked the admiral and senator, who inspected Hera and discussed what involvement her father Cham might have. When Rampart implied punishment for Hera, Howzer interjected, adding that she was only a child.

The group sat inside as the transport traveled through Sector 3 of Ryloth's western outskirts, which was when Twi'lek reinforcements led by Cham and Eleni arrived. Cham began assaulting the escorting clones on speeder bikes, and Howzer was informed of the attack through his comlink. Knowing that Cham was behind the attack, Taa ordered Howzer's forces to fight back, and the captain complied after a moment's hesitation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Howzer listened over his comlink as his speeders outside were defeated in their attempts to fend off the Twi'lek militants. The comms were then jammed by the militant Lenk, who had hijacked the juggernaut's cockpit, and the transport came to a halt as the last of the speeder pilots were taken down, leading Howzer to put on his helmet. After the transport's power was cut, Howzer raised his DC-17 hand blaster to defend his colleagues, but Rampart advised him to stand down, and the juggernaut passengers watched as Cham and Eleni broke into their compartment."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Framing of the Syndullas"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Howzer, Taa, Rampart and their remaining clones were held captive by the Twi'leks. Cham and Taa accused each other of treason, the general pointing his blaster at the senator. Howzer told Cham to think about what he was doing before Eleni talked the general out of killing Taa. Rampart then thanked the senator before nodding at a distant Crosshair, who shot Taa in the head. Several Low Altitude Assault Transports then flew in, forcing Hera to flee with Chopper in a landspeeder. The LAATs deployed additional clones alongside Crosshair's elite squad, who arrested the Twi'leks and loaded them onto the transports."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Taa was carried away on a hoverlift, injured but alive, Howzer walked to the side of Rampart, who handed the clone a DC-15A blaster carbine and ordered him to find Hera.

With the efforts to locate Hera being unsuccessful, Howzer returned to Rampart at the Capitol building, where the pair visited Cham and Eleni Syndulla in their prison cell. The admiral and the Syndullas exchanged taunts before the former walked away, leaving Howzer to look somberly at his old Twi'lek friends before departing as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Howzer and Rampart went towards the landing area outside the Capitol, and the admiral ordered the clone captain to arrest the Syndullas' supporters across the planet. The captain insisted that the people he was to arrest were not insurgents, but Rampart said that they supported one, recalling the attack on the juggernaut and the shooting of Taa. Stating that he had been there, Howzer argued that Taa had not been shot by the Twi'leks, but when the admiral asked who the clone thought had fired, Howzer said he did not know. Rampart reminded him of his orders, and Howzer offered to find Hera himself, but Rampart denied his request, saying that another squad was looking for her."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Torn loyalties"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Numerous Twi'leks at Lessu gathered for another public address at the Capitol building, where Rampart, flanked by Howzer, updated the crowd on the supposed assassination attempt on Taa by the Syndullas and their allies. After, the pair traversed the hallways of the building, with Howzer suggesting only some of Cham's allies be arrested. Rampart insisted that all were to be rounded up, and the captain expressed worry that it could incite an uprising. The admiral, though, offered the solution that more would therefore be arrested to quell a rebellion.

Howzer observed their shuttle from one of the building's balconies, and learned of a trap that Crosshair had set in front of one of the exits with his elite squad and members of Howzer's squad. The captain then went down towards the exit and intercepted Cham and his allies, who had been rescued by two Bad Batch commandos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Howzer warned the group of Crosshair's trap and condemned the Empire's actions on Ryloth. After the captain added that all the Capitol's exits were blocked, Eleni decided the group would steal Taa's shuttle from the senator's private tower hangars.

Howzer felt guilty about having to turn against Cham, but tried to make amends with him by pledging to protect Hera Syndulla.
