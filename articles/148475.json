During the Cold War between the First Order and the Resistance, some of the most delicious Trandoshani flatcakes in the galaxy were served on a buffet at the Canto Casino in the city of Canto Bight on the planet Cantonica. The Suerton gambler Wodibin served himself a plate of the flatcakes and sauteed fruit which he brought with him to a table in the casino where the gamblers Kaljach Sonmi and Orisha Okum were playing pazaak. Near to the table, the Suerton collided with the barkeeper Ganzer, causing the plate of food and a tray of drinks Ganzer was carrying to spill onto Okum. The spill revealed an alterable pazaak card that she was using to cheat; however, Sonmi let her play it anyway. The card malfunctioned due to the spill and caused Okum to lose."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trandoshani flatcakes first appeared in the short story \"The Ride\", which was written by John Jackson Miller and published as part of the Canto Bight anthology book on December 5, 2017.
