Argente knew the Separatist Council, particularly Wat Tambor, would be watching him closely. He wanted to buy a droid he could use to spy on Tambor. Nachkt shows Argente what he had to offer. Argente at first expresses interest in the deactivated R2-D2, but Nachkt says he is reserved for another customer. Nachkt then shows Argente a RA-7 protocol droid and offers it to him at a discount. The deal was made. What Argente wasn't aware of was that the RA-7 droid was already programmed by Wat Tambor to spy on Argente himself. The double-agent droid was given to Nachkt to \"sell\" to Argente. After informing Tambor that the deal had been made, Nachkt receives his payment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
