The building was filled with technology of all kinds, including computers, terminals, viewscreens and various droids. It was defended by several IG-106 sentry droids and all slicers were armed with small firearms. Members of this group included Kelson Sharphorn, Skaelor Tay and Byd Chillings, various quality assurance staff members and several slicer students."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Yavin, the Corellian technology-hating Meatlump terrorists had expanded to Lok, establishing a small Meatlump camp near Nym's Stronghold.

The slicer NPCs were not part of any quest but they were indirectly involved in the so-called \"Meatlumps Theme Park\". In the basement of the house, there was a bomb that the player had to defuse as part of the quest \"Muddle the Meatlumps\". While there were several slicer NPC enemies in the house, none of them had to be killed for the mission, though it was likely that some of the NPCs would attack the player. \"Chronicle Relics\" could be looted from them. Such relics could be used by players in the Chronicle Quest system to create their own quests for other players. By using the relics related to the slicer NPCs, the quests would task the player with killing slicer in the house, or just traveling to the house."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
