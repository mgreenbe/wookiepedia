The Kubaz wore a pair of goggles, a brown and gray jacket with a fur-lined hood, brown pants, red gloves and black boots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kubaz ferryman appeared in the first episode of the 2019 Disney+ television series The Mandalorian, which aired on November 12, 2019.
