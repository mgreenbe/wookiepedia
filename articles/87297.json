He also utilized it when he broke his contract with the InterGalactic Banking Clan and attempted to return to Kalee to restart the war. A Separatist ion bomb hidden aboard the vessel exploded, killing most if not all of Grievous's Kaleesh elite, the Izvoshra, and dealing crippling injuries to Grievous's body which would ultimately require that he be rebuilt as a cyborg.
