Having just won an oridium mining operation in a game of sabacc, Bargos calls upon the group of adventurers to travel to where the operation is based on a small planet called Gavos, just Coreward of Hutt Space, to assess how much the mines are worth. Once the adventurers travel there, they discover that the mines do not produce as much oridium as expected because, while the mines contain tons of oridium, the ore is hard to reach and difficult to extract. While there, the adventurers run into an evil that will potentially follow them for some time to come."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
