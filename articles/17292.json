It was damaged by Crimson Dawn, but the Savarians repaired some of the machinery. They kept their operations limited to not attract unwanted attention, but sometimes refined valuable products such as coaxium for smugglers who stole them from Kessel. Savarians lived in the ruins of the factory, using its storage silos for housing. In 10 BBY, the workers helped Beckett's gang deliver their unrefined coaxium to the refinery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
