Beniko mounted a rescue mission and infiltrated the Spire with her astromech droid T7-O1 while Vortena and their bodyguard droid HK-55 waited in the shuttle that served as their escape vehicle. Unfortunately, their presence was detected and Vortena was forced to abandon the original pickup point, evading pursuing vehicles while Beniko and the Outlander were being pursued by the High Justice Vaylin. Attempting to cut off their escape route, Vaylin destabilized a Sun Generator, which threatened to explode taking innocent lives and Vortena demanded that the Outlander take a detour to disable it before the detonation, despite Beniko's protests. His shuttle was eventually shot down, and making a crash-landing on a nearby shuttle pad, Vortena and HK-55 defended their position from Arcann's forces. They managed to clear their position, after which Vortena stole a nearby Zakuulan shuttle and rushed to pick up Beniko and the Outlander.

As soon as he was ready, Vortena rushed outside to assist them, where he was shocked to discover that Beniko had recruited his old adversary Senya Tirall to aid them. Vortena initially refused to let her onboard, but with more reinforcements on their way there was no time to argue and the Force-users helped raise the ancient starship from the swamp. As everyone got onboard and the ship left the atmosphere, the Eternal Fleet appeared to intercept them, and Vortena ordered everyone to their battle stations. The Outlander fired the Gravestone's omnicannon, destroying more than two dozen Eternal Fleet warships in a single shot, giving Vortena the confidence that they could win their fight. The Gravestone escaped into hyperspace, but sustained enough damage to require additional repairs, with both the Hyperdrive and the Omnicannon taken out.

Tora returned safely and joined the rest in working on the ship when Beniko returned with HK-55, having found the droid wandering the streets with his most recent memories missing. Vortena informed her that the droid was accompanying the Outlander to a rendezvous with Tirall's allies and assumed that the turncoat Knight had betrayed them. However, Beniko suspected that the mystery contacts were the most present danger and asked HK-55 for his last location before the memory gap. Beniko, Vortena and his crew rallied to that spot, locating a concealed entrance to a hideout of the Scions of Zakuul, where they found the Outlander and Tirall in a standoff with the Scion leader Heskal. Beniko demanded for Heskal and his Scions to stand down, which they did as Heskal revealed to everyone that Valkorion still lived within the Outlander's mind. Vortena believed that Valkorion's survival meant hope for Zakuul and was excited, while Beniko replied that the Immortal Emperor was a threat to all life in the galaxy and vowed to find a way to extract him from the Outlander's mind.

He insisted that Valkorion was never interested in war and that restoring him to the Eternal Throne should be the group's primary goal, to which Beniko again countered that Valkorion was a world devourer. The argument was interrupted by HK-55, who relayed a message from T7-O1 on Zakuul, informing them that the information broker known as \"Lady of Sorrows\" wished to have a dialogue with the Gravestone s computers. Senya Tirall volunteered to accompany the Outlander back to the Old World of Zakuul in a shuttle, which Vortena again saw as a sign of destiny calling. Before the two left, they discovered a wingmaw infestation inside the ship, which HK-55 volunteed to clean up, and Vortena warned him not to open fire inside the vessel. When T7-O1 reported that the two of them were heading inside Breaktown, Vortena deduced that they were going to confront the Heralds of Zildrog and decided to follow them to Zakuul. Catching up with Tirall and the Outlander, Vortena insisted that the leader of Heralds of Zildrog, the Exalted, detested Knights and wouldn't talk to Senya Tirall, arguing that he should accompany the Outlander instead. The two began arguing, with Tirall insisting that she could simply strongarm the Exalted into compliance, and Vortena claiming that as an average Zakuulan, he could reason with them better. The Outlander made their decision and took one of them to meet with the Exalted, while the other was ambushed and brought to the Lady directly. The Exalted refused to cooperate and was about to order his Heralds to open fire on the Outlander, but was interrupted by a holocall from Lady's Nautolan aide Thea, who told them that the Lady wished to meet both the Exalted and the Outlander at the Razor. The parties converged on the base of operations of the Lady of Sorrows, who was revealed to be an advanced Artificial intelligence calling herself SCORPIO. She killed the Exalted and his Heralds and agreed to accompany the Outlander, departing Zakuul alongside Vortena and Tirall.

The Eternal Fleet emerged from hyperspace and opened fire on the shadowport, while the Gravestone remained grounded by Asylum docking clamps. Vortena went to the Control Spar to free the Gravestone, sending HK-55 ahead of him to clear the route. The Outlander soon joined him and Beniko volunteered to hold a choke point to cover their back. Vortena took control of a shuttle to get himself and the Outlander to the high ground, asking them about Valkorion along the way. After rejoining with HK-55 and killing Captain Lazna Delothrea, Vortena and the droid stayed behind to hold off a full battalion of Zakuul Knights using Vortena's unorthodox military training to their advantage. Meanwhile, the Outlander reached the Control Spar and released the docking clamps, but was confronted by Arcann, who destroyed HK-55 seemingly beyond repair. Despite suffering a great physical toll, the Outlander managed to survive and escape the confrontation with Arcann alive, returning to Gravestone by shuttle just as the vessel was taking off. Vortena took control of the vessel and set it towards the blockade, where despite the omnicannon being offline, he still managed to destroy one Eternal Fleet warship with the Gravestone turbolasers.

Vortena relaxed in a new Alliance cantina along with Beniko and her trusted assistant Theron Shan, where he continued to cling to his distrust against Senya Tirall.

The Commander also assisted Republic Special Forces Division Havoc Squad under Major Aric Jorgan in wire-tapping a Zakuulan listening post in the Eternal Swamp. Combining the information from the new sources allowed SCORPIO to reveal the existence of the GEMINI frequency, by the means of which Arcann controlled the Eternal Fleet. The Alliance planned an attack on the Hyperwave relay station hidden ten kilometers beneath the Spire on Zakuul and connecting the Eternal Throne to the Eternal Fleet, sending the Havoc Squad and Kaliyo Djannis on the mission, one of them providing a diversion for the other's main objective. Unfortunately, the Commander went missing and was unable to join on the mission, so the Alliance had no choice but to proceed regardless. In the process the contact with the infiltration team was lost, prompting the diversion team to attempt a rescue, and Vortena and Tirall found a common ground in their desire to see Kaliyo Djannis removed from Zakuul by any means. At that point, the Spire went into full lockdown with no transmissions coming in or out, making any rescue attempt all but impossible and leaving the Alliance leadership no choice but to wait. Relaxing in the Alliance cantina, Vortena engaged in a game of Holo-Sabacc with Theron Shan, Lana Beniko and Gault Rennow. Aric Jorgan and Kaliyo Djannis eventually managed to escape Zakuul and returned to Odessen with a database on the GEMINI droids. Its analysis let SCORPIO reveal that the GEMINI droids were produced from a template called GEMINI Prime in a weapons factory on Darvannis. After the Commander secured the Prime with the help of Mandalorians, SCORPIO determined that plugging the Prime into any of the warships in the Eternal Fleet would enable her to take over the entire network, and with it the Eternal Fleet.

Inside, the GEMINI captain separated the Alliance members and during a confrontation with the captain SCORPIO was seemingly destroyed. When that happened, the Gravestone received a transmission from the Eternal Fleet ship that permanently disabled the GEMINI Prime and temporarily knocked out the Gravestone power, allowing the GEMINI captain to use the moment when the jammer was offline to send an alert signal to Zakuul. The Alliance rescued several prisoners from Zakuul and ejected them in two escape pods, which Koth picked up just as the GEMINI captain set the vessel to self-destruct.

Vortena disabled the bomb from the bridge console and told Len Parvek to get Tora and the rest of his crew to evacuate in escape pods. SCORPIO then contacted the bridge and revealed that she knew about the quantum bomb and manipulated Vaylin into leaving the bridge so that Vortena could disable it. She also informed the Commander that Lana Beniko was cornered by Vaylin in the Dark Sanctuary, where the bomb was hidden. The Commander and Vortena arrived in time to save Beniko from Vaylin's lightsaber, but their fighting still triggered the bomb. About to strike the Commander, Vaylin suddenly turned and fled, giving Vortena the chance to disarm the bomb while the Commander disabled the power relays to prevent its early detonation. Just as Theron Shan brought Kaliyo Djannis, Aric Jorgan, Torian Cadera and Vette as reinforcements by landing an Alliance shuttle inside the hangar, SCORPIO took over control of the Gravestone, sending it towards an unknown location and locking the hyperdrive.

With ARIES re-charging the weapon that incapacitated them to begin with and promising to use it again on a lethal setting, the only way out was to stop ARIES.
