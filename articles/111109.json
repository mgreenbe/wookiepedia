It was created when the artifact known as the Bridge crystal was held toward Ibleam, Endor's sun. By shining through the prismatic crystal, sunlight would create a bridge that appeared to be made of rainbows. Although formed from refracted and reflected light rays, the rainbow managed to support people walking on it, in a fashion similar to the technologies known as plasma bridges and laser bridges."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
