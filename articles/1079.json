There were ten lights on the inside; three on each non-door wall and one large light on the ceiling. The same type of ceiling light was on the top and bottom of the elevator's exterior. 3224 was the middle elevator of its group of five sharing the same shaft. 3224 was secured to the shaft by two railings that ran along the left and right sides of the elevator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Coruscant, Anakin Skywalker, carrying an unconscious Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Chancellor Palpatine himself attempted to use the elevator to escape the Invisible Hand. However, a barrage of turbolaser fire from the Star Destroyer Guarlara knocked the Invisible Hand out of orbit. This meant that Anakin and Palpatine had to run down the elevator shaft while the ship was vertical, but as the ship leveled out, they were forced to cling to the side of the shaft. The trio was forced to swing into hallway 328 as the activated 3224 was quickly descending towards them. 3224 was later lost when the rear half of the Invisible Hand broke in twain above Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
