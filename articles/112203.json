Per his master's instructions, Razall posed as an informant and attracted a bounty from the rival Gorensla clan that bounty hunters Gorran and Nell sought to fulfill. Captured by the pair and turned over to Giarda after she negotiated terms with the bounty hunters, Giarda had Razall's chains removed from his wrists and allowed him a drink in her throne room. Detailing her plan to gain Gorran and Nell's service while allowing them to transmit false information to the Gorensla, Giarda had Razell's throat slit as he toasted his Hutt master."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
