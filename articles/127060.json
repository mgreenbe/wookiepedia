Legend held that in ancient times, another species genetically altered the Skups to sell them to the Hutts, who dominated the region of space around the Skup homeworld, Sionia. The species exhibited a wide range of genetic features, and at least some Skups were referred to as biomorphs. The Skups were not known for their prowess as bounty hunters, although their thieves were renowned.

Members of the species had two arms, two legs, a torso, and a head, giving them a humanoid frame. The face featured a nose, a mouth with teeth and a tongue inside, and ears on each side of the head. Skups were capable of swallowing. Certain features distinguished them from Humans, however: They had beady, close-set eyes, brittle hair, and skin that matched the color of dianoga cheese. The Skups had at least one sex, male."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Skup species showed a huge array of genetic traits, and at least some members of the species were called biomorphs. For instance, one Skup biomorph had legs that were disproportionately short for his frame, while his arms were long. He had four attenuated fingers per hand. His pointed nose protruded like a beak, and his teeth were small and peg-like. His hair grew long and straight from his scalp like the bristles of a brush."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Skups were slaves to the Hutts, the species that dominated the region of the galaxy where the Skup homeworld was located. The Skups were renowned for their deft thieves, some of whom became masters of the act of pilferage. In contrast, they were not known for their bounty hunters. At least some members of the species dressed to the standards of other humanoid species, wearing such items as hats, shirts, jackets, gloves, trousers, and shoes. Skups were capable of speaking Galactic Basic Standard. At least one Skup had a two-part name: Anky Fremp."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Skups hailed from Sionia, a planet in Hutt Space.

Circa 2 BBY, Fremp befriended the Rodian drifter Greedo, whom the Skup taught the skills of living on the street, such as how to steal items and fence them. The two worked as a team for two years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, Greedo struck a deal with two non-Human bounty hunters, Dyyz Nataz and Spurch \"Warhog\" Goa: In exchange for helping them capture some members of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, who were running guns on Nar Shaddaa's Level 88, Goa would teach Greedo the ins and outs of bounty hunting. Despite Fremp's requests to join the scheme, Greedo intended to use the association to move away from the small time and break association with the Skup. Greedo also intended to purchase his own starship, an Incom Corsair known as the Manka Hunter. At a shop on Nar Shaddaa, Greedo and Fremp were caught attempting to steal Dekk-6 power couplings for the vessel from the Human smuggler Han Solo, prompting Fremp to run away. The Skup was still living on Nar Shaddaa in 10 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A large-nosed humanoid drawn by artist Cam Kennedy appears in the comic book Dark Empire 3 as a background character. The comic was first published by Dark Horse Comics in April 1992. The character went unnamed until Tom Veitch's short story, \"A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale\", was published by Bantam Spectra in 1995 as part of Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina. The story alternates between referring to Fremp's species as \"Siona Skups\" and \"Sionian Skups.\" In a webstrip based on Veitch's story, illustrated by Pablo Hidalgo, the large-nosed character from Dark Empire 3 was linked to the character Anky Fremp from the short story."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Other sources that have provided information on the species include the Star Wars Encyclopedia, written by Stephen J. Sansweet and published in 1998, and The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, published in 2008. These sources have disagreed over the name of the Skups' homeworld; Star Wars Encyclopedia calls it Sionan, while The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia calls it Sionia. In 2009, The Essential Atlas, written by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry, established the planet name as Sionia and provided additional information about the species and its association with the Hutts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That much of the information about the Skup species comes from Fremp's appearance in \"A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale\" and its webcomic adaptation presents continuity issues. While that story purports to tell the background of the Rodian bounty hunter Greedo, a different character history was presented by Star Wars creator George Lucas in a deleted scene from 1999's Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace and in 2010's \"Sphere of Influence,\" an episode of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated television series. \"Sphere of Influence\" makes Greedo's street education in the years leading up to Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope improbable given that Greedo is shown as a luckless bounty hunter many years earlier during the Clone Wars. No source clarified Greedo's association with Anky Fremp\u2014and, thus, the details about Fremp's own life on the moon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
