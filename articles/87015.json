This slugthrower was a design of beauty, as much artwork as functional weapon, it employed golden creshik wood imported from Tralus for its hand-carved furniture and stock. Aimed largely at collectors and enthusiasts, the Mark V rose in popularity for several decades as a retirement gift among Corellians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mark V's long barrel and wooden housing made the weapon more unwieldy than those that used modern alloys and polycarbonates, but these features made for a steady grip and exceptional accuracy no matter the conditions of weather. Per usual with high-caliber, long-barreled slugthrowers, the Mark V's recoil was severe. To compensate, a pneumatic buffer was built into the firing mechanism, one of the few components engineers modernized from the original design."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
