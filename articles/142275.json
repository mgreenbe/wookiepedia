It had a grey hull with two orange stripes across its center and was equipped with two engines. Sometime between 39 BBY and 36 BBY, the Thalmussen, alongside three other identical craft, were used  to transport some of the first Wookiee settlers to the moon Alaris Prime. The ship traveled alongside the other vessels through the Alaris Expanse, an area of space, until they landed on the moon, in a clearing near a large body of water. Most of the Wookiees on the transport ships stayed on board while the Wookiees Chewbacca, Shoran and Attichitcuk scouted ahead. The settlers soon became embroiled in a conflict with the Trade Federation, an intergalactic corporation, on the moon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Thalmussen first appeared in the 2001 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds. The Thalmussen's name is only given in the description of the Wookiee tutorial campaign, and it is also shown in the introduction to the first level of the campaign, named \"Moving and Attacking\". In the level itself four identical transport ships are shown but it is not made clear which one is the Thalmussen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
