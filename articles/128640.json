When the 204th initiated the attack on Cerberon, Keize and his squadron lured New Republic starfighters into a battle above Catadra in an attempt to split up and confuse General Hera Syndulla's forces. The nine training drones were programmed to follow Keize's TIE fighter while the two lieutenants herded them. Keize was the only survivor of the battle, Seedia being injured and rest being lost altogether, however he succeeded in his plan to divert New Republic forces. Keize rejoined the main attack and ordered the 204th's TIEs to destroy Syndulla's remaining forces, which included the destruction of the Lodestar and the attack on the city of Troithe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soran Keize's squadron appeared in the 2020 novel Shadow Fall, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
