The system contained the planet Kolatill, which was the sector's largest producer of repulsorlift vehicles and parts and a major stopping point on the Trition Trade Route. The system was locally governed by the Kolatill Council until 2 BBY, when it came under the authority of the Galactic Empire. Six years later, following Emperor Palpatine's death at the Battle of Endor, the entire Kathol sector was withdrawn from the Empire by its Imperial Moff, Kentor Sarne, who set himself up as a warlord. The Kolatill system subsequently became part of Sarne's fiefdom. In 8 ABY, Kolatill's population rose up and overthrew their appointed governor after learning that the New Republic had ousted Sarne from his capital, Kal'Shebbol. In the days following this act, they endured two attacks on their planet by forces loyal to Moff Sarne, but were assisted by the crew of the New Republic CR90 corvette FarStar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kolatill system was located in the Kathol sector of the Outer Rim Territories. Situated on the Trition Trade Route, it was forty-six hours away from the sector capital of Kal'Shebbol by Class One hyperdrive, or ninety-two hours by Class Two. The system contained the planet Kolatill and at least one other world. The system was connected to the neighboring Torize, Oon Tien, Corjain, Charis, and Aaris systems via hyperlane. Starships traveling from the Kolatill system took one day and four hours to reach Torize, nineteen hours to transit to Oon Tien, five hours to get to Corjain, twenty-one hours to reach Charis, and sixteen hours to get to Aaris III. The system was under local rule until it was subjugated by the Galactic Empire and was controlled by the local Moff, Kentor Sarne\u2014in both his capacity as an Imperial official and independent warlord\u2014until 8 ABY, when the local population overthrew their appointed Imperial governor in favor of the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kolatill system was under the rule of the Kolatill Council until the Galactic Empire took control of the system in 2 BBY.

Under Sarne's direction, Tetrum instituted a despotic regime, enforcing martial law and nationalizing all repulsorlift companies\u2014with the exception of the politically connected Ikas-Adno\u2014to produce combat speeders for the Moff's military forces.

As news reached the Kolatill system of Sarne's defeat, the population of Kolatill rose up, overthrew Governor Tetrum, and declared their loyalty to the New Republic. In response, Sarne dispatched the Ton-Falk-class escort carrier Kathol Protector to the system. When the Imperial vessel entered the system, it launched TIE/sa bombers against Kolatill. The bombers assaulted Kolatill's capital city, Domaz, leaving it in ruins. Around the same time, a starship that was traveling in the system was attacked.

As relief operations progressed, the Kathol Protector returned to the Kolatill system. The FarStar and its starfighter squadron\u2014aided by the newly established Kolatill Defense Force\u2014engaged the escort carrier and its complement of TIE bombers and TIE/LN starfighters.
