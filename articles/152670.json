While this power droid survived the hijacking with a number of other droids, all living personnel on board were killed or captured. When D-Squad arrived on the Renown, they ran into BNI-393 who brought them back to their shuttle where the surviving droids, including this GNK, were hiding. The group later followed a buzz droid through the ship. This droid toppled, whilst the buzz droids attempted to dismantle the unit but failed to do so. After the buzz droids were defeated, they returned to the shuttle and escaped before the Renown exploded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
