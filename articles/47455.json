In 3 ABY, the 61st raided an Imperial heavy freighter. The squad escorted a trio of engineers to obtain the supplies the unit needed for their ship, the CR90 corvette Thunderstrike. During the fight, one of their troopers, Cappandar, took a dozen shots before hitting the floor. Fektrin led the rest of the squad to a rendezvous where the engineers got onto a terminal. When Imperial reinforcements arrived, the squads were ordered to get back to their pods and Fektrin was killed as his squad travelled back. The alien Mzun stepped in to take charge of the squad after."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fektrin's squad appeared in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
