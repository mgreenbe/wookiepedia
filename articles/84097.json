Once home to a highly advanced and cultured civilization, Lupal was rendered inhospitable by the solar flares of its star, and the moon was eventually left uninhabited. Numerous explorers were drawn to Lupal by its former glory, but expeditions to the moon were said to have ended in disaster due to the effects of the dying star's red light. According to legend, one such group of explorers, led by Fionn Tucat, embarked on a mission, believing that they would be safe from the solar flares. However, their prediction was proven incorrect when the red light darkened the explorers' moods, and the Shistavanen Kordus Vrak was driven mad, attacking the rest of the crew in a feral rage. Only three of the crew\u2014Tucat's associate Romina Foss, the Lasat Borzul, and the droid RF-U5, escaped aboard their starship, leaving Vrak behind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
