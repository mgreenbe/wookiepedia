Later, the Clone Wars broke out after the First Battle of Geonosis happened in 22 BBY after Obi-Wan Kenobi had overheard a secret meeting of various heads of major corporations, some of which represented their worlds in the Galactic Senate of the Republic, and formed the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Umakk fought side by side with clones of the Grand Army of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, the last year of the war, it became clear that the Supreme Chancellor and leader of the Republic, Palpatine, was known to be the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and had influenced the war in his favor in recent years to annihilate the Jedi. Even during the fierce battles that took hold in the Outer Rim, Palpatine and Anakin Skywalker, who had fallen for the dark side and became Darth Vader, managed to turn against the Jedi by issuing Order 66 and pull the Galactic Senate to his side in forming the Galactic Empire. Umakk survived the purge and settled on Dantooine where he trained other Jedi, who had survived purge, in defensive combat throughout the years. He waited so long to teach others the ways of the Jedi and destroy those who followed the ways of the dark side."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
