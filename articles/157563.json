By the year 3 BBY,[source?] the trooper was stationed on the planet Lothal with the military rank of corporal, and further served as the deck officer of the Lothal Depot near the city of Jalath in the position Stormtrooper Commander. At some point, Lothal was visited by a delegation from the planet Alderaan, who had been given permission from the Imperial Senate to deliver relief aide to the famished Lothal civilians. The delegation consisted of three Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvettes under the leadership of Princess Leia Organa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The corporal, along with a two-man scanning crew, received the delegation at the depot, unaware that the ships were intended to fall into the hands of the local rebellion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon meeting Organa face-to-face, she requested that she be able to begin delivering her relief aide. The corporal informed her that before she could do that, he and his crew had to inspect the cargo for contraband, and then wait for the arrival of Lieutenant Yogar Lyste, Organa's liaison for the relief mission. The corporal then continued with his scanning operation. During the time of the scan, Organa had Lyste hand over his own transport for her personal use. Along with two disguised rebels, Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger, Organa helped rescue the Imperial prisoner Ryder Azadi and fake her own capture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the rescue, the corporal finished his scan after finding no contraband.

After a brief struggle, Bridger tore off the corporal's helmet, knocked him to the ground, and knocked him out with a forceful punch to the face. Azadi, Jarrus and Bridger escaped in the last two corvettes, while Organa allowed herself to be stunned by Bridger to make herself appear a victim of the rebels.
