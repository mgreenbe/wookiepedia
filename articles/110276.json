Arriving near the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center, the squadron engaged the Malevolence, and were able to damage its ion cannons, and when they were used, they exploded and further damaged the Separatist warship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plo Koon's astromech droid was originally named \"R7-F5\" in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars: The Visual Guide publication, but this was revised to \"R7-D4\" in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars Character Encyclopedia.
