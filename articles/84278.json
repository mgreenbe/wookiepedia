A five kilometer-long channel, the Complex featured an array of increasingly difficult hairpins, turns, and curves. Repulsor buoys were spaced along the course, and swoopchasers raced through a series of water jets that sprayed them as they passed. Below the racers, the water was churned by a series of turbines and water generator to add another level of difficulty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
