Ahsoka Tano suggests they look at how they got there in the first place, and Rafa says that they are in this situation because Ahsoka convinced Trace to dump the spice, and if they had followed her original plan they would be back on Coruscant counting their money. Ahsoka retorts that Rafa's plan was the problem, and Trace agrees. Rafa is very upset that her sister has sided with Ahsoka against her. When they have finished arguing, Ahsoka says she has a plan, but says its better they don't know what it is. Rafa is skeptical, but Ahsoka says they need to trust each other if they're going to get out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pyke guards summon the three prisoners to Marg Krim's throne room. Krim tells them that they have to make a choice: to pay their debt, or watch their friends die slowly. Ahsoka says she wants to make a deal... alone. To the Martez sisters' horror, Ahsoka tells Krim that they hid the spice off-world but she doesn't know where. She suggests the Pykes send them to retrieve the spice, giving them one rotation to return or Ahsoka will tell them the location of their family. Krim asks what she will get out of the deal, and Ahsoka replies just a small percentage of the value of the spice shipment. Krim agrees, and tells the Martezes they have one rotation to return the spice, or he will torture the information out of Ahsoka, and kill her, them and their family.

Trace cannot understand why Ahsoka threatened to give their family up to the Pykes as she knows they have no family.

Trace fights with the Toong, while Rafa takes on the much stronger Trandoshan. As they fight on a loading gantry, the Trandoshan holds Rafa up to throw her to her death, but she grabs onto the frame and disconnects the gantry, sending the manager plummeting to his death below.

She hears Marg Krim's voice, and looks up to see the Pyke leader speaking to a hologram of Maul, assuring him that they can proceed as planned despite the delay. Maul says that although the Pykes are a small piece of the mechanism he has designed, their failure jeopardizes everything. Krim responds that the Republic is cracking down on his operations, and had recently raided a shipment on Coruscant. Maul asks if the Jedi were involved, and Krim says none of his men made it out, which Maul says means that they were. He tells Krim that if there are any more delays, Crimson Dawn would love to take over their operations. Through the hologram, Maul senses Ahsoka's presence.

The sisters are shocked to learn Ahsoka is a Jedi, and demand to know why she kept it from them. As they argue, the detonators explode, shaking the room and stunning the Pykes. Ahsoka, Rafa, and Trace race to the landing platform and board the Silver Angel, but are pursued by three Pyke patrol ships. Ahsoka says she is sorry for not telling them she was a Jedi, and Rafa says she might as well use her powers and skills to shoot down their pursuers. Ahsoka takes control of the gun, shooting down two ships, but several hits from the last one destroys the cannon and rear deflector shields.

Trace can't understand how anyone could and would walk away from being a Jedi, and Ahsoka replies it is complicated.
