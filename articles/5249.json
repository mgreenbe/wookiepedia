In the ensuing conflict, Kallus and one of the Ghost crew members, the Lasat warrior Garazeb Orrelios, were trapped on the frozen moon Bahryn. They found kinship as soldiers as they worked together to survive, and Kallus learned more about the rebels and their camaraderie. It was enough to make him question his beliefs about the Empire and the rebellion, and he covertly became a rebel spy under the codename of Fulcrum, thanks to Zeb.

After Darth Sidious, publicly known as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, declared himself Emperor and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire, Kallus attended the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant, the main campus of the new regime's military training program. At the Academy, Kallus notably studied under Wullf Yularen, who considered him one of his star pupils. He also befriended Jovan, who soon became an informal mentor to the young Coruscanti. Eventually, the two completed their course of study together, with Kallus graduating head of his class. Later on, Kallus joined the Imperial Security Bureau, a secret task force that pursued and destroyed rebellious activity throughout the galaxy.

During a routine patrol a rebel mercenary, a Lasat, working for Saw Gerrera, ambushed the platoon and knocked out Kallus.

These rifles were powerful enough to disable starships and had gruesome results when used against sentient beings. These weapons were ultimately banned by the Imperial Senate as a result of their destructive power. Before the cleansing of Lasan ended, Kallus was given a J-19 bo-rifle by a member of the Lasan High Honor Guard that he had defeated.

Kallus was given permission to dock by Captain Hiram Zataire, with whom he later had dinner aboard the Lawbringer; Kallus' goal with the meal was to determine if he could trust Zataire as a loyal Imperial officer. The two discussed Zataire's son, an outspoken critic of the Empire, after Kallus deduced that the wine the captain served him was from Alderaan\u2014a planet deemed to be rebellious by the Empire\u2014and that it had been given to the captain as a gift by his son. This allowed Kallus to realize that Zataire's son was on Alderaan, giving the ISB a chance to arrest him, and Zataire pleaded with Kallus not to hurt him. The ISB Agent said that the law could allow him to be flexible so long as Captain Zataire fully cooperated with Kallus' operations on Lothal, a request that the captain agreed to.

Jedi survivor Kanan Jarrus, Lasan High Honor Guardsman Garazeb Orrelios, Mandalorian warrior Sabine Wren, and the droid C1-10P boarded the ship, while the Lawbringer dropped out of hyperspace and captured the Gozanti-class cruiser and the Ghost. With the ships captured, Kallus and his stormtroopers also boarded the cruiser and attacked the rebels. Wren and the droid shut down the gravity generator on the ship, taking the Imperials by surprise and giving the rebels an opportunity to escape.

Despite Bridger's insistence, the rebels did ultimately return, though the boy escaped from his holding cell on his own. The Ghost landed in the lower hangar, which the Imperials detected.

He ordered his men to take cover, but the explosion ripped through the hangar and some of his men. Kallus, however, survived, and was thrown forward by the explosion. The damage caused a hull breach, and many stormtroopers were blown out into space. Kallus himself was nearly pulled into space as well, but he held onto the hangar deck long enough for a force field to cover the damage to the hull.

Kallus and a squadron of stormtroopers landed at the mine and advanced on the rebels, forcing them to take cover. With the rebels pinned down, the rebel leader, Jarrus, stepped forward and ignited his lightsaber, revealing himself as a Jedi who had survived the destruction of the Jedi Order.

Kallus believed that Bridger was Jarrus' apprentice and prepared to kill the boy, but the Ghost arrived to rescue Bridger. Jarrus, who stood atop the ship, deflected Kallus' fire back at the ISB Agent. Kallus was struck with blaster fire, knocking him over the railing, which he held onto as the Ghost escaped.

After the rebels stole the weapons, Tua contacted Agent Kallus and informed him of what had transpired on Garel, and Kallus recognized it as the work of the Ghost crew. C-3PO, believing himself to be the prisoner of criminals, attempted to send a distress signal to Governor Pryce, but the signal was rerouted and intercepted by Kallus aboard the Lawbringer.

By the end of their duel, in which Kallus taunted Orrelios about the fall of Lasan, Orrelios was nearly beaten.

Bridger was the one who infiltrated the Academy, posing as a cadet named Dev Morgan. After several weeks in the facility, Bridger made his move to sneak into Kallus' office. Once he arrived, he found Kallus leaving his office. Bridger, who had won a cadet tournament to serve as an aide in the Imperial Complex, arrived\u2014wearing a helmet to disguise himself\u2014with a datapad that he was sent to deliver. The rebel offered to leave it on the ISB Agent's desk, but Kallus took it himself and left the area.

Leonis insisted that the parts were for Kallus, stalling the Agent so as to buy Bridger time to steal the decoder. Bridger used the Force to levitate the decoder, and it floated up to the opening of the ventilation shaft. Kallus noticed Leonis' surprised reaction to the use of the Force and turned around, but Bridger had completed the theft before the Agent could see him.

Leonis reminded behind, however, as he had unfinished business at the Academy; he pretended to try to stop the rebels from escaping so as to avoid suspicion.

Jovan managed to flee, jumping in a stolen TIE starfighter, but Kallus gave him chase over the plains of Lothal aboard another fighter. Although he was a lesser pilot than his old acquaintance, the ISB agent managed to take the rogue lieutenant down, using a maneuver he had learned from him when they still got along. Defeated, Jovan asked Kallus to let him go for old time's sake, but the agent refused to let his personal feelings override his loyalty to the Empire.

Kallus participated in the search for the Rodian, doing so even at the Empire Day parade in Capital City. During the parade, the rebels destroyed an experimental TIE Advanced v1 starfighter. After they fled from the scene, Kallus took charge of the investigation into finding them and requested schematics of the city's ventilation systems, sewers, and anywhere else that the rebels could have been hiding.

When Orrelios reached the medical facility, Kallus was waiting for him with four stormtroopers. The ISB agent started dueling with the Lasat and got the upper hand for a time.

Trayvis sent out a message via a hacked HoloNet News transmission where he said he would meet the rebels in the Lothal City Capitol Building on Lothal. The rebels took the bait and Kallus prepared the trap, though Minister Tua questioned whether it would work.

Coleema encountered and activated a droid named Are Zero Are Zero \"Roro\" who proceeded to activate the transponder which alerted Kallus to her situation.

His conversations with Zeb revealed that he held a somewhat rose-tinted view of the Empire, firmly believing that Zeb would receive a fair trial if he were to turn himself in and cooperate.

He gained a respect for Zeb and apologized for his role in the Imperial pacification of Lasan, claiming he hadn't intended it to be a massacre. In light of the unique bond he formed with his enemy, he was saddened by the cold and indifferent reception he received from his own comrades upon his return.
