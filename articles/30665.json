In 21 BBY, Todo 360 and HELIOS-3E tricked astromech droid R2-D2 into entering the spa, so they could capture protocol droid C-3PO, which would allow them to acquire the Senate Building's plans for the bounty hunter Cad Bane. SN-D1 and BO-N1 worked there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
