The corvette witnessed continued use during the Cold War by the Resistance against the First Order, and subsequently in the pan-galactic war between the forces of the galaxy and the Final Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "General characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvettes, also referred to as Hammerhead-class cruisers, were inspired by a similar starship design by Rendili Hyperworks that dated back centuries prior to the Imperial Era. The Sphyrna-class was a joint operation between two companies,[source?] as it was designed by Corellian Engineering Corporation and manufactured by Rendili StarDrive. A big, bulky transport, the Hammerhead was built for the transportation of goods and individuals safely, comfortably, and without the need for escort ships. It had a cylinder-shaped hull that contained a number of large modular cargo holds, external docking points for cargo containers, and an external cargo lift."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The flight deck, crew berths, and passenger staterooms were located in the angular, vertical bow, which gave the ship its notable physical profile and name. Three large pylon mounted ion sublight engines dominated the ship's aft which gave it a sublight speed of 900 kilometers per hour. The engines were placed on an inverted triangular engine block which also housed the ship's main reactor, the ship's hyperdrive, and the bulk of the engineering section. The Hammerhead was equipped with a primary class 3 hyperdrive along with a secondary class 15. It was equipped with a navigation computer and a medium range sensor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The engine block was connected to the ship's main fuselage, ultimately ending up at the front of the ship at its spacious cockpit. The bridge of the Hammerhead had four crew stations, though it could be operated by two crew members, or in certain situations even a single pilot. Despite this, it could be fully crewed by thirty-five crew members and carry 125 passengers. A circular tactical display console was used for crew briefings, often led by the fleet group commander to coordinate their ships. The console was situated in the middle of the bridge room, behind the command chair. It held enough consumables for six months and cost 1,000,000 credits to manufacture. Hammerheads typically held a cargo capacity of 22,833 metric tons."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Armament and defense"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hammerhead corvettes carried a respectable armament of heavy laser cannons and turbolasers, with the standard variant being armed with two dual forward-mounted heavy laser cannons by the bridge and a dorsal turret-mounted twin light turbolaser battery at the ship's engine block. The ship's internal systems were easy to maintain and upgrade, and were backed by numerous redundant systems. Due to this and their strong deflector shields, Hammerheads were well-suited for space travel, and were capable of surviving accidental collisions with relatively minor damage. Additional external ordnance racks could be outfitted on Hammerhead corvettes which could launch projectiles."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Variants and upgrades"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout its existence, several variants of the Hammerhead existed. One was commonly seen utilized by early rebel cells that featured a large ventral cargo bay and three dual laser cannon, as well as a vertically-elongated bridge section characteristic of the Hammerhead. In its early years, the Rebel Alliance continued to use this model. The Hammerhead Scout Corvette and the Hammerhead Torpedo Corvette were part of this variant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 0 BBY, however, the Alliance had modified its previous Hammerheads, such as the Lightmaker, into a slightly different refit. Several new features were added to the original Hammerhead structure, including two extra modules mounted to the port and starboard of the craft at the docking tubes, which included a ventral and a dorsal turret-mounted twin light turbolaser battery, increasing the total number from one to five. Six escape pods were added in place of the cargo bay, and a fourth sublight ion drive mounted on top of the primary three, giving it enough power to single-handedly move a disabled Imperial I-class Star Destroyer. Additionally, the hull and frame of the ship was fitted with additional modules and compartments. Due to the ship's easily upgradeable systems and tough hulls, smugglers and pirates acquired Hammerheads and highly modified them with more powerful armament and better cargo-handling systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a civilian capacity, Hammerhead corvettes were utilized by shipping companies for the transportation of goods and personnel. Smugglers and pirates utilized Hammerhead corvettes as part of their fleets. In military capacities, the Alliance deployed Hammerheads with great effectiveness against the Imperial Navy. The Alliance used Hammerheads as a heavy attack craft, pitting itself against vessels of the same size or larger while in groups. Pointing itself towards a target, a Hammerhead kept its strongest shields between it and its opponent and remain aligned for a potential ram, and were specially used for ramming. Additional military roles included serving as an escort, a scout ship, and as a spacetug."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early service"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvette predated the CR-series corvettes from the Corellian Engineering Corporation, including the CR70 corvette that was active during the implementation of Order 66 at the end of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Already decades old during the Imperial Era, Hammerhead corvettes were used by private shipping companies, smuggler and pirate fleets, and by other factions, including the Royal House of Alderaan. Shortly after the transformation of the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, at least one derelict Hammerhead corvette was among the wreckage on the planet Bracca alongside other starships including Venator-class Star Destroyers, Providence-class Dreadnoughts, and Acclamator-class assault ships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 3 BBY, after learning of the losses of the early Alliance's Phoenix Cell at the Battle of Garel, Imperial Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan dispatched his adopted daughter, Princess Leia Organa, along with three Hammerhead corvettes\u2014Lightmaker, Amity's Arrow and Duchess Senna\u2014 from the Alderaanian fleet to Lothal to reinforce the rebel group, under the guise of a Senate-sponsored delivery of relief supplies to the people of Lothal.

One such ship was the Lightmaker, which was part of Admiral Raddus' fleet just prior to the Battle of Yavin, under the command of Kado Oquon\u00e9. The vessel was present at the Battle of Scarif. During the battle, Raddus ordered it to ram into the side of the disabled Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Persecutor, causing it to crash into a second Star Destroyer, the Intimidator, and then into the Shield Gate, allowing the Death Star plans to be transmitted from the Imperial base on the planet's surface. After the transmission is received by the fleet, at least one Hammerhead corvette, the Consonance, along with some of the fleet began the jump into hyperspace just seconds before the arrival of the Devastator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the siege on Tureen VII, at least one Hammerhead corvette was present with a large contingent of the Alliance Fleet, while another painted in orange markings was active in a small Alliance naval group along with an EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate, a CR90 corvette, and several T-65B X-wing starfighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one time, a shipping company owner in financial trouble planned to use their Hammerhead corvette to ram the Imperial Central Bank's aurodium vault for the Halla sector.

The starships of the fleet began engaging the Xyston-class Star Destroyers that had the potential to each single handedly destroy an entire planet. When the resurrected Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious used a massive amount of Force lightning, the ships of the citizens' fleet were disabled and began falling towards the planet's surface until Sidious began fighting the Jedi Rey. The ships not destroyed then regained power and control, and continued to fight against the Sith armada. Eventually, Rey finally killed Sidious and the remaining forces of the Sith Eternal were annihilated.
