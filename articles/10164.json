The colony, which included the mother and father of the Republic Military's Sergeant Fideltin Rusk, refused to fight back against anyone who attempted to take advantage of them, and the Sith Empire destroyed the defenseless colony with ease. The death of his family greatly affected Rusk, driving him to become reckless with the lives of the soldiers under his command."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack on Mindor was first mentioned in Fideltin Rusk's entry on The Holonet, a section of the official website for the BioWare massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic, which was released in 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
