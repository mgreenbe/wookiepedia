It was a favorite meal of local crime boss Jabba Desilijic Tiure, who called it beetle stew although his cook, Porcellus, insisted that is was a broth and not a stew. During the Galactic Civil War, Porcellus hired a sapcer in order to kill several rock beetles and bring him their carcasses to cook a beetle broth for Jabba."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
