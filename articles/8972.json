While there, he encountered a spacer, and tasked the individual with completing a number of tasks. The first involved delivering a datadisc containing a compendium of evidence in an ongoing fraud investigation into Corellian shipping interests of Shalera the Lady Hutt to an individual named Huffee Vindaag. Despite being ambushed by a tusk cat on the way to Vindaag in the Naboo countryside, the spacer succeeded in delivering the datadisc."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Von Sarko's next task was to escort an artisan named Folux Pozur back to Moenia.

Von Sarko also requested that an Imperial sergeant named Merox Suld be escorted back to the city.

Although these three quests could be completed, Von Sarko's dialogue was incomplete, thus providing limited context for the quest's storyline. The game files suggest that Von Sarko paid 500 credits as a reward for each of the three questions, in addition to a bracelet as a reward for the second quest. However, it is not known if these rewards were actually implemented. Von Sarko's quests were removed at some point during the game's lifespan, but he remained in the Moenia cantina. If a player were to attempt to converse with him, he would simply dismiss the player by saying, \"I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
