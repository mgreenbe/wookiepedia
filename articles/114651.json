Two variations appear: the Research Combatant Mk-IV, groups of which can be summoned at the three pylons in the northern section of the Western Ice Shelf, and the Research Combatant Mk-II, groups of which can be summoned in the open world player-vs-player zone in the center of the area. The Mk-II, like the Mk-II versions of the three other Gree droids involved in the mission, is reduced in strength to make it possible for smaller groups to complete the mission in an area where they can be attacked by other players."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
