It was one of the few to feature artificial obstacles such as stone pillars, energy fields and repulsor mines. Located only 40 kilometers south of the capital, it drew immense crowds on race days. Tiaran'grast was known as much for the raucous parties and expensive private receptions among Bothawui's elite as for the sling racing. The track was known for vicious cross-currents in the \"South Swing.\" Amateur sling racers were not allowed on the course because it was so challenging."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
