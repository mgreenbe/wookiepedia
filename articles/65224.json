It allowed Lothal to send messages throughout the planet, into orbit, and to other nearby star systems. The Empire destroyed the tower after the crew of the Ghost used it to broadcast a rebellious message across the planet and into other star systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 BBY, the activities of a rebel cell operating on the Outer Rim planet Lothal drew the attention of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, a high-ranking officer in the Galactic Empire. Having heard the stories of the rebel cell, and that their leader, Kanan Jarrus, was a Jedi, Tarkin put a plan in motion that led to Jarrus' capture. He was captured during a rebel mission to hack into the main communications tower to send out a transmission to Lothal, which would allow the rebels to deny the Imperial accusations that they were criminals and instead reveal themselves as rebels fighting against Imperial tyranny. The rebels were able to send out the signal to Lothal, as well as to other worlds, but Jarrus was captured at the tower."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the transmission, sent out by Ezra Bridger, the Empire destroyed the tower. The destruction of the tower hampered communication on Lothal, including amongst Imperial forces. The Imperial Military resorted to using astromech droids to relay messages from the planet to a communications ship in orbit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
