The Jennie Lee was sent to scout N'zoth, the Yevethan homeworld. In orbit, it detected multiple Galactic Empire Star Destroyers, Aramadia-class thrustships, the Executor-class Star Destroyer Pride of Yevetha, and the shipyards of Black Fifteen. Its scanner readings were relayed by the R2-R unit of the Jennie Lee directly back to Coruscant, where they were reviewed by President Leia Organa Solo and multiple high-ranking military commands. It flew a constant trajectory while using braking thruster maneuvers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, before it could complete the last thirty seconds of its recon scan, it was hit by ion cannon fire from the Yevethan corvette Beauty of Yevetha. Eighty-nine seconds later, it was reeled in by tractor beam. Rather than being captured, Lieutenant Taggar wiped all the data from the Recon-X's computers, detonated his R2-R unit, and then self-destructed his fighter. The explosion killed him and destroyed both the Jennie Lee and the Beauty of Yevetha."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
