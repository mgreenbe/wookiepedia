The sabotage of the arrays had been carried out by forces of the House of Thul, an Imperial-backed rival to House Organa, which had also prevented further repair attempts. Organa's men needed the arrays to track the Thul troops' advance, but Liagri told the duke that Republic forces were spread too thin to help and that the next attempt at repairs would only be completed in two weeks' time, which the duke concluded would not be quick enough to save himself or his troops."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Liagri gave Organa the bad news, a Republic-aligned individual approached the sergeant and offered to help repair the arrays.
