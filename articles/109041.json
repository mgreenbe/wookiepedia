The species had six limbs with one set of arms and two sets of legs. The feet on the front set of legs were jointed and could be used to grasp objects. There were several different Qieg races, differentiated by shell color. They communicated by a series of clicks, chirps and mandible motions. Their vocal cords could approximate droid binary and some Qieg were capable of speaking it. To communicate in Basic, Qieg would wear electronic masks that could reproduce the vocal ranges of Humans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Qieg religion was practiced on the species' homeworld. The males and females had equal roles in society, and children were not claimed by any parent but raised communally. Qieg culture was focused on the hive and de-emphasized individuality.
