Bassi Vobah was even more angry when she found out that Calrissian was avoiding punishment, and that she would accompany him, his droid Vuffi Raa, and Imperial narcotics officer Waywa Fybot to arrest the \"richest man in the galaxy\"\u2014and lesai addict\u2014Bohhuah Mutdah."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After several close calls, the group arrived at Mutdah's private estate, and the idealistic young Peacekeeper declared that Mutdah was under arrest.

Vobah hated few things more than trouble occurring during the Flamewind, as that meant paperwork taking up her time. In the list of things she did hate more were professional gamblers such as Lando Calrissian, whom she considered a \"wandering tramp.\" So Bassi was rather mad when Lob Doluff, Administrator Senior of the Oseon system, coerced her into playing sabacc with him, Lando, Del Cycer and the trunk-thing. She had horrible luck at the table."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
