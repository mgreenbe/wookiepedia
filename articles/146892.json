During their service to the Order, To-La ended the War of the Flowering Knives, a conflict which had been ongoing for one thousand years. For their actions, the Jedi was hailed as a hero by the people of the planet Vaklin, who erected a statue of To-La in a public square. In 19 BBY, following the rise of the Galactic Empire and the dissolution of the Jedi Order, To-La's statue was destroyed as part of a scheme meant to wipe out all memory of the Order's existence on Vaklin, to prevent support of a Jedi lead insurgency taking place there. The Imperial Security Bureau Major Oniye Namada mentioned To-La in report she compiled on the insurgency, titled I-1807-VAK."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To-La was first mentioned in Purge \u2013 The Tyrant's Fist 2, a comic book written by Alexander Freed and released in 2013 and part of the Star Wars: Purge series.
