It was a source of extreme pride for the Gungan people as only the finest musikagungs were members. The band was a significant part of Gungan culture, as it composed symponiks to record and retell Gungan history. The Great Municipal Band was directed by a leader, and in 32 BBY that leader was Augara Jowil, who succeeded Beezar Pert, composer of the \"Symponika Crunchen-Grand.\" Under Jowil's direction, the Municipal Band performed the \"Symponik Nabooalla\" following the Invasion of Naboo by the galactic megacorporation known as the Trade Federation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Great Municipal Band was a musical band composed of the finest musikagungs, the musicians of the swamp-dwelling Gungan species, on the planet Naboo. Sometime prior to the year 32 BBY, the band was under the conduction of Beezar Pert, composer of the famous \"Symponika Crunchen-Grand,\" a symponik detailing the events of the formation of the Gungan Grand Army. Pert took the young musikagung Augara \"Augie\" Jowil as his apprentice and instructed her until he retired. Despite Jowil's relative youth and inexperience, the members of the band unanimously elected her to be Pert's successor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During 32 BBY's Invasion of Naboo, Jowil and the band evacuated the city of Otoh Gunga, along with the rest of the city's population, and fled from the invading Trade Federation to the Gungan Sacred Place. It was there Jowil got her chance to chronicle the historical event she never thought would come: the meeting of the Gungan Boss Rugor Nass and the Human Naboo led by Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala in order to regain freedom for the entire planet. Jowil composed the entire \"Symponik Nabooalla,\" an epic for all of Naboo's denizens, in her head within days. The piece's first movement debuted during the Municipal Band's parade performance during the victory celebration in the capital city of Theed after the Naboo and Gungans successfully defeated the Trade Federation. The Band's performance was witnessed by representatives of the Galactic Republic such as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and the Jedi Council. That ensured Jowil's place in history as one of the group's most important leaders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Organization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Great Municipal Band was composed of the finest musikagungs.
