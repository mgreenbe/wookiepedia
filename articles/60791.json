His father, Kal Mpon, believed fighting each other was futile, and they should focus on the hunt for scarce water on the planet. In the wilderness his father tested out an unknown plant and was killed by its odorless paralytic gas. To support his mother, Nkai began delivering packages of salt -- an illegal narcotic on Cona -- for a settlement of offworlder prospectors. He eventually became addicted to salt, and was convinced by deceitful prospectors to travel to their salt water-covered homeworld. During a stop on Tatooine, news of his mother's death drove him to the Cantina, where his ship's crew abandoned him. Nkai remained on Tatooine and became a moisture farmer.
