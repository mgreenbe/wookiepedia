The Gank wielded a blaster and pointed it between Arranda's eyes. At the same time, Smada told Arranda's caretaker, the Shi'ido anthropologist Mammon Hoole, that he must work for the Hutt as an assassin; the assault on Arranda was intended to emphasize Smada's seriousness regarding the matter. The Gank fled along with the Hutt master when the Human smuggler Han Solo intervened in the confrontation, backed up by the Human moisture farmer Luke Skywalker and the Wookiee pilot Chewbacca."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
