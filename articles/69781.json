Located in the Jedha system of the galaxy's Mid Rim, the moon had a cold climate due to its lasting winter.

Frosted by a permanent winter, Jedha had a cold climate and an atmosphere breathable to oxygen-breathers, such as humans. Within the moon's sandstone crust were rich deposits of kyber crystals\u2014Force-attuned crystals that were fundamental in lightsaber construction. Many settlements on the moon, such as the ancient Holy City, sat atop the world's natural mesas. Though Jedha's sands remained parched for much of its year, there were instances of powerful torrents of rainfall, a cause for celebration among the people of Jedha."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedha's ancient structures were some of the earliest examples of architecture known to exist in the galaxy. The weathered sandstone structures and statues dotted Jedha's landscape, a testament to its ancient past."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Being an antiquated destination, Jedha was surrounded by uncharted systems, making it a reliable replenishment port for travelers.

Some scholars made a case for Jedha as the location of the Jedi Order's first Temple, alongside other candidate worlds, such as Ahch-To, Coruscant, Ossus, and Tython. As well as the Jedi, the Disciples and Guardians of the Whills represented a dominant faith on Jedha. They, along with the Church of the Force, were centered at the Temple of the Kyber, a great temple located in the city of NiJedha. This spiritual history led to Jedha becoming an important location for pilgrims of various faiths, including those of the Brotherhood of the Beatific Countenance, the Clan of the Toribota, and the Central Isopter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As more of the galaxy was mapped, more direct hyperspace routes were discovered. These new passages made the old, winding routes, such as those connecting with Jedha, obsolete.

Unknown to all but the most high-ranking officials in the Empire, the crystals were being used as components in the construction of an Imperial superlaser capable of destroying entire planets. The Imperial occupation included specialized units, due to its urban landscape and importance to the Death Star project. These units were charged with restricting access to the Temple of the Kyber and protecting kyber crystal mining operations. The streets of Jedha were patrolled by stormtroopers, scout troopers with speeder bikes, combat assault tanks, and AT-STs. The scout and tank troopers wore lighter armor for better mobility in the urban environment and were specially trained for reconnaissance and urban warfare. However, the occupation did not go unopposed. Under the coordination of Onderonian rebel extremist Saw Gerrera and his Partisans, an insurgency was formed, targeting the Empire's kyber shipments. The increasing violence prompted the Empire to place the Dauntless, an Imperial I-class Star Destroyer, directly over the Holy City."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, an Imperial defector by the name of Bodhi Rook was captured by Gerrera's rebels, claiming he had a message from Galen Erso, an Imperial scientist whose research helped create the Empire's superweapon.

Minutes later, they were captured by Gerrera's insurgents and spent the night trekking through the desert outside the city before reaching a weathered monastery known as the Catacombs of Cadera. At the same time, all Imperial forces on Jedha were ordered to evacuate immediately. Unknown to them, the Empire's colossal, superlaser-equipped battle station, the Death Star, was moving into position above the moon. Though the Death Star project's director, Orson Krennic, intended to destroy the entire moon, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin ordered only the Holy City be destroyed using a single-reactor ignition blast from the station's superlaser. After a short exchange, Gerrera revealed to Jyn the holographic message of her father. As she watched, the Death Star moved into position over NiJedha, eclipsing the sun before firing its emerald beam and completely obliterating the city. The immense explosion caused the surrounding land to crumble, sending swaths of rubble into the air and allowing some to reach escape velocity. Before the blast could reach the Catacombs of Cadera, however, Andor, Jyn and Rook, along with two Guardians of the Whills named Chirrut \u00cemwe and Baze Malbus, managed to escape into hyperspace aboard a U-wing starfighter and relay the event to Alliance High Command."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Destruction of Jedha City"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To prevent word getting out about the nature of the Holy City's destruction, the Imperial Senate on Coruscant was informed that the explosion was due to a mining disaster.

The Empire under Commander Befa continued to harvest the remaining kyber crystals from the surface. Befa, however, was unable to deliver a single shipment of kyber crystals and the Empire sent Queen Trios of Shu-Torun and Commander Kanchar to retrieve the remaining kyber crystals.

Most of Jedha's 11.3 million inhabitants were centered around elevated settlements on rocky mesas, whose streets were filled with priests, scholars and holy men and women. The natives of Jedha were as a whole a spiritual people and were gracious and tolerant of outsiders who practice peace and respect. After Imperial occupation, prohibitions on trade and commerce lead to the cultivation of a black market, with some cynical entrepreneurs making a profit off the disadvantaged populace. Local merchants would offer Imperial officers goods\u2014both legal and illicit\u2014to ensure they were happy and that their attention was diverted from possible infractions. Transportation of goods to and from Jedha became a lucrative business, with only specially licensed spacers allowed access to the moon's spaceports. The subsequent insurgency made life dangerous for the civilians of Jedha, especially with the rebels preferring guerrilla tactics, meaning anywhere could become a warzone instantly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedha was the homeworld of the Imperial-turned-Rebel pilot Bodhi Rook, the warrior monk Chirrut \u00cemwe and his freelance assassin friend Baze Malbus.

The city also has Middle  Eastern influences with its narrow market alleyways, desert sands, and Ottoman-inspired architecture. The moon was also filmed in the Middle East, specifically Jordan's Wadi Rum desert. First footage of Jedha was released with the teaser trailer for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, on April 7, 2016. The moon was fully revealed during the Rogue One panel at Star Wars Celebration Europe 2016, on July 15, 2016.
