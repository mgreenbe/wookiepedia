These stinging insects lived inside of vines and would swarm if disturbed. The viper wasp's venom, in significant quantities, could cause cramps, diarrhea, yellowing of the eyes, numbness of the extremities, pustules on the mucous membranes, and hormone disruption. Smoke could be used to drive the insects away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Biggs Darklighter accidentally cut the vines of a viper wasp hive while searching the forest for a cure for Derek Klivian.
