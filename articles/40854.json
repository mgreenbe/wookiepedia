As the Amorphiian finished his introduction, the forefinger of his right hand went limp due to a power loss, and he nudged it back to life with his nose before continuing. Flipping switches on the mini-transmitter and preparing to begin, Dromboid lost power to his left leg, so, twitching, he patted it back into motion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Setting the mini-transmitter on a table, he began searching for the tools necessary for the assembly. As he reached for the small, clear plastic bag containing the instruments, the Amorphiian's elbows locked at a closed angle, so, embarrassed, he began to flap his bent arms to unlock the joints. Arms again working, Dromboid picked up the sealed bag, which he suggested not to rip, as it would be useful for storage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Removing a screwdriver-like tool, the Amorphiian warned the viewers about its sharp edges, demonstrating the danger by pretending to prick his finger, saying \"ouch,\" and smiling.

Operational once again, the Amorphiian reminded the viewers that all ten thousand of the circuit-breaker module's terminals must be paired with wires of corresponding colors. As he began to demonstrate the build, Dromboid's eyes temporarily crossed and drifted upwards, and the instructor then recommended that the assembly be done slowly and methodically."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Running out of time left in the video, Dromboid began the complicated assembly of the impulse-to-voice translator, a component he described to be the heart of the mini-transmitter, as it was responsible for converting the electronic energy into a recognizable language. Noting that viewers should stay alert for the procedure, the Amorphiian expressed the importance of endurance and concentration to utilize the full capacity of their brains.

Whenever power failures occurred, he would make no mention of them, simply correcting the problem and resuming his speech or action.

Over the jacket was a large-buckled belt, which was matched with a pair of black pants."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Dromboid was created for The Star Wars Holiday Special, a television film that aired on CBS in the United States on November 17, 1978, for the first and only time. In the Holiday Special, Dromboid appears in a four-minute-long comedy sketch preceding a commercial break. In the scene, Dromboid is portrayed by comedic guest star Harvey Korman of The Carol Burnett Show, who also played the character Gormaanda in a prior sketch and the character Krelman in the following one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The purposed humor of Dromboid's scene, referred to in the script as the \"Harvey Korman 'Dromboid' segment,\" is that his constant malfunctions prevent him from giving timely instructions to Lumpawarrump, which angers the young, eager Wookiee. To accomplish the filming of these malfunctions, clips of Korman were edited to create stutters, spasms, and vocal changes. The Holiday Special's fourth draft compares Dromboid's demeanor to those of Milton Cross and Bergen Evans, a radio announcer and educational television host, respectively. However, in the time since the film aired, Dromboid's quirky behavior has been likened to that of Max Headroom, the erratic titular character of The Max Headroom Show, a comedy talk show that aired nearly a decade later."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Dromboid is not identified by name in the film, the name is used throughout the Holiday Special's fourth-draft script. The name Dromboid was later confirmed as canon within the Star Wars Legends continuity by Alex Newborn's 2008 article, \"I Have a Bad Feeling About This!,\" published in the 106th issue of Star Wars Insider magazine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
