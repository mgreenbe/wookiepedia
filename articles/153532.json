The Initiate, who had earned distinction as a promising student, proved their comprehension of the Jedi Code, self-discipline via meditation and lightsaber combat, and their strong attunement to the flow of the Force, passing the Initiate Trials. The apprentice gained the attention of a Master and was selected as a Padawan student."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At about this time the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) had united against the Republic, and the Jedi had no choice but to fight in the conflict, and like all apprentices the Padawan was given the rank of Jedi Commander. In the war room of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, the Padawan convened with famed Jedi Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Mace Windu, Plo Koon and Ahsoka Tano, along with clone marshal commander CC-2224 and astromech droid R2-D2.

This individual participated in a lightsaber dueling class, taught by Obi-Wan Kenobi, and dueled opponents such as the Padawan Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee while they were still in their Jedi training. The Jedi also was taught how to use a blaster, develop and plan battle strategies, hack and slice into computers, and fly a Jedi Starfighter via simulation programs. The Jedi had advanced skills for their age, and therefore was accepted into a lightsaber throwing class taught by Luminara Unduli."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "First Battle of Geonosis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker, along with Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, were being held hostage on the planet of Geonosis, requiring a Jedi support group to rescue them. Approximately 212 Jedi voluntaries composed the rescue crew, including this Jedi. The Jedi, not having enough hands-on experience with battles, went with Master Yoda and Adi Gallia to retrieve the clone army from Kamino. Once arriving on Kamino, Adi Gallia went ahead in a smaller cruiser, while Yoda and the Jedi prepared the larger-scale army for action. Once the army and the fleet was assembled, they traveled to Geonosis. Yoda was needed on the surface, leaving the young Jedi to command the fleet of warships against the Confederate fleet; they were severely outgunned. The fleet attacked until enough enemy ships had been destroyed for the fleet, and they then proceeded to land their transports on the surface and deploy troops to support the Jedi survivors in battle. Since there was a need for more aerial units, the Jedi was assigned to pilot a Republic Gunship in order to assist with the aerial foothold."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Battle of Christophsis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Confederacy of Independent Systems, a few months into the war, initiated several attacks on systems, focusing on key hyperspace routes in the Outer Rim. One of the systems they focused their assault on was the system containing the crystalline planet Christophsis. As attacks raged on, the Republic stepped in to defend the planet, deploying the Jedi along with them. As the planet was besieged, plans were made to establish a Republic base of operations. With the base being constructed, the Jedi and Clone Commander Cody were assigned to set up defensive measures for the base and surrounding area. The Jedi had engineers develop a line of defense turrets, using this as an opportunity to deploy several new turret designs. As the Republic base was constructed, General Whorm Loathsom led an attack on the installation in order to stymie the Republic's attempt to gain a foothold. This required the Jedi and Cody to use their defensive parameters that had been set up. The Jedi and his turreteers defended the uncompleted base from several heavy droids, such as the Homing Spider Droid. Destroying the strike force that attempted to attack the base, the Republic continued constant construction of their stronghold. After establishing a base of operations, the Republic continued the campaign along the planet, collecting many refugees, and sending them to their secret refugee camp."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, General Loathsom discovered the camp, forcing the Republic to take defensive measures again, this time deploying an ion cannon to be used against droidekas. After the Republic began defending the refugee camp, the Separatist army fell back upon sustaining some losses. As the conflict raged on, the Separatist foothold began to spread thin throughout the battlefield, as they were attempting to hit multiple objectives with limited forces. This gave the Republic an opportunity to set up an ambush that would greatly cut back the spread of the droid army. The Republic analyzed the strategy of the Confederacy and planned to ambush them before they could reach their rendezvous point. Commander Cody and the Jedi were assigned to set up turrets at the path in order to block the rendezvous point of the droid army. The ambush involved offensive attacks by octuptarra magna tri-droids, and prompted the Attack Cruiser Dauntless to give air support. This ambush was eventually successful and put a large dent in the droid army on Christophsis. After the ambush, the Jedi was no longer needed for the campaign on Christophsis and therefore was withdrawn for another battlefront."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Battle of Ryloth"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Being a Padawan at the beginning of the Clone Wars, the Jedi was bestowed the rank of commander, and was deployed to the planet Ryloth to help assist in the ongoing battle. After the death of the Jedi General leading the defense that was aimed to stall the droid forces until the Republic arrived, Wat Tambor sent a squadron of Hyena Bombers to bomb a nearby village; Skywalker led an offensive Y-wing bomber squadron (the Jedi participated) to counterattack. Following this counterattack, Tambor ordered additional attacks on the village, resulting in the Jedi's extensive use of lightsaber throwing and combat skills. After a Republic Outpost was established in the village, with the assistance of High Jedi General Master Mace Windu, Anakin Skywalker, and Master Kenobi, clone trooper captain Breaker initiated the Jedi to instruct a squadron of engineers, and turreteers to set up defense parameters for the village. As part of the attack on the village, a droid drop ship was deployed, near the village to direct an assault. With the assistance of Cham Syndulla, Captain Rex, several ARC Troopers, the Jedi pushed an assault, to engage in combat with the IG-100 MagnaGuards patrolling near the ray shield that protected the droid drop ship. After defeating the MagnaGuards, the Jedi was ordered to fall back to the Republic Outpost, and was reassigned elsewhere in the galaxy. Breaker, with his squadron of LAAT Gunships, escorted the Jedi, in their red Delta-7 starfighter, back to a Venator-class Star Destroyer orbiting the planet. As the jump to hyperspace was initiated, a reinforcing Separatist fleet laid down fire upon the ship; the Jedi was forced to strategically fight in the circumstances of them being outgunned. This resulted in a victory by the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Ambush over Ord Mantell"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime during the Clone Wars, the Republic established an artillery base on the planet of Ord Mantell, which throughout the war hosted several conflicts. A Republic fleet, led by Admiral Yularen, was dispatched to the planet to receive a detachment of weapons which had been prepared. However, a CIS fleet had planned an ambush on the Republic fleet. Once arriving, a fleet of Munificent-class destroyers jumped out of hyperspace and laid fire onto the Republic fleet. Not having any turrets or regular fighters prepared, the Republic fleet launched all of their alert fighters, in one of which the Jedi had been assigned, in order to hold off and perhaps slightly damage the CIS fleet. This measure was merely aimed to stall until the Republic fleet could jump to hyperspace. The Jedi attacked enemy turrets, as well as Vulture Droids, and Hyena Bombers, which attempted to bombard several Republic cruisers. Hastily the CIS launched two droid drop ships, which were dispatched to land on the Republic command ship in order to disable the fleet. Brief clone defensive attacks were launched until the alert fighters could fly overboard and weaken the offensive. Once the navicomputers on each ship had plotted a course to hyperspace, the alert fighters were recalled to their corresponding ships, so the jump could be initiated."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Bombardment of Mustafar"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Planned by Skywalker, a squadron of Y-wing bombers, and several V-19 Torrent fighters, attempted to bombard a Techno Union mining facility on Mustafar. The Jedi served as a fighter escort alongside the V-19 Torrent squadron. Upon arriving at naked-eye aerial level, the CIS quickly overwhelmed the squadron of Y-wings. Skywalker sent the Jedi ahead to hold off the heavy defensive attacks while the V-19 Torrents followed closely behind. The Jedi dealt with heat-resistant Vulture Droids, Hyena Bombers, Tri-Fighters, and several ground defense measures such as octuptarra droids, missile launchers, and the classic B1s and B2s. Once the Y-wings reached the facility they fired all of their torpedoes onto the base, leaving it in flames, damaging several resources, and severely weakening the enemy installation."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Battle of Excarga"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Neither the Jedi nor Anakin Skywalker had participated in any of the ground conflicts taking place on Excarga, but they both volunteered as fleet aerial units. After the Republic had a success on Excarga, the CIS fleet attempted to evacuate. Having deployed numerous droid drop ships on the planet, the Jedi was assigned to target them in order to prevent future use of the droids being carried. The Jedi took out several drop ships, until the CIS fleet jumped to hyperspace, forcing the Jedi to return to their ship."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Second Battle of Geonosis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Padm\u00e9 Amidala's discovery of the secret droid foundries on Geonosis, the Republic took a large strike force in order to cease production of battle droids at the factory, capture Archduke Poggle the Lesser, and re-secure Republic territory on the planet. As the fleet plunged to the ground to land large amounts of troops, the Geonosians launched a defensive attack. The Jedi was deployed in a Y-wing starfighter to escort Republic LAATs that were landing the parties that would secure a rendezvous point to deploy the rest of the strike force. Commanded by Admiral Yularen and Captain Breaker, the Jedi and a Y-wing squadron defended the gunships through an intense laser fight. After all the gunships had reached the astrosphere, the Jedi was recalled to the ship, and the defensive Geonosian starfighters retreated (they were allowing the ground forces to shoot down the Republic gunships). During the opening exchanges of the battle, Breaker, the Jedi, and a gunship piloting crew were deployed behind enemy lines in order to sever a heavily defended Geonosian communications facility. The gunship returned to the Republic command vessel awaiting more orders from the Admiral. Yularen, collecting several reconnaissance reports, next assigned the Jedi to lead a squadron of Y-wings to support surrounded General Kenobi. With his next set of orders, the Jedi proceeded to several areas of resistance, where he used his lightsaber throwing skills to clear them out. The Jedi and Breaker then began to set up turrets to defend General Skywalker's squadrons. Poggle the Lesser sent several waves of droids, including droidekas, Homing Spider Droids, Mobile Shield Generators, and soon a Super Tank to defeat them. After several days, the droid armies were pushed back, and the Jedi had won."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Battle on Felucia"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Knight ended up on Felucia, commissioned by the famous Boss. The hero fought Yorn Nuro, C-21 Highsinger, and Scratch. As the battle progressed, Armored Assault Tanks were deployed, but required some time to mobilize.

Due to being trained at Coruscant from an earlier age, the Jedi was taught about the Force and about lightsaber combat. The Jedi showed a finesse for using the blade, eventually being extensively trained in all seven lightsaber forms. As the techniques of each form were so radically different, maintaining even a working knowledge of them was a feat. For their own personal form, the Jedi Knight chose the acrobatic and offensive Ataru. Eventually mastering and specializing in Ataru, the Jedi mastered and harnessed this form to an incredible degree. Not only was the Jedi capable of wielding it effectively on the battlefield against multiple opponents, something Yoda had attributed to only a highly capable Ataru master, but Yoda himself was sufficiently curious to challenge this individual to a duel. Over the course of that duel this individual was able to outfight Grand Master Yoda, a noteworthy feat as Yoda was considered one of the finest Jedi swordsmen to ever exist. While this was a practice duel, not a live battle, fighting the Grand Master and winning, even in a friendly duel, was something only a handful of other Jedi were capable of, such as Jedi Master Plo Koon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Besides their skill as a swordsmen, the Jedi had an attuned understanding of the Force. As skillful as a Jedi-trained individual could be expected to be, this Jedi rapidly progressed beyond the average Jedi. At an early age they were accepted into an advanced lightsaber throwing class, showing promise wielding telekinesis and lightsaber combat as a combined attack. This individual also had the talents to properly mesh lightsaber crystals for lightsaber production. This is particularly notable as the crystals could be dangerous to modify, and only Jedi artisans were regarded to have the skills to manipulate lightsaber crystals at high level safely."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fittingly given their skills with the blade and the Force, this Jedi was a capable battle strategist. In particular, they knew a variety of techniques concerning turret formations and defensive measures. The Jedi, like many of their peers, had skills in flying starfighters. The Jedi also knew advanced torpedoing, missile, and bombardment techniques, which they had learned via simulations in the Jedi Temple. The Jedi could fly in complex formations, and could dodge rapid-fire blaster bolts, as well as enemy missiles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi was also a skilled technician, being able to manufacture virtually anything out of scraps and shards of materials. As a technician the Jedi was an encryptionist, and could decrypt a multitude of advanced security systems with the aid of an astromech droid. The Jedi also knew various droid programming languages, and they also knew how to create command processes for droids, as well as how to clean, wipe, restore, and manage certain droid data. They also had holo-telecommunications management skills."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Somewhat different from their peers, this Jedi also maintained a variety of mundane skills, some of which were frowned upon by the Jedi Order as a whole. For example, this Jedi learned blaster techniques and firing sequences, becoming an adept marksman, via the blaster training simulation program. Most Jedi considered such weapons to be crude and clumsy, while this Jedi pragmatically utilized them as the situation demanded. During their off time between battles, the Jedi would occasionally engage in swoop speeder bike racing. The Jedi could dodge and make hasty turns and jumps on their bike, showing expert skills as a pilot and a racer. The Jedi was also a card player. The Jedi played games such as Card Commander, which they often used on missions concerning criminals. The Jedi even beat Commander Cards, in which this individual was eventually titled the Champion of the game. The Jedi also knew Card Assault, another complex strategy card game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This Jedi is the player's in-game avatar in the Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures video game.
