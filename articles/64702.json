He was a friend of the girl Streaks during the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Endor, Iggs and Streaks joined a group of child resistance fighters called the Anklebiter Brigade which fought against Imperial forces in Coruscant's CoCo Town. Iggs and Streaks were part of a group of refugee children that fled to Naboo during the fighting on Coruscant. After not receiving attention from the adults, Iggs and Streaks decided to sneak back to Coruscant and join the Anklebiters' in their struggle against the Empire. Later, Iggs, Streaks, and their fellow Anklebiters rescued the Grand Vizier Mas Amedda from the Imperial Palace. This enabled Mas to sign the Galactic Concordance with the New Republic, which ended the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
