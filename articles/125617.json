The fuel was being refined by a crew of outlaws associated with the Crimson Dawn criminal syndicate who the Cloud-Riders confronted outside of a cantina.

In 10 BBY, the organization was led by the human female Enfys Nest, who led a small group of Cloud-Riders to the planet Vandor to try and steal coaxium fuel from the Empire, but was thwarted by a crew of criminals led by Tobias Beckett and associated with Crimson Dawn. Nest then had her people tail Beckett's crew, and Fi and fellow Cloud-Rider Weazel followed them to the drink establishment known as the Lodge on Vandor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There, Fi lent against a column with a drink as Beckett's associates Han Solo, Qi'ra, and Chewbacca passed by in search of the pilot Lando Calrissian.

Fi witnessed the final round of the game, in which Calrissian bet his ship, the Millennium Falcon, against a fictitious VCX-100 light freighter that Solo claimed to own.

The speech was enough to convince Solo to try and aid them, and he came up with a plan to work with the Cloud-Riders and kill the leader of Crimson Dawn, the crime lord Dryden Vos.
