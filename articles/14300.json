During the battle, a New Republic intelligence team detonated a fake bomb when Wraith Squadron approached the world. The Wraiths then purposefully fled from the battle, pursued by planetary defenders. During their escape they were able to wipe out a small lunar garrison launched to intercept them. The Wraiths suffered no casualties, though the defenders lost numerous starfighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
