He used this ship to confront Rey on Pasaana, where it was destroyed when the Jedi aspirant sliced off one of the wings with her lightsaber, though Ren survived the subsequent crash. After either having it rebuilt or replaced with an identical model, Ren flew it to Kef Bir after Rey traveled there to claim the Wayfinder. Following a duel between Rey and Ren in the wreckage of the second Death Star, Rey took the TIE Whisper, stranding Ren on the moon while she used it to return to Ahch-To. Planning to exile herself, Rey destroyed the TIE Whisper for a second time by burning it on the shores of Temple island."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
