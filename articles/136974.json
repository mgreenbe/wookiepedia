The city was situated in the deserts of Mandalore and was enclosed by a bio-dome that allowed the city to exist on the harsh planet, which had been rendered a desert after years of Mandalorian wars. During the reign of the pacifist New Mandalorian government, led by Duchess Satine Kryze, the city was the site of multiple attacks by the splinter faction known as Death Watch. They eventually took over the city during the Clone Wars in an effort to restore Mandalore to its warrior past. Shortly thereafter, it was the site of a civil war between different Death Watch factions, who were fighting as a result of the rogue Sith Lord Maul's takeover of Death Watch."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 21 BBY, during the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi was sent to Sundari.

Fortunately, Amidala, Kryze and her bodyguards put an end to this smuggling ring.
