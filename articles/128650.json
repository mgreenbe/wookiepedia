The Sorcerers were highly skilled in deception, illusions, and shapeshifting. They rarely ventured off Tund, and were known to be driven mad by their explorations of the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sorcerers of Tund were established on the planet Tund, following the Great Hyperspace War, around the time of one of the Great Schisms. They were originally composed of a group of banished pure-blooded Sith priests and rumored by the Jedi to be descendants of purebloded Sith that were once exiled from Korriban. This pure-blooded Sith society \u2013 spoken of in whispers throughout much of the galaxy \u2013 combined science, ontology, and magic. Convinced by their Rakatan interactions that all sentients are Force-sensitive, the Sorcerers of Tund proclaimed the omnipresence of the Force (\"the Unity\") that illuminated the deception of dualities and multiplicity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The early Jedi viewed the sorcerers as merely another dark side Force sect, much like the Jal Shey or Zeison Sha. But following the Restoration\u2014and reign of terror by Karnak Tetsu, who led the sorcerers in the years following the Great Sith War\u2014the Jedi Order would have often tried to \"convert\" the Sorcerers, attempting to convince them to use the Force without any of their trappings of magic and mysticism. However, they were unsuccessful, and eventually the Jedi contented themselves with making sure the Sorcerers did not descend into the dark side. Unsurprisingly, the sorcerers were reticent in accepting outlanders, believing that only true Sith can grasp their truth. On one occasion, however, they welcomed the few remaining Massassi and Kissai, descended from outcasts much like themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the waning years of the Galactic Republic, numerous crises forced the Jedi to abandon their surveillance of the Sorcerers. Darth Sidious did not see any potential for recruitment in the ranks of the Sorcerers, believing that the Imperial Navy could contain Tund."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, Adler Roty claimed to be a Sorcerer of Tund. The last known disciple of the group was Rokur Gepta, a Croke who joined the group, learned all their secrets of power, invented a few of his own, and when he felt that there was nothing more to learn, killed the others and all other life on the planet with his electromagnetic torpedo. Gepta would repeatedly come into conflict with Lando Calrissian during the early years of the gambler's career, eventually dying at his hands, thus seemingly eradicating the order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Academy Training Manual mistakenly states that all Sorcerers of Tund are members of the Croke species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
