While they were being held, Nym managed to acquire the codes to the space station to free Orsai and his men and have access to weapons to escape the station. When the pirate forces arrived a the space station, the Liberator, a Mere Troop Transport piloted by Kole would dock the station once the defense laser turrets were destroyed. Nym helped Jedi Master Adi Gallia destroy the turrets. While that was going, however, the codes that Nym used to get Orsai free accidentally activated a squad of Battle Droids, pinning down Orsai and his men. Nym managed to help them get pass them by destroying an airlock that Orsai asked for him to destroy. When Orsai and his men got to the lift they were unable to use it so they took the stairs but not before being cut of by Neimoidian support staff, who didn't put up much resistance. By the time the prisoners reached the escape hatch, the Liberator docked with the station and Orsai and his men managed to get onboard as the Liberator escaped into hyperspace under escort from friendly fighters."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Assault on Trade Federation Sensor Station"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After freeing the prisoners, the Mere resistance planned on going on the offensive.
