Their most distinctive features were the twin conical horns growing on the top of their heads, which acted as highly responsive electro-magnetic sensors and caused discomfort when exposed to complex electrical systems, like droids. Gotals were also covered with distinctive short fur that shed rather easily.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gotals were part of galactic society as far back as the early days of the Galactic Republic, and were represented in the Galactic Senate as well as the Jedi Order. Around 182 BBY, a group of Gotal in the Heaven system vanished, and the Heaven-earth corporation that ruled over the star system failed to explain what had happened. Thus, many Gotal chose to avoid the Heaven system, making the species a rare sight within its borders. Throughout the Separatist Crisis, their homeworld of Antar 4 was held by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, leading to a diaspora that had many Gotals flee to the colony world of Atzerri. As a result,[source?] Gotals were often seen off-world on planets such as Coruscant, Tatooine, Lothal, and Castilon. Many Gotal were sympathetic to the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
