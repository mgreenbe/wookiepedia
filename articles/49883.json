The power of a dyad was as strong as life itself, and the individuals who formed a dyad shared a connection that spanned across space and time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Members of a dyad were attuned to each other's senses completely, including what they saw, heard and felt. They possessed rare Force powers, such as the ability to physically interact across many light-years in the galaxy. A dyad could also utilise Force healing to such a degree that, should either member of the dyad die, the other would be able to transfer enough of their own Force energy to resurrect them, albeit at the cost of their own life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A prophecy foretold that there would be a dyad in the Force, which had been unseen for generations by the time of the New Republic Era. The prophesied dyad was realized within Ben Solo and Rey. Although they were enemies during the war between the First Order and the Resistance, Solo and Rey shared a unique bond that featured prominently in the lore of the Sith Eternal cultists.

Physically, they were two separate individuals, but in the Force they were one. This form of connection made it possible for the bonded individuals to communicate with each other across great distances."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A dyad in the Force, binding two separate beings together, was not an easily discernible phenomenon. The Sith Lord Darth Sidious was unaware that Ben Solo and Rey were a dyad until he inadvertently siphoned a fraction of their bond's life force. Supreme Leader Snoke, the dark side master of Solo's alter ego, Kylo Ren, was aware that his apprentice had an equal in the light side of the Force. However, he incorrectly presumed that it was Solo's uncle, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, before realizing that it was, in fact, a scavenger girl from Jakku."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Capabilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Sidious described the Force dyad as a \"power like life itself.\" The beings who formed a dyad in the Force possessed the uncommon power of Force healing. It was an ability that could be used to heal a wounded person or animal, although this process temporarily weakened the healer who transferred some of their Force energy. This ability was lethal to the user if they utilized it to resurrect a deceased individual for it required them to sacrifice all of their life force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bond between Force dyads was an exceedingly rare connection that made it possible for them to communicate across light-years. The bond gave the dyads the ability to see and feel what the other was experiencing, and also gave them a clear sense of the other's thoughts and emotions. Another unique aspect about their relationship as dyads was their ability to pass objects to one another through the Force, regardless of the distance between them, as demonstrated when Rey passed Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber to Ben Solo during their final conflict against Palpatine and the Knights of Ren."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The dyad had an instinctive drive to fight back to back, defending each other when threatened by multiple enemies. Through their bond, both persons in a Force dyad could sense each other's next actions.

The Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Bane invented the Rule of Two to ensure the survival of his Order through two members, a Sith Master and a Sith apprentice. Its ultimate goal was leading every subsequent master to seek out a more powerful apprentice in hopes of achieving the power, while remaining hidden from the Jedi. During the Republic Era, Darth Plagueis sought to create a dyad within himself and his apprentice Darth Sidious, but his attempt was unsuccessful. Sidious also tried and failed to create a dyad with his own apprentice, Darth Vader.

Their innate connection that Ren felt with the scavenger intractably bridged their minds, but at the time he was unaware that they formed the prophesied dyad."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ren and Rey both possessed raw, untamed strength with the Force, by virtue of their respective bloodlines as the grandson of Darth Vader and the granddaughter of Darth Sidious. While searching through Rey's mind, Ren discovered that the girl could sense his thoughts and feelings as well. As a side effect of their bond, Rey assimilated some of Ren's Force knowledge and Jedi training during the probe. Her latent Force powers manifested at an exponential rate, allowing her to utilize a few techniques such as mind trick and telekinesis. By delving into Rey's innermost thoughts, Ren not only sensed her loneliness and longing for family, but also discovered certain details about her past that Rey had subconsciously suppressed as a child."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bond between Ren and Rey became stronger after their duel on Starkiller Base; their connection was so raw and powerful that it reminded Rey of touching a live wire in the wreckage of a starship. At this point, they discovered their ability to see, hear and touch each other through the Force. The bond allowed Rey to gain new insights into Ren, who no longer attempted to hide his pain and misery from her.

He assumed it would be Luke Skywalker, Ren's previous mentor, until he discovered Rey after her awakening in the Force. Snoke gloated in his success at having gathered Rey and Ren before him, for it proved beyond doubt that there existed a unique bond between them. Using Snoke's reliance on sensing his every thought, Ren outmaneuvered his mentor and ultimately killed him. With Snoke's unexpected death, the Elite Praetorian Guards did all they could to stop their leader's assassin, causing Ren and Rey to fight alongside each other.

Before his death, Snoke knew that Rey and Ren were the prophesied dyad in the Force. As the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, Ren vowed to destroy Rey for rejecting him after he entreated her to rule the galaxy by his side, but later confessed that he had no desire to hurt her. During the final days of the conflict, Ren was able to use their connection as a means of tracking Rey's location, first on Pasaana and later aboard his own flagship, the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Steadfast.

Though stung by her rejection, Ren continued to pursue Rey at Sidious' behest, leading to their final confrontation on Kef Bir. As they fought in the wreckage of the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station, Ren's mother, General Leia Organa, died reaching out to her son in the Force. His mother's sacrifice, combined with the memory of his father, Han Solo, led him to cast off the persona of Kylo Ren and reclaim his former identity as Ben Solo.

Having failed to mold either of them into a successor, Sidious resolved to destroy them both, but in the process he discovered that their bond was as powerful as life itself. Realizing that they were a dyad in the Force, Sidious decided to keep his clone body and have it healed instead by nearly draining their combined life force in order to restore it. Yet his triumphant return was short-lived; calling on the spirits of all the past Jedi, Rey was able to vanquish her grandfather at the cost of her life. When Solo found Rey's body, he sacrificed himself to bring her back to life.
