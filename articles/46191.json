It depicted a regular stormtrooper, a scout trooper, and a cold weather assault stormtrooper adopting idealized, hieratic poses, as well as the words \"Your Emperor commands you: Expose - Pursue - Destroy - Those who would resist us\" in red type (and in the case of the final words, black type on a red banner) using the High Galactic alphabet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As open combat between the Rebellion and Empire sent the galaxy into a state of civil war, the soldier art that depicted Imperials as sentries and vanguards became more dynamic. Troops were now depicted in action, and the sense of glory infused in the images evoked the more rousing posters of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Expose, Pursue, Destroy is an in-universe artwork in the canon art book Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy. It was illustrated by Russell Walks. It had previously appeared in the Legends sourcebook Star Wars: Imperial Handbook: A Commander's Guide. Although its appearance there was largely similar to in Propaganda, the final phrase on the poster in the former was \"Those who would resist us!\" instead of \"Those who would destroy us!\" Something similar existed with Strength & Obedience and COMPNOR Recruitment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
