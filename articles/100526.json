After the Battle of Yavin, he moved to the planet Lok after a death mark was placed on his head. Nevertheless, around 1 ABY, the Trandoshan bounty hunters Bossk and Balfur Jhcor localized Oono Mor'in on Lok. Bossk later proposed to a spacer encountered on Corellia to split the bounty. The adventurer therefore traveled to Lok and tracked the Gungan to the Great Kimogila's Skeleton. The spacer attacked Oono Mor'in and finally killed him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Oono Mor'in was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
