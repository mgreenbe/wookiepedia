It was made from highly processed detonite for precision demolition of small or lightly armored objects with minimal collateral damage. Sold in fifty-meter-long reels of thick adhesive tape three centimeters wide, demolitionists could quickly outline door frames or wrap small objects in tape, and use one of the timers stored within the polycarbonate reels to set off the charges."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rebel agents often preferred to use the Flex-5 as opposed to more traditional charges or putties like sizzler, as a result of its relative ease of use and safety."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
