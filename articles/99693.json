For a time, Ogly was a business partner of the Human starship operator Borrath Freelan, and Ogly eventually began using a starship that belonged to Freelan, because the collapse of the Ma'Haffee Shipyard in the system had destroyed the records of Freelan's ownership of the craft. Following the Cularin system's succession from the Galactic Republic, military patrols were increased in the system, and one one occasion, Ogly and a number of other spacers queued in their starships near to Cularin, waiting for permission to depart the world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
