She along with her partner were sent to Brath Qella to excavate the Qella culture in order to learn more about the Teljkon Vagabond. They would land on the ice-covered planet, and using a Mark II World Rover, would begin preparing equipment to extract samples. Unfortunately, while drilling, the machine triggered a massive avalanche, which would kill both Krenn and Stopa. When the team on the Penga Rift landed weeks later, the glacier in which their bodies were found was named in their honor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
