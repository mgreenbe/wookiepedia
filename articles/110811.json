Around 18 ABY,\nseveral of the gang's smugglers who had been stranded on Yavin 4 escaped the moon in the Ragged Claw, piloted by Poe Dameron. The New Republic Security Bureau attempted to apprehend the starship as it left Yavin 4, but Dameron devised an idea to pretend that the Spice Runners had kidnapped him as a hostage, and would let him free elsewhere if allowed to escape. After escaping, Dameron continued to fly it. Following the Incident on Quintil, Dameron had to engage Hyperspace skipping, ad the ship crashed at the end of the run, although the Spice Runners soon repaired it. The Ragged Claw became too closely related to the Spice Runners of Kijimi, so they had to abandon it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ragged Claw first appeared in the 2020 novel Poe Dameron: Free Fall, written by Alex Segura."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
