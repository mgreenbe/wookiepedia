Due the the threat of the Subjugator-class heavy cruiser Malevolence, the convoy of three Pelta-class frigates carrying injured clone troopers was reinforced with a Jedi escort in the form of a Venator-class Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This increase in security, however, proved useless in the Battle of the Ryndellia system, when the Malevolence attacked the convoy. It destroyed two Pelta-class frigates and subsequently destroyed the Venator-class Star Destroyer which managed to stay active for a slightly longer time. The surviving frigate was attempting to escape into hyperspace before it was disabled with a blast from the mega-ion cannon and destroyed. Several Republic escape pods ejected from the doomed frigate, although the Malevolence dispatched vessels to track them down and destroy them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
