In 137 ABY, he was present at the Jedi Order's Hidden Temple when the bounty hunter Cade Skywalker visited it in 137 ABY, seeking to gain the Jedi Council's help in assassinating Darth Krayt, Dark Lord of the Sith and Emperor of his faction of the Galactic Empire. The Council refused, instead opting to oppose Krayt by allying with the remnants of the Galactic Alliance and the deposed Emperor Roan Fel's forces. Drok, along with Jedi Masters Asaak Dan, Sayar Dun'La, and Te Corso, was sent by the Council to meet with Admiral Gar Stazi, the leader of the Galactic Alliance Remnant in the Arkanis sector. Shortly after Drok and his fellow Jedi boarded Stazi's flagship, the Alliance, the fleet was assaulted by Sith forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the death of Darth Krayt, Drok, alongside fellow Jedi Asaak Dan, Sayar Dun'La and Te Corso, was sent by Jedi Council to aid the Anti-Sith alliance formed by the Galactic Alliance Remnant and the Empire-in-exile.

The Nikto first appeared on the cover for the second issue of the The Hidden Temple story arc. Drok was drawn by Omar Francia for the cover of Legacy 26: The Hidden Temple, Part 2. He was first identified and featured more prominently in the standalone comic Divided Loyalties, the series' forty-second issue. The character was drawn by Dave Ross in Divided Loyalties; Drok later received appearances in The Fate of Dac\u2014the series' forty-seventh issue\u2014and the fourth issue of Star Wars: Legacy\u2014War, the follow-up miniseries to Legacy. In these issues, Drok was penciled by Jan Duursema."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of a surplus of characters in the story, Drok and the other three Jedi from the cover of Legacy 26 were not used in the actual comic itself. Originally, they were to accompany Cade Skywalker against the wishes of the Jedi Council in his hunt for Darth Krayt. In the cover art of Divided Loyalties, Drok wields a purple bladed lightsaber. However, in the actual comic, he wields a yellow bladed lightsaber. In The Fate of Dac, he carries a blue lightsaber. In Legacy\u2014War 4, his blade changes color once more to green."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
