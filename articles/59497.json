He possessed a talent for reading and analyzing cultures, which he proudly utilized in serving his employer. Under orders from Jixtus, Haplif attempted to orchestrate the demise of the Chiss Ascendancy by sparking a civil war between three of its Forty Great Families."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Destroying a world for nyix"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the behest of Jixtus, Haplif orchestrated a civil war on Sunrise in under six months. During the civil war, Haplif pushed both sides to use destructive flat-blast artillery shells, which would later cause Frosif to be triggered into a trauma response to similar sounds. Haplif's war left most of the native population dead and ravaged the sky and surface of the planet. The Agbui and the Grysk Hegemony subsequently took over Sunrise and mined the world for nyix."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A group of two hundred refugees, led by the Magys, escaped their planet, heading towards the Paccosh homeworld of Rapacc. Unlike many of the worlds of the Chaos populated by sentient species, Sunrise never had a long-range communications triad. Jixtus had told Haplif to leave no witnesses. Lacking either military forces at his disposal or a comms triad on Sunrise, Haplif could not kill the refugees directly or contact Jixtus to do so. Instead, he contacted the forces of the Nikardun Destiny, giving them the refugees' vector and telling them that the refugees were raising an army against the Nikardun. Thereafter, the Nikardun military came to occupy and subjugate the Rapacc system, where the refugees settled."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Subverting the Chiss"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After successfully orchestrating the destruction of Sunrise, Haplif's master Jixtus sent the Agbui to infiltrate, learn about, and ultimately try to destroy the Chiss Ascendancy from within.  To prepare, Haplif and a number of other Agbui including Shimkif and Frosif posed as cultural nomads traveling the Chaos in order to learn about the Ascendancy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In doing so, Haplif came to travel with the Chiss midager Coduyo'po'nekri, whom he manipulated into organizing a meeting with Councilor Xodlak'uvi'vil on the planet Celwis. While residing on Celwis on farmland owned by Rancher Xodlak'phr'ooa, Haplif influenced Lakuviv into believing that the Agbui possessed a valuable nyix mine. By flooding the market of Celwis with underpriced nyix brooches and acting naive about the metal's value, Haplif and his companions manipulated Councilor Lakuviv into attempting to secure the mine for the Xodlak family. At the same time, two other Chiss families were manipulated into claiming the supposed mine. Though the resulting conflict threatened to grow into the civil war that Haplif had intended, Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet managed to put a stop to it by destroying the false mine. Haplif, however, never learned that his plan had failed; Lakphro had realized that his guest was up to something, confronting him. Haplif attempted to kill the rancher, but Lakphro managed to defend himself, killing his former guest, who was left for dead by his fellow Agbui."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Haplif was supremely confident, even arrogant, about his abilities. He hated leaving any job uncompleted, even if all that remained was \"mop-up.\" While Haplif enjoyed causing mass-scale destruction, he disliked killing others with his hands as his telepathic sense of touch would cause him strong unpleasant feelings while killing someone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Haplif often presented a fa\u00e7ade of good humor and cheer, although he secretly thought many of the individuals he interacted were stupid, boring or spoiled. While Haplif had a strong desire to finish his task so he could return to an unspecified home, he found satisfaction while dying in his belief that the plot against the Chiss would come to fruition."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Haplif and other Agbui had a limited form of telepathy, based on physically touching other sentient beings. Haplif claimed to be particularly gifted with that ability, which he insisted allowed him to understand, manipulate, and even destroy entire species. Haplif took pride in using his knowledge of others' desires and motivations to manipulate them. He likened such knowledge to having a \"handle\" belonging to an axe which he could weaponize for his own goals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of Haplif's exceptional interpersonal skills, including manipulation, Jixtus put Haplif in charge of interacting with Chiss and learning about Chiss culture, among the fifty Agbui he traveled with as a \"cultural nomad\". While Shimkif also possessed touch-based telepathy, she was more skilled than Haplif in administration and less skilled in manipulation. Therefore, she was put in charge of keeping the Agbui starship and crew in working order rather than manipulating Chiss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Haplif of the Agbui first appeared in the 2021 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good by Timothy Zahn, in which he played the role of a major antagonist and point-of-view character. Haplif's role in Greater Good was similar to the role played by Pathfinder navigator Qilori of Uandualon in that novel's 2020 prequel, Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising, although Haplif was much more involved in Jixtus' machinations than Qilori was in those of Yiv."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
