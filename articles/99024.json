It was inhabited by the near-Human O'reenians. The planet was colonized after the Great Hyperspace War as a Galactic Republic advance warning outpost, based on a self-sufficient military garrison. Eventually, the colonists were stranded and isolated from the rest of the galaxy. Following a coup led by Magnus, the colony's military leader, O'reenian society transformed itself into a caste-based military dictatorship devoted to the planet's military buildup under the rule of a leader holding the title of Magnus. Only those who served with O'reen's military were granted full citizenship and rights."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Millennia after O'reen's settlement, the natives captured a corporate exploration vessel that had discovered their world. The encounter made the O'reenians realize how backward their level of technology had become compared to that of the wider galaxy. In an attempt to counter that, the O'reen Star Corps performed raids on nearby star systems to capture modern military technology. Stolen equipment was then analyzed on O'reen in order to upgrade the planet's own armaments. During that time, the planet was visited by offworlders on several occasions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, O'reen's natives captured the crew of a Republic military exploration ship, resulting in a rescue operation on the planet, followed by the Republic Senate placing the hostile world under a quarantine that lasted for decades. At some point following the disestablishment of the Republic, the O'reenians stole a prototype tactical data core from a galactic-scale naval force, planning to install it aboard a refurbished battle cruiser. A group of individuals tasked to retrieve the tactical computer traveled to O'reen. There, the group infiltrated the Orbital Deployment Center garrison-city and stole the computer from an analysis station before escaping the planet. As the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong invaded the galaxy, O'reen once again became virtually forgotten; however, the ruling Magnus continued to wait for an opportunity to expand the planet's influence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "O'reen was a planet in the O'reen system, located just inside the Unknown Regions' border with the Outer Rim Territories.

The outposts would have served as military garrisons as well as self-sustaining colonies. The outpost on O'reen was led by the son of a Republic bureaucrat, while the colony's military was headed by Magnus, a former starship captain. During the colonization of O'reen, numerous satellites were put in the planet's orbit to serve as an early warning system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the other outposts failed due to various reasons, the Republic scrapped the entire project, leaving O'reenian colonists stranded and isolated from the rest of the galaxy.

Magnus's coup, as well as the abundance of natural resources on the planet, allowed the colony to flourish, and Magnus's surname eventually became honored as the title of the outpost's leader. Decades after O'reen's settlement, the original purpose of the Republic colony became nearly forgotten, and the society stratified into a caste system based on martial prowess and maintaining the military readiness of the outpost."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Renewed contact with the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several centuries before the beginning of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, a corporate exploration vessel accidentally discovered O'reen.

The ruling Magnus decreed that the scout starship be repaired and retrofitted. The O'reen Star Corps was also eventually established, which, for the following centuries, performed carefully planned raids on the nearby star systems in order to acquire new military technology, allowing the O'reen military to try and catch up to the galactic levels of combat technology."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Accidental visitors"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point during that time, an error in trajectory calculations forced a traveling starship to revert out of hyperspace, causing the vessel to become sufficiently damaged to require a rough landing on the nearby O'reen.

Subsequently, the individuals broke into the heavily guarded city, in the process avoiding getting involved in a shootout. The crew stole back their ship plus the necessary repair parts, fixed the vessel, and left O'reen. After jumping to lightspeed, the crew discovered that several O'reenians had sneaked aboard the ship.

The crew then decided to proceed with the delivery of the cargo anyway, despite not having the appropriate permits for transporting such equipment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arriving near the planet, the starship was hailed by O'reen ground control, which threatened to have the vessel shot down unless it transmitted the proper identification codes. The ship's crew negotiated for the right to land on O'reen. On the planet, O'reenians boarded and inspected the starship, confiscating the military equipment as evidence of a traitorous plot against the ruling Magnus.

The Star Corps stole the ship's cargo, a prototype tactical data core of a command capital ship. The data core, along with other military equipment acquired in the raid, was brought back to O'reen and held in an analysis station in the Orbital Deployment Center. There, the tactical computer was studied by a group of O'reenian researchers, led by a military supervisor, for potential installation in a battle cruiser being refurbished in O'reen's orbit, and it was eventually scheduled to be transferred to Fort Maximus, the planet's capital."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lieutenant Amalia, an attendant of a high-ranking naval officer interested in retrieving the computer, hired a group of individuals to return the stolen equipment. Traveling to the provided coordinates where the transport was attacked, the group followed Amalia's suggestion and looked through both archived and recent astrogation charts of the area to find any indication of pirates establishing bases in the nearby systems. The individuals discovered evidence of the supposedly abandoned O'reen colony, although its exact location had been lost by that time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sensors of the group's starship then detected an archaic transmission broadcast from one of nearby O'reen's early warning satellites. Several minutes later, a pair of old O'reenian Star Corps starfighters, resembling the vessels that had attacked the transport, arrived and demanded the crew's surrender.

In the resulting shootout, the supervisor and the researchers present were defeated.

Criminals on O'reen were rare and few in number and frequently flew their vehicles through the fog blanketing the planet's surface, navigating by their sensors alone. Such method of travel allowed the lawbreakers to hide from the authorities but was also dangerous due to the high risk of collisions with the walls of O'reen's mesas and plateaus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result of the stringent social system, every citizen on O'reen was a capable combatant.

An analysis station located just inside the outermost perimeter of the city was used for such studies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the primary purpose of the Orbital Deployment Center was to use the planet's orbital satellites to monitor activity throughout the O'reen system. Over time, the satellites gained another function, as they were used to evaluate any potential targets for supply acquisition raids in the nearby sectors. In addition to the surveillance satellites in O'reen's orbit, the entire planet was surrounded by a dense net of orbital defense mines that detected, approached, and detonated in the vicinity of any starships moving toward the planet without transmitting the appropriate transponder identifiers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Other cities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fort Maximus was both the capital of O'reen and its primary military headquarters.

The characters can emerge from hyperspace as close within the orbit of O'reen as possible, risking a dangerously close approach to the planet's mass shadow for a tactical advantage. If the characters approach O'reen from a further distance, they can avoid the orbiting patrol ships in one of three suggested ways: They can simply outmaneuver and outrun the patrol vessels, risking the entire planet becoming alerted to their presence; they can locate and inconspicuously use an approach vector not covered by the flight patterns and the sensors of the patrol ships; or, if the characters previously learned O'reenian clearance codes, they can simply transmit them and land on the planet unhindered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
