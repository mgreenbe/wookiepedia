The retrofit included a large hangar bay, three extendable docking tubes, advanced turbolaser computers, sensors, and armor. This happened in the hidden shipyards in Korbiss Valley on Kal'Shebbol and the use of imprisoned technicians, including New Republic Sergeant Lofryyhn.

To pursue him, the New Republic took over the corvette, since Sarne hadn't been able to destroy it before he left. The ship's sublight and turbolasers were in disarray, and the racks for the TIEs had not yet been installed. This allowed the newly christened FarStar to carry eight T-65B X-wing starfighters and four REC Defender starfighters.
