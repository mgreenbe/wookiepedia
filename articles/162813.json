New Republic pilot Chass na Chadic was partial to warbat trance and owned a datachip with warbat trance music on it. During the Battle of Jakku, Chadic and senior squadron commander Wisp of the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing sang a warbat trance single that had been popular in the galaxy's clubs around 7 BBY. The lyrics to this particular were sung in an obscure Huttese dialect. Chadic believed that it was likely a love song, and found the words haunting and indecipherable."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
