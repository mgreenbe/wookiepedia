By deregulating the banks, the Republic was to be able to increase spending on the Grand Army and further legislation to produce more clone troopers. Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and others who opposed the bill, attempted to stall it from moving forward. In an effort to overcome their opposition and further the war, a bombing of Coruscant's central power distribution grid was orchestrated, destroying the peace initiative and galvanizing the Senate to vote in favor of the bill. The deregulation allowed for a bill to be introduced and passed, increasing the production of Republic clone troopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
