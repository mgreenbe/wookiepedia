The Emperor traveled to the planet Agamar in that year to conduct peace talks with members of the Jedi Order, and the brown-haired male was one of many Imperial Knights who accompanied Fel as bodyguards. As the Imperial delegation met with several Jedi on Agamar's grassy plains and negotiated an alliance against the Sith Lord Darth Krayt's Empire, the proceedings were interrupted by a group of Sith who ascended from nearby swamps and attacked. The Imperial Knights and Jedi stood together and defended the Emperor, but several of their numbers, including the brown-haired male, died in the melee.

Three months prior, Legacy's forty-fifth issue showed eight Agamarian farmers tending to a field close to the peace talks between the Imperial Knights and Jedi, and in the following issue, five of those farmers shed their robes and revealed themselves to be Imperial Knights in disguise. Although Legacy 48 introduced two additional Imperial Knights who fought in the battle, neither the brown-haired male nor the female whose corpse he lay next to have been explicitly confirmed to have been one of the other three farmers.
