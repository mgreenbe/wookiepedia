At some point during galactic history, Sibyl encountered a pair of traveling priests from the Cult of Veroleem in a starport and she agreed to travel to the distant planet Veroleem and become a new recruit of the cult. However, on arrival on Veroleem, Sibyl and a number of the cult's other new acolytes were taken to a temple in the Coreesh Mountains on Veroleem and imprisoned, and the cultists planned to kill them to manufacture an elixir of immortality.
