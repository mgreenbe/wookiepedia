It was a force of Imperial warships, pirates and privateers assembled under Grand Admiral Harridax Kirill, an ex-slaver commonly known as \"the Voidwolf\", who commanded the fleet from the Harrower-class dreadnought Regnant. The Voidwolf's plan was to use the fleet to assault the Galactic Republic's shipyards on the Core World of Corellia, which would cripple the Republic Navy and give the Empire a tremendous advantage in the war to come."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Voidwolf's chief rival was a smuggler captain who had worked as a Republic privateer, and been conned into working for the Voidwolf by his agents in the Republic. During the Battle of Corellia, the smuggler managed to infiltrate the Regnant in orbit around Corellia, and confronted the Voidwolf on his bridge while in conference with the three captains who had declared themselves commanders of the Voidwolf's fleet. In a brief but brutal duel, the smuggler defeated the Voidwolf and took command of his fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Voidwolf's fleet was formed from the combined forces of various pirates, including pirate captains Trizz'mal the Merciless, Iceheart Carac, and Lunatta. The fleet primarily consisted of Ajuur-class heavy cruisers and ships of the Unidentified freighter class. The fleet also made use of smaller starships such as the K-52 Strongarm gunship and the VX-5 Ricker. A single Harrower-class dreadnought named the Regnant served the flagship of the fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the death of the Voidwolf, the smuggler has three options as to how to use the fleet. The light side option is to order the three captains to pledge their forces to the Republic. The neutral option is to disperse the fleet and allow the captains to go. The dark side option involves the smuggler turning to piracy, and ordering the fleet to attack both Republic and Imperial targets alike."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
