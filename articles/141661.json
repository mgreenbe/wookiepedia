The trees yielded hand-sized edible nuts, which could be husked and used for a variety of dishes. In 17 BBY, many Rodians of the Tetsu Clan left their home planet and settled on this lush world to eke out a new, peaceful life for themselves. They built meager wooden huts within the branches of the Tendril trees that kept them safe from jungle predators such as the ferocious manka cat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
