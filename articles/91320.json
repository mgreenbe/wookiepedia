But the mission ended in tragedy when Padawan Darra Thel-Tanis was killed by Omega, who himself was then killed by Kenobi. Zan Arbor and the hidden Sith Lord, Darth Tyranus, escaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude to tragedy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Only days had passed since the malicious attack on the Galactic Senate Building on Coruscant. The criminal operation that was masterminded by Granta Omega and Jenna Zan Arbor might have been catastrophic, had it not been for the quick response of the Jedi Order, for literally thousands of politicians had been targeted. Miraculously, only 21 Senators, and 24 advisors, aides, and guards were killed in the Senate Chamber battle against Omega's formidable phalanx of seeker droids. Above all, the attempt on Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's life had been thwarted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi High Council had sensed very early on\u2015with an affiliated anti-Jedi scheme to lawfully sever all Senate ties with the Jedi Order\u2015that behind the deadly machinations lay \"an unknown presence.\" Indeed, the Council had come to believe that a Sith was the real power behind the terrible plan, and the Senate feared that the attack was only the beginning of a much wider plot. They did not want to simply wait for the next attack. They had to preemptively act to cut the head off the snake, by spreading a wide net to lure in and trap the vicious creature. But galactic politics were volatile, and a period of calm was needed to steady the mood of the Senate, which had grown ugly since the attack. Chancellor Palpatine therefore urged restraint and cautioned the Jedi to be discreet in their pursuit of the notorious, murderous enemy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eighteen-year-old Anakin Skywalker was confident that he would be part of that pursuit, for his Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, knew the arch-villains better than anyone and, in fact, had been the first Jedi to warn the Council of Omega's plans. It was therefore fairly inevitable that Kenobi would be the one to head the team to bring Omega to justice\u2015and, naturally, Skywalker would be there, too. The specially marked Padawan didn't have to wait long before his suspicions were confirmed: the Council called into their High Chamber the four Master-Padawan pairs that would comprise the critical strike team whose charge it would be to bring both Omega and Zan Arbor to justice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before that meeting took place, however, the Padawans had spent time together in preparation for whatever mission might lie ahead for them, as was customary for the Jedi, who frequently had to be ready to leave at a moment's notice. As starfighters and cruisers were being readied and fueled, apprentices and their Masters checked their gear and said goodbye to fellow learners and friends. Throughout the Temple, Jedi Knights finished up last minute-assignments as they readied for new ones, uploading new mission information to their datascreens. Anakin was in his quarters with his good friend Tru Veld, helping him check his lightsaber's power cell, reserve, blade crystals. Skywalker adjusted Tru's flux aperture and rebalanced the saber's handle. Liquid cable launcher, comlink, aquata breather\u2015all utility belt items were checked ... including Tru's ever-ready snacks for the spacelanes, including Terratta strips. Sitting down to enjoy the food, they were content to have checked their equipment five times, even though they knew all was functional, for routine always seemed to keep nerves steady."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Padawan Darra Thel-Tanis entered with her usual witty humor, sitting down with her friends to enthusiastically enjoy the savory terk-hide treat. She announced suddenly that something was up, as both her friends' Masters, including her own Master Soara Antana, were at that moment in the High Council Chamber. Darra had the feeling that they'd all be leaving the Temple before the day was out, but she was ready. When Tru asked, she confirmed also that Siri Tachi was there, as she'd seen her walk into the Council room with her Padawan Ferus Olin. A jolt of jealousy shot through Anakin, and he asked Darra why Ferus was in session with the Masters, but the rest of the Padawans weren't. But she said she didn't know, asking Anakin if she really looked like a Council member to him\u2015\"Moons and stars, I hope I'm not that grim\"\u2015and told him he would just have to wait and find out. Trying to soothe Anakin's ego, for he knew that he and Ferus, mutual rivals, had clashed in the past (though they got along better now), Tru reassured Anakin that he didn't think it would be long now. Suddenly, as if Tru had just prompted fate, their three comlinks all buzzed at the same time, calling them into the Council Chamber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon entering the chamber, to stand before the High Council, Anakin felt a heavy presence in the room. All of the Council members looked, just as Darra had said, grim. He felt the Force strongly, humming underneath their various seats and through their beings, as if (and he could only imagine) it were a council of war. Glancing over at Ferus, Anakin suddenly had a foreboding feeling that what he was about to hear he would not like. Master Mace Windu began by offering the Council's apologies to Obi-Wan Kenobi, for though he'd warned them on many occasions of the danger of Granta Omega, they'd not taken those warnings as seriously as they'd been given. Obi-Wan had, after all, been right: Omega should have been the Council's first priority. He was now, however, Mace said. He told the Jedi assembled before him that they would be the first coalition to go after Omega. Mace advised that they could contact the Temple at any time for whatever degree of help or Jedi backup support that they might need to join them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Council felt that there was some degree of Sith involvement in what they were about to face, but didn't know to what extent, and so urged each member of the team to weigh carefully every move that they would make. As if all of this weren't enough, Master Windu issued the startling revelation that the Council had actually located Omega and Zan Arbor: the criminal duo had found sanctuary on the Sith tombworld of Korriban. And suddenly Anakin understood the feeling of dread that filled the chamber. The great Force legends spoke of Korriban as the seat of Sith power, thousands of years in the past. And because it constituted the burial grounds of the ancient Sith Lords, it was a concentrated source of the dark side of the Force: no Jedi wished to go there to tempt its powerful pull toward the dark side. Kenobi was not overly surprised notwithstanding, as Omega had ever striven to be noticed by the Sith. He'd obviously succeeded at last: to his reward he apparently now went, whether that meant only protection or something more."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Mace Windu's eyes settled on Anakin, he made yet another startling disclosure: Due to the galaxy's current state and the Council's concern over the gathering strength of the dark side of the Force, they had made a decision to speed up the process of apprentices becoming Jedi Knights. For Anakin, the news was electrifying, for he was sure the Council was going to announce that he would be allowed to undertake the trials of Jedi Knighthood early\u2014and for that, he was, he assessed, more than ready. But because this was a major decision, the Council had decided to proceed with caution and grant only one test case. Skywalker's burgeoning heart betrayed his utter confidence that, of course, it would be him\u2014he was, after all, the Chosen One: the one with the greatest skills and Force connection. It was, however, only after much deliberation and consultation with all the Jedi Masters that the Council had settled on Ferus Olin: he would be the first among the apprentices, when this new pressing mission had ended, to undergo the trials. Anakin Skywalker was fully stunned, heard only a blank where his name should have been. The unreal sensation made him want to move and cry out, for it couldn't possibly be true. Still Mace emphasized that their unanimous decision in no way reflected upon any Padawan's fitness to be a Jedi Knight. They believed in all of their apprentices and simply needed a way to begin to fill the urgent galactic need for a strengthened Jedi force, and Olin was to fill that vanguard role. Each Padawan would be ready in his or her own time. Despite that assurance, the disbelief and anger in Anakin were overwhelming, for he felt that his time was now. Indeed, he felt he would fully explode as his emotions ran rampant and he fought to contain them. \"May the Force be with you,\" Mace said, dismissing the newly appointed Jedi coalition to their readied ships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi told Anakin not to say anything, as they left the High Council Chamber. \"Follow me,\" he said, as they descended on the turbolift several levels to the Room of a Thousand Fountains and its calming elements: the splash of the waterfalls, the green growth, the soft radiance of refracted light. Skywalker's face was hot with frustration and anger. Anakin couldn't understand how it had happened, or how it even could. Obi-Wan conceded that it was natural to be disappointed and, for such a high singular honor, to want to be first. \"I am first!\" Skywalker exploded\u2014the almost nineteen-year-old Padawan was also, by a galactic standard, right. He was first in his class, first in lightsaber training, and, given his chosen status (one could well argue, as Anakin did), \"First in the Force.\" But his Master frowned, for there was no such thing at the Temple: students were not ranked. Skywalker, however, who would be a Jedi Knight soon, knew that that wasn't what was whispered or said, that it wasn't the reality, and his Master knew it. But how good one was, was not the point of the Council's decision, Kenobi explained. What made Ferus better, then? Anakin wondered. Not the point, either, Obi-Wan said: the fact of the matter was that Ferus was more ready. Anakin knew now that he was pushing his Master's limits, for Kenobi's voice was raised, which didn't happen very often. But Skywalker couldn't help himself\u2014he was ready, just as ready as Olin was. That was something that Anakin could not know, Obi-Wan cautioned, for it was not for the Padawan, but for the Master and the Council to know."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker started at the sudden knowledge that seared his brain: his Master had agreed\u2014he'd voted for Ferus. It was not a vote, but a discussion, Kenobi corrected, to which all Masters were invited. He had agreed with the Council's choice. Anakin could feel only as if he'd been brutally prodded by an electrojabber. But it wasn't about Skywalker's skills, his commitment, or his abilities; it was about his readiness, and there was a clear difference. When Anakin flatly challenged Obi-Wan that he didn't think him ready, Kenobi responded that while he thought Ferus was ready, that did not mean that he believed that Olin would make a better Jedi, only that he was ready now. Beyond fairly certain, Anakin knew that Ferus had manipulated the Council members and the Masters, voicing aloud his own doubts about Skywalker, sometimes in front of Anakin's own Master, and had somehow corrupted their opinions of him. His fury was saber-hot, wild, scarcely containable. And looking at his Master, he suddenly didn't know him anymore: he seemed a stranger. \"Take care,\" Obi-Wan warned, for he could feel his Padawan's anger. But Skywalker didn't care; he wanted to strike out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin's focus on who got to be a Knight first, however, simply reinforced the rightness of the Council's decision: Anakin was not emotionally ready to be a Jedi. Decisions such as this had to be accepted. Skywalker told Kenobi that he didn't need to quote Jedi teachings to him, for he knew them well\u2014better than Olin, in fact, but then, that didn't seem to make a difference. His aspect tight, Obi-Wan told his Padawan that he needed time to compose himself, after which they could discuss the matter further. Turning away to leave, Kenobi suddenly relented and turned back: \"I believe in you, Anakin,\" he said. But the young Jedi kept his back to his Master, for he couldn't answer, and only thought of Ferus\u2014how he'd plotted, beaten him, and won. He was forced now even to work with him on their new mission, forced now to help Olin achieve what he, Anakin, deserved. He saw only Ferus' smug face as he accepted the praise of the Council, as he took Anakin's place as a Jedi Knight ... while the Chosen One would remain a Padawan! It simply couldn't happen that way, he silently resolved, taking his anger and focusing it. The many fountain waters around Anakin suddenly hung for a moment in the air, fully suspended: he'd used the Force to freeze them in midair, just to prove he could do it. The silence was deafening, but then he let them fall\u2014all the waters gushing, trickling, and racing again. The noise grew enormous, torrential, as if he could hear every drop of water cascade with every stone, every pebble. Skywalker thrilled in the surge of power\u2014and it was but a small part of what he was capable of. They would all soon know it. He would show them that they had made a serious mistake. For he should be the first apprentice to ascend to Jedi Knight. He knew this, and soon everyone else would, too. He would make them know it."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Into the Sith realm"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two Republic cruisers would take the Jedi to Korriban, and the best pilots of the group\u2014Master Ry-Gaul and Skywalker\u2014would fly them. Assembling now together at the vast hangar, Siri and Ferus had been assigned to accompany Obi-Wan and Anakin, while Soara and Darra would travel with Tru Veld and his Master. Kenobi, who didn't think it wise to put Anakin and Ferus together in a small cruiser until Skywalker had cooled down, wished it could be otherwise. All choices they made from now on, however, had to be calculated ones, for the consequences of such decisions could be critical. In this case, they had no choice, with the looming possibility that their ships might be attacked on the journey. Indeed, going forward, nothing could be taken for granted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the designated pilots did their pre-flight checks and the rest of the Jedi team prepared to depart Coruscant, Obi-Wan took note of his comrades. More than three years had passed since they'd all shared a mission to Euceron, to patrol the Galactic Games, and the intervening years had been long and hard for everyone: his fellow Jedi looked more focused and intent. Veld and Ry-Gaul had survived a series of highly dangerous missions; Antana and Thel-Tanis had recently navigated a fierce interplanetary war\u2014and the changes and the recognition he could see in all the Padawans were the same he once saw in himself as he neared the end of his years of apprenticeship. Their countenances mirrored the seriousness of their purpose and the things they'd seen\u2014a long way indeed from each Jedi learner's early expectation simply to lead a life of service, adventure, and success. Failure was never a part of that rose-tinted vision, and the passing years brought not only satisfaction, but deep disappointment and heartbreaking loss as well. Forever imprinted in each one's memory were things they wished they had not seen. A Padawan polishing his or her lightsaber while yearning to be chosen, lost in heroic dreams, could not then imagine how vastly more complicated the Jedi path would be."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Siri Tachi was leaner, her edge was sharper, if that was possible; there was less humor and more frustration. Ry-Gaul's gray eyes had bleached almost to white: experience had, it seemed, leached out their color. The quiet, somber Jedi, moreover, if it were possible, spoke even less than he did before. But he had explained to Kenobi that there simply was \"less to say.\" Oddly enough, the great lightsaber master Soara Antana had grown softer, almost tender, with Darra. But often replacing the lively exuberance in Thel-Tanis' eyes was now a shadowy sadness. They'd all changed, including Obi-Wan himself, who, catching a glimpse of his bearded face in the viewport, though younger than Qui-Gon Jinn was as a Master, nevertheless felt old. A strange weariness was in his bones. And he knew it was from the intense concentration and effort he placed in cautious vigilance, in ever watching and waiting for something he could not name. All the Jedi had felt it\u2014a gathering of dark energies throughout the galaxy, from the Force's dark side. Having spent these last years pushing with their strength against the darkness and the chaos, they were tired, but had so much farther to go."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As for Anakin, Obi-Wan simply had to trust in the integrity of his Padawan's core. Kenobi must count on Skywalker's maturity now\u2014that, with time, Anakin would forgive him for supporting Ferus. Indeed, Obi-Wan recognized the difficulty he had in admitting that Olin was the best candidate. It was only natural to have wanted Anakin to be chosen, but something had whispered no. Even so, he would never had consented had the feeling not permeated his being that, in this instance, the times were too perilous for the Jedi to make a mistake. But he knew his Padawan well, knew Anakin would find acceptance despite the profound struggles that Obi-Wan knew he could not help him with. But Kenobi was confident that, in time, Skywalker's better side would win."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From his quiet ruminations, Obi-Wan was suddenly brought back to the present by the surprise appearance of Master Yoda on the landing platform. He'd glided in on his repulsorlift chair from the turbolift to bid a special farewell. After Obi-Wan had quickly stepped forward to greet him and ask if anything was wrong, the beloved Jedi sage was silent, allowing his gray-blue eyes to scan each member of the Korriban coalition, moving from one Jedi to the next, until he lingered on the faces of the Padawans. Yoda told them that he felt he needed to look upon them all before they left, and tell them ... but he remained silent for a moment and, leaning on his gimer stick as he looked upon Obi-Wan with great affection, simply said that he had become as Ry-Gaul, and had, after all, nothing to say. What he would say, he told Obi-Wan, he knew already. Kenobi knew that Yoda spoke true, for a great dread lay within Yoda's soul. He knew the Grand Master needed to come look at them all in case any one of them did not return: he needed to be present so that each would know how deeply he felt for them. He wanted to see them off, see the last glint of sun on a wing as they flew. The pre-flight checks completed, the Jedi turned to board as Yoda lifted one three-fingered hand in fond farewell: \"May the Force be with you,\" he said."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having traveled in hyperspace for days from the galactic Core, the Jedi cruisers were on their final approach to Korriban within the Horuset system of the known Sith Worlds. Obi-Wan had found comfort in navigational routine (what he'd always done since he was an apprentice)\u2014checking coordinates to forestall problems, though he knew precisely his team's position and how far they had left to go in a journey that had passed, after all, without incident. Kenobi appreciated Olin's effort to keep a delicate distance between himself and Anakin, for he did so without seeming to, giving his Padawan space. When Siri came up behind him, Obi-Wan activated the star charts' holomode and together they studied the isolated system of the marooned planet that other planets seemingly chose to hide from: Korriban. For Kenobi, Korriban was a source of evil that still called evil to come meet it. For Siri, on the other hand, it was just a place where some old Sith bones lay. Indeed, the Jedi were on their way to a place they'd heard about from their earliest days as students at the Temple: the Valley of the Dark Lords, where the dark side of the Force still lived. They'd used tales of the Valley to scare each other as younglings. But a thousand years and more had passed since the times of Sith occupation and the planet had remained, for the most part, barren of settlers and unattractive. In truth, Korriban had never recovered from the Sith presence, had never formed a government, had never joined the Senate, and therefore was not part of the galactic alliance. Even freighters wouldn't stop there, and there were few places that freighters would not go."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Commerce Guild, nonetheless, had opened an office there, offering incentives to corporations to open branches in the Dreshdae spaceport. The business enterprise seemed strange to the Jedi, but they considered it to be \"the same old dance\"\u2014just another power play by the Guild to gain influence and keep major corporations \"in their backyard\" so that they might control them. But the choice of Korriban prompted the Jedi Order's suspicion that the Sith might have been behind the Commerce Guild's presence there\u2014even if the Guild (or most of it) didn't know it. The Guild would reap what it deserved, in that case, Siri said. The Padawans now had joined the conversation, and, in response to Ferus' inquiry about the kinds of beings who lived on Korriban, Tachi told him that there were three: those who were forced to live there because of work, those who had been stranded there, and, finally, those who chose to be there\u2014which were the dangerous ones, Kenobi said. When Anakin voiced his concern about how they planned to find the criminals, being that they might be hiding anywhere on the huge planet, Obi-Wan said he didn't believe that they'd come there to hide, but that Omega had come for a reason. Kenobi believed that Omega had been invited: for having done his best to impress, Omega had finally attracted the notice of the Sith and was going there for his reward, whatever that might be."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Coming out of hyperspace, Korriban, that solitary \"cradle of darkness,\" loomed in their vision\u2014a large planet with blood-red clouds obscuring its surface\u2014and the Jedi prepared for their descent and landing at the Dreshdae spaceport. Each of them felt what Kenobi did: the dark side of the Force emanating from the planet's surface in what was certainly the most complicated surge of dark energy any of them had ever felt. For it had a sick sweetness to it, something that seemed to pour through their veins\u2014attracting and repelling them at once. They struggled to meet and clear their minds of it. Even as Obi-Wan entered the coordinates into the nav computer, he hesitated, for he got the distinct impression that in making the commitment to land, he was sealing their fate. Their faces to the viewport, none could turn away: dread seeped into their hearts as, through the red-blood clouds, the planet appeared to come up to meet them."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Korriban commerce"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before he'd left the Temple, Anakin Skywalker had decided that he would have to wear another mask on this mission, but a mask of friendship, for Ferus could never know his true feelings: he would defeat Olin without him ever knowing that they were in competition. But, as often happens with well-intentioned plans or theories, they often falter when they're actually attempted. For Skywalker found that it was impossibly difficult to keep his true feelings hidden when faced with Ferus himself. His resentment, like a leaking gas, threatened to explode. But he kept telling himself that that would not happen, that he would prove that he was the better Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Flying now over Korriban's deserts, deep canyons, and mountain ranges, Olin inquired where the Valley of the Dark Lords was located. Obi-Wan answered that the Valley, invisible from the air and constantly under heavy cloud cover, was narrow\u2014a slit hidden in the mountains some distance from Dreshdae. The disorderly settlement, its unsightly buildings clumped together, had been built on a plateau in the middle of the planet's largest mountain range. As they approached the spaceport, the Jedi could see that the recently (and poorly) refurbished landing platform was deserted, apart from a few cruisers parked behind an energy fence. Upon landing, the other Jedi cruiser passengers soon joined Kenobi's party, with the Masters going over final details in the cockpit while the Padawans stood on the ramp overlooking the spaceport as they prepared their equipment. It was a very grim place\u2014not exactly Belazura, Darra said, as she stuffed her thermal cape into her survival pack. They tried to make light of the odd tension each felt: they remembered how nervous they'd all been on their earliest missions together, and Tru admitted comically that he still was."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin, unable to help himself, asked Ferus if he was nervous, or was that not allowed for a Jedi Knight? He was, after all, closer to Knighthood that the rest of them were, and the Council's eyes were upon him. Olin, picking up on Anakin's taut meaning, frowned and said he wasn't thinking about that, only the mission\u2014which idea Darra reinforced by stating that that's what they all were thinking about. Tru's eyes told Anakin to back off as he added that they all wanted to capture Omega. But Anakin wagered that Ferus wanted to be the one to do it, because once you started impressing the Jedi Council, you had to keep on doing it. Olin replied that it didn't matter who did it, only that it got done. Spoken like a true Jedi Knight, was Skywalker's rejoinder. Ferus, his neck flushing red, asked Anakin what was it exactly that he was trying to say, as Darra, in a warning tone, spoke Anakin's name. Stepping boldly toward Ferus, Skywalker clarified that Olin would do whatever he could to succeed on this mission, but not because he wanted to catch Omega: he wanted rather to be a Knight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ferus' dark eyes now flashed with anger, saying that Anakin's was a serious charge, and untrue. But Skywalker said he had news for Olin: Ferus wouldn't be the one to find Omega\u2014Anakin would. And he was so confident on that point that he was willing to bet on it. Ferus, for his part, refused to bet on a mission. That was because Olin had too much riding on it, Anakin guessed; for if he lost, he might lose the Council's favor. It was no wonder Ferus refused to take up his offer. Olin spun and came within inches of Anakin's face, taking him up on his bet, after all\u2014sure, whatever Anakin wanted, for he'd hate to stand in the way of Skywalker's ego. \u2014Ego? Ferus was the one, Anakin countered, who spent all his time showing off. Olin responded softly, but with an icy edge now, that someone had to teach Skywalker that he wasn't as powerful as he thought himself to be. But now the Masters had overheard the bit of commotion, and were looking over, and Anakin could see that he had to control himself, for he'd gone farther than he'd meant to. But he didn't care, for it was now out in the open."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A light gray rain with an acidic taste was falling on Dreshdae's main thoroughfare. The Padawans had followed their Masters out onto the narrow, unpaved street, when Anakin felt a foreboding settle upon him. The drab hodgepodge that was Dreshdae had, over the years, grown and shrank without thought given to utility or beauty. Until the Commerce Guild had set up headquarters there, it was just a smattering of temporary structures in various states of disrepair, made up of plastoid blocks or cheaper metals that rusted with age. Newer buildings sprung up around them, most of them near the Guild's central office building\u2014a multistoried durasteel edifice faced in a multicolored iridescent material that was intended to sparkle in sunlight but, in the drip of rain, looked rather cheerless. The strain of growth showed in Dreshdae's obvious efforts to promote itself, and it was clear that the spaceport would soon slide back into a dark, dangerous, lawless place. Evil undercurrents that bubbled up out of cracks in the stone and hastily built walkways could be felt by the Jedi. Beings didn't linger in the streets or caf\u00e9s. There were no trees or plants, and nothing thrived."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obi-Wan announced that their contact in Dreshdae was one Teluron Thacker, a prosperous businessman, who had done favors for the Jedi in the past and had agreed to help them, if he could. They were on their way, even now, to meet him. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Anakin felt a touch on his shoulder, and then another\u2014whipping around, he found no one there; then came a whisper, then another. He couldn't make out the words, only their mocking, derisive intent. Crossing the street, he thought he saw blood coursing down a stone wall, but when he blinked, it was gone\u2014was it all just his imagination? He looked questioningly at his Master, who told him it was the dark side of the Force, that he was picking it up, too, but to just ignore it. But there was something insistent in the whispering voices, which Anakin couldn't just ignore, that urged him to answer. Though anxious, Skywalker wanted, strangely, to face it, to get to the root of, and match himself against, this dark power\u2014to prove that he was as strong as it was."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arriving at the small, dingy caf\u00e9 that had been predesignated (the roof of which was in serious need of repair), Kenobi wondered why Thacker would ever frequent such a place. Though not getting any Force premonition or warning, the problem was the energy on the planet\u2014dark waves buffeted Kenobi from every side, as if he were swimming in an evil sea. The thick darkness made it hard to distinguish true threats. Ry-Gaul offered to scout out the place before they entered it. He emerged to tell them it was all clear and that Thacker was inside. Entering, they greeted the nervous Eeyyon native, who, because the Jedi had helped his homeworld, said he'd pledged to help them whenever he could. The tall humanoid, wrapped in a red cape, had pale skin and the soft look of a being used to spending time indoors, sitting down. He'd angered his previous, oversensitive boss, and she'd banished him to Korriban because of a deal that had gone south. A loss of a few million credits later, and he'd been handed an assignment to open an office on Korriban. But Thacker hadn't slept through the night since."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Siri Tachi asked Thacker what he could tell them about the two beings they were pursuing. \"Only that they were there,\" came the reply. A human man and woman matched the Jedi descriptions perfectly. They weren't using their real names, however, and no hotel or guest house carried any clues. Kenobi asked if Thacker had looked into whether any businesses there were, in reality, a cover for Omega's enterprises. In fact, he had not done that, Thacker said, stating that, though he wanted to help the Jedi, people there said it wasn't wise to ask too many questions on Korriban. But then, Thacker suddenly offered a piece of information that the Jedi could actually use: he warned them that the Commerce Guild had its own army division on Korriban\u2014which was there out of necessity, the Guild had said, to protect its business workers from petty crime. Spider and surveillance droids were everywhere, and so, if Omega and Zan Arbor had any contacts in the Commerce Guild, Thacker said, they could very well have access to all the surveillance information and could see everything."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because Kenobi knew that Zan Arbor had expensive tastes and probably wasn't too keen on being on Korriban, he asked Thacker where one might go if one were a pampered business executive in \"need\" of special luxury items. There was a loose black market on the planet, Thacker said, one run by thieves who robbed when they could from the office buildings, spaceport hotels, and Commerce Guild supply ships. When Obi-Wan asked how they might get in touch with the black market, Thacker disclosed that its base of operations was in a ruined plaza on the outskirts of Dreshdae, that they should go at dusk and ask for Auben\u2014who was the best of a bad lot and wouldn't cheat them. Thacker gave one last warning to watch out for the Commerce Guild army, as the Guild executives were tired of buying back their own items, and wanted to smash the black market."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi were soon walking toward the ruined plaza in the deep, dark, diffused red of Korriban's dusk. They couldn't see the Sun due to the pervasive cloud cover overhead. Anakin suggested that Auben might feel less threatened if only one person approached her, especially someone young, and he offered his services. Obi-Wan and Siri concurred that it was a good idea, but appointed both Anakin and Ferus to go together: they would pose as brothers, stranded on the planet. Anakin swallowed his groan, for it was bad enough that he had been teamed with Ferus. The two were not to reveal that they were Jedi\u2014for that was information that could be sold. Though the Jedi knew Omega was expecting them, he didn't know when they were to arrive. The two Padawans walked to the marketplace in deathly silence, with no lessening of the tension between them. Anakin had wanted to meet with Auben alone, for he had hoped to gain information about Omega before Ferus did. No words were spoken between the two Padawans; no plans were made."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After circling the plaza once, they were approached by Auben\u2014a young woman dressed in a tight-fitting gray tunic and leggings, with a leather headpiece fitted snugly over her ears. On her back she carried a huge satchel, seemingly without strain. She asked them if they were looking for something, and they replied that they needed blankets and handwarmers. Auben demanded to see their credits first, and after Anakin had handed them over, she tossed Ferus the goods. Anakin, sensing she was about to take off again, quickly told her that their parents had marooned them on Dreshdae, saying they'd be back, but it had been a few weeks now, and\u2014 Auben, interrupting, said flatly, however, that she didn't need their story, just their credits. When Anakin said they'd heard about a couple that landed at the spaceport recently, and asked if by chance she'd seen them, Auben replied that she didn't discuss her customers\u2014ever. But when Ferus suggested that, armed with the same skills, contacts and discretion she already had, she might discover a lucrative business in finding not only things, but beings also, she paused to consider their proposition carefully. But before she could speak, a blast of artillery fire shattered a column directly behind her, and the explosion of rocks sent her flying toward Anakin and Ferus.

Ferus covered their retreat, as Auben yelled \"Who are you?!\"\u2014but there was no time for either Jedi to answer. Pausing to catch their breath under the shelter of the dark ruins, Auben wanted to know, staring at the lightsabers, where she could get \"one of those.\" But they had to move fast, for the Guild had tracking droids. When Anakin confessed to Auben that neither of them knew which way to go, she resolved that, because they'd saved her life, she would save theirs: \"Come on,\" she said. Skywalker could sense that the other Jedi were close behind and were following them as the trio made their way through the ruins, twisting through narrow passageways and climbing through blasted-out holes. But the army was near, too, advancing on the outskirts of the spaceport. Auben led the Jedi from the ruins into the winding streets of a hovel that dwindled into a lane that wound out to a rocky landscape. And finally, they climbed up the steep lip of the plateau that cradled the spaceport. Reaching the top, Anakin looked down and beheld an ancient structure below them that rose out of the steep mountainside and spilled out into a narrow valley: two-thirds of the structure was made impenetrable because of the mountain. The structure's entrance was in ruins, blocked by great slabs of crumbling stone and huge toppled columns.

He knew what this wreck of a building was: the Sith Academy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ancient monastic halls of the Great Sith Temple were spread out below them, thousands of years old, deserted for centuries, and still a presence of evil. Once a bastion of Sith lore and learning where thousands had once trained \"and thousands of hopefuls had once disappeared forever,\" the academy was, at once, repulsive and alluring to the Jedi. Auben didn't hesitate: she told the Jedi not to let its creepiness bother them, for nobody lived there. She knew they wouldn't be followed, at least, for everyone was afraid to go inside\u2014except her. Starting down the steep path toward the academy, through boulders and crags, she explained that the ancients had blasted out the side of the mountain to build it. Something deep within Anakin suddenly lurched, revolted. Although he rarely felt fear, it was no stranger to him now: a deep inner voice warned him not to enter, while yet another that was deeper than fear, bade him go inside."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obi-Wan Kenobi, lowering his electrobinoculars, could not understand why Auben was entering the ancient Sith Academy. Soara guessed that she probably had never found a better place to hide. The original inhabitants of Korriban who had built (and, in later years, rebuilt) the Sith complex had, of course, long since vanished, and nothing thrived there: but if the ancient stones could speak, \"they would talk of blood and terror.\" For though the Sith academy had had the same goals as did the Jedi Temple\u2014study and learning\u2014this place had been ruled by fear. The Jedi knew it could very well be a trap, but they also realized that every step they took on the planet could lead to a trap. And so they pressed forward, following the path they'd seen Auben take when she led the Padawans into the academy through a crevice in the stones. The massive Temple and academy structures were faced with giant exterior walls composed of great stones that had \"shifted\" over the years, with sundry large slabs propped up against one another, and others that had toppled and crumbled into boulders. The Jedi all slipped through the crevice easily\u2014all except for Ry-Gaul, whose tall, solid frame couldn't get through the crack. He told the rest that he would find another way in, and catch up; he quickly then disappeared. Taking their first steps inside, vast echoing chambers that rivaled the Jedi Temple's Great Hall were shrouded in darkness. They could hear echoing footsteps ahead as Auben led the apprentices farther into the ruins, and the Jedi followed them silently. An oppressive dread emanated from the academy's ancient cracks and hollows; the walls wept with moisture. Ancient voices could be heard, and spectral images of torture and pain passed, then vanished, like phantoms. When Obi-Wan turned a corner quickly, he saw a vision\u2014a Sith apprentice on his knees, begging.

Coming closer, but keeping out of sight, they could see through the half-ruined wall that the spaceport thief had taken them to her hideout and storage space, where she had stashed her stolen goods in bins along the wall. A bedroll was in the corner, and durasteel boxes had been stacked to form a table, upon which a glow lamp perched. Auben immediately guessed that Anakin and Ferus were Jedi, but said that it was all the same to her, as Jedi credits were as good as anyone else's. She told them that if they waited a bit, the army would stop tracking and they could leave, for the Guild army wouldn't come inside the Sith Academy. Auben lived there alone, and sometimes she got spooked, she admitted. She would hear things, but then realize that \"it's just this old place.\" When Ferus offered to scout the place a bit, to make sure she was safe, Auben said she didn't need help, that she had her friends to help her\u2014patting her belt where her two blaster pistols hung. She asked if they were really looking for a man and a woman, but not to lie by telling her that they were their parents. They confirmed that they were indeed looking for a couple and, moreover, that they'd make it worth Auben's time if she would tell them what she knew. But, suddenly, an explosive blast rocked the academy walls\u2014which Obi-Wan and the Jedi, hiding behind the ruins, also felt, scarcely keeping their balance. They heard the pounding footsteps of soldiers and the unmistakable clack clack of spider droids: Auben had been wrong\u2014the Commerce Guild army had followed them. Auben knew, because they were coming through the main chamber, that there was only one way out: \"Follow me,\" she said.

But Skywalker feared that Olin knew it, too, and he could feel Ferus' breath on his neck as they moved close together in the narrow passage: he'd been behind Anakin every step of the way. As Auben pushed forward, Anakin could tell, despite the thick blocks of stone, that they were moving parallel to the great hall, for he could hear the clatter of droids and the steady, fast ping of blaster fire. The stones were damp and slippery now, as she led them down sloping passageways that once had been hidden (the secret corridors once comprised a whole system by which powerful academy heads spied on the lesser Sith instructors and apprentices\u2014standard Sith procedure, Anakin thought, being that trust was not a part of Sith doctrine; even so, it seemed to him a bleak way to live). Deeper into the complex they descended. They were now in that section of the academy buried by the mountain, and were about to be shown, Auben said, that which was not visible from above. As they pushed open a rotted door, Skywalker was awed at the sight of vestiges of the Sith's greed-torn Order that were strewn across a vast, ancient hangar where aggression and technology met\u2014remains of huge hulking ships were witnesses to the Order's own perceived invincibility that, ultimately, was brought down in disaster by vengeance, lust and pride.

Just then, however, Anakin's nerves screamed an alert\u2014he was acutely aware that a dark presence lurked deep in the vast hangar. The surging feeling of the dark side seemed to rise from the soles of his feet and blast through the crown of his head: its undeniable power was stomach-turning, nerve-splitting\u2014nauseating. Ferus felt it, too, and softly whispered Anakin's name. \"I know,\" Anakin said. Resolved to execute a quiet retreat, they stepped back into the service bay again, where the cool shadow calmed Anakin's tripping heart.

It didn't make sense to him. The spider-droid blaster fire, while fast and accurate, couldn't compete with the Jedi's weapons that moved like pinwheels of glowing light, faster than the droids could track them. The opposing forces were mowed down, as smoke filled the air and drifted to the vast space above. The Guild army officers were startled when their deflected blaster bolts shot back at them, and they found it difficult to hold their line. This clearly wasn't, they realized, just a straggly band of thieves with a few blasters at their sides, and so seized their blaster rifles off the holsters strapped to their backs, and fired. Two dozen of them advanced, while a third wave of droids entered the fray.

They would later learn that these were super battle droids; their control centers were placed lower than those of standard battle droids, which, Anakin noted, made it so that a Jedi couldn't cut off their heads. And they had reinforced armor. Because there were far too many of them (perhaps forty), Olin recognized the obvious need to retreat (despite Anakin's accusation that Ferus always looked at the odds). Skywalker thought that they could take them, utterly dismissing Olin's comment that it was no time to play the hero, and suggested they attack from above, for the droids would not expect it.

They would wait for the first wave of droids, Anakin said, then drop using their liquid cable launchers, while using the statues as cover. But only seconds before they were about to strike, two dark shapes sprinted out from the hangar: Darra and Tru, who'd clearly thought Skywalker and Olin were at floor level. To Ferus' horror, the droids were locking onto the others' positions. The Jedi leaped in midair\u2014their cable launchers holding them secure\u2014bounced off the statue, and swung over the first line of droids, their lightsabers moving in slashing circles.

A damaged droid's random, stray blaster fire caught Tru in mid-leap, wounding him, his weapon flying from his hand as he fell. Another droid stepped on the lightsaber and kept going. As Anakin rushed to help, out of the corner of his eye he caught a flicker of sinuous, flowing movement: a cape. Moving quickly, the dark-robed figure headed towards the shadowy end of the hangar.

It was therefore with increasing dread that they followed Ry-Gaul swiftly down into the darkness of the mountain. They were deep in the monastic Academy now. Though it was in ruins, Kenobi could see how different it was from the Jedi Temple. The high walls that narrowed in harsh lines and pyramidal angles at the top were designed to create a feeling of entrapment; slightly askew, they were meant to intimidate and keep beings off balance. With no openings to light or air, there were only the massive columns, bleak towering walls, and hard floors of cold gray stone. Obi-Wan could still feel the fear that had ruled there.

But he wondered momentarily, because he'd been so afraid, at the fear within that had seemed so out of proportion to what he knew were Anakin's very capable\u2014even formidable\u2014skills. All he knew, was that he had an overwhelming need to protect his Padawan from the Sith, to stand like an impenetrable wall between Anakin and the dark side. The feeling was only natural, he supposed. Anakin, hugging the hangar wall and moving quickly with an intense focus, did not even notice his Master behind him, which insensitivity struck Kenobi with alarm. Anakin should have sensed him, for his Padawan knew only too well, as he'd been taught, to cast his attention wide, like a net, and not be solely focused on the goal ahead. Quickening his pace, Kenobi felt the dark side of the Force grow and gather. He wanted to warn Anakin, call out to him, but he couldn't divulge their positions. But such a hope proved empty, na\u00efve\u2014because, whoever the Sith was, he knew precisely where Anakin was.

He'd never felt a force like the one he'd just experienced. When asked if he'd seen the Sith Lord, Skywalker (recognizing now that he hadn't been trailing Granta Omega, after all) said that he'd fleetingly glimpsed the tall, black-hooded figure only from behind: his cape had trailed all the way to the ground, but he couldn't see his face. It was without even turning that the Sith had flung the Force at Anakin like an autoblaster cannon. Struggling to his feet, Skywalker suddenly began to move forward\u2014but where was he going? his Master inquired. They had this one chance to make a stand, Anakin said, his aspect changing: his face hardened, his eyes were as flint, every muscle tightened. If they waited for the others, it would be too late. His Padawan was right\u2014they had to try\u2014and together they moved forward into the darkness. Obi-Wan told Anakin to keep his focus loose, because the Sith would come from anywhere, when he did.

Flattening themselves against the wall, another vehicle's jagged wing flung out to slice them into ribbons, while an old cruiser suddenly zoomed toward the wall, straight at them. \"Drop!\" and the Jedi hit the floor, hugging the stones, as the ship passed over them, smashing into the wall. Ancient vehicle parts began falling like rain, impacting the hard surfaces with deafening roars.

Omega expressed gratitude to the Sith Lord that his and Zan Arbor's failure to complete their mission at the Senate did not disappoint him, for (as their Master had generously conceded) the intent to disrupt and demoralize was achieved, and the Senate was more divided than ever. Omega expressed also his and Zan Arbor's gratification that the Sith Lord had decided to entrust them with his secret, saying they'd received the coordinates for their meeting, when, at last, the Sith would reveal himself to them.

Tru was worried that it now was slipping back into half-power without warning. Anakin wondered why Tru hadn't told Ry-Gaul about his damaged lightsaber\u2014apprentices were obligated, after all, to report to their Masters if their Jedi weapons were damaged. As if hearing Anakin's thoughts, Tru voiced his worry that, because his Master was always \"so correct,\" Ry-Gaul might leave Tru out of battle situations, or even send him back to the Temple. Ferus concurred, however, saying that if Veld's lightsaber was permanently damaged, Ry-Gaul would be right to do so\u2014which Skywalker thought so typical of Olin, who always felt he had to inform Padawans of the rules they knew by heart already. Tru didn't want, after all, Ferus told him, to meet a Sith without a lightsaber. Veld agreed, saying that the mission was crucial, and that's why he couldn't be sent back: he'd thought that if he could just fix it without having to tell Ry-Gaul... For while he conceded to Olin that he wouldn't be the first or even second candidate to enter the Jedi Knight acceleration program (that honor was to be Ferus and Anakin's, and Darra perhaps would be third), Tru didn't want to be left behind. When Ferus reminded Tru that his advancement was not the reason they were there, the injured Padawan retorted that that was not what he meant\u2014only that he wanted to stand with his fellow Jedi because they all knew the darkness was growing. They needed every Jedi, and Tru wanted to be there. They all did, Ferus said compassionately."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ferus Olin then bent over Tru Veld's lightsaber, fine-tuning it, which made Skywalker itch to get his own hands on it. What was Ferus doing to it? It worried Anakin, who knew himself to be a better technician than Ferus. Putting the handle back together, Olin handed Veld's saber back to him, telling him it was fixed and that he shouldn't have any more problems, as its power cell was now boosted. But if Olin had worked on the power cell, Anakin thought, that meant that Tru needed to check the flux aperture again. Anakin himself had tweaked Veld's lightsaber before the mission, and it probably now needed an adjustment to compensate for Olin's power boost. Knowing it would be wise to double-check, Anakin started forward, but stopped when he heard his name. Ferus had asked Tru why he didn't ask Anakin to fix it, acknowledging that Skywalker was better at that sort of thing than Olin was. Tru muttered that Anakin had been busy with Obi-Wan. But his friend had evaded the question, Anakin realized with a frown, looking on and noting the two Padawans' heads close together. Tru could have asked him for help: he could feel his friend drifting away from him. Standing up, Ferus didn't see any reason to tell Ry-Gaul, now that the lightsaber was fixed, but he suggested it better that they get back with the others. Retreating back into the shadows, Skywalker felt betrayed: Tru had chosen Olin to confide in! As Tru's best friend, he should have been the one to help him. Veld was clearly holding a grudge against him for not coming to his aid, Anakin realized, as he headed back to join the others. Well, if Tru didn't want his help, Anakin certainly wasn't going to offer it. Ferus had most likely done a perfect job, anyway\u2014he was, after all, almost a Jedi Knight. But what was strange to Anakin, was that Ferus had agreed to keep Tru's secret. Anakin would have expected Olin to tell Ry-Gaul about the damaged weapon, or at least urge Veld to do so.

He tapped on it\u2014it was just a small thing, for the indicator was green now.

Noticing also a small timer, he figured that, even if takeoff didn't take place, it was going to blow anyway. The Masters were grateful and commended Anakin for his skill, but they were running out of time. Grabbing his comlink, Obi-Wan was determined that Teluron Thacker was going to find his courage.

On the other hand, it would be like driving a gooped-up gravsled, Anakin lamented, knocking on its decorative outside fins. Obi-Wan ordered his Padawan to drive, noting that it would fit them all and get them there. The speeder did have a couple of sniper blasters that might come in handy, Skywalker said with approval as he surveyed the instrument panel.

When asked why, he said the speeder wasn't very fast, or agile\u2014but Kenobi assured him it was fine. \"I'm sorry!\" Thacker yelled again as the Jedi took off.

When Kenobi begged to differ, stating the speeder was owner-loaned, the patrol said its owner had reported it stolen and threatened laser-cannon firepower if they didn't comply within thirty seconds. The Jedi suddenly understood why Thacker was so jumpy\u2014he'd betrayed them after someone who he was clearly more afraid of than the Jedi had \"got to him.\" When Kenobi asked his Padawan if he could outrun the patrol, Anakin replied that he could if he had to, and took the speeder into a screeching dive. Struggling to keep up, the army speeders shot out with their cannons. Anakin found the sniper blasters were disabled, however, when he tried to respond in kind\u2014the Jedi could only hope for canyon-cover as they sped for the academy. But if Anakin was to outrun the patrol, he realized, he was going to need greater speed. With Ry-Gaul taking over the controls, Anakin crawled past the other Jedi to the rear, let fly the canopy with a servodriver, and, with a fusion cutter Soara had handed him from the cabin toolkit, cut through the fastenings of the decorative port fins and kicked them off.

At the last possible second, Anakin wrenched the controls, but instead of turning, he went straight up, causing the bottom of the speeder to skid, space-bound, along the formation: its screaming sound blocked out all other sound, including that of the engine. Smoke and flame rose up around them, which Obi-Wan noticed acutely, closing his eyes. Foolishly attempting the same maneuver, the security speeder behind them crashed head-on into the rock. Straightening out his craft, with all of the patrol vehicles now out of commission, Anakin gleefully noted that no one in the Jedi speeder said anything for a moment.

Having landed the now-battered speeder on a precarious rocky mountain ledge above the Valley, they had but a short distance to walk down the mountainside to reach it. Though Korriban's longer-than-average dusk was still holding, it was nevertheless dwindling, and so they hiked quickly, while still managing to conserve their energy for what lay ahead. The coming darkness was faintly tinged with red. The approach to the Valley of the Dark Lords led them through steep mountains that \"crowded together like spiteful beasts,\" with cliffs pressing in from both sides; boulders would sometimes crash down suddenly without warning, sending them leaping for safety. As the Jedi entered the Valley proper, a dark wave hit them, causing them to slow to a stop\u2014it fractured the Force they felt around them, tearing at it.

Directly following Kenobi's meeting with the Jedi Council, both Tru (who had been censured) and Ferus (who was in seclusion) would face the full Council. Unquestionably, the mission to Korriban had, in the Council's eyes, partially succeeded. Though Jenna Zan Arbor and the hidden Sith Lord had escaped, the Jedi Order had caught and dealt with Granta Omega. And stripped of any connection to Omega's wealth, Zan Arbor would not find it easy to hide. The High Council did not fault the Jedi for failing to uncover the Sith's identity, for they had yet made small advances by getting near him, by uncovering one of the planets that sheltered him. But instead of feeling any modicum of satisfaction for what was achieved, Kenobi found himself pondering certain things that he'd not thought of since his Master's death.

What might Granta Omega have been, had his obsession not gripped him? Finding weakness, the Sith Lord had exploited it; taking a flaw, he'd twisted it into a weapon.

But of course his Padawan would have told him, and Kenobi hated himself for having the feeling. He tried to clear his mind just before entering the Council Chamber doors. Some days it was difficult meeting so many Jedi gifted in Force-sensitivity at once\u2014especially, as was the case that day, when the full Council was assembled.

And because of that, Master Adi Gallia announced, they had reconsidered their decision to speed up the trials of Jedi Knighthood for chosen Padawans. While the galaxy yet had great need of additional Jedi, Master Oppo Rancisis said, they simply could not rush readiness, as they now could clearly see. \"Our mistake, it was,\" Yoda said, and this caliber of mistake in the perilous times in which they lived they could not afford. Even so, Master Windu told Obi-Wan that they would commend his Padawan for his bravery. To face a Sith, after all, was the hardest task for a Jedi, and Anakin showed ingenuity and bravery throughout the mission. The ever-perceptive Master Yoda, of course, peering at Obi-Wan, could sense that something troubled him, and asked Kenobi if he had something to share with them. There were, of course, many things\u2014doubts, fears, sorrows\u2014that vexed Obi-Wan's spirit, but it was not the time or the place to disclose such, and he hesitated: \"No, Master Yoda,\" he said.

Obi-Wan conceded that his apprentice would indeed be crestfallen, saying that Anakin was \"not good at waiting.\" Nodding, Yoda said, Then wait, he should.

When Anakin expressed how sorry he was about his friend's censure, Tru said that he himself felt he deserved it.

But Tru hadn't gone to Ferus, he said\u2014Ferus came to him. Olin had noticed that Veld's lightsaber was at half-power near the end of the Sith Academy battle. Tru wouldn't have gone to Anakin, anyway, because he wouldn't have wanted to get his friend in trouble: he knew that Anakin would have kept his secret ... just like Ferus did. Tru acknowledged that he was wrong not to have told his Master, but also wrong to have allowed Olin to stay silent. Anakin, in his friend's defense, told Tru that he was only thinking of the mission.

Shocked at this news, Anakin told Ferus that he wasn't responsible, that there was no way he could have known. Interrupting Skywalker, Ferus claimed, on the contrary, that he did know\u2014knew that Veld's weapon had malfunctioned. He'd offered to fix the lightsaber secretly and didn't tell Tru's Master or urge him to do so. The lightsaber failed in battle, and Darra was killed trying to protect him, Ferus said. \"But you thought you'd fixed it!\" Skywalker blurted out. The words, of course, hung in the air\u2014made Olin stop and gaze at Skywalker for a long moment. Anakin knew? Ferus asked. If Skywalker knew Veld's lightsaber had broken, then he must have seen Ferus fixing it. \"I didn't say that,\" Anakin said quickly.

And Tru might never have noticed, except that in battle, the power drained faster than normal. Uncomfortable now, Anakin said he didn't know why Ferus was telling him all this ... But behind him Tru's voice rang out: \"Because you fixed the flux aperture\"\u2014and Anakin would have known, Tru said, that it needed to be rechecked after the power-cell boost. Turning, Anakin accused Veld of not coming to him to have his lightsaber fixed! Shaking his head in dismay, Tru told Skywalker he thought the comment a bit odd\u2014for shouldn't Anakin have said that he didn't know it was broken? They both were trying to trap him, Skywalker said angrily, looking at Ferus.

Tru had wondered at the moment the saber failed, he told Skywalker, if, in fact, Anakin knew then, for he saw how Anakin froze in the tomb. \"But not my friend,\" Tru had reassured himself, his friend wouldn't do that. But then Tru had remembered how Anakin genuinely felt about Olin and how angry he had been: Skywalker would have wanted Olin to get in trouble, even if that meant exposing Veld. \"That's not fair!\" Anakin protested.

Nothing he could say could convince them otherwise, because he himself did not know. Tru, on the other hand, didn't believe that he was looking at the situation \"all wrong,\" but told Anakin that he believed he was, instead, seeing Skywalker as he truly was for the first time. Speechless, Anakin could only swallow: he truly didn't know what to say to Tru. This wasn't the friend of his childhood, but, suddenly, a personality entirely unfamiliar to him. Tru then turned to Ferus and told him he'd see him outside, and walked out. Turning savagely on Ferus, Skywalker asked him if he could see what he'd done. Yes, Olin definitely saw all that he'd done, Ferus said, but could Skywalker? he asked. Shaking his head, Ferus told Anakin that he was afraid for him, that Skywalker thought that simply admitting that he was wrong opened him up to attack. Anakin countered that it wasn't true\u2014and that Olin should save his fears for himself. This last comment by Skywalker caused a spasm of pain to cross Ferus' face. Suddenly Anakin realized that he couldn't imagine how awful it must feel, to give up the Jedi Order. It would be like giving up everything that he himself lived for.

He felt like he did in the mausoleum's energy trap\u2014helpless\u2014and he had never wanted to feel that way again. Yet he was trapped in his envy, in his anger, just as surely.

He would make it fade by pushing it down with his memories of Shmi. And now that Olin was gone, Skywalker could fulfill the promise of his destiny: He would bring balance to the Force. Tru was angry at Anakin, but Veld had never truly understood the burden that Skywalker carried. Perhaps Tru had never understood him at all. Maybe no one did, except for his Master. Surely Tru would come around.

Ferus had felt Darra's death so very strongly, he said. A lost look enveloped Obi-Wan's face as he gazed down the empty hallway: \"The legacy of this mission is pain,\" he finally said.

And so, his mind rushed to rephrase Kenobi's statement: \"The legacy of this mission is that a great enemy has been defeated. I saw you strike him down.\" But the comment only earned Anakin a rebuke from his Master, who told him sternly that Omega's defeat wasn't an act that should bring a Jedi satisfaction, for Kenobi had actually taken a life. In his Master's defense, Skywalker said that it was done as a last resort, to rid the galaxy of a great evil, and was therefore necessary and right. Necessary, yes, Obi-Wan agreed. But right? That was not a word to throw around lightly, he said. The Jedi, after all, could not say what is right. They could only do their best. But Obi-Wan's gaze warmed ... \"As you do, my young Padawan.
