After the fall of the Empire, Quinn was amongst those Imperials who joined the First Order, first continuing to serve as a junior officer, then to the military rank of commander, and subsequently rose to general, becoming one of its key ground force commanders of the Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "General Quinn and his forces benefited greatly from the First Order's ambitious military build-up, at first modest but then more visible as the Order gained more confidence. Sonn-Blas Corporation and the contributions of trade allies to the First Order, facilities in the Inner Rim and the Outer Rim Territories produced weapons and munitions for the First Order. As a result, General Quinn and his forces were among the best equipped in the galaxy as the First Order moved to conquer more territory under the ploy of spreading civilization in the Unknown Regions and the bordering systems of the New Republic. Quinn served under Supreme Leader Snoke until his death at the Battle of Crait in 34 ABY, after which he came to serve under Snoke's successor, Kylo Ren."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Ren formed a Supreme Council to help plan the future of the First Order, Quinn was given a seat, and in 35 ABY attended one of the council's meetings on board the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Steadfast. Ren presented the Council with the head of the Resistance sympathizer Boolio and announced that there was a traitor within their ranks; however, due to the recent discovery of the Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious's survival on the planet Exegol and the promise of a Sith fleet to bolster the forces of the First Order, the Supreme Leader was unconcerned."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Going too far"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quinn then questioned the First Order's allegiance with the Sith Eternal forces on Exegol, complaining that they were a cult. Allegiant General Enric Pryde reminded Quinn of the extremely high increase in resources the alliance with the Sith would provide, but Quinn persisted and asked Ren what it was that the Emperor wanted in return for the fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mid-sentence, Quinn was cut off when Ren used the Force to begin choking him, before proceeding to slam the general into the ceiling of the conference room. Something in Quinn's body fractured loudly upon impact, and Ren slowly choked the general to death, as he ordered the other officers present to focus on crushing all remaining resistance to the First Order while he hunted down the scavenger Rey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quinn was a technologist at heart and used logic-based solutions verified by complex computer simulations in his battle strategies. When he served in the Galactic Empire, Quinn considered the Jedi to be a myth, and attributed the stories of the Force as hearsay, propaganda, and exaggeration, similar to other officers who had never witnessed the powers of Darth Vader or Emperor Palpatine. Quinn believed in technological superiority above all else."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He disagreed with Snoke's reliance on mysticism, but kept his opinions in check. Under Kylo Ren, the general was frustrated by the fact that the Supreme Leader was more than ten years his junior and struggled to keep his temper under control, questioning Ren openly in front of the Supreme Council about his alliance with the Sith Eternal, who he considered little more than conjurers and soothsayers. During the exchange, Quinn's voice dripped with contempt.
