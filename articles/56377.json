Prior to the Empire's devastation, the grass was everywhere on Lothal, spanning the planet's continents like a sea of golden-green. Following the planet's liberation from the Empire, much of the former glory of the planet's rolling grasslands was restored."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thirstgrass was a species of carnivorous plant that cut the skin of passing animals with sharp blade-like leafs and absorbed their blood.
