The ceremony took place in 3998 BBY, two years after the final battle of Onderon's centuries-long civil war. The funeral was held in Iziz, Onderon's lone city and the one from which Amanoa ruled, with the procession being led through the streets by Arkanian Jedi Master Arca Jeth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Jeth prepared to have both the sarcohagi of Amanoa, and that of the deceased Dark Lord of the Sith Freedon Nadd loaded onto a starship for transportation to Onderon's moon Dxun, the procession was interrupted by the emergence of a giant, tunnelmaker from underground. The boring machine was carrying a full compliment of Naddist soldiers, who, under the command of the Dark Jedi Warb Null, ambushed the funeral and stole the sarcophagi. The Naddists then retreated onboard their war machine, but were followed by the Jedi, who discovered Amanoa's husband King Ommin underground and in command of the Naddist forces responsible for the theft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being pursued from the tunnels by Ommin's forces, the Jedi requested assistance from the Galactic Republic, to aid them in liberating Onderon. The Republic provided the support of their navy, and together with the Jedi and Beast Riders, engaged Ommin's forces in a planetwide battle. The Naddists were ultimately defeated, and with the dark side finally purged from Onderon, Arca Jeth was finally able to oversee the final internment of Amanoa, Ommin, and Freedon in a Mandalorian iron-constructed mausoleum on the jungle moon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
