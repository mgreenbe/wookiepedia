Bek employed his weapon to defend either his master or any of his guests in his palace on Tatooine, such as Sy Snootles. In 4 ABY, after failing to negotiate with Jabba for the release of Han Solo, the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker called the blaster from Bek's holster and attempted to use it to kill the Hutt. However, Jabba ended up throwing Skywalker, along with the Gamorrean Jubnuk, into the pit of his rancor, Pateesa, leaving Skywalker to shoot at the ceiling before falling with the blaster in his hand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
