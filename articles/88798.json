She took a bounty from the Hutts to kill Jarid DeBell, a former Jedi who had incurred their wrath. DeBell was going to be marrying Senator Lavina Durada-Vashne Wren on the planet Cularin, so Centris traveled to the Cularin system. She arrived in Tolea Biqua on the gas planet Genarius, where a group of Devaronians persuaded her to let them work for her. She sent the Devaronians to acquire some cake baking materials, which she used to bake a poisoned cake. She then infiltrated the wedding in disguise as an usher and planned for DeBell to consume the cake. However, the Heroes of Cularin realized what she was planning to do and they thwarted her plans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Centris attempted to release a virus into the atmosphere of the planet Caarimon, in an attempt to kill off its native species, the Caarites."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
