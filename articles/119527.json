Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn once related a parable to his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi of a particularly dense growth of sallap trees growing near a lake on Generis. According to Jinn, for several generations, those that wanted to visit the lake were forced to skirt the large sallap forest, taking a long and circuitous path to the lake. A Sith Lord, however, opted to blaze a path directly through the copse in order to reach the lake by a faster route. Ultimately, his path never reached the lake, as testified by others that tread it after him. Jinn used this story when Kenobi was concerned that he might have been influenced by the dark side of the Force while on a mission to Asmeru."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "James Luceno created the sallap for his novel Cloak of Deception, published by Del Rey in 2001.
