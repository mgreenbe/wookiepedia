Used by the Mandalorians to mine for ore deposits of the nearly indestructible beskar iron, the sheer scope of the operation and the vast number of mining facilities took a toll on Concordia's natural forests, nearly destroying them. By the time of the Clone Wars, Concordia's mines were largely believed to be abandoned and inactive by the government of the New Mandalorians. However, they continued to be used in secret by the radical Mandalorian splinter faction known as the Death Watch, who transformed one of the facilities as a base of operations and utilized the mine's industrial equipment in the creation of armor and jetpacks for their Death Watch troops. During an investigation into the Death Watch that led him to the Concordian mines, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered the facilities were still functioning and engaged a number of Death Watch soldiers both within the underground mines, and at their base on the surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Centuries prior to the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Mandalorians of Mandalore transformed the previously agricultural moon of Concordia into a mining base in search of beskar iron ore\u2014a nearly indestructible metal believed unique to Mandalore and its moon, so strong it was capable of withstanding blows from a lightsaber. Ugly mines scarred the surface of Concordia in such great numbers that the beskar mining operation threatened to destroy the native forests of Concordia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the beginning of the galaxy-wide conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems known as the Clone Wars, the mines of Concordia were believed by the leadership of the New Mandalorians to be abandoned and inactive. Without the large-scale strip-mining, Concordia's forests were allowed to flourish again, and by 21 BBY, had truly begun to make a comeback. In secret, however, the radical Mandalorian splinter group known as the Death Watch had taken up residence in one of Concordia's mines, turning it into a covert base of operations. There, the Death Watch utilized the abandoned industrial machinery within the mine in the creation of armor, jetpacks, and weapons for their soldiers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his investigation into the Death Watch threat on Mandalore, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi traveled to Concordia with New Mandalorian leader, Duchess Satine Kryze, and set his sights on the supposedly inactive mines. While surveying the mines for evidence of activity, Kenobi found that they were indeed still functional; the Jedi Master was attacked by a pair of Death Watch troops within the mine, incapacitated, and captured. Before he could be killed, however, Kenobi was rescued by Duchess Kryze and the two fled the underground mine for the surface. There, they encountered further Death Watch forces at their base, and Kenobi battled several Death Watch warriors and the group's leader, Pre Vizsla, before being forced to escape in the face of overwhelming enemy numbers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even after their discovery at the hands of Master Kenobi, the Death Watch continued to operate from their base within the mines for a time, but were eventually driven from Concordia. Fleeing the Mandalore system, the splinter group took temporary refuge on snowy Carlac, before returning to Mandalorian space and establishing a base on the swampy world of Zanbar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mines of Concordia first appeared in Star Wars canon in the twelfth episode of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series' second season, entitled \"The Mandalore Plot.\" They appeared again in the later fourteenth episode of that season, \"Duchess of Mandalore.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
