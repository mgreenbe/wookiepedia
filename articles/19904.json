Able to perform all the functions of a standard datapad - including reading standard datacard in a slot on the underside of the device - the bracer computer featured a holographic screen that displayed information as a two-dimensional image roughly three centimeters above the device. The bracer computer was popular among those who needed to conserve space with their equipment, and was especially easy to use as its keyboard was designed to accommodate one-handed typing, both features making it a favorite among bounty hunters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
