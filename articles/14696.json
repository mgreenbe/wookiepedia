The general in charge of the Galactic Republic's troops hoped to use demolitions to bury a Separatist fortification. When the Republic soldier and explosives expert Skelly pointed out that the ground was not firm enough and that the available explosives were the wrong kind, the general did not listen and ordered a charge. Skelly decided to enter the breach himself, hoping that he could save his fellow soldiers thanks to his innate talents. However, the explosives expert fell into a coma, and all of his companions died in the charge. Waking from his coma after the Clone Wars had ended, Skelly lost his right arm as a result of the failed attack. As the medical droids had run out of human-compatible cybernetic parts, he received a prosthetic intended for Klatooinians instead. Unfortunately, the botched surgery made giving Skelly a suitable replacement impossible, leaving him stuck with an arm that did not work properly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Slag's Pit was first mentioned in A New Dawn, a canon novel written by John Jackson Miller.
