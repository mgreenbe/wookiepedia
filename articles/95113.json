It also served as the heir's first public appearance. It normally took place on the day of the child's birth, but in cases where the heir was adopted, it usually took place several days later at the earliest. Leia Organa's Name Day took place three or four days after she was born, when her parents Queen Breha and Viceroy Bail first showed her to their subjects."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
