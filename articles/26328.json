Around 392 BBY, Twi'lek settlers, escaping from slavery, domesticated the herds that roamed their adopted homeworld. Along with the development of farms, the ranching of the chollas helped the Twi'leks to establish the basis of their new society. By 8 ABY, chollas were also found on the neighboring planet of Kolatill. The ranching of both chollas and banthas was a large industry on the planet; the hides and meat of the chollas sold for decent sums of credits in Kolatill's northern cities. Both the meat and hide were also exported off-world to the nearby planets of Gandle Ott and Torize."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chollas were first referenced in The DarkStryder Campaign published by West End Games in 1995 in their information capsules for the planets Kal'Shebbol and Kolatill.
