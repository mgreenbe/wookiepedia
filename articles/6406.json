The individual affected might remember certain things such as how to perform tasks or speak, but have little or no memory of the personal details of one's life, such as name, occupation, or family. Exposure to sights, sounds or other sensory information containing details from one's past might serve as a trigger to overcome the condition."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following his defeat at the hands of Obi-Wan Kenobi in lightsaber combat, Maul suffered partial amnesia regarding exactly what had happened in the incident, but still sought revenge on the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Galactic Republic's forces were defeated by the Separatists on the planet Sarrish, the clone commando CC-5576-39 \"Gregor\" suffered from amnesia, remembering only his name and forgetting even his status as a clone.
