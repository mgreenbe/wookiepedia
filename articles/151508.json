The spiders used this silk to make webs; however, it was also harvested and used by members of the sentient Sakiyan species to produce Sakiyan shadowsuits. The company Ayelixe/Krongbing Textiles employed chemists to synthesize a material similar to the webbing known as shadowsilk which they also used to make shadowsuits, but the Sakiyan's maintained that Umbraspider silk was superior to the synthetic material."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Umbraspiders were first created for Lords of Nal Hutta, a supplement book produced for Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying game.
