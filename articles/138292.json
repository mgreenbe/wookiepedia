They were faster, more updated fighters compared to their predecessors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The T-65B was considered an excellent all-round starfighter requiring very little adjustment for most mission profiles. The craft supported many advanced technologies including modest shields, heavy weaponry, and a hyperdrive unit. In spite of this, the X-wing was still very easy to fly. The controls were designed to mimic civilian ships already on the market. This made the switch for new pilots much easier. Flown by one pilot, the T-65B carried four KX9 laser cannons and two proton torpedo launchers. The engines were four Incom 4L4 fusial thrust engines. A craft with this sturdy a design and ease of use was essential to the survival of Rebel Alliance pilots. The starfighter had a transparisteel canopy, titanium armor, and a Chempat shield generator. The craft was also equipped with sensors in the nose cone. The X-wing was still slower than and not as heavily armed as the Imperial TIE Defender."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each T-65B was equipped with an astromech droid. The droid was used in place of a navicomputer for calculating hyperspace jumps. In addition to its primary function, the droid could also be used for inflight repairs, enhancing the durability of an already rugged design. The X-wing carried four S-foils which deployed into an \"X\"-shape, giving the craft its name. The laser cannons were mounted on the tips of the wings. The proton torpedo launchers could be replaced by ion cannons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The T-65B was the primary T-65 X-wing starfighter of the Alliance Fleet. Its development began in secret when the Incom Corporation first started sympathizing with the Rebellion's cause. It was present early in the rebellion and later became a symbol for Alliance tactics. \"Hit fast and hard, and take advantage of all opportunities presented to you.\" The Alliance later developed the T-65C-A2, but these ships were rare. Most Rebel X-wing pilots flew the B model. The Rebels liberated Incom storehouses to acquire the starfighters, then shared the plans with other shipbuilders. As a result of the low numbers, the Alliance limited the craft's use. 70% of sorties were on reconnaissance missions, although the X-wings earned its reputation on strikes against Imperial projects. Luke Skywalker flew the T-65B at the Battle of Yavin. Rogue Squadron flew the T-65B in their strikes against the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Turncoat technician Ral Shawgrim attempted to deliver a near-complete set of plans for the starfighter to Sienar Fleet Systems some time after the Battle of Hoth. However, despite his escape, the plans were retrieved."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At least some members of Rogue Squadron were piloting the starfighter during the campaign against Lord Shadowspawn. Rogue Squadron's T-65B fighters were used to deploy flechette torpedoes at the Battle of the Corellian Queen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
