The elite Bothan pilot customized his ship, making it incredibly maneuverable. It was also rumored to contain some prototype technology obtained by the Bothan from a job for the Hutts. Begraas painted the fighter black, with highlights in blood red. Begraas' personal insignia of a clenched fist was also painted on either side of the cockpit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
