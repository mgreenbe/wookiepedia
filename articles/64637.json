After the children, along with their guardians Kam and Tionne Solusar, were rescued from the surface of Yavin 4 by Talon Karrde, the Idiot's Array, under the command of Shada D'ukal, ferried them, along with Tionne, to Coruscant where Luke Skywalker found them a safer place to continue their training."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After delivering the younglings to Coruscant, Shada returned with the Idiot's Array to help Karrde rescue the remaining Jedi trainees on Yavin 4: Anakin Solo, Tahiri Veila, Valin Horn, and Sannah. The Jedi teamed up with Remis Vehn, who had come to Yavin 4 as a pilot for the Peace Brigade, and Qorl, an old Imperial TIE fighter pilot who had been living on Yavin 4 for some time now, and together they were able to repair Vehn's ship and make it off the planet. However, the Yuuzhan Vong attacked them in space so the Idiot's Array, along with the two other fastest ships of Karrde's fleet the Sudden Demise and the Etherway, escorted the Wild Karrde to try to help the Jedi. The Demise was destroyed during the first pass and the Idiot's Array was also hit a little while later but was still able to keep pace with the Wild Karrde until it took a second hit, this one to the engines. All of the energy in the Idiot's Array was then transferred to the tractor beam so it could get a lock on the Yuuzhan Vong destroyer that was attacking Vehn's ship. Once they had obtained a lock the crew, including Shada D'ukal, vacated the Idiot's Array in the escape pods, leaving it on autopilot. The ship's reactor core went critical, blowing up both the Idiot's Array and the Yuuzhan Vong destroyer, leaving only one destroyer for the Wild Karrde to deal with."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Idiot's Array first appeared in the 2001 novel The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory I: Conquest by Greg Keyes which was the first book in the Edge of Victory Duology and also part of the larger New Jedi Order series.
