Raised by the Elders of the Path to believe that it was wrong for any living being to touch the Force, Krix was unaware that Mrala was Force-sensitive and desperately attempting to suppress her abilities. In the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace Disaster, Trymant IV came under threat from an Emergence and a Nihil attack simultaneously, and Krix attempted to approach the pirates for assistance. An encounter with a Jedi team which had arrived to provide aid led to a rift between Krix and Mrala after she was forced to use her Force powers against the hyperspace debris raining down on Bralanak City, as Krix accused Mrala of lying to him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Krix first appeared in the first issue of the comic series Star Wars: The High Republic Adventures, which was written by Daniel Jos\u00e9 Older, illustrated by Harvey Tolibao, and published by IDW Publishing on February 3, 2021.
