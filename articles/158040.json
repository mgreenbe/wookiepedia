It could be found in Imperial Military industrial facilities at Kuat, Scarif, and Fondor. Though unapproved by the Galactic Empire, it enjoyed a forbidden popularity among Imperial engineers. The poster's design had an Imperial officer carrying rolls of design specs only to be suddenly halted by Darth Vader grabbing his mouth to silence him from offscreen, with the words \"Loose Lips\" appearing above the officer's head, and \"Bring Down Starships\" being on the officer's tunic. According to legend, Vader tracked down and executed the original artist for a lack of respect."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This image was created by Cliff Chiang.
