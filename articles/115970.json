According to legends, two such rings existed: one that provided eternal life but drove the wearer to madness, and another that gave whoever wore it eternal fortune but hastened their death. When worn together, the rings supposedly provided the wearer with great power. The Rings were supposedly cursed, said to hold the entire city in their thrall, corrupting the very air around them. There were few tales of explorers venturing to Dianth, with those who survived going mad recalled seeing unspeakable horrors. During the Imperial Era, the archaeology student Detta Yao hired the rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Aphra to find the Rings so that she could write her thesis on the artifact. Aphra took the job, aware of the artifact's value, but found that Ronen Tagge, member of the powerful Tagge family, also sought the Rings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
