After his defeat at the Battle of Alderaan, he was picked up and carried away in his shuttle. While on board the vessel and en route to rendezvous with the rest of the Sith Empire's retreating forces, Malgus sensed a Jedi in the ruins of an Alderaanian city, and the Sith Lord ordered his pilot to turn around and lower the ship.

There he planned to confront Jedi Knight Aryn Leneer, whom he had been ordered to kill by his superior, Darth Angral. The shuttle circled at an altitude of one hundred meters above the Temple for hours until Leneer arrived, at which time it descended to fifty meters and allowed Malgus to debark and face Leneer. After Leneer escaped the battle, Malgus recalled his shuttle and was taken to the planet's Liston Spaceport to intercept the Jedi and to retrieve his lover, Eleena Daru. During the flight, the back of the shuttle was nearly destroyed by Malgus when his pilot informed him that a peace accord had been reached with the Galactic Republic at the Alderaan peace conference.
