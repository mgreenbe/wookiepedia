Corran Horn was at the time under cover within the Prince-Admiral's troops, along with the other members of Rogue Squadron. When the call came, he was engaged in a game of Sabacc with some of the other troops, and was informed, upon the call's arrival, that Sabacc pots abandoned in such a situation went to what was called the \"Survivor's Fund,\" presumably a donation fund for the families of those killed in battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
