Commanded by Captain Mak Jorlen, the Thurse was a cruiser-carrier that saw action at the Battle of Ord Mantell that year before later going up against a Yuuzhan Vong frigate in the Bilbringi system. At Bilbringi, the Thurse and its complement of starfighter squadrons attempted to save the luxury liner Queen of Empire from the forces of the Peace Brigade and the Yuuzhan Vong frigate in the area.

Possessing launch bays that could hold a large number of starfighters, the Thurse acted as a cruiser-carrier and retained a complement consisting of X-wing fighters from multiple squadrons\u2014including Green, Red, and Blue Squadrons\u2014and TIE Series starfighters. Equipped with sublight engines and a hyperdrive, the cruiser-carrier was armed with laser batteries and ion cannons, and also had enough room to carry at least a dozen troopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Action at Ord Mantell and Bilbringi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Thurse served in the New Republic's Defense Fleet as of the year 25 ABY, during the Yuuzhan Vong War, in which the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong species invaded the galaxy. Commanded by Captain Mak Jorlen, the Thurse served as a cruiser-carrier and took part in a New Republic surprise attack on Yuuzhan Vong forces at the planet Ord Mantell after the New Republic learned of an impending enemy assault there. Along with a significant force, the Quasar Fire-class cruiser hid behind the world of Quatin in Ord Mantell's Bright Jewel system and engaged the newly arrived Yuuzhan Vong ships in the Battle of Ord Mantell after they decanted in the star system. During the fighting, X-wings and TIEs launched from the Thurse attempted to kill the massive Yuuzhan Vong Qworlth skaal creature that was attacking the Jubilee Wheel space station, to no avail. However, the New Republic forces were successful in their endeavor, driving off the Yuuzhan Vong fleet, but not before the Thurse took damage in the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Thurse was still not fully recovered from the Battle of Ord Mantell, the luxury liner Queen of Empire\u2014serving as a transport for refugees from Ord Mantell\u2014issued a distress call after it was boarded by members of the Yuuzhan Vong-affiliated Peace Brigade group in the Bilbringi system. The Thurse responded to this call, as a Yuuzhan Vong frigate had also been spotted near the stricken vessel. Arriving in the system, the cruiser-carrier deployed Red and Green Squadrons to guard the Thurse while Blue Squadron, led by Wing Commander Kol Eyttyn, was dispatched to attack the frigate. Additionally, some of the cruiser-carrier's other starfighter squadrons were launched in the combat area. However, while Blue Squadron managed to fight its way through the frigate's coralskipper complement, the frigate began to make small hyperspace jumps that sent it all over the combat zone, preventing Blue Squadron from effectively harassing the vessel."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Covering Han Solo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the frigate still a threat, the freighter Millennium Falcon jumped into the system, and Jorlen, aboard the Thurse, warned the occupants to keep out of harm's way, convincing influential New Republic politician Leia Organa Solo and Jedi Master Luke Skywalker to momentarily stay out of the fight despite the presence of Organa Solo's husband, Han Solo, aboard the Queen of Empire. Moments later, the Peace Brigadiers issued an order to the Thurse to move away lest they begin to expel the passengers of the Queen of Empire from the airlocks, but Jorlen refused to comply, as the New Republic did not make deals with pirates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after, at least a dozen elite New Republic troops were dispatched from the Thurse to board the Queen of Empire in an attempt to combat the Peace Brigade members while the cruiser-carrier was positioned near a planetoid in the Bilbringi system as its complement of fighters engaged the coralskippers nearby. Just then, the Millennium Falcon began to chase a Peace Brigade Martial-class shuttle that had departed from the Queen of Empire and was racing for the Yuuzhan Vong frigate. Although Jorlen once again requested the occupants to stay away, Solo, who was at the helm after the Millennium Falcon had docked on the Queen of Empire, informed Jorlen that he would need cover fire from the Thurse after he retrieved two important individuals\u2014the Fosh Vergere and the Yuuzhan Vong defector Elan\u2014from the fleeing shuttle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo successfully docked with the shuttle after it was mysteriously immobilized and completed his objective, and the Thurse covered the Millennium Falcon's retreat back toward the Queen of Empire. The cruiser-carrier attacked the frigate with its batteries when the vessel attempted to pursue the Millennium Falcon, though the escaping freighter soon turned and suddenly steered a course directly for the Yuuzhan Vong frigate, blocking some of the Thurse's angles on the enemy ship. With Jorlen demanding to know what Solo was doing, the Millennium Falcon changed course toward the Thurse instead of the frigate, leaving the field between the two warships empty. With clear firing lanes, the Thurse pounded the frigate with its ion cannons and batteries, and although the last remaining coralskippers attempted to make suicide runs upon the cruiser-carrier, the fighters were quickly destroyed. The Thurse's assault forced the frigate to give up its pursuit of the Millennium Falcon, and the damaged Yuuzhan Vong vessel fled to hyperspace, leaving the Thurse victorious."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Commanders and crew"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Thurse was commanded by Captain Mak Jorlen during its encounter with the Yuuzhan Vong frigate in the Bilbringi system.
