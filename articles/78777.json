However, before Narec had the chance to finish Ventress' Jedi training, he was shot in the back by a Weequay raider, hired by Kirske.

Later, Ventress, Naa'leth, and Karis attacked Count Dooku and nearly killed him, but he proved too powerful and he used Force lightning and forced them all to the cliff below. They all survived. The reason for this attack was to get Ventress the revenge she longed for."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
