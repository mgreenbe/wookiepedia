At Tipoca City on Kamino, weather vanes were used to give out storm warnings and allow for changes to the inside atmosphere. They had large processor units attached to them on the inside of the building. They were also used on Cloud City, where Luke Skywalker once clung to one following the duel on Cloud City, until he was saved by the crew of the Millennium Falcon. They were part of the city's flotation system and had sensors detecting the velocity of wind and the content of local clouds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
