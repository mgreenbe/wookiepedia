During the Clone Wars, Andor joined an insurrectionist cell backed by the Confederacy of Independent Systems that operated in the wilds of the Outer Rim Territories and fought against the Galactic Republic. Andor saw his first combat experience in this cell as a child soldier in 20 BBY by tossing rocks and bottles at Republic walkers and clone troopers. Sometime during the Clone Wars, when Andor was still young, Andor's father was killed at the Carida Academy during a protest against the expansion of Republic militarism."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Serving the rebellion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to 0 BBY, Andor joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic after being recruited by General Davits Draven.

Throughout his career as an intelligence agent, Andor worked undercover and used several aliases. While working as a government agent on Ord Mantell, Andor went by the name Willix. As a senatorial contact on Darknell, he was Aach. Andor used the name Joreth Sward when he was an assistant to Admiral Grendreef.

He suggested that Cassian the twins Kertas and Rismor, who were renowned for their skill in gathering Imperial intelligence. However, the twins did not speak much, as they conversed via smell. went to Wecacoe to undertake the mission in the Colonies. The world was a backwater, and therefore the team expected limited stormtrooper presence. Upon finding the facility guarded by swarms of KX-series security droids and troopers, Cassian thought about how Rebel Command would have wanted him to turn back, but he continued on to not end up empty handed. The team slipped into a Sewage pipe and entered the Storage facility 47 to find an abandoned Imperial Cruiser. Unfortunately someone must have spotted them entering the tunnels because stormtroopers were looking by the entrance on the cameras. Andor hurried the twins. While they were searching for data, Cassian looked for another way out. Suddenly, an alarm rang out and the team had to run. There were too many troops along the perimeter and so Cassian decided to distract K-2SO and to then shut him down. The droid pinned him, but then the twins shut him down and removed his memory. K-2SO escorted the spies to their ship, but they were soon intercepted by stormtroopers. When they arrived at their ship, they found it surrounded by troopers. Both of the twins ran off, telling him that K-2 had all the info they needed. Suddenly, their ship exploded. Cassian realized that he had to get rid of the base programming to have the droid as an ally, and deleted the last memories. The pair than ran to a ship and hijacked it. Then, Cassian took the droid back to ship to learn the new imperial security protocols."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Mission to the F'tzner system"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following this, Andor and K-2SO were sent to the F'tzner system to undertake a raid on an Imperial freighter. Andor used gas to trick the Empire into thinking that smugglers stole the cargo as smugglers were known to use gas to raid transports. When they got to the cargo room, they found three Wookiees named D'Koetaa, D'Lylaa, and Wyhyatt, and took them instead of the cargo. Andor then took them to the monastery moon of Charissia in the Bartahn sector.

Through Tivik, Andor learned that the Empire had built a superweapon which his informant described as a planet killer. As he continued to try to coax information out of Tivik, two stormtroopers who had become suspicious of the exchange advanced towards them. Cassian feigned getting his scandocs, instead grabbing a blaster and gunning down the two troopers. However, other troopers noticed him and went to alert reinforcements to close down Section 9. Realizing that their clandestine meeting location was also a dead end, Cassian deduced the quickest escape path as Tivik became angry that their cover had been blown. When Andor realized the easiest way out was to climb, he killed Tivik, who was unable to escape the area because of an injured arm, before more stormtroopers could arrive and capture him."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "A new mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Andor was then stationed at the Rebel base on Yavin 4 when Jyn Erso, an Imperial prisoner and former associate of Saw who had just been freed from Wobani, arrived at the base. During a briefing with Mon Mothma, a leader of the Rebel Alliance, General Draven, and Erso, Andor explained that Saw had a prisoner, an Imperial pilot who defected as the behest of Erso's father, Galen, claiming that the Empire was building a superweapon with the power to destroy planets. Erso joined the mission, which Andor led, due to her connection with Saw offering a way to meet with him. As Erso got aboard Andor's U-wing, LMTR-20, Andor was pulled aside by Draven, who told him to keep an eye on Erso due to her reckless and potentially volatile nature as well as to kill Galen Erso instead of capture him. When Cassian returned, he attempted to confiscate the blaster that Erso had armed herself with, but ultimately allowed her to keep it. They then departed to the planet Jedha."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Mission to Jedha"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once he, Jyn, and K-2SO landed outside of Jedha City, he and Jyn left K2 with the ship and proceeded towards the Temple of the Kyber, where they would contact one of Gerrera's Partisans and request a meeting with him. Going to his various sources, the two got stuck in the middle of Tythoni Square, where an Imperial patrol was ambushed by the Partisans, attacking and causing heavy casualties on both sides. When the Imperial TX-225 GAVw \"Occupier\" combat assault tank destroyed a building with several of the Partisans still inside, Andor shot and killed the tank commander. However, when Jyn took cover behind the tank as more stormtroopers arrived, Andor then fired on a Partisan that was about to throw a grenade at the tank, which would have killed Jyn, an act that was noticed by the other Partisans. When the last troopers were eliminated, the Partisans advanced and looted the tank of the stolen kyber. However, Imperial reinforcements, including an AT-ST, soon arrived. As the fight continued, the two escaped and ran into K-2SO.

However, as Andor and his new companions were then immediately captured by Saw's forces, with their leader, Benthic, noting that Andor had killed one of their own. They were taken to Saw's hideout outside the city. While imprisoned, he found the Imperial pilot, Bodhi Rook, and asked him of the location of Jyn's father.

When Rook asked what Cassian would be doing, he sent Rook on his way without offering an explanation. He then watched a meeting between Galen and Director Orson Krennic. After missing several opportunities to take him out, Cassian realized there was more to the situation than what met the eye. He decided there must be another way. However, the Rebellion's Blue Squadron came and attacked the facility. The squadron had been launched by Draven when he lost contact with Cassian following their crash. Rebel X-wings bombed the platform, killing Galen in the process. He made his way to the platform and rescued Jyn, who had ascended the platform to find her father herself, and the group left on a stolen Zeta-class Heavy Cargo Shuttle and returned to Yavin 4."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they proceeded back to base, an angry and sorrowful Jyn confronted Cassian, telling him that she had figured out that he was planning on killing her father. Although Cassian reminded her that he had even chance to pull the trigger and did not, Jyn retorted that he may as well have since he ended up being killed by Alliance forces.

Together, they all took the stolen Imperial shuttle and left for Scarif. Rook was able to use Imperial clearance to pass the Shield Gate that protected the planet and steered the shuttle to landing pad nine. There, the rebels ambushed the two Imperials that came onboard, with Jyn and Cassian taking the uniforms of two Imperial men and sneaking into the base with K-2SO. They reached the area where the plans were kept, while a battle occurred outside as a distraction. During the attempt, K-2SO sacrificed himself by locking them in the facility to avoid their deaths by stormtroopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two of them began to climb to retrieve the plans manually.

Andor often kept quiet and reserved, a trait he had acquired due to his experience in war. Although fighting on the side of the Rebel Alliance, he'd been hardened by war to the point that he did not hesitate to commit morally questionable acts when necessary.

Draven indicated that, since Andor worked for the rebellion since childhood, that the Alliance was like his family and that his loyalty was unwavering. Mothma, however, worried about the terrible things Andor and other Rebel agents were asked to do in the name of the Rebellion.
