In the year 34 ABY, the First Order operative Kylo Ren was treated by an IT-S00.2 on board the Mega-class Star Dreadnought Supremacy after he received a bowcaster wound to his abdomen and a lightsaber wound to his right shoulder and scar across one side of his chest and face during the Resistance attack on Starkiller Base. The droid managed to seal the wound using mechnosutures, but applied bacta therapy too late to prevent scarring."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An IT-S00.2 medical droid first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, which was released on December 15, 2017.
