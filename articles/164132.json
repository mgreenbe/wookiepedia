The ship had a class 1 hyperdrive, an improvement over the class 2 hyperdrive that came with stock YT-1930s. Unlike most transports, the Wild Menagerie had a fully functioning life-support system in the cargo area to facilitate living cargo. The 35-meter-long freighter's capacity allowed for one pilot, one passenger, 200 metric tons of cargo, and four months' worth of consumables. The ship's weapons systems had also been upgraded with a quad laser cannon and a belly gun set to stun. In addition, the Wild Menagerie had upgraded fire control systems and expensive security systems. With all these modifications, the ship was valued at 208,000 credits compared to the 135,000 credits for an unchanged YT-1930."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The YT-1930 light freighter Wild Menagerie was owned by the bounty hunter Zan Ransom.
