Unbeknownst to the children, Amedda in fact no longer held any power within the Empire, and was kept as a prisoner within his own room by troops loyal to the true Imperial leader, Counselor to the Empire Gallius Rax."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A change of plans"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The children surrounded Amedda in his bed and took aim at him with blasters, but when the vizier awoke he simply requested that they get it over with.
