The deep-rooted trees required an alkaline soil in which to grow, and produced a sap that was used for medicinal purposes. The trees were also found off New Canistel, with a small number growing wild on Endor. These were believed by Xenoarborists to be survivors from two Canistel AgriStar freighters that were lost in the Moddell sector. Endor's native Ewoks regarded the tree as holy due to its healing properties, and in 3 ABY, the Warrick family of Ewoks used senoti sap in a medicine administered to the shipwrecked youngling, Cindel Towani. Several senoti trees also grew in the Xenobotanical Garden of Garqi; however, these were burnt down during the first year of the Yuuzhan Vong War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The senoti was a species of tree. Mature senoti had brown, rough, gnarled bark, and could reach a girth several times that of an Ewok. The trees grew deep roots and required alkaline soil in order to thrive. Senoti seeds planted in acidic soil only grew into scrubby plants, if they survived at all. The senoti produced a watery sap, which had analgesic properties and could quell fevers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The senoti was native to New Canistel, a planet of little historic or military significance located in the Demetras sector of the Outer Rim Territories. Several decades before the fall of the Galactic Empire, two Canistel AgriStar X-19 barges carrying senoti seed were lost in the Moddell sector, a region with significant navigational anomalies. Later, several senoti trees were found on the moon Endor, homeworld of the Ewoks, a diminuitive sentient species. Xenoarborists hypothesized that one or both of AgriStar's barges crashed on Endor, distributing the seed. Only a few of these seeds survived in the acidic soil of the moon, including one tree that grew within Ewok territory, near the Bright Tree Village. The Ewoks soon discovered the medicinal properties of senoti sap, and the tree became regarded as a near-sacred healer, used by generations of Ewoks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, a starship crashed on the moon. One of the survivors, a small Human child by the name of Cindel Towani, soon became ill and feverish following exposure to something in the Endorian environment. She and her brother, Mace, were taken in by the Ewok Warrick family, but Cindel soon lost consciousness. The Warrick family administered medicine made of senoti sap to Towani. This initial dose roused Cindel from unconsciousness, but was insufficient to cure all her pain. Consequently, several of the Warricks took Mace to the senoti tree, where they extracted additional sap. Ultimately, this was enough to restore Cindel to full health."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several senoti trees could also be found on the planet Garqi, within the Pesktda Xenobotanical Garden. This garden was dedicated to off-world trees and shrubs, and included a grove of bafforr trees from Ithor. In 25 ABY, during the Yuuzhan Vong War, it was discovered that the Vonduun crab armor worn by the extra-galactic invaders, the Yuuzhan Vong, was allergic to bafforr pollen. In order to hide this militarily significant discovery, the Garqi Resistance burned the entire Xenobotanical Garden, including the senoti trees."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1984, the film Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure, written by George Lucas and directed by John Korty, depicted Ewoks retrieving sap from a tree and administering it to Cindel Towani. This medicine was referenced, although unnamed, in Andy Mangels's The Essential Guide to Characters, published in 1995. In 2002, the tree was named by Craig Carey, Jason Fry and Daniel Wallace in \"Endor and the Moddell Sector,\" a roleplaying game article written for Star Wars Gamer 9. The trees were also referenced in Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds, published in 2004."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
