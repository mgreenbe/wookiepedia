Following a skirmish over Phaegon III in 5000 BBY a the outbreak of the Great Hyperspace War, the Harbinger entered an unstable hyperlane and traveled through time to 41.5 ABY. There, Jedi Master Relin Druur, who had sabotaged the Harbinger during the previous skirmish, met up with Jedi Knight Jaden Korr and salvagers Khedryn Faal and Marr Idi-Shael. The Harbinger's hyperdrive remained inoperable, and Druur wanted to attempt another mission to destroy it's dangerous cargo, a powerful dark side ore known as Lignan. However, he was also motivated by the dark side itself; he wished revenge for the recent death of his Padawan, Drev Hassin, during the skirmish over Phaegon III, as well as on Saes Rrogon, a former apprentice of his who had turned to the dark side and become Harbinger's captain. Idi-Shael helped Druur get aboard the Harbinger and assisted in his infiltration of the ship, before fleeing. Druur then made his way to the Lignan in the ship's cargo hold, where he awaited the arrival of Rrogon. When Rrogon arrived, he engaged the Sith Lord in a duel of Force powers, and Rrogon eventually gained the upper hand, clenching Druur in a Force Choke. Druur, however, called on the power of the Lignan and managed to defeat his former apprentice, finally stabbing Rrogon with Rrogon's own lightsaber. He then continued to draw on the power of the Lignan, allowing it to consume him as he died, finally unleashing it upon the Harbinger. The ship was destroyed in the flames."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
