The clone went with Obi-Wan to create a diversion so Anakin Skywalker and Adi Gallia could rescue Koth. This clone along with CC-2224 and another clone survived long enough to try and capture a fleeing Grievous with a grappling hook and by tackling him. This clone also assisted by chasing after Grievous with Obi-Wan, CC-2224 and the other clone. When they reached the bridge connecting the two ships, it began to break apart and Grievous escaped after a quick fight with both Gallia and Kenobi. When the two ships finally did break apart, the clone was sucked from the ledge he was holding onto and sent into space killing him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
