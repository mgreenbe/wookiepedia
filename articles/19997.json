Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs included a recipe for the dish in his cookbook. He described his version as hearty and rustic. In his recipe, the shaak meat was braised with local fungi and greens, then accompanied by noodles. Tuggs' recipe for Braised Shaak Roast was served at Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo at Black Spire Outpost on the planet Batuu in 34 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Star Wars Legends continuity, shaak pot roast was a dish served at Dexter Jettster's\nrestaurant on Coruscant, Dex's Diner. Braised Shaak Roast was introduced to the new Star Wars canon via the Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo food stand at Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, where it has been available since the opening in 2019. The dish consists of a beef pot roast with cavatelli pasta, wilted kale, and mushrooms. Since its debut, the Galaxy's Edge dish has been renamed to Batuuan Beef Pot Roast. When that name appeared in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: Traveler's Guide to Batuu, Batuuan Beef Pot Roast matched the out-of-universe description of the dish served at Galaxy's Edge, but the in-universe details changed to be made from cows instead of shaak."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A recipe for Braised Shaak Roast is included in the 2019 recipe book Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, written by Marc Sumerak and Chelsea Monroe-Cassel.
