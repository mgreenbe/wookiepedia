At 1 ABY, the spacer talked with the Wookiee Chewbacca and informed him about a potential lead to the power gem at Antipose. It was largely because of this that Chewbacca was delayed in saving Han Solo from would-be assassins of Jabba the Hutt. Afterwards, he contacted Mystra about Han and Chewbacca's impending arrival at Antipose, and started undergoing a laughing fit for all of the bar to hear, indicating that while he was honest about the power gem's existence, he believed that Han and Chewbacca didn't stand a chance at retrieving it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to the other barflies, the spacer rarely laughed unless it was at someone else's expense."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
