Developed in response to both Sith and Jedi using the Force to manipulate soldiers and security personnel, the neural band reinforced various synapses throughout the brain and provided alternate conduits for electrical impulses within the mind, making the wearer's thoughts difficult to affect. Old Republic troopers often nicknamed these devices as 'Little Shocky'."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The neural band proved to be so useful during the Jedi Civil War, that it was even used during the battles of Ruusan thousands of years later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
