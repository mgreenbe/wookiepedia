He and around six hundred Mandalorians were hired by the Galactic Empire to defend a certain planet in an Inner Rim system, with explicit orders to deny it to the New Republic. The Mandalorians seized several trineutronium power plants and threatened to detonate them if New Republic ships started landing, which by doing so would sterilize the entire the planet and kill three billion people."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Princess Leia Organa, accompanied by Han Solo, met with the Mandalorian commander in an asteroid to negotiate their surrender. The meeting lasted two days without any success, with the commander rejecting all advise of surrender. The stalemate was finished when General Lando Calrissian, accompanied by Mandalore Fenn Shysa, took over the negotiations while Organa and Solo left and went to help Luke Skywalker in his campaign against Lord Shadowspawn. Calrissian informed the commander that the Mandalorians won, and the New Republic would honor their terms. But he reminded the commander that with the Imperials gone in the system, the Mandalorians would not be paid for their services. Having softened commander's resolve, Calrissian then proceeded to hire the Mandalorians and deployed them against Shadowspawn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A male Mandalorian was the leader of a group of around six hundred Mandalorian mercenaries during the Galactic Civil War.

When the New Republic moved in to capture the planet\u2014which was rich with mineral resources and overwhelmingly supported the Republic\u2014the Imperials hastily retreated. Before they did, however, the Imperial commanders ordered the Mandalorians to deny the New Republic the planet at all cost. The Mandalorians captured the local trineutronium power plants and threated to detonate them if New Republic ships attempted to land, essentially taking hostage the planet's three billion population. The New Republic organized a meeting on neutral ground, with the New Republic dispatching Princess Leia Organa Solo as their representative."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
