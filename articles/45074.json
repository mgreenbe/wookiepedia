A Star Wars fan, Eric Larson handled much of the design efforts when the PepsiCo food corporation created collectible promotions to coincide with the release of the Special Edition of the original trilogy in 1997. Larson notably created \"Jabba's alphabet,\" a writing system in which coded messages would be written in pizza boxes for Pizza Hut. That alphabet was not used much in canon, but it did appear in the 2002 video game Star Wars: Racer Revenge. The thirthy-fifth issue of the Star Wars Insider magazine featured a four-page interview with Larson."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
