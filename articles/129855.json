The spores were fast acting upon inhalation or contact with the skin, and caused intense drowsiness and sleep. Spore grenades were expensive in comparison to other stun grenades, costing 100 credits, but their effectiveness was second to none, and performed better against more resilient species and creatures, which made them popular for zoological excursions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like the spores of the Czerka manufactured Spore/B stun grenade, the Speizoc grenade's spores could have strange interactions with different body chemistries. However, while rare, there were reports of allergic reactions ranging from temporary to lethal. The spores could also exacerbate preexisting cardiac and respiratory conditions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The spore stun grenade was mentioned in Gadgets and Gear, a roleplaying supplementary sourcebook for the Star Wars Roleplaying series that was published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
