Ascendants using this spell created an illusionary mirror image of the caster. The illusion seemed real to whomever interacted with it.

The illusion appears to have form and substance, and registered as a normal being to droid sensors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Duplicate was one of the most difficult Ta-Ree spells to learn, and required knowledge of number of other spells including block pain, boost senses, cloak presence, detect life, detect Ta-Ree, lessen another's pain, psychokinesis, projective empathy, receptive empathy, and sense life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
