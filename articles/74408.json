Used almost exclusively by the Wookiees, the long-gun's bronzium alloy barrel offered no scope or rangefinder, limiting the weapon to use in short-range combat. The weapon used a 10-shot ammunition clip, and each shot would incur a powerful recoil. The Wookiee leader Tarfful wielded a long-gun during the defense of Kachirho. It weighed 8 kilograms and cost 2,000 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
