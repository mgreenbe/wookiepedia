Although reptomammals in fact had scaly skin yet but had fur instead for warmth, and gave birth to live young or laid their eggs and gave milk to feed their young, some of the species such as the wampas of Hoth could be considered marsupials in terms of their mating process, as their cubs were developed within their mothers' pouches for a period of roughly three months. Similarly, the reptilian Hutts were normally nourished in a brood pouch for the first fifty years of their life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
