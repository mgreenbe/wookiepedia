But when this situation was discovered by Imperial agents planted on Bundim, a brutal crackdown was decided and swiftly launched."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A fleet of Imperial warships tightly blockaded the system, destroying any merchant ship that tried to enter or leave the planet. After several days, Imperial troops, including two battalions of stormtroopers, landed on the planet and, assisted by long-range artillery bombardment, devastated the major cities of the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial attack made Bundim, once the Rebellion's greatest hope in the sector, a gloomy world with no future.
