Due to the fact that they were located near Trade Federation spaceways, their minerals were stolen by the CIS during the Clone Wars, and even some of the residents were used as target practice for General Grievous's droid army. Because of this, the remaining miners bore a great hatred against the cyborg general. They even assisted a group of Jedi deserters to locate Grievous and sneak into enemy territory and assassinate the General."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
