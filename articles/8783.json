The tank had heavy frontal armor that gave it the capability to plow through walls, and it was heavily armed with a payload of 57 shells. The tank required a crew of four battle droids to be fully operated and was able to carry six additional battle droids onto the battlefield. The tank's reactor and power and communications gear were kept in the rear for protection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The vehicle was designed by the Baktoid Armor factories, with its most important parts placed in the back. Piloted by OOM pilot battle droids, AATs comprised a significant portion of the Trade Federation's ground forces. They were used to fight armies of pirates in the Outer Rim Territories before they were finally deployed in the Federation's Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY. Ten years later they would be used heavily during the galactic Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Though AATs did see a little action after the Republic transformed into the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, these instances were very rare."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Armored Assault Tank was a formidable vehicle; it was augmented with heavy inches-thick frontal armor that allowed it to plow through walls, and had heavy weaponry. It carried a payload of 57 shells, but once exhausted, the AAT had to return to its carrier to have its shovel-shaped lower hull completely replaced, fully replenishing its supply."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The AAT's launch tubes could be equipped with a variety of ammunition. The three standard-issue ammunition types were \"bunker-busters\", high explosive shells used for destroying enemy structures such as outposts; armor-piercing shells, used for penetrating heavy armor on tanks; and high-energy shells for anti-personnel and anti-vehicle use. As they were fired, these shells were surrounded by high-energy plasma, which improved their penetration and reduced friction, thus increasing speed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Its crew consisted of four battle droids (one commander, one pilot, and two gunners), and could also carry six B1-Series battle droids on the hand grips on the outside of the tank. The commander typically sat inside the turret of the primary blaster cannon, while the gunners and pilot were positioned in the main hull of the tank. The gunners operated both secondary blasters, and the commander controlled the main turret. The droid's programming allowed for only simple tactics, but the tank was effective nonetheless."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The reactor, along with key power and communications gear, was kept in the rear for protection, as with many other Baktoid vehicles. The AAT used heavy-duty repulsors to keep it off the ground and propel it forward. While this method was relatively quick, it was sluggish compared to the Gian and Flash speeders of the Naboo, and the later GAT. Like other repulsorlift vehicles, the Armored Assault Tank was unable to penetrate deflector shields."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Enemy forces could destroy an Armored Assault Tank by dropping EMP or explosive grenades into both the main turret and the pilot hatch.

When the Invasion of Naboo had started, the AATs had already engaged in fierce combat against armies of pirates, proving that the tank was ready for war. Trade Federation strategy dictated that two AATs escort an MTT."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 32 BBY, the AAT was one of the primary vehicles used in the Trade Federation's invasion of Naboo, and was deployed throughout the city of Theed, where their maneuvers caused damage to many buildings. AATs were instrumental in securing the planet, and fought in other important battles of the invasion. During the course of the invasion, commander OOM-9 ordered the creation of additional units at mech factories. Notably, two Jedi ambassadors stole an AAT to fight their way through Theed to reach Naboo's Queen, Padm\u00e9 Amidala. AATs also battled the Gungan Grand Army on Naboo's open fields. Droid commander OOM-9 led the battle against the Gungans from an AAT. As a result of Anakin Skywalker destroying the Federation's Droid Control Ship, they were left in their final battle positions when the Trade Federation's droid forces were deactivated and were thus captured by the Naboo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A heavy variant of the AAT known as the Heavy AAT also engaged in battle during the Invasion of Naboo.

During the assimilation process, they were all repainted with the CIS standard blue and gray paint scheme and fitted with heavier double laser cannons on the flanking turrets. They would see action during the first battle of the war, and would be used extensively during the Dark Reaper Crisis, as well as the Battle of Muunilinst."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the planet Christophsis, AATs were used under the command of General Whorm Loathsom and many of the tanks were destroyed during the battle by the Republic's AV-7 Cannon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Heavy Artillery Gun, also used during the war, had a design similar to that of the AAT."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the war, they showed vulnerability to PLX-1 portable missile launcher fire, with a single missile from this capable of destroying it if aimed at the correct location. Advanced Recon Commandos also displayed capability of jumping inside the tank and blasting it apart from the inside. Also, they seemed inferior to the Republic TX-130 Saber-class fighter tank."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Second Battle of Geonosis, many AATs were deployed for use by the Geonosian Rebels against the Republic Forces.

George Lucas' original design ideas for the battle tank resembled more of an assault helicopter: a low-flying armored gun. As the design developed, the AAT began to draw more tank-like characteristics, as well as animalistic qualities (the arm-mounted cannons, for instance, suggest claws and horns). The forward curve of the tank was inspired by the design of a shovel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: Battlefront, AATs were going to be part of both the Separatist and the Imperial faction. The Imperial variant was cut from the final version, but its code remained hidden in the game's source.

These files are available for free on several modding sites."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its 2002 expansion pack, AATs serve as the \"mech destroyer\" unit for the Trade Federation.
