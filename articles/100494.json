He was the father of Oola, a Twi'lek girl who spent much of her youth dancing due to his unwillingness to educate her. In 3 ABY, a visitor to the clan's village named Bib Fortuna saw Oola perform and, rather than purchase the dancer from her father as custom demanded, conspired to kidnap her. Fortuna then enslaved the girl as a companion for his Hutt employer, the crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. Oola's father did not see her again, as she was killed by Jabba two days after arriving at his palace on Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Born before 25 BBY, a Twi'lek male was a member of the primitive Ryloth Clan\u2014a small community of natives from the planet of the same name\u2014where he lived in a village built deep in underground warrens. He had a daughter, who was named Oola, a word meaning \"water\" in Twi'leki. By no later than 3 ABY, he became the renowned chief of his eight-hundred-person clan, granting both himself and his family considerable power and influence. Despite this, he provided Oola with little or no formal education, as Twi'lek society held that educating women was a threat to male authority. His daughter instead devoted herself to dancing, which won her dozens of admirers, including a visiting Twi'lek criminal named Bib Fortuna. Clan custom gave Oola's father the right to sell her, but Fortuna had doubts that the chief would agree to this, so he abducted the girl during the night. Afterward, Fortuna enslaved Oola at his Ryloth smuggling complex, and in 4 ABY had her taken to the planet Tatooine as a gift to his master, Jabba Desilijic Tiure. The Hutt crime lord retained the dancer as a concubine in his desert palace for two days before having her killed, more than four months since she'd last seen her father and clan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Society on Ryloth was oppressive toward Twi'lek females, and Oola's father demonstrated this widespread bigotry by restricting her education. Bib Fortuna believed that he might have been unwilling to subject his daughter to a life of slavery, however. Even though Oola's father followed the laws and rules of not educating his daughter he refused to obey the custom of letting Fortuna take his daughter as a slave.
