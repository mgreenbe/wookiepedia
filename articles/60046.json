Garblaque was terrified of being caught up in the conflict, and so decided to set out on a ten-year pleasure cruise aboard the Haven; however, he bankrupted himself in the process of building the ship, and was forced to auction off thousands of seats in order to pay for the ship. The Haven featured marble floors, fur carpets, and massage droids in every cabin, and the smuggler Beryl Thorne heard rumors of a \"wine spa.\" Thorne and the Voidhound tried to acquire tickets to the Haven, but only ended up getting tickets to deck seven, which was reserved for ammonia-breathers and non-humanoids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
