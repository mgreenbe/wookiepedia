An adherent of the Living Force, Jinn always kept his focus in the moment and often clashed with and even openly defied the Jedi High Council. Born in 92 BBY, Qui-Gon Jinn was raised at the Jedi Temple on the galactic capital of Coruscant before being apprenticed at the age of ten to Jedi Knight Dooku. After years of training under Dooku, Jinn achieved the rank of Jedi Knight and\u2014after successfully training a Padawan of his own, a farmer's son named Feemor\u2014became a Jedi Master himself. Shortly after that, Jinn took on a second Padawan, a prodigy named Xanatos, whom Jinn had himself discovered and had brought to the Jedi Temple earlier. Jinn was marveled by his Padawan's prowess so much that he turned a blind eye to Xanatos's flaws, namely his desire for power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Jinn was faced with his Padawan's true nature during a mission to stop a civil war on Xanatos's homeworld of Telos IV. During the mission, Xanatos fell to the dark side of the Force and sided with his father Crion, the power-hungry Governor of the planet, who had orchestrated the insurgency to further his own goals. In order to stop the war, Jinn had to confront Crion, who was accidentally killed in the process. Xanatos fled from the planet, swearing revenge on his Master. Devastated by his apprentice's betrayal, Jinn blamed himself for Xanatos's fall, believing in his inability as a Master and renouncing his earlier success with Feemor. Jinn swore never to take another apprentice, until he crossed paths with a Jedi trainee named Obi-Wan Kenobi during a mission to the planet Bandomeer in 44 BBY. Jinn took Kenobi as his third apprentice, starting their long training together. Over the course of the next twelve years, Jinn and Kenobi participated in numerous missions across the galaxy, most notably fighting side by side against Xanatos, who attempted to exact revenge on his former Master. Ultimately, the fallen apprentice took his own life when cornered by Jinn and his new Padawan on Telos, ending that dark chapter in Jinn's life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 32 BBY, Jinn and Kenobi were assigned by Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum as ambassadors to the Trade Federation, which had recently blockaded the planet Naboo in protest against the recent taxation laws introduced by the Galactic Senate. The Trade Federation, led by Viceroy Nute Gunray, however, attempted to dispose of the Jedi, launching an invasion of Naboo. Escaping to the surface of the planet, Jinn and Kenobi saved the Queen of Naboo, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, agreeing to escort her to Coruscant in order to report the Trade Federation's act of aggression, but their ship's hyperdrive was damaged, forcing them to make a stop for repairs on the lawless world of Tatooine. It was under the twin suns of Tatooine that Jinn discovered Anakin Skywalker, a young slave boy with great Force potential, who helped the Jedi obtain the money to buy the replacement T-14 hyperdrive generator by risking his life at the Boonta Eve Classic podrace. Convinced that the boy was the Chosen One who was supposed to bring balance to the Force, Jinn secured Skywalker's release from slavery and brought him to the Jedi Temple, narrowly escaping from an attack by the Sith Lord Darth Maul in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Believing that Kenobi was ready to become a Jedi Knight, Jinn asked for Skywalker to be assigned as his new apprentice. However, the Jedi Council refused Jinn's request, believing Skywalker to be too old for Jedi training and potentially dangerous. Jinn then accompanied Amidala back to Naboo, helping her to liberate her world from the Trade Federation. During the battle, Jinn and Kenobi faced off against Darth Maul, and the Jedi Master was struck down by the Sith, before Kenobi cut him in half. With his final words, Jinn asked Kenobi to train Skywalker as his Padawan. Following the battle, Kenobi was promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight, and Skywalker was accepted into the Jedi Order. Kenobi fulfilled his promise to his later Master, training Skywalker for the next ten years. Even though Jinn died on Naboo, he continued to have great influence on the future of the Jedi. Having long ago learned how to preserve one's consciousness with the Force, Jinn remained as a Force ghost, eventually passing the secret to Kenobi and Grand Master Yoda. Even though Skywalker fell to the dark side\u2014becoming the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader and leading to the fall of the Galactic Republic, the rise of the Galactic Empire in its stead and the near-destruction of the Jedi Order\u2014he eventually fulfilled the prophecy just as Jinn had foreseen, killing his Sith Master Darth Sidious and returning to the light in his final moments."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life and apprenticeship"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Childhood at the Jedi Temple"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Qui-Gon Jinn was a Human male born in 92 BBY on a terrestrial planet. Within the first six months after his birth, Jinn was identified as a Force-sensitive and was taken from his homeworld to the galactic capital of Coruscant to train at the Jedi Temple and become a Jedi. He maintained some ties with his planet of birth, however, and even obtained a special smooth Force-sensitive stone from his home planet's River of Light as a keepsake, while he was no older than thirteen. At the age of eight, Jinn participated in a training exercise at a Coruscant lake along with his class. The younglings scaled a nearby cliff with cable launchers several times, learning to keep their balance. The trainees were to repeat the same task a week later, albeit without the cable launchers and under the supervision of a Jedi Master as part of their Force training. Jinn, however, did not want to wait for another week and, after everyone else had left, he remained at the lake, contemplating to climb the cliff alone. His thoughts were soon interrupted by a young girl from his class called Tahl, who playfully dared Jinn to race her to the top of the cliff. Jinn tried to use the Force to help him in the ascent, but that day, Tahl felt a deeper connection with the Force and beat Jinn to the top. Although his pride was somewhat hurt, the young Jinn did not show it. He and Tahl then jumped from the cliff into the cool water of the lake, enjoying the refreshing feeling. At that moment, Tahl saw someone coming in their direction. Since the two of them were supposed to be in meditation and not playing in the water, Jinn and Tahl hid behind a rock and saw Grand Master Yoda passing them by. Both barely restrained each other from laughing, and Yoda walked away without noticing the two."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After that incident, Jinn and Tahl vowed to be friends forever. The two indeed became the best of friends over the years, along with other trainees, including Clee Rhara. Jinn and Tahl would often find themselves in arguments that even ended in scraps, but that never hurt their friendship and only made it stronger. At one point during his training at the Temple, Jinn snuck into one of its spires, taking in the cityscape of Coruscant. Fascinated by its beauty, from that day he dreamed to explore the ecumenopolis from bottom to top. On rare occasions, the trainees were permitted to leave the Temple under escort of chaperons, making visits to the Senate Building, the Courts Building and the Municipal Authorities Building. During those early trips to the city, Jinn changed his mind about Coruscant, realizing that much of the planet was artificial, its natural beauty buried long ago by the massive city."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time he was ten years old, Jinn was considered one of the most promising of the Temple's students. During that time, Jinn participated in the Exhibition Day, a tournament among the older Temple students, where they demonstrated their skills to Jedi Masters. The last exercise of the day was a lightsaber tournament; Jinn easily defeated his opponents and made it to the final, where he faced against Tahl. The two engaged in a fierce duel for an extended period of time, gathering a lot of attention from the observing Masters. Ultimately, Jinn was able to defeat Tahl, although after the battle she maintained that she had deserved to win that day. Jinn's lightsaber skills did not go unnoticed, and Jedi Knight Dooku was impressed by Jinn's prowess with the weapon. Craving to achieve perfection by having the best possible Padawan at his side and dreaming of surpassing Yoda as the greatest Jedi alive, Dooku chose Jinn as his apprentice. Dooku was an outspoken and an unconventional teacher, who was barely in his early twenties, and the two had a very distant relationship, Jinn viewing his Master as intimidating and intent on teaching his own future Padawan in a different fashion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their lack of connection, Jinn and Dooku did enjoy some recreational activities together, like playing smashball, with Jinn considering it an easy victory to play against his Master. Shortly after being taken as a Padawan by Dooku, Jinn received a present from his Master\u2014a copy of the third edition of the book called The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, which served as a guide for Jedi trainees. That particular copy of the book had been passed from Master to Padawan in succession; Dooku had received it from his own Master, Thame Cerulian, who had, in turn, received it from Yoda. All three previous owners of the book had made their own notes inside the book, noting their experiences and thoughts on topics presented in the guide. Jinn continued the tradition, continuously making notes in the book while training under Dooku. It was from the guide that Jinn first learned of the Ancient Order of the Whills, a secretive Force-using organization."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Padawan of Dooku"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinn and Dooku participated in a number of missions, going to isolated outposts in the Outer Rim Territories and various dreary planets. As was customary for the Jedi at the time, Jinn and Dooku visited the planet Ilum to collect a lightsaber crystal for Jinn's lightsaber. There, Jinn encountered vicious gorgodon creatures native to the planet. When he was just a little over fourteen years of age, Jinn met Didi Oddo, the owner of Didi's Caf\u00e9 on Coruscant and a well-known informant among the Jedi. Eventually, the two of them became close friends, and, despite Oddo's close connections to the underworld, Jinn trusted him completely. He held no liking for Oddo's cooking, however. By that time, Jinn had achieved much progress in fulfilling his childhood dream, having explored much of Coruscant, yet still not coming close to exploring all of it. During his training, Jinn also encountered a variety of non-Jedi Force-using groups, including the Cruthauses and the Boughtine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Jinn was sixteen, he and Dooku were assigned to escort Senator Blix Annon on a diplomatic assignment. There had been an increase in pirate activity recently, and many senators had been kidnapped while traveling between their homeworlds and Coruscant and had been held for great ransoms. All the kidnappings were performed by the same pirate, whose identity was unknown, and who remained elusive time and again. Annon was an important senator and a friend of the Jedi Order, so when he asked the Jedi for protection, the Jedi Council assigned Jinn and his Master to guard the Senator while he traveled aboard his personal cruiser; not used to luxury in his travels, Jinn was awed by the ship's rich furnishings. During their journey, the Jedi stumbled upon another ship drifting in space and emitting a distress call. A young girl spoke through the comlink, claiming that her name was Joli Ti Eddawan, the daughter of Senator Galim Eddawan from the planet Tyan. She told Jinn and Dooku that her ship had been attacked by the pirate, the pilot and everyone else aboard had been killed, and her father had been taken away. The girl also said that her ship's systems were failing and oxygen level was falling. Dooku, suspecting that this might be a trap laid by the pirate, told Annon's aide Eero Iridian\u2014who was also Dooku's childhood friend\u2014to check Senator Eddawan's current whereabouts. Consulting the cruiser's computer, Iridian found out that Senator Eddawan had indeed been scheduled to arrive at the port station Alpha Nonce the day before, but he never did."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dooku then ordered Annon's pilot to approach the drifting ship slowly and to stay out of its laser cannons' range. Jinn, feeling that the girl was in danger, was willing to go ahead and rescue her, but Dooku was still unsure that the distress call was genuine. Dooku's suspicions turned out to be right, as the other ship suddenly came to life and revealed a battery of previously hidden turbolasers, which opened fire at Annon's cruiser; the pilot was surprised and failed to react, forcing Dooku to grab the controls and pull the cruiser away from the line of fire in the nick of time, and a firefight erupted between the two ships. Annon's cruiser was outfitted with two types of shield\u2014a particle shield that protected against turbolaser fire and an energy shield protecting against laser cannons. Such combination offered good defense but had one major downside, for in order to fire Annon's own laser cannons, the particle shield had to be dropped. Jinn soon noticed that the attacking vessel fired at the cruiser every time the Jedi dropped their particle shield; that required great reflexes and precision on the part of the enemy pilot. The cruiser's energy shield eventually malfunctioned and the armor plating peeled off, allowing the pirate to blast the cruiser's docking bay doors and to land his ship inside. Jinn and Dooku rushed to the docking bay, only to find battle droids rolling from the pirate's craft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two engaged the droids, but the machines used smoke grenades, covering everything in sight with smoke. Suddenly, Joli's voice was heard again, begging the Jedi to rescue her and saying that she was forced by the pirate to stand on his ship's ramp. Despite Dooku's urging not to listen to her, as that was most likely another ruse, Jinn risked his life and fought his way to the ramp to save the girl. Dooku soon caught up with him, and they boarded the pirate ship. Inside, however, they found only a recording rod with Joli's prerecorded voice. Realizing that the pirate had already slipped aboard the cruiser, Jinn and Dooku hurried to a safe room, where Iridian had been supposed to take Annon to in case of any potential danger. Inside the room, they found Iridian lying unconscious and Annon nowhere to be found. Returning to the docking bay, they saw Annon in shackles, being pushed into the enemy ship by the pirate, whose face was hidden behind a helmet. At the same time, the cruiser's systems began to fail because of the damage the ship had sustained during the battle. The two Jedi leaped onto the pirate ship's ramp; Dooku deflected the pirate's blaster shots with his lightsaber and began slowly advancing on him. The pirate, however, performed a maneuver that disoriented Jinn's Master. The pirate managed to slip into his ship and raised the ramp, causing both Jedi to fall on the cruiser docking bay's deck."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the pirate safely retreated with Annon in his custody, Jinn and Dooku were left aboard the crumbling cruiser. First, they checked on Iridian, and after ensuring that his injuries were not fatal, they went to help the cruiser's pilot. Jinn managed to repair the cruiser's sublight mainframe control, allowing the pilot to land the ship on Voltare, a nearby spaceport planet. Having delivered Iridian to a local medical clinic, the two Jedi returned to the ship and started planning their next course of action. Standard procedure dictated that they should contact the Council, but Dooku\u2014having recognized the pirate as Lorian Nod, his fellow Jedi trainee and former friend at the Jedi Temple\u2013turned bitter rival\u2014decided to proceed with the investigation without consulting the Council, unwilling to admit to the Council members that Nod had outwitted him. Jinn was not told about Dooku's discovery either and was even ordered to maintain comlink silence. Although Dooku did not tell him about Nod, Jinn still felt anger emanating from his Master. Analyzing the battle on the cruiser, both Jedi noted that although Annon had claimed that his equipment had been of the highest possible quality, the energy shield had failed, and the armor had began to peel off after taking only minor damage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinn and Dooku concluded that the cruiser's systems had been sabotaged, and the pirate had been aware of the fact. Upon checking the reports of all the other kidnappings, Dooku noted that in all cases, pilots had reported various malfunctions on their ships. Deciding to check where Annon's cruiser had been outfitted with the security devices, Jinn and Dooku visited Iridian in the clinic, who told them that the cruiser's upgrades had been done by the renowned Kontag corporation. Dooku raised Kontag's officials on the comlink, but they did not tell much. Jinn's Master decided to infiltrate the company's headquarters on the planet Pirin, and the two Jedi soon arrived there. Lying to the company's representative, Sasana, that the Jedi Order was considering a purchase of security upgrades from Kontag, Jinn and Dooku asked her to show them the Kontag factory. Having thoroughly inspected the facility, the Jedi noticed signs of both prosperity and decline. A large client base was maintained, but little to no actual work was being done in the facility. Dooku realized that the Pirin factory was just a sham, and the real work was being done elsewhere. Analyzing a sensor suite he had taken from a Kontag landspeeder during the tour, he found a factory mark buried in it, which pointed to Von-Alai, a once-icy planet transformed into a barren wasteland by the toxic waste produced by a vast number of factories."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Knighthood"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After they reached Von-Alai and entered the factory, Jinn, to his shock, discovered that child labor was being practiced there, which was forbidden by the Republic laws. Jinn tried to convince his Master that they had to help the children, but Dooku was preoccupied only with their mission. Confronting one of the factory's managers, Dooku threatened him with a promise to report all the violations he had seen and to shut down the production. Under those threats, the man revealed the name of the corporation that owned the factory, Caravan, which Dooku recognized as the name of Nod's model ship he had built at the Temple. As Jinn and Dooku turned to leave the factory, they were surprised to find Iridian waiting for them, who claimed that he had followed them in order to help them find Annon. The aide said that he had found a worker who might know where the pirate's hideout was. The Jedi followed Iridian, but the aide wandered away and disappeared, and the Jedi were instead confronted by several Eradicator-series battle droids. The Jedi ignited their lightsabers, but after Jinn realized that a battle inside the factory could harm the children who were working there, he deactivated his weapon. Dooku was determined to fight, however, and Jinn had to convince his Master to stand down. Grudgingly, Dooku followed his Padawan's example, and both Jedi were taken into custody by the battle droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinn and Dooku were drugged, taken to an unknown location, and handcuffed to the floor. After Jinn awoke from the effects of the drug, Dooku finally decided to tell him about Nod. Jinn was puzzled and disappointed that his Master had withheld such important information from him, but he tried not to show his feelings. Remembering Iridian's sudden disappearance, Dooku also realized that his friend had been in league with Nod all along; Iridian hoped to use the money raised from the kidnappings to finance an election campaign for the post of senator. At that moment, Nod himself showed up, and Jinn accused him of using children to work for him. Nod casually replied that the children were the only ones who could support their families, and if he were to fire them, they would starve, but Jinn was not satisfied with this answer, believing that there was another way. Nod further explained that he had been kidnapping senators just to earn some money and to retire peacefully. Iridian then burst in, accusing Nod of killing Annon; the Senator had just died of a heart attack. The two began to argue, and the panicking Iridian pulled out his vibroblade. Dooku, however, used the Force to pull the vibroblade out of Iridian's hands and used it to cut loose of his cuffs. Jinn's Master then Force-pulled his lightsaber that was stored nearby and attacked Nod, while Iridian fled from the site. Defending with a blaster and his own vibroblade, Nod slowly moved toward Jinn's lightsaber\u2014which was also kept close\u2014and grabbed it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Dooku and Nod engaged in a lightsaber duel, Jinn, still tied and helpless, cried for his Master to release him. Dooku, however, was too enraged and immersed in the battle and did not hear his Padawan's pleas. Only when he was ready to deal a fatal blow did Dooku hear Jinn's desperate cry and stop his hand. He finally released his apprentice, and they took both Nod and Iridian into custody. The two returned to Coruscant, not speaking a single word on their return journey. After handing the two criminals to Coruscant security, Dooku told Jinn to learn one lesson from their mission\u2014that the day would come when his friends would betray him. Unbeknownst to the Jedi, the plot to replace Annon with Iridian had been secretly instigated by Darth Tenebrous, the current Dark Lord of the clandestine Order of the Sith Lords. The replacement of Annon was to be another step in the Grand Plan, the imperative designed by the Dark Lords to bring the galaxy under Sith control. Although Jinn and Dooku had unknowingly foiled that particular scheme of the Sith, they did not find out about Tenebrous's involvement in Annon's kidnapping."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, Jinn and Dooku embarked on their final mission as Master and apprentice. The mission lasted for two years, and it was difficult and dangerous. Exhausted and weary, the two returned to the Jedi Temple, where Jinn was ready to undergo his Jedi Trials. At the landing platform, Jinn was greeted by Tahl, and the two friends shared a warm embrace, which irritated Dooku, who had stopped believing in sincere friendship a long time ago. As they walked together to meet the Jedi Council, Dooku commended Jinn on being a great Padawan, but he also said that Jinn had one major flaw, namely his trust and connection to other people. Dooku reminded Jinn that in the end, he would always be alone, and that betrayal was inevitable. Around 72 BBY, Jinn was granted the rank of Jedi Knight. After the knighting ceremony, Jinn kept his Padawan braid, preserving it with his copy of The Jedi Path. Although he stopped making notes in the guide, Jinn made sure to keep it safe to pass it eventually to his own apprentice. Tahl also became a Jedi Knight, although their Jedi duties prevented them from seeing each other for years, and they only heard of each other's promotion. After Jinn was knighted, he kept very little contact with Dooku, viewing their past relationship strictly as that of a Master and his Padawan. Although he respected Dooku's training, he did not heed his Master's final lesson, unwilling to live without trust and friendship."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The fall of Xanatos"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Attaining Mastery"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his first year as a Jedi Knight, Jinn and three companions were exposed to a theta storm. Jinn survived by luck, while the three with him failed to reach shelter in time and died slow, excruciating deaths over the course of two days. At some point in his life, Jinn saw the giant trees in the Silver Forest of Dreams on the planet Kubindi. Their leaves reached up to twenty meters in width, and they floated like giant rafts when they fell. When Yoda suggested that he take a Padawan learner, Jinn chose not to rush things and contemplate on that, in the meantime performing solo missions for the Order. During his travels, around 66 BBY, Jinn discovered a three-year-old Force-sensitive boy from the planet Telos IV named Xanatos\u2014the son of Crion, the wealthiest man on Telos. Jinn performed Xanatos' midi-chlorian count, finding out that the boy exhibited strong connection with the Force. Although he did not want to part with his child, Crion allowed his son to be taken away, and Jinn, after some hesitation, brought Xanatos to the Jedi Temple for training. Xanatos proved to be a brilliant student, one of the most promising trainees to come to the Temple in many years, but his brash personality and desire for power led him to clash frequently with other students and caused Yoda to express concerns about him.

Before making a final choice, the Jedi Knight decided to undertake one more mission. He made a stopover at the barren world of Zekulae, where he was waiting for his transport. Stopping at a caf\u00e9 to have a drink, Jinn witnessed an argument between a local Zeku and a Human, whom he recognized as Tahl, who were playing sabacc. Tahl claimed that the Zeku had cheated; the latter was angered by the statement and reached for his weapon. Jinn did not want to endanger Tahl's mission by intervening and waited to see how the situation would resolve. Tahl easily disarmed the Zeku and, after ordering her opponent a drink, she noticed Jinn and joined him. The two talked for some time, remembering their time at the Temple, and Jinn told her that he was thinking about taking Xanatos as his apprentice. Tahl advised Jinn to consider his decision carefully, believing that he and Xanatos were not the best match. Returning to her mission, Tahl then left the caf\u00e9.

In 53 BBY, when Xanatos was sixteen, Jinn and his Padawan were sent on a mission to stop a tyrant from overtaking a world in the Outer Rim Territories.

During that time, Jinn and Xanatos were joined by Jinn's first Padawan, Feemor, in a training duel at the heart of the Jedi Temple. Feemor and Xanatos both attacked Jinn but could not breach his defense. Xanatos then told Feemor to attack from Jinn's left side. Although the Jedi Master repelled the attack, it made him lose the grip on his lightsaber, allowing Xanatos to knock it out of Jinn's hands and win the fight. Xanatos boasted about his victory, priding in his noble ancestry and stating that Feemor had been destined to lose the duel due to his humble origins. Jinn was forced to reprimand Xanatos and console Feemor. After Feemor left, Tahl entered the training grounds, saying that Yoda had sent her to escort Jinn and Xanatos to the Council chamber to receive a new assignment, a mission to the Telos system.

Xanatos protested against going to his homeworld, saying that the Council should send a diplomat like Dooku there instead, but Yoda told him that if he was not ready to undertake the mission then the Council would assign Tamarik to Jinn instead of him. As Jinn and Xanatos parted ways with Tahl and Tamarik and were going down on a set of stairs from the Council tower, Xanatos suddenly leaped over the edge and landed on a thin pole.

However, Jinn also sensed that a person \"who was a Jedi, and at the same time not yet a Jedi,\" had been somehow involved in Liora's death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, aboard the New Citadel Station surrounding Telos, the four Jedi attended the mourning ceremony for Liora. During the ceremony, Jinn and Tahl shared their experiences on the planet. Jinn told Tahl about his investigation of the murder scene, while Tahl, who had recently survived an attack by a group of insurgents, told him that one of the escaping rebels was dressed as an Antarian Ranger, a member of the special forces that trained with the Jedi and who were based nearby on the planet Toprawa. Tahl also said that she did not want Tamarik as her Padawan. Xanatos left the New Citadel Station with Nason, his sister, whom he had met during the ceremony, while Jinn joined Crion in his shuttle. When Crion expressed his grief over the fact that Xanatos was lost to him, Jinn stated that when Xanatos became a Knight, he could be assigned to Toprawa to the Antarian Rangers, and Crion could see his son more often. During the conversation, Crion called the Antarian Rangers \"mercenaries,\" which Jinn found odd as the Rangers did not have such reputation. Back at their apartment, Xanatos, who had overheard Jinn and Tahl's conversation about Tamarik, once again had an outburst. Now aware that Tahl did not want Tamarik as her apprentice, he felt that Yoda had planned from the start to leave him on Telos and to have Jinn train the girl instead.

Instead, Jinn began his own investigation. He disguised himself as an elderly arms dealer and contacted the insurgents, telling them that he had a shipment of weapons he needed to move. Jinn hoped to meet an insurgent leader named Welleques, but his contact turned out to be a young man named Pon, who escorted him to a supposed meeting place with Welleques. Focused on maintaining his disguise and scrambling the boy's thoughts with the Force, Jinn did not notice two more insurgents, who had recognized him as a Jedi, until they told him not to move. A fight broke out, but Jinn soon emerged victorious, killing the two attackers and leaving only Pon. He used the Force to assure the young man that nothing untoward had happened and told him that he would take the \"arms dealer\" to Welleques that night.

During the fight, Nason was killed and Dairoki rushed to her side, attacking his own men. The insurgents were soon defeated, but Dairoki retreated. When Jinn asked Tahl if she had known of the attack when she called for a meeting, she replied that she had not and had intended to tell Jinn that she was being recalled from Telos to the Landor system to confront the local pirates who had captured the pilot Stieg Wa. Tamarik was to remain with Jinn, since Landor was considered too dangerous for her. After the attack, An Devi confronted Jinn, showing him a lightsaber they had found near one of the dead insurgents\u2014left there on purpose by Dairoki\u2014and accusing the Jedi of withholding the information regarding the involvement of the Rangers. Jinn replied that he did not have all the information yet and said that he would try to find more details."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Xanatos defied his Master; instead of helping him in the investigation, he went to his father to protect him, telling Jinn to take Tamarik with him instead in his continuing investigation.

As they drew their blasters, Jinn tore off his disguise and attacked the band, killing everyone except for Welleques. He grabbed Welleques and asked him if the Antarian Rangers were involved in the insurgency, and the man told him that the entire corps was indeed involved. Before Welleques could tell more, he was killed by a shot in the head fired by the Antarian Ranger from a roof. When Jinn reached the spot the Ranger had stood on, the sniper was already gone. Crion was quick to make the news of the Antarian Rangers' involvement in the insurgency public, claiming that their involvement was part of a larger conspiracy involving the Toprawan government. All diplomatic ties to Toprawa were suspended and all citizens of Toprawa currently on Telos were told to leave the planet. Crion's chief of staff additionally claimed that the Rangers had been implicated by agents working with the government, hinting at the Jedi on Telos.\nWhen Jinn confronted Xanatos regarding those accusations, Xanatos replied that he was certain that the insurgency would soon fade away. Jinn did not think so and apologized to Xanatos for asking him to keep secrets from his father. Xanatos once again got mad at Jinn, telling his Master that he never wanted to come back to Telos, and he asked Jinn to find Nason's killer, so that they could go back to Coruscant. Xanatos then left Jinn and moved in to live with his father at his palace for the rest of their stay. Soon enough, Crion announced that the people of Telos should react to the increased acts of insurgency. Conflicts among the population erupted, sparking the civil war on Telos.

Dairoki, no longer wanting to take part in the insurgency after the death of his love, Nason, had come to An Devi and revealed that Crion had been, in fact, manipulating the insurgents. He had played on the Telosian population's feeling of nationalism, planting links between the Antarian Rangers and the local insurgents, so that the people of Telos, convinced of offworld intervention, would surely not forgive the rebels. Crion's goal had been the escalation of violence in order to strengthen his rule, and he had achieved it with the civil war raging on the streets.

Determined to protect the young Padawan, Jinn struck Crion with his lightsaber, making him lose his balance and fall into a pool of hot embers located at the lower level of the palace. The Jedi Master followed the governor there, trying to wake him as he landed, but Crion was already dead. Enraged by his father's death, Xanatos attacked Jinn, knocking his Master's lightsaber out of his hands; the weapon fell into the fiery ashes and was destroyed. Xanatos confronted the defenseless Jinn, who tried to plead with his Padawan, but the boy had fallen to the dark side of the Force and did not listen. Having regained her lightsaber, Tamarik tried to protect Jinn, but Xanatos easily parried her attacks. Jinn then Force-pulled Tamarik's lightsaber and engaged Xanatos in a duel.

However, the crowd proceeded directly to Crion's body, carrying it away as a trophy. During that proceeding, Jinn had lost sight of Xanatos, who disappeared into the crowd and escaped. With Crion's death, the civil war on Telos IV came to an end, and the last insurgent groups were ready to lay down their weapons. Deeply affected by the loss of his Padawan, Jinn did not contact the Council with a report for a long time. When he finally did, the Council promised to provide him with a Kaiburr crystal, a powerful Force relic, so that he could build a new lightsaber to replace the one he had lost on Telos. Jinn lied to the Council members regarding Xanatos's fate, telling them that his Padawan had died in an attack on Crion's palace.

He vowed never to take another apprentice, but as the Jedi Council kept asking him to reconsider his decision, he came to the Temple every year. There, he spent a few hours watching the pupils, and then he left alone. Tahl tried to comfort Jinn by accompanying him on a training exercise to the world of Ragoon VI to hopefully relax and take his mind off Xanatos.

The issue revolved around the proposed construction of an Aqualish-manufactured hyperwave repeater in Celanon space. The repeater would expand the reach of the HoloNet galactic communications grid into the Corporate Sector, a vast region of space located at the galaxy's Tingel Arm.

After four hours of negotiations that led to nothing, Vemec called for a break. Jinn, Dooku, and Sifo-Dyas were then approached by Hego Damask, who expressed concern that in the absence of any resolution, the outlying systems would suffer the most.

Although Jinn still did not agree with Damask's methods, he ended the conversation, leaving the Muun to talk to Masters Dooku and Sifo-Dyas. Little did Jinn know that Damask was, in reality, the Sith Lord Darth Plagueis, the current heir to the Order of the Sith Lords.

He was intercepted by SonTag on his way, who informed him that the meeting place had been changed to a more formal one. Jinn and SonTag soon arrived at the receiving room, where they met with VeerTa and Clat'Ha, the latter acting as a representative of the Arcona. The representative of Offworld came soon afterward, and he turned out to be none other than Xanatos himself. Xanatos displayed a very friendly demeanor, acting as though he was glad to see Jinn, calling him an old friend. Xanatos admitted that he had went astray from the Jedi path, but he had changed since joining Offworld. He assured VeerTa that Offworld would not interfere with the Home Planet's operation and even offered to donate ten percent of his company's income to the Bandomeer reclamation effort. Jinn did not trust his former apprentice, and neither did Clat'Ha, but SonTag and VeerTa appeared to believe Xanatos' words. Suddenly, an explosion somewhere outside rocked the meeting. Looking out of the window, Jinn saw smoke coming from the Home Planet Mine. Accusing Xanatos of orchestrating the explosion, VeerTa lunged at him, but Jinn stopped her, knowing that a fight would not help them find the truth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xanatos assured everyone that Offworld had nothing to do with the explosion, and SonTag's eventual investigation appeared to prove his words, as it was found out that a mixture of gases had built up and special sensors had failed to warn about it. In an unexpected gesture, Xanatos offered Offworld's money to help rebuild the mine. Still, Jinn sensed that Xanatos was not being sincere and was playing some kind of game. Later, Jinn was contacted by Kenobi, who had found a secret Offworld stash of mining supplies on AgriCorps' territory. The door to the storage had been protected by the Force, and inside Kenobi had found a box with a symbol in the form of a broken circle. Kenobi suspected that Offworld was up to something, but Jinn saw no proof that Offworld was interfering with the AgriCorps operation and ordered the boy to return to his duties. Meanwhile, Offworld kept their promise and provided money and droids, and the Home Planet Mine was quickly being rebuilt. Moreover, it was discovered that the explosion had blasted deeper into the ground, revealing a vein of ionite, one of the most valuable minerals in the galaxy. VeerTa proposed to show Jinn the ionite and took him to one of the mine's underground levels, labeled Core 6. Remembering his nightmare, Jinn asked if there was a Core 5, but VeerTa replied that they did not have the technology to dig that deep."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "VeerTa later told Jinn about her plan to use Offworld's donated money to secretly mine ionite instead of rebuilding the mine. In case Offworld tried to undermine them, she asked Jinn to join the Home Planet Mine's board of directors, believing that Offworld would not go against a Jedi. As it was forbidden for members of the Jedi Order to participate in any profit-bringing operation, Jinn had to decline. He asked VeerTa about the box Kenobi had told him about, and she replied that she had seen similar boxes in other Enrichment Zones, but she believed them to be some sort of AgriCorps equipment. Jinn was still worried by Kenobi's discovery and decided to begin an investigation, starting by checking what position Xanatos held in Offworld. The official files, however, showed only mere figureheads and had no mention of Xanatos, so Jinn decided to infiltrate Offworld's headquarters and to look for information there. Using a mind trick on a Hutt guard, he secured passage to Xanatos' office. He browsed through several datafiles, but most of them were encrypted, and those that were not contained no useful information. However, Jinn also saw the logo of Offworld, formed by two broken circles, and he realized that Xanatos was not simply an Offworld employee\u2014he was the head of the corporation. Based on that information, Jinn began to suspect that Xanatos was planning to take over Bandomeer. Returning to his quarters, he contacted Yoda, informing him of his suspicions. Yoda, however, only made Jinn question his unwillingness to let Kenobi help him in his investigation. Yoda's words made Jinn realize that he had been wrong, and he tried to raise Kenobi on the comlink, but the latter did not respond."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that moment, Clat'Ha burst in Jinn's quarters, telling him that Si Treemba had contacted her with information that Kenobi had disappeared. Si Treemba had seen only that the unconscious Kenobi had been dragged by Offworld guards in an unknown direction, but Jinn was certain that Xanatos had personally orchestrated the boy's kidnapping. Jinn knew that Xanatos was overseeing an Offworld mining operation at the outskirts of Bandor. Hoping to take advantage of his former apprentice's overconfidence and prove his guesses, he waited until Xanatos had left the administration building and confronted him outside. Jinn conversed with Xanatos, making him lose his temper and admit that he was heading Offworld and was planning to overtake Bandomeer. Xanatos also revealed that he had kept his lightsaber even after leaving the Order, and he attacked Jinn with it. During their fight, Xanatos armed himself with a second lightsaber, the one that Jinn recognized as Kenobi's. Jinn realized that Xanatos had indeed kidnapped the boy and therefore decided to break the fight and rescue Kenobi. He grasped the boy's weapon out of Xanatos' hands and retreated, while Xanatos laughed in his back. Jinn went to Si Treemba to see if he could tell anything else about Kenobi's capture, but the young Arcona had seen only as Kenobi had been dragged away from the Enrichment Zone's dome during the night."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, one of the Meerians working at the Enrichment Zone, RonTha, admitted that he had broken protocol and remained in the dome that night to pick some fruit in the orchard. After seeing Kenobi being taken away by several people led by a cloaked figure, he had followed them and had seen them taking a boat. Upon hearing that information, Si Treemba realized that Kenobi had been taken to the deepsea mines, and Jinn persuaded RonTha to give him a boat to go there. As Jinn crossed the Great Sea of Bandomeer and approached the mines, he witnessed a group of guards pushing Kenobi with electro-jabbers toward the sea, having caught him trying to find another box with the broken circle logo and attempting to inspect its contents. As the guards pushed the boy from the edge, Jinn saw someone at a lower platform quickly fashion some kind of a sling. As Kenobi was falling, Jinn saw that he did not display fear and was determined to meet his end as a Jedi. Jinn used the Force to help Kenobi fall into the sling, and once the boy did, he was grabbed and taken to the lower platform by a long-armed creature. Jinn parked his boat and soon met with Kenobi and the creature, whom the boy introduced as his new friend, a Phindian named Guerra. Kenobi explained to Jinn that he and Guerra were both wearing electro-collars that would blow them up if they were to leave the mine. Jinn temporarily deactivated Kenobi's collar with the Force, but before they could deactivate Guerra's collar as well, Offworld guards attacked them, and the Jedi were forced to retreat, but not before Guerra told them that the transmission signals for the collars were being emitted from a security office at the Bandor harbor.

That led Jinn to finally tell the story of Xanatos' fall to Kenobi. Reaching mainland, the two Jedi stormed the security office where the transmitters were located and deactivated Guerra's and Kenobi's collars. When Jinn tried to take the collar off Kenobi, however, he was unable to do so. He tried to cut it with his lightsaber set on low power, but it did not work either. Unwilling to risk the boy's life by trying a higher setting, Jinn gave the boy the transmitter linked to his collar for safekeeping, and decided to try to take the collar off in Bandor. The two set off to the capital city to confront Xanatos, taking a security landspeeder. However, they were followed by Xanatos himself in another landspeeder, who attacked them with laser cannons. Jinn maneuvered his speeder, but he and Kenobi were eventually forced to disembark and take shelter inside the Home Planet Mine. Jinn realized that Xanatos was leading them into a trap, but he also believed that he needed to foil whatever plan Xanatos had prepared. Jinn hoped to use a newly fixed turbolift to go to what they believed was the lowest level of the mine, Core 6, thinking that Xanatos did not know that the lift was operational. Jinn planned to circle Xanatos and escape, and the two Jedi soon reached Core 6."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xanatos, however, emerged from a tunnel which should have been blocked according to VeerTa. Kenobi engaged Xanatos, forcing him to retreat further into the mine, with the two Jedi hot on his trail. As they followed Jinn's former pupil, the Jedi noticed that they were going deeper into the mine. Kenobi was hesitant to pursue Xanatos further, but Jinn believed that it was too late to turn back. The two eventually reached a glowing sign that read Core 5, and Jinn realized that VeerTa had lied to him and had been in league with Xanatos all along. The lights suddenly went out and Xanatos attacked the two Jedi. They dueled for some time, but eventually Xanatos retreated in a turbolift, while all the exits suddenly shut close. Xanatos gloated on the comlink, saying that he had recreated the conditions of the first explosion, and that the gases were building up for a blast even more powerful than the first one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two Jedi found themselves trapped inside Core 5, just like in Jinn's nightmare. Believing that an explosion could break open one of the sealed doors, Kenobi was intent on triggering his collar and killing himself so that Jinn could escape, but Jinn did not allow it, believing that there was another way. Jinn was nevertheless astonished by Kenobi's bravery and even inadvertently called him his Padawan. Noticing a broken circle symbol on the door, Jinn used the Force to connect the circle, and the door opened. He and Kenobi raced back up the tunnel to the turbolift, as an emergency signal advised them to evacuate, but then Jinn noticed one of the boxes with the broken circle symbol nearby. Remembering that Xanatos always made sure to have a back-up plan, he inspected the box and found out that it contained an ion bomb, a powerful explosive device equipped with a precise ion clock. Jinn realized that Xanatos had lied about the gases building up; instead, he had planted the bombs throughout Bandomeer and was intent on destroying the entire planet just to have his revenge and kill Jinn. The bombs were chain-linked, however, meaning that if one of them was deactivated, the rest would not go off. Jinn believed that he would be able to disarm the bomb, but there was little time for him to do so."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinn reflected on Xanatos' desire to kill him out loud, surprised that it even eclipsed his fallen student's craving for wealth, as the explosion would also destroy all the ionite. After Jinn mentioned ionite, however, Kenobi remembered something, quickly gathered several ionite slabs, and put them around the bomb; the bomb's timer then stopped, leaving Jinn enough time to disarm the explosive. Kenobi then told Jinn that while he had been imprisoned in the deepsea mines, he had learned from Guerra that ionite carried a neutral charge, making most instruments in the vicinity freeze. After Jinn deactivated the bomb, the two returned to the governor's office, where Jinn revealed to SonTag that VeerTa had been in league with Xanatos. VeerTa claimed that she had done so in favor of Bandomeer, believing that Offworld's secret backing would be profitable for the Home Planet Mine. She had helped Xanatos to smuggle boxes with explosives to the planet, but she did not know of their contents, and she was surprised to know that Xanatos had tried to destroy the entire planet. VeerTa was taken into custody, and Jinn and Kenobi returned to their quarters, where Jinn discovered another note written by Xanatos, who had left it in case Jinn survived his trap. In the note, Xanatos promised his former Master that they would meet again. Upon reading that note, however, Jinn did not feel anything beyond determination to fight Xanatos' evil, having finally overcome his psychological issues in the course of the mission.

The pair were to go to the planet Gala to oversee political elections there. For a long time, Gala had been ruled by the Beju-Tallah dynasty that had managed to unite the planet's three peoples\u2014the city people, the hill people, and the sea people\u2014and had brought prosperity to the planet. However, the dynasty had then become corrupt, stripping the planet of its wealth and leaving the people on the brink of revolution. The dying Queen Veda realized that, and instead of giving the throne to her rightful heir and son, Prince Beju, she decided to organize an open election. The Prince, however, was not happy with the Queen's decision, believing that it was his birthright to rule the planet. Therefore, Jinn and Kenobi were to oversee that the election went smoothly and to prevent any possible interference from Beju. On the day of Kenobi's thirteenth birthday, they were ready to embark on the mission. Moving through the streets of Bandor, the two reached a hangar where a ship awaited them, and Jinn decided to drill Kenobi in a Jedi exercise, \"Attention to the Moment Gives Knowledge,\" which involved Kenobi closing his eyes and reciting by memory everything he had just seen to the tinniest detail."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi made a slight mistake, however, and Jinn realized that the boy was distracted with thoughts about his birthday; Kenobi believed that Jinn had forgotten about it. The Jedi Master had not, and he reached for his pocket, giving Kenobi his special stone as a present. The boy was baffled by the seemingly useless gift but accepted it with gratitude. Jinn also asked his Padawan if he had taken time to reflect on his past as all Padawans were required to in accordance with Jedi tradition, and Kenobi honestly replied that he had not. Jinn and Kenobi then boarded the starship that was waiting for them, finding out that it was piloted by a Phindian, who reminded Kenobi of Guerra. For some reason, the pilot behaved rudely toward the Jedi, which surprised them. The Phindian then raised ship and set a course for Gala. Jinn and Kenobi reflected on the friends they were leaving on Bandomeer, namely Si Treemba, Clat'Ha, and Guerra, but the Phindian pilot, irritated by their conversation, purposefully shook the ship, and the Jedi opted to remain quiet for the rest of the journey. Soon enough, the ship jumped to hyperspace, leaving Bandomeer behind. Halfway to Gala, however, a warning signal began to blink on the pilot's console, and the pilot told the Jedi that there was a fuel leak and they had to land on the nearest planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once they returned to realspace and set course to a nearby planet, the three were contacted via comlink; a voice ordered them to identify themselves or be destroyed. When the Phindian pilot requested an emergency landing, the person they were talking to denied the request. Jinn asked the Phindian if there were other planets nearby, but the pilot replied negatively. At that moment, starfighters appeared to escort the Jedi's ship to the planet. The pilot wanted to fight them, but Jinn decided that it was best to comply. Under the escort, the pilot landed their starship on a landing platform, where a detachment of battle droids awaited them. Jinn believed that the battle droids would not harm them, but when the Jedi emerged from the ship, the droids opened fire. Jinn and Kenobi quickly dealt with the droids, but upon returning to the ship, they found that the control console had been hit by blaster fire and disabled. Moreover, the communications were jammed, and the Phindian pilot was nowhere to be found. Realizing that their landing on the planet was not an accident, Jinn came to believe that the pilot would find them himself. The Jedi then proceeded to a nearby city. Observing that the planet was populated by Phindians, and taking into account that they were close to Gala before the emergency landing, Jinn correctly concluded that the Jedi were on Phindar, more specifically, in its capital city, Laressa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It soon became evident to the Jedi that something was wrong in Laressa; all the shops were closed, assassin droids were everywhere, and all the Phindians appeared afraid of something. Some of the Phindians looked especially strange; their faces displayed nothing and there was only blackness in their eyes. The Jedi also saw a group of Phindians dressed in metallic silver coats, who passed them by, and the locals were quick to step out of their way. Then, a gold landspeeder appeared, carrying two golden-robed figures surrounded by dark-side aura. Jinn and Kenobi quickly hid in an alley to avoid being detected and decided to go to the market. Once there, they saw a single shop opening and offering bread. As the mass of Phindians rushed to the shop, Jinn and Kenobi almost lost each other in the confusion, but they were suddenly approached by their pilot, who told them to follow him.

Guerra introduced the Jedi to the pilot\u2014his brother, Paxxi Derida. Paxxi revealed that he had deliberately dumped all the fuel from their starship in order to lure the Jedi to Phindar. The Derida brothers told Jinn and Kenobi that there was a death warrant placed on their heads by the Syndicat, the organization that controlled the planet, for organizing a black market. The Syndicat was controlled by the gangster Baftu and his associate Terra, the two persons that the Jedi had seen in the gold landspeeder. According to the Deridas, the people on the streets who did not display any emotions were \"the renewed,\" people whom the Syndicat considered enemies. Those people had been mind-wiped and stripped of all their memories; most of the renewed were sent off-planet, while others were released to roam Phindar, and members of the Syndicat placed bets on how long those people would survive. After hearing that story, Jinn was outraged at such injustice. The brothers went on to tell the Jedi that the apparent food shortage had been faked by the Syndicat as a means to control the Phindians. Guerra and Paxxi, however, knew where the Syndicat was keeping the supplies, and as such, asked the Jedi to help them steal those goods, claiming that they had a key to the vault and that they intended to use those supplies to show the Phindians that the Syndicat was depriving them of food.

The group tried to lose their pursuers by jumping from one roof to another, until they ran into a Phindian female, Kaadi, a member of the resistance against the Syndicat and the daughter of the caf\u00e9's owner Nuuta, who had been renewed and had been sent to the planet Alba-16. Kaadi informed the four that the Syndicat had increased security both because they knew of the Jedi and the Deridas' presence on the planet and because they were expecting an important visitor\u2014Prince Beju of Gala. As Kaadi explained, Beju and the Syndicat were planning to form an alliance. Hoping to reclaim his rule over Gala, Beju had created a fake shortage of bacta, a vital medical supply, on his home planet. Beju was to return from Phindar to Gala with the Syndicat's bacta. He would thus be hailed as a hero, while the Syndicat would essentially take control of Gala like they had done with Phindar. Sensing the Living Force pulsing between the Derida brothers and impressed by Kaadi's brave efforts to openly fight the Syndicat, Jinn decided to help them with their plan. At night, the Jedi helped Guerra and Paxxi break into the Syndicat's headquarters by using mind tricks on the guards.

Using the Force, Jinn impersonated a Syndicat guard and replied that they were performing a routine check.

After they had been branded criminals, the Syndicat had confiscated all their goods. Among the things that the Syndicat had confiscated from them was the anti-register, a device that could undo the action of a transfer register, which served as a method of recording transactions in the galaxy. The anti-register had been invented by Paxxi and potentially cost a fortune, as it allowed its user to seize any product and break into any security system. The Deridas had planned to find the anti-register among the stored supplies and use it to break into the treasury; however, the Deridas' belongings were not in the sanctuary.

Still, he felt that he should not give up and planned to strike at the Syndicat the next day, when, according to Duenna, Beju was due to arrive. Kaadi would rally people to break open the Syndicat's warehouses, providing the distraction for Jinn and the Deridas to break into the treasury using the anti-register and to steal the Syndicat's treasures. Kaadi would then distribute food and weapons among the Phindians and see to it that the locals saw as Baftu delivered bacta to Beju's ship.

Continuing to play the role of Beju, he was able to convince Baftu that Terra had mistaken him for someone else, and everyone proceeded to the treasury after Kenobi insisted on inspecting it.

Once Baftu saw that the treasury had been robbed, he, remembering how Terra had accused \"Beju\" of being a spy, suspected that Terra had done so to distract him from the vault which she had robbed. Beju then ordered assassin droids to kill her; the droids fired their weapons at Terra, inflicting a mortal wound, and Baftu and Kenobi left the sanctuary, going to the warehouses to pick up the bacta.

Taking a shipment of the much-needed bacta, Jinn and Kenobi embarked for Gala."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Royal intrigues"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Jinn and Kenobi reached Gala's spaceport and disembarked from their craft, they were greeted by a man in a speeder, who had been sent by Queen Veda to escort the Jedi to the Grand Palace of Gala. Wanting to inspect the surroundings and attune to the Force in order to attain a better understanding of the mission, Jinn declined the driver's services, and the two Jedi walked to the palace on foot, leaving the ship filled with the bacta at the spaceport. As they walked toward the palace through the streets of the planet's capital city of Galu, Kenobi expressed to Jinn he was worried that Beju might react aggressively when he would see the Jedi who had foiled his plans on Phindar. Jinn assured his Padawan that Beju would not bring that topic up, as he would not risk revealing that he had faked the bacta shortage. Jinn, however, still believed that Beju would see them as enemies and, as such, the two had to stay alert. Jinn's and Kenobi's conversation was then interrupted by a sound of shouting in the streets, and they soon saw an approaching crowd of supporters of Deca Brun, one of the two candidates opposing Beju at the upcoming election. Another crowd soon appeared, the one supporting Wila Prammi, the other opposition candidate. A fight erupted between the two groups of Galacians, and the two Jedi were caught in the middle of it. Jinn and Kenobi were attacked, but they were able to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two soon reached the Queen's palace, where they were greeted by Veda herself. Jinn felt that the Queen's presence in the Living Force was very dim, as if she were gravely ill. Noticing Jinn's worried look, the Queen admitted that she was, in fact, dying. Veda went on to explain that she wanted Gala to become a democracy after her death, as she believed that that was what the people of Gala needed. Monarchy had already proven itself ineffective after corruption had spread throughout Gala's Council of Ministers during the thirty-year rule of King Cana, Veda's late husband. However, if Beju were to win, he would retain the monarchy. Beju had few supporters, though, since Brun was the favorite, a hero to the Galacians. On the other hand, Prammi was more experienced in politics. Due to her status as the Queen, Veda could not publicly support any of the opposition candidates, and she was afraid that Beju might interfere in the election process, which could lead to a civil war if the people suspected that the elections had been unfair. Veda also revealed to the Jedi that overseeing the elections was not the actual reason she had invited them. She told Jinn and Kenobi about Elan, the secret daughter of Cana and Tema, a woman from the hill-people faction of the Galacian population. As Elan was born before Beju, she was the true heir to the throne."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Elan was unaware that she was actually the King's daughter, and she was leading the hill people, who did not recognize any authority. Both Brun and Prammi had tried to court the hill people to sway them to their side in the election, but the hill people had refused to participate in the elections, just as they had not recognized Veda, and prior to her, Cana, as their ruler. Veda wanted to notify Elan of her true heritage and see if she truly had the Mark of the Crown, a special mark that was bestowed upon the true heir to the throne and could only be recognized by the Council of Ministers. Beju reportedly did not have the mark; however, as the winner of the governmental elections had the right to open the Council to elections, the Council supported Beju, knowing that he would not exercise that right. As such, the Council members did not plan to test Beju and see if he had the Mark of the Crown. Veda realized that Elan would not meet with her, but the Queen hoped that the Jedi would find a way to set up a meeting with her. However, there was one major obstacle to that. Since the Council of Ministers had been against inviting the Jedi to Gala, Veda had had to negotiate. According to her agreement with the Council, the Jedi were forbidden to leave the city of Galu during the entirety of their mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that moment, Beju burst into the Queen's throne room, along with the head of the Council of Ministers, Lonnag Giba. Beju demanded the Jedi to leave the planet. Telling Veda his own version of the events on Phindar, he claimed that the Jedi had led the Phindian rebels in an attack on his ship and had stolen the bacta he had planned to bring to Gala. Jinn remained silent and did not tell the Queen the true story of what had happened on Phindar. Veda insisted that the Jedi should stay as peacekeepers and negotiated a compromise with Beju; the Jedi were prohibited from leaving the palace without an escort. Beju agreed to those terms and assigned a young boy named Jono Dunn as the escort. Again Jinn did not protest, believing that it was better to leave Beju with a sense of security and a feeling that he could control the Jedi. After the meeting with the Queen was over, Jinn wandered off to the palace gardens, thinking about Elan. As he reflected on Elan's choice to live among the hill people, Jinn realized that she was no different from himself, who had willingly chosen the life of a Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi soon found Jinn in the garden and asked him if he believed Veda's intentions regarding Elan. Jinn replied that there was a chance that the Queen had been lying and in fact wanted to use the Jedi to bring Elan to her, kill her, and, with potential opposition to the throne eliminated, safely proclaim Beju king. However, Jinn still believed that they needed to meet with Elan in any case. As such, Jinn told Kenobi that he was leaving to meet with the hill people. Because the Jedi were prohibited from leaving the palace, Kenobi was to create an illusion of Jinn still being somewhere in the palace. With that arranged, Jinn slipped out of the palace and embarked on a journey to the hills to find the hill people and Elan. While he was absent, Kenobi went into Jinn's quarters each morning before dawn and disarranged the sheets on his bed so that it appeared that Jinn had slept there. Kenobi also ate Jinn's meals when they were delivered to the Jedi Master's quarters, and he constantly came up with excuses to explain his Master's absence; he usually told Beju and Giba that Jinn was meditating, resting, touring the gardens, or otherwise unavailable."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Search for an heir"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the meantime, Jinn was on his way to the hills. Jinn first found a ride in a speeder that took him to the outskirts of the city, then a kind farmer took him far on a turbo cart, then a young teenager gave him a lift on a speeder bike. On the third day of his journey, Jinn finally reached the hills. The terrain became harder to traverse, and Jinn's comlink stopped working\u2014being secretly jammed by the hill people\u2014preventing him from contacting his Padawan. Sensing that a storm was going to erupt soon, Jinn started looking for shelter when he caught a glimpse of several landspeeders headed his way with hostile intent. The speeders were piloted by local bandits, who attacked Jinn. Activating his lightsaber, Jinn engaged in battle with more than a dozen landspeeders, using large rocks as cover. Attacking the speeders one by one, Jinn managed to destroy or otherwise damage several vehicles, but he was himself injured when two errant blaster bolts collided and shattered a large rock in pieces, one of which hit Jinn badly in the chest. Drawing from the Force, Jinn sobered and was ready to continue the fight, when he witnessed a swoop bike heading toward him; Jinn believed that it was another bandit coming to join the battle, but the swoop's pilot\u2014whose face was covered with black cloth\u2014suddenly took out a bowcaster and attacked the bandits, giving Jinn the distraction necessary to take down one more speeder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "More swoops soon appeared on the horizon, and the remaining bandits retreated, with some of the swoops in pursuit. The first swoop's pilot, pointing the bowcaster at Jinn, demanded to know who he was, and Jinn replied that he was a Jedi Knight sent by Veda to find Elan. To his surprise, the swoop pilot took off the cloth hiding her face, revealing herself to be Elan. Elan behaved with distrust toward Jinn, accusing him of using the rocks\u2014which were sacred to the hill people\u2014as cover, and refusing to hear the reason he had come to her. However, seeing that Jinn was badly wounded and would not survive an approaching storm, she decided to take him to the hill people to spend the night and heal. At the hill-people encampment, Jinn was surprised to find out that Elan was also her people's healer, when she visited him to attend to his wounds. As she applied bandages to his wounds, Jinn told her about her true heritage. Elan did not believe his words, suspecting that it was a trick to lure her into the city and imprison her. She denied the fact that her mother ever visited the capital and refused to return to Galu no matter how hard Jinn asked her to reconsider her decision. However, Elan did agree to stop jamming Jinn's comlink and to allow him to contact Kenobi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Jinn contacted his apprentice, Kenobi told him that he suspected that the Queen was being poisoned, which worsened her condition. Kenobi had taken a sample of her tea to a scientist named Mali Errat, who had used a substance analyzer to find traces of a strange compound in it. Jinn advised Kenobi to stay alert and tell the Queen about his discovery so that she ate only the food she prepared herself. Jinn suspected that Dunn might be responsible for the poisoning, but Kenobi, who had befriended Dunn, did not think so. When Jinn told him that Elan was a healer accustomed to various poisons, Kenobi, in turn, suspected her, but Jinn denied the accusations. He told his Padawan that he would stay with the hill people for a few more days, pretending that his wounds were healing slower than they actually were. The next morning, as Jinn once again tried to talk to Elan, the two witnessed a large number of proton tanks approaching the settlement. Elan urged him to leave, but the Jedi refused to leave her people unprotected. Elan then quickly drew a battle plan. Jinn and the hill people were to ride swoop bikes toward the tanks and lure them away from the village and into the Moonstruck Pass, where they would fall into a trap."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the battle began, Jinn followed the hill people on his swoop and led the tanks according to the plan to the Moonstruck Pass, which resembled a large bowl. When the swoops appeared to be cornered, the ice covering the Pass collapsed under the tanks. Elan's people dug out the enemy soldiers from under the snow and flew them to the camp and kept them under guard. At that moment, Jinn met one of the hill people's elders, Domi, who knew Elan's mother and her adoptive father, Rowi. Domi confirmed that Elan's mother had once visited Galu and had worked at the palace; Jinn realized that Elan had lied to him because she was afraid of actually being royalty. Jinn interrogated one of the captured officers, who revealed that the tanks had been sent by Giba, who had claimed that the hill people were savages who planned to sabotage the elections. Jinn realized that Giba planned to take over the government and was planning to kill Elan. Believing that Giba had to be stopped, Jinn managed to convince Elan to go with him to Galu and participate in the elections.

Kenobi was imprisoned; he managed to escape, but he lost his lightsaber in the process. It also turned out that Jinn had been right in his suspicions regarding Dunn; it was the boy who had been putting poison in the Queen's food, using dimilatis, a herb found in the palace gardens. Dunn's family had been the palace servants for many generations, and the boy was afraid to lose that position when the new administration came along. Upon discovering that, Kenobi slipped back into the palace to deliver the antidote made by Errat to the Queen, but was confronted by Beju and engaged him in a sword fight, which was interrupted by Council member Viso. In an attempt to prove to Beju that Veda had told the truth about Elan being the true heir, Viso performed the special ritual on Beju and confirmed that there was no Mark of the Crown on him. Beju accepted that judgement and issued an order to arrest Giba, although he suspected that Giba might have a backup plan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Jinn returned to the palace Giba soon indeed revealed himself, claiming that the Prince did not have the authority to imprison him, but Veda reiterated her son's order.

As guards arrested Giba, the Minister tried to convince Veda that it was too late for elections, claiming that the hill people had arrived to occupy Galu. Giba tried to convince everyone present that in order to evade civil war, the royal house had to throw its support to Brun. Kenobi, however, explained that Giba had been in league with Brun; afraid that Beju might lose the elections, he had made a deal with him, promising to find him funding from outside sources\u2014which he did by introducing Brun to Offworld\u2014and in exchange Brun would find him a place in his government. Brun was unaware that Offworld was planing to exploit Gala's natural resources. Kenobi's lightsaber served as proof of his accusations, since Brun's men had confiscated it from the Padawan, and the only way Giba could obtain it was if he had ties to Brun.

Refusing to become a Princess, Elan decided to return to the hills, although she had forged a bond with Prammi and would not isolate herself as she had done before. Before leaving the planet, Jinn visited the former Queen Veda\u2014who was getting better\u2014one last time. As they spoke, the Queen noticed sadness in Jinn, and the Jedi Master replied that he was struggling to understand what he would leave as a Jedi when he died. In response, Veda showed him the peaceful streets of Galu, and a realization came upon Jinn that he would be remembered for bringing peace to the planet.

Weeks prior, the sides had come close to signing a peace treaty, and Tahl had been sent there as a guardian of peace, but she was injured when war broke out again and was captured by the Melida. Jinn and Kenobi were sent to the planet to rescue Tahl and were supposed to meet their contact, a Melida named Wehutti, who had agreed to smuggle them into the capital city of Zehava. Jinn and Kenobi approached the planet in the starfighter, and Kenobi landed it inside a canyon, where it could not be detected. They then headed toward Zehava from the west as they had been instructed. There, Wehutti was supposed to be expecting them near a Melida controlled gate. When they reached the gate, however, they saw that it was under the control of Daan forces and was being protected by a particle shield. Jinn then decided to look for an unguarded spot to enter the city and possibly find Wehutti. They also saw many large black buildings, which they decided to avoid. Moving near the city walls, Jinn used the Force to search for an opening in the shield; once they found it, the Jedi tried to use carbon ropes to climb over the wall.

They used the lightsabers to cut through it and squeezed through the opening into a narrow tunnel; the Jedi sensed something evil there. Suddenly, they were attacked by a warrior armed with a blaster. Kenobi tried to attack him, but when his lightsaber passed through the warrior's body without doing any harm, the Jedi realized that that was a hologram. The holographic warrior related his story\u2014his name was Quintama, Captain of the Melida Liberation Force, who had fought in the Twenty-First Battle of Zehava. Kenobi found a gravestone with Quintama's name on it, indicating that he had not survived the battle. As Jinn and Kenobi found more and more gravestones and saw more holograms, they realized that they were within some kind of memorial to fallen warriors. The Melida and the Daan had erected those mausoleums to keep the memory of the conflict alive, instead of trying to put it to rest.

Hoping to surprise the snipers, the Jedi made their way around the cliff and scaled it from the other side. Jinn and Kenobi attacked the four snipers, disarming three of them. The final one, a one-armed man, pointed his blaster at Jinn but then tossed it aside after recognizing him as a Jedi; the snipers had initially thought that Jinn and Kenobi were Daan. The one-armed sniper was Wehutti, who explained that he had been looking for the Jedi for days in the sector occupied by the Daan in the Twenty-Second Battle of Zehava. He and the snipers had not left the occupied territory because they were determined to protect the Hall of Evidence, as the mausoleum Jinn and Kenobi had left was called.

Wehutti himself escorted Jinn and Kenobi to the Melida territory through the ravaged parts of Zehava. As they approached the Inner Hub, however, Jinn's instincts told him that Wehutti was going to betray him and Kenobi. Once inside the Hub, the Jedi noticed that no middle-aged people were seen on the streets; everyone they had encountered were either elders or Kenobi's peers. Wehutti explained that the Middle Generation had been nearly wiped out by the wars. The Jedi also noticed graffiti on the walls, signed by a group called the Young, although Wehutti dismissed the Young as an insignificant gathering of children. Wehutti then took Jinn and Kenobi to the Melida headquarters, where he asked them to leave their lightsabers at the entrance. Jinn and Kenobi pretended to follow Wehutti's orders, only to reclaim their weapons without their guide noticing.

Their rescuer, a girl named Cerasi, escorted Jinn and Kenobi through the sewers to an old resting ground, where they met an armor-clad young man. The latter introduced himself as Nield, the leader of the Young. Nield explained to the Jedi that the Young were seeking to stop the fighting between the Melida and the Daan, and he told Jinn that the Melida Council had been planning to take him and Kenobi hostage to force the Jedi Council to back the Melida government. Nield offered his help to Jinn and Kenobi in finding Tahl, but asked for their help in stopping the war. Jinn, however, was not ready to take sides until he heard all sides of the conflict, and so he requested to speak with the Daan. Nield, who was himself a Daan, agreed to lead the Jedi to his people, and he did so along with Cerasi. Through a series of tunnels, Nield led the Jedi to Lake Weir, the last body of water within a thousand kilometers, now serving as a place for a large repulsorlift-held Hall of Evidence.

All he asked from the Jedi was that they did not nothing and waited until Cerasi led them to Tahl. Realizing that Nield outmaneuvered him, and aware that Tahl was injured and required immediate attention, Jinn agreed to the plan. Upon returning to the Young headquarters, Jinn restlessly waited as the Young developed strategy for their attacks. He offered his help, but the Young declined. Unwilling to rely on the Young completely, Jinn then left to explore the tunnels on his own, leaving Kenobi with the Young. Later that night, Kenobi approached Jinn, telling him that Nield and Cerasi had asked him to share their quarters. Jinn wished his Padawan good night, but soon he saw Kenobi, instead of going to sleep, leaving with Nield and Cerasi. He did not stop his Padawan, letting him make his own choices, although Jinn was stung by the fact that Kenobi kept secrets from him.

Cerasi distracted the Melida who were guarding Tahl, saying that she was Wehutti's daughter and claiming that the Daan were attacking the building. She then ran away and feigned blaster fire, distracting the guards and allowing Jinn and Kenobi to defeat the guards and break into the room where Tahl was being held. To his shock, Jinn discovered that Tahl was very weak and completely blind, so Jinn had to carry her in his arms. As they tried to escape, more guards appeared, but they were too distracted by Cerasi's simulated blaster fire, and the three Jedi escaped the same way they had come.

The Young's raid on the Daan weapons storage had been successful, while the Melida had destroyed their own storage so that the weapons did not fall into Daan arms. The Young had subsequently sent a message to both sides, revealing that it had been them who stood behind the attacks and issuing an ultimatum for peace. As the Young celebrated, Jinn contacted Yoda, filling him in on Tahl's rescue and the still volatile situation on the planet.

He tried to plead with their leaders, Wehutti, and a Daan named Gueni, warning them not to underestimate the Young and urging them to create a coalition government, but both sides did not listen. At that moment, reports started to come through to the Elders of deflection towers\u2014structures that generated particle shields preventing entry into the city\u2014being destroyed one by one by the Young; that was done thanks to Kenobi's assistance, who had allowed the Young to use the Jedi's starfighter.

Kenobi was unmoved by such words, replying that he had felt that it was right to break the rules and that he had found his place with the Young. As Nield had predicted, the offer for the negotiations had been a trick, as the unified Elders attacked the Young with previously hidden starfighters. While Jinn made preparations in order to leave the planet immediately, Kenobi rushed to help his friends fight the battle. Jinn escorted the injured Tahl to the starfighter, and soon Kenobi appeared there as well. However, he had come not to go with Jinn, but to take the starfighter and assist the Young in the fight. Jinn did not allow him to do so. Both Jedi stood their ground, and the situation became so tense that they ignited their lightsabers and were one step from dueling each other. Jinn then issued a final ultimatum to his Padawan; he could either go with him, or stay on the planet and cease to be a Jedi.

One of the duels he fought was against Bruck Chun, the boy whom Jinn had witnessed duel Kenobi before departing for Bandomeer. Distracted by his thoughts about Kenobi, Jinn did not pay much attention to the fight and nearly lost it, but he eventually concentrated and defeated Chun. As they exchanged ceremonial bows, Jinn noticed a familiar gaze in Chun's eyes, who approached his thirteenth birthday and wished to become Jinn's apprentice. After the fight, Jinn went straight to the Room of a Thousand Fountains to seek solitude, but Yoda found him there.

When Jinn visited Tahl, she revealed that she had been told that her loss blindness was irreversible and permanent. This prompted Jinn to try helping her in everyday activities, but Tahl insisted on doing things herself, as she had been working on improving her hearing and other senses in the course of the past weeks. She also introduced 2JTJ, a navigation droid that was assigned to her by Yoda and which irritated her by constantly giving her directions. When their conversation touched upon the topic of Kenobi, Jinn displayed anger at his Padawan, although Tahl made it clear that she herself did not hold any grudge against Kenobi.

The string of seemingly petty thefts suddenly became serious when senior training rooms had been vandalized and all lightsabers\u2014including Kenobi's\u2014kept there by the elder students had been stolen. When Jinn and Tahl inspected the training rooms, among the torn tunics, they found an inscription written in red paint on a wall in a tone mocking Yoda's pattern of speech that stated the Jedi's time would come and that they should beware the intruder, who called himself \"trouble.\" The Jedi decided that the time had come to alert all the students about the situation.

Both Tahl and Jinn felt a disturbance in the Force in the Temple, and Jinn was fearful that it was not a student who stood behind the attacks, but an intruder. Soon enough, rumors spread that an intruder had been spotted inside the Temple. Jinn then realized that the Temple's security was flawed, since it relied on the fact that no Jedi would allow an intruder in, and, as such, little security was maintained inside. The intruder had to have been assisted by someone from the inside. Jinn and Tahl soon heard as the Emergency Code Fourteen was announced over the intercom system, which called the two to a small conference room, where they found Yoda. He informed them that the Healing Crystals of Fire, one of the greatest treasures of the Jedi Order, had been taken from their holding room. Yoda warned the two investigators that he sensed that the thief was planning to use the crystals for destructive purposes and urged them to complete their investigation as soon as possible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After meeting with Yoda, Jinn decided to go back to his room, where he kept a datapad with notes. Jinn was afraid that his datapad might have been stolen as well, but when they entered the room, Jinn found nothing unusual there there and saw the datapad lying where he had left it. However, Tahl's improved smell picked up a scent of an intruder who had been in Jinn's quarters. That gave Jinn an idea regarding how to track the intruder. Jinn and Tahl compiled a list of two hundred and sixty-seven Jedi and non-Jedi staff, who had access to the stolen goods and who did not have alibis. The two then started interviewing each one of them, so that Tahl could try to pick up the scent she had smelled earlier from one of them. Finally, Tahl reacted when they were interviewing Bant Eerin, a Mon Calamari girl and a friend of Kenobi's, although it became clear for Jinn and Tahl that she was innocent. However, Tahl soon realized that the smell was not coming from a person but rather from the Temple's lakes and Eerin smelled the same because she often explored the lakes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinn then decided to enlist the Mon Calamari's help in searching the lake for any clues. Eerin soon found a water-proof container underwater, and Jinn helped her to bring it onto the surface.

Jinn decided to use the crate to track the intruder, and he had it returned underwater. Having come to find a pattern in the thefts, Jinn and Tahl deduced the approximate timing of the next incident and laid in hiding near the lake, waiting for the culprit to come and hide the stolen goods. They waited for five hours, until finally, Bruck Chun appeared and dove underwater. When he emerged and left the lakeside, Jinn followed him, hoping that Chun was going to a meeting with the outside intruder. As he left, Jinn instructed Tahl to stay behind. However, Jinn soon heard 2JTJ's voice, which startled Chun, and he left; Tahl had followed Jinn after her enhanced hearing had picked up someone following Jinn, while 2JTJ had come looking for Tahl. Tahl then revealed the most startling news\u2014the person who had followed Jinn obviously knew his way around the Temple's premises.

Kenobi had lost his command and status in the ranks of the Young after he had opposed Nield's decision to demolish the Halls of Evidence. He was confused, scared, and did not know what to do, so he requested Jinn's help. At that moment, a realization hit Jinn, and he understood what Yoda and Tahl had been trying to tell him\u2014that he had not been betrayed by a Jedi, but by a boy who had been overtaken by passion and had been trying to protect his friends, and that boy deserved Jinn's understanding. With that realization, Jinn departed for Melida/Daan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Jinn arrived on the planet, he greeted Kenobi coldly and calmly, although he realized that it hurt the boy.

In turn, Wehutti did not command his forces and did not want to see anyone after Cerasi's death. Jinn and Kenobi visited Wehutti, trying to tell him to convince the Elders to stand down.

The Jedi Master asked the boy to concentrate and remember objectively, putting aside his feelings for Cerasi, what had happened that day. Kenobi recalled that the day had been gray and overcast, but he also said that he had spotted a glimmer of sunlight coming from a roof. Jinn then suspected that that glimmer might have been a shot fired from a blaster. Jinn continued to guide Kenobi toward unraveling the mystery, asking him how the Elders and the Young could have obtained weapons that day if all had been confiscated following the conclusion of the war. In order to find an answer to that question, the two went to a warehouse where the Young Security Squad had kept the weapons. As they walked there, Jinn realized that he had forgiven Kenobi, although he still was not sure that he would take him back as a Padawan if the latter asked."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They found the warehouse deserted, guarded only by two Young girls, Deila and Joli, who initially did not want to tell anything to Kenobi, who had been branded an outsider by Nield. However, not wanting another war on their hands, Joli told Jinn and Kenobi that Mawat had secretly armed both factions that day, hoping that a war would break out and Nield would be blamed responsible, allowing Mawat to secure power for himself. He had also put sharpshooters on the roofs in case Nield or Wehutti backed down; it had been one of those sharpshooters who had killed Cerasi. Jinn and Kenobi realized that they needed to inform Nield that he had not been the one responsible for killing Cerasi, and to tell him of Mawat's treachery. Hoping to find Nield quickly, Jinn and Kenobi split up, with Jinn handing Kenobi's lightsaber back to him. Hoping that Kenobi had more chances of locating Nield, Jinn went to Cerasi's quarters in the tunnels, where he happened to find a holographic message disc with a message recorded by Cerasi on the morning of her death, where Cerasi pleaded for peace to finally come to her planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With that disk, Jinn rushed to the fountain plaza, only to find a battle raging there. Mawat and the Scavenger Young had attempted to demolish the Hall of Evidence, but Kenobi and Nield, who had been convinced by the former to change his views, tried to stop him along with the mainstream Young. Jinn then activated Cerasi's message, playing it aloud for both sides to hear. Cerasi's words convinced all participants of the fight, including Mawat, to stand down. The leader of the Scavenger Young admitted that he had been wrong and retreated from Zehava with a few of his followers to the countryside. Jinn's negotiation skills helped Wehutti and Nield to come to an agreement and form a joint government. Kenobi had realized that his destiny was with the Jedi Order, and he was ready to return with Jinn. When he asked the Jedi Master if he would take him back as Padawan, Jinn replied that it remained to be seen.

Tech worker Miro Daroon was struggling to keep all Temple systems running, but every time he fixed something, he found another malfunction. Jinn and Kenobi entered the Jedi Council chambers, where they were informed of the specifics of the attempted murder of Yoda. The Grand Master had been inside the Room of a Thousand Fountains when his Force sense warned him about an explosive device located there. Yoda's hesitation saved his life when the device exploded under a bridge.

Kenobi was then sent to his old quarters, while the Council members remained to speak with Jinn in private. However, Bant Eerin soon came in, urging the Jedi Masters to assist Kenobi; when she and Kenobi had traveled to the Lake Level they watched as a hover car had come out of its shaft, threatening the lives of Jedi Master Ali-Alann and ten younglings.

Jinn himself concluded that the stolen items had not been random but had been used by the intruder. The teacher's meditation robe was probably used by the culprit to travel about the Temple freely, while the toolbox had been used to dismantle the hover car's repulsorlift engines. Students records with names A through H were most likely stolen to conceal some fact about Chun. Only a student's sporting gear seemingly held no significance. Also, Yoda revealed to Jinn that the Jedi Order had undertaken a secret mission from the Senate and had agreed to store a large shipment of crystalline vertex, a highly valuable material, in the Temple's treasury room.

The petty thefts were the disruption, the theft of the Healing Crystals of Fire and the attack on Yoda were the demoralization, and the various malfunctions throughout the Temple were the distraction. When Jinn arrived at the tech room to consult with Daroon, Kenobi followed him there. Remembering Yoda's advice, Jinn did not tell the boy to leave. Daroon told the two that he had been forced to close two wings of the Temple as the sabotage was growing worse. The technician could not keep up with all the problems, which bothered Jinn, since Daroon was a brilliant tech expert.

Jinn and Kenobi went to Tahl's quarters and told her about their discovery. Their conversation was interrupted by Jedi trainee Siri Tachi, who had been questioned by Kenobi earlier and who remembered more facts about Chun. She told the three that Chun had somehow discovered the identity of his father, who was a powerful man on Xanatos' homeworld of Telos IV, and Chun had bragged about that fact. Jinn then assigned Tahl to search for any information on Xanatos and Offworld, while he and Kenobi proceeded with their own investigation. As soon as Jinn and Kenobi left Tahl's quarters, they ran into Eerin, who had noticed that all the attacks had taken place near water; she deducted that Chun and Xanatos used a series of water tunnels in their diversions.

Eerin led the duo to the Temple's water purification tanks, where the water flooded the tunnels every twenty minutes and was then drained again. Jinn, Kenobi and Eerin followed a service tunnel and followed it until they were suspended on a catwalk above the water purification unit. Suddenly, Xanatos emerged from the water and began taunting Jinn, but the Jedi Master retained his calm. Jinn and Kenobi did not attack Xanatos, knowing that their lightsabers would short out if they touched the water Xanatos was standing in. Xanatos then attacked them himself, jumping onto the catwalk and clashing his lightsaber with Jinn's. Eerin, meanwhile, dove into the water and swam to call for help. Jinn and Kenobi tried to lure Xanatos back into the water, so that his own lightsaber shorted out, but then the time came for the water to come through the tunnels, and Xanatos allowed himself to be taken away by the torrent.

Kenobi suspected Tahl, but Jinn trusted her wholeheartedly and ruled her out immediately. Jinn then went to Tahl to see what she had found, and she showed him her discovery; Offworld was on the brink of bankruptcy following a failed mining operation. Jinn then realized that Xanatos' reason for coming to the Temple was not only revenge, but also the vertex with which he would be able to finance his corporation. When Tahl's droid 2JTJ entered the quarters, Jinn remembered that the droid appeared around the same time as the thefts began, so he suspected that 2JTJ might be the spy.

Xanatos revealed that he had captured Eerin and had tied her and placed her underwater, where she would eventually drown unless Jinn returned Xanatos' airspeeder. Kenobi was deeply affected by Eerin's kidnapping, who was his closest friend, but Jinn consoled him and asked to behave like a Jedi if he wanted to become one once again.

The winners of the challenges advanced to face even harder tests, until the last round.

Xanatos sped toward the pools filled with acid\u2014a result of UniFy's mining operations\u2014where he turned around and attacked Jinn, engaging him in a duel and saying that Jinn would not be able to kill him; the Jedi Master replied that he did not intend to; he wanted to bring Xanatos to justice.

Realizing that he had no way of escape, Xanatos spoke to Jinn, saying that he was his biggest failure and Jinn would have to live with that. With that said, Xanatos stepped back and fell into the pool of acid. Jinn reached out with his hand, trying to stop him, but it was too late, and Xanatos died in the acid. Respecting all life, even that of his enemies, Jinn took his time to mourn for Xanatos' passing. Such gesture deeply impressed Kenobi. With Xanatos' death, life turned for the better on Telos. UniFy was exposed as a front for Offworld, the Governor who had turned a blind eye on the company's activities resigned, the government apologized to the people and called for special elections, Katharsis was stopped, Vox Chun was put in jail, and the Telosians set off to rebuild their damaged land."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Andra and Denetrus helped clear Jinn and Kenobi of all charges.

Jinn also confessed that he and Kenobi had bonded and were destined to be Master and Padawan, no matter the opinion of the Jedi Council. Still, Jinn offered Kenobi to help him settle the matters with the Council and promised to spend some time in the Temple with Kenobi, who was required to do so on the terms of his probation. Jinn understood that he and Kenobi had different temperaments and that they would clash again in the future, but he was now looking forward to it. Soon enough, Kenobi's probation was lifted, allowing him to once again officially become Jinn's Padawan. The two spent a lot of time both at the Temple and on various missions across the galaxy, helping wherever they could, and improving their ties even further.

She revealed that Junction 5 had a long-standing rivalry with its moon of Delaluna. Several years ago, the people of Junction 5 had discovered that Delaluna had been developing a superweapon, called the Annihilator, capable of wiping out entire cities.

However, Delaluna denied the existence of the weapon and any plans for an invasion, and the negotiations between the governments of the two planets were stalled.

Nod offered to provide the two Jedi with escort to their transport. Jinn declined the offer, but Nod did so nonetheless. As two Guardians escorted them to the transport, Jinn asked them why he had seen more and more security arriving on the streets.

Taking Kenobi with him, he went to the Internal Security Office. Finding a lone guard inside the office, Jinn introduced himself as a security consultant from Constant Industries, and Kenobi as a new employee, who had been assigned to take the guard's place.

The group fought back, with Jinn using the Force to incapacitate a security guard, and they slowly retreated from the office with the copied documents on the Annihilator and left the Ministry through an emergency exit, which was open because of the drill.

Therefore, Jinn decided that their best bet was to make the information public through the local communications system. However, the system was controlled from the main Guardian compound, and the only way for the group to get in was to get themselves arrested. The only member of the team who did not have a warrant on her head was Aeran, so she left them, promising to alert the local resistance to be on a lookout for a major announcement.

Hiring some of his Rutanian friends, he arranged for their passage to Senali, where they sewn disorder and established their identity as the \"Ghost Ones.\" Once Leed was kidnapped, Taroon arranged for an attack on Rutan and planted evidence that would point to Leed both being the leader of the Ghost Ones and the instigator of the attack. That would lead to Leed both being banished from Rutan and being unwelcome on Senali any longer. In turn, Taroon would become the next King.

Grieving for the loss of her cousin, Lena, however, focused on the mission and led Jinn and Kenobi back to the Tubal Park, where she believed Rutin had wanted her to go to their favorite hiding spot.

Returning to the warehouse, Lena analyzed the datapad, confirming that it contained enough evidence to strip the Cobral from power. Jinn the contacted Senator Crote with the update on the mission, and the Senator advised the Jedi to take one of his fastest ships, the Degarian II, to deliver Lena and the datapad to Coruscant. That night, Jinn sensed that something was amiss and he went to check on Lena, finding her bound and Kenobi confronting an intruder who was trying to escape with the datapad.

The Jedi safely brought Lena to Coruscant, where they were met by Master Windu, after which Lena testified in an emergency session called by the Supreme Chancellor. Her evidence led to Senator Crote's removal from office and arrest warrants issued against members of the Cobral family. Many senators were impressed by Lena's bravery and suggested her to run for the post of Frego's Senator to replace the corrupt Crote.

However, instead of attacking Kenobi, Zanita used the weapon to commit suicide, accepting her family's defeat. Lena survived the attack and was treated for her wounds. Remembering how patient and understating Kenobi had been to him in the recent months and especially during the mission to Frego, Jinn realized that Kenobi was getting closer to being ready to become a Jedi Knight, and he thanked him for his comforting words, which had helped Jinn find the strength to go on after Tahl's death."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Mission to Vorzyd IV"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning from one of the missions later that year, Jinn and Kenobi found themselves on a prolonged period of time without any other assignments. After two months spent in physical exercise and meditation, Jinn and his Padawan were finally summoned before the Jedi Council, who dispatched them on a mission to the Vorzyd system, where a feud was growing between the fourth and the fifth planets of the system. According to the briefing provided by Master Nu, the native Vorzydiaks of Vorzyd IV were a very work-centric species. Every member of their society was required to work starting from age ten until mandatory retirement at the age of seventy, although most of the retirees died shortly afterward despite being in good health. Due to such hard-working population, Vorzyd IV was producing most of the food and other goods used by the five planets of the system.

Meanwhile, a series of sabotage attacks had struck the production facilities on Vorzyd IV. Claiming that Vorzyd V attempted to achieve power in the system and had been responsible for the acts of sabotage, all Vorzyd V diplomats had been expelled from the fourth planet, and the Chairman of Vorzyd IV, Port, had personally contacted the Jedi Order for help, which was highly unusual for the generally isolationist Vorzydiaks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinn and Kenobi traveled to Vorzyd IV, where they were met by a Vorzydiak guide and escorted to a factory operated by Multycorp, one of the largest corporations on the planet.

According to Port, no one had been hurt in the sabotage attacks, and they had been strictly aimed at slowing production rates. Port did not give Jinn any reason that he suspected Vorzyd V's hand in the attacks, so Jinn asked to inspect the sabotaged areas. At that moment, however, another sabotage attempt occurred, the factory's computers showing erroneous data regarding production rates of hard goods. Kenobi looked at the computers but was unable to find the source of the problem as the Vorzydiaks' workday came to a close.

The next day, Port showed the Jedi Vorzyd's retirement home, where his mother used to live before she died a month ago. Port allowed the Jedi to stay in his mother's room, and Jinn and Kenobi decided to meditate. During his meditation, Jinn saw visions of an older Kenobi, who had attained the rank of Jedi Master, and he was proud of what his Padawan had accomplished. Meanwhile, Kenobi, too restless to meditate, left the room. When he did not return after a long time, Jinn initially wanted to contact him via comlink, but believing that his apprentice had grown enough, he gave him more time to conduct his own investigation. When Kenobi returned, he told Jinn that he had uncovered two important pieces of information; firstly, the Vorzydiaks could share emotions with each other through their antennae. Second, Vorzyd V was not responsible for the attacks. It was a group of Vorzyd IV's children, who called themselves the Freelies, and who did not share their parents' workaholic attitude and attempted to make them work less."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi suggested to Jinn that he would be able to infiltrate the Freelies by disguising himself as a Vorzydiak.

The next day, Port summoned the Jedi to be present as he contacted Vorzyd V. As Jinn went to the meeting with Port, Kenobi infiltrated the Vorzyd school. Port told Jinn that another sabotage had occurred: the central operations computer, controlling Vorzyd IV's entire power grid, had gone out of commission. Jinn asked to take a look at the problem and descended to the sublevel containing the computer. Seeing the Vorzydiak workers affected by a high-pitched sound it emitted, he realized that the computer had not been broken but had been programmed to play music. Jinn deactivated the program, but the power was still rapidly going out throughout Vorzyd, with the next building to lose power being the children's hospital."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinn rushed back to stop the disaster, overriding a network shutdown and flushing the system, preventing the deaths of the children.

Jinn diffused the situation, but Felana promised that if Vorzyd IV continued their accusations, there would be war. Returning to their apartment in the retirement complex, Jinn conferred with Kenobi, who had returned from his first day undercover. Kenobi informed Jinn that the Freelies were planning to sabotage the shuttles carrying the workers to work, but only when nobody was present there. However, early in the morning, Port arrived to the Jedi's room, informing them that the shuttles were exploding with people in them; the Freelies had struck earlier.

Jinn tried to prevent the conflict by telling Port to wait with the accusations until the sabotaged shuttles were expected. He did not reveal anything about the Freelies, giving his Padawan more time to act on his own. However, when they met in their apartment, Kenobi told Jinn that he had been discovered as a Jedi and that the Freelies' meeting place had been raided by the Vorzydiaks acting on someone's tip, although the children had escaped.

However, Jinn received a call through the Force from his Padawan, telling him to evacuate everyone from the annex. Trusting his Padawan, Jinn did as he asked, evacuating those present at the meeting in time before the annex exploded; it had been rigged with explosives by Flip, who had advocated for the violent ways of the Freelies, although he had not expected anyone to be inside the annex when it exploded.

Jinn and Kenobi then helped the Freelies and the adults to come to peaceful terms, making the workers realize that there was more to life than just work. The retirees had been dying because they did not have anyone near them to share emotions with. In the aftermath of the events at Multycorp, the population of Vorzyd IV reevaluated their views on work. The work week was shortened by a day, and the generations started to spend more time with each other, with the children and the laborers coming to visit the retirees and building outdoor space for them. As they were thanked by the Vorzydiaks, Jinn and Kenobi left the planet, headed toward Coruscant. On their way, Jinn told Kenobi how proud he was of his progress as a Jedi and admitted that he was the best Padawan he could ever wish for.

Although the Sith were believed to be extinct, Fisto and Eerin had located a recently abandoned dwelling on the planet, which belonged to someone who had been collecting knowledge about the Sith. A drawing of a Sith holocron was scribbled on the wall, with the text that it had been located. Jocasta Nu told Jinn and Kenobi that a number of cults worshiping the Sith were known to be active across the galaxy, and that recently, a Quermian historian named Murk Lundi had shifted all of his university courses toward the topic of the Sith.

Disembarking on Nolar as well, Jinn and Kenobi trailed Lundi as he booked passage with another pilot and then went through the city of Nolari.

According to Nu's information, Kodai was a planet mostly covered by sea, which at one point had drowned most of its population. Now, only a small patch of land remained among the sea, with a small number of native Kodaians living there. Every ten years, when the two moons of the planet synched up, the sea experienced a particularly low tide.

Jinn and Kenobi, along with Saesee Tiin and Mace Windu, were dispatched to the Yinchorri homeworld of Yinchorr. Adi Gallia, Eeth Koth, Tsui Choi and Choi's Padawan Theen Fida were assigned to the ocean world of Yitheeth, and Plo Koon, Micah Giiett, Lilit Twoseas and her Padawan K'Kruhk were sent to Yibikkoror, a small world with a dense atmosphere."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before they embarked on the mission, Giiett demonstrated K'Kruhk and Kenobi a trick involving four cups and four colored stones. He put three white stones under three cups and made it appear that he placed one black stone under the remaining cup, while in fact he put a white stone there as well. He then told the two Padawans to keep track of the \"black stone\" while he quickly moved the cups. Kenobi and K'Kruhk correctly guessed the cup but were surprised to find a white stone underneath it. When Giiett's trickery was revealed, Jinn told his Padawan not to feel bad about being cheated, as he knew that Giiett had tried this trick with every Padawan known to Jinn. After that, the Jedi teams boarded their respective ships and embarked on the mission. As the three Jedi ships exited hyperspace near the Yinchorri system, however, they were attacked by Yinchorri starfighters. Following Windu's command, the Jedi split up and proceeded to their planned destinations, each pursued by several fighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinn's cruiser soon lost its shields, forcing Tiin to improvise an escape plan. Telling Jinn to enter the necessary coordinates into the navicomputer, Tiin made a dangerous jump through hyperspace past Yinchorr, emerging from the other side of the planet and losing track of the pursuers. The group safely landed on the planet and, after hiding their cruiser in a canyon, began their search for the Yinchorri command post. While Tiin and Windu hid in the mountains, Jinn and Kenobi scouted for their objective, but instead of the command post they only found a staging area in a nearby city where the Yinchorri were preparing for an invasion. Barely evading capture by Yinchorri sentries, Jinn and his Padawan returned to the hiding spot with a report. During the mission, Jinn had also discovered that the Yinchorri could not be affected by mind tricks. As Jinn was finishing his report, the Yinchorri had found the Jedi's hidden ship and destroyed it. Windu was not concerned with the loss of the cruiser and decided to wait for the other two teams in order to regroup and act together."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By that time, the Yitheeth team had found the Devaronian Olmar Grahrk who had been commanding the Yinchorri on the planet and had taken him prisoner.

The Jedi reinforcements dragged away enemies from Jinn and his group, allowing them to regroup with the others and start to fight their way to the cruiser. During the fight, Master Twoseas was killed, and Windu decided to get her body back to the cruiser; Jinn, Kenobi, Giiett and Koon covered Windu and the other Jedi as they performed the extraction.

Olmar was discovered by the Jedi who had returned to the cruiser with their fallen comrades' bodies. The Jedi subdued him and traced his signal to the moon, realizing that the command center was built deep within the moon's structure. They relayed this news to the Jedi Council on Coruscant\u2014who had recently fended off a Yinchorri attack themselves, suffering two casualties\u2014 and the Council, in turn, informed Chancellor Valorum of the command center's location."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Calling in every favor owned to him in the last five years and making significant concessions to a number of Senators, the Chancellor convinced enough of them to vote for an embargo act, assembling local paramilitary forces to enforce a technological blockade of the Yinchorri system, preventing them from rearming and resuming their conquests, and convincing the Senate to immediately send a strike force to assist the Jedi at Uhanayih. Having witnessed the brutality of the Yinchorri attacks, Valorum believed that the outlying systems needed the means to defend themselves. Although he was determined to uphold the Ruusan Reformation accords which prohibited the creation of a unified Galactic Republic military force, he suggested to the Senate to impose taxation on the so-called Free Trade Zones used by trading conglomerates such as the Trade Federation in the outlying systems. The money gathered through the taxes of the free trade zones would then be directed to the outer systems, allowing them to finance their paramilitaries to defend themselves against future local conflicts similar to the ongoing Yinchorri Uprising. The suggestion was met with upheaval in the Senate, mainly from the Trade Federation delegation\u2014as it would severely hurt their profits\u2014as well as worlds supporting the Federation, and the proposition was not put to vote at that time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the meantime, Jinn, Giiett, Koon and Kenobi were still fighting the Yinchorri, who began to regroup for another attack.

The three did as he asked and ran for the cruiser, while Giiett pierced the tank with his lightsabers, triggering an explosion that stalled the Yinchorri. Giiett's sacrifice allowed Jinn, Koon and Kenobi to reach the ship. As the surviving Jedi prepared to depart for Uhanayih, Jinn conversed with Windu, who was stricken with guilt over Giiett's death.

Jinn asked the Admiral in charge of the strike team to provide escort for the Jedi, as they navigated their cruiser into a tunnel carved into the moon, which led to the Yinchorri base. The Jedi then crash-landed their ship in the middle of the command center and captured the Yinchorri High Command, although Vilmarh Grahrk had already escaped from the base. With the loss of their leadership and the main base, the Yinchorri were defeated and the uprising was resolved.

The Jedi then set out to locate Vilmarh Grahrk, finding his notion to stir up the Yinchorri unusual, as he had no reason to do so. Jinn and Kenobi were sent to track him down; they located the Devaronian in an alleyway on one of the planets. When Grahrk pulled out his blaster in an attempt to defend himself, they easily disarmed him and apprehended him, bringing the Devaronian to the Jedi Temple for interrogation before the Jedi Council.

Unbeknownst to the Jedi, Grahrk's employer was the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who had orchestrated the crisis as one of the steps in the Sith Grand Plan to conquer the galaxy. The Yinchorri rebellion had served several purposes for Sidious; it had resulted in the deaths of seven Jedi and the removal of the Yinchorri as a threat to his plans and had presumably allowed Sidious to steal a Jedi treasure from the Jedi Temple during the chaos of the Yinchorri attack. More importantly, it had weakened Chancellor Valorum's stance in the Senate, in part due to him having to call in so many favors to convince the Senate to vote in favor of the Yinchorri system blockade, but in large part due to his controversial proposition of the taxation of the free trade zones."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Nebula Front"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this period of time, an unrest was growing in the Outer Rim sector of the galaxy.

The Nebula Front tried to reason with the Federation at first to ease of their control on the trade in the region, but when the talks failed, the Nebula Front turned to violence. The organization initially restricted their actions to interfering with Trade Federation shipments or delaying their vessels whenever possible.

Without informing the Jedi Council, Jinn decided to use that information in order to follow Cohl and locate the Nebula Front's command, taking his Padawan with him and embarking for Dorvalla in a small CL-1c Lancet interceptor starfighter marked with the red colors of the Republic Judicial Department."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on Dorvalla, Jinn learned of Cohl's plan to infiltrate the Trade Federation by hiding his shuttle within the shell of a cargo pod, similar to ones that carried the cargo of lommite to the ship.

Jinn and his Padawan waited for Cohl to arrive inside the freighter first and then landed their own disguised craft. Inside the hangar, they saw that Cohl and his men had already left their pod, wreaking havoc as they had fought through the Federation's droid security force toward the ship's bridge, leaving only two sentries to guard the pod. Jinn and Kenobi exited their cover and moved toward Cohl's pod. Jinn distracted the guards, allowing Kenobi to reach Cohl's pod and plant a thermal detonator on the pod's drive core, as well as a contingency in case the detonator was discovered\u2014a tracking device hidden more thoroughly on the hull of Cohl's shuttle surrounded by the pod."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When they returned to their vessel, the two Jedi watched as the rest of the pods started launching from the hangar; the Federation was disposing of all cargo.

Soon, Cohl returned to the hangar with some stolen cargo, boarded his pod and left the Revenue, with the Jedi on his tail. Once in space, Jinn and Kenobi discovered that the Federation Lucrehulk-class battleship Acquisitor had responded to the Revenue's commander Daultay Dofine's distress call and had engaged Cohl's pirate fleet.

As Jinn had predicted, Cohl's men discovered the detonator before it exploded and split open the pod, revealing their shuttle. The Jedi did the same and revealed their Lancet, continuing to track the pirates. Unexpectedly, Cohl then pulled back to the Revenue's hangar. Jinn, witnessing that both the pirate ships and the Acquisitor were moving away from the Revenue, correctly guessed that the freighter would soon be destroyed, but he decided to follow Cohl in order to learn his intents.

Believing that the remains of the Revenue would fall down on Dorvalla, Jinn told Kenobi to contact the Jedi Reconciliation Council and tell them that the planet needed immediate emergency relief.

In order to discuss Valorum's proposition in detail, a summit was announced to take place on the planet Eriadu. Through a contact in the Senate, Jinn was made aware of the Trade Federation's request to increase its battle droid army.

On their way to Naboo, Jinn was in a very talkative mood, and he and Kenobi spent their journey to Naboo remembering their past missions and their friends, such as Didi Oddo, Paxxi and Guerra Derida. A shadow of sadness crossed over Jinn when he remembered Tahl, but he brushed the feeling away. Kenobi then asked Jinn to tell him his main flaw as a Padawan.

Approaching the Trade Federation cruiser, Jinn suddenly felt a tinge of uneasiness through the Force, but he could not pinpoint its source before it faded away. Jinn and Kenobi then prepared for the upcoming mission, equipping their utility pouches with food capsules, tools, and medical supplies.

As they were waiting for the Neimoidian, Kenobi expressed to Jinn that he felt something elusive that worried him. Jinn told his Padawan to focus on the moment and assured him that the negotiations would be short, as he believed the Neimoidians to be cowards. However, as Gunray took longer and longer to come, Jinn began feeling uneasy about the mission. Meanwhile, the Neimoidians, on the orders of Darth Sidious, gave a command to kill the ambassadors.

Jinn and Kenobi quickly destroyed the patrol and decided to reach the ship's bridge to confront Gunray personally and inquire into his attempt at killing them. Navigating through the passageways of the Saak'ak, the two soon reached the hangar in which they had landed, finding the destroyed remains of the Radiant VII. However, the hangar turret that had destroyed their ship was still active, preventing the Jedi from crossing the hangar.

Jinn and Kenobi wanted to try reaching the planet's Queen Amidala in the capital city of Theed to warn her of the invasion, but as they heard Binks mentioning his home, the Gungan underwater city of Otoh Gunga, the two decided to enlist help from the natives.

Traversing through a number of such platforms, the two Jedi reached a Trade Federation field command center and had to fight through more droids. Following the path past the camp, they eventually crossed a bridge and moved into a cave, where they faced a Slaatik hagworm creature.

As soon as they entered one of the large bubble-like structures, they were met by a Gungan security squad led by Roos Tarpals. Tarpals placed Binks under arrest for disobeying the terms of his exile, and he and the Jedi were escorted to a meeting with the leader of the Gungans, Boss Rugor Nass.

However, the bongo had been damaged and lost its power, causing the Jedi to land the bongo inside a cave, as Kenobi struggled to restore the power. The cave turned out to be the lair of a colo claw fish, which attacked the submersible. Kenobi was able to fix the bongo's issue, escaping from the cave.

Jinn then left Mos Espa with Binks, Padm\u00e9 and R2-D2, leaving them at the Royal starship and ordering Kenobi to start installing the new hyperdrive, while he returned to Mos Espa to return the eopies and to pick up Skywalker. As he entered the town, Jinn heard a cry for help. Responding to it, he met an alien who claimed that slave traders had attacked his brother. Jinn followed the individual, but was led into a trap, as a number of thugs\u2014including Denno Thuk, Bongor, Diddop and Vomak\u2014attacked him. Jinn easily defeated his opponents and interrogated the individual who had led him into a trap, finding that the criminals had been hired by Watto to prevent him from releasing Skywalker. Putting the individual to sleep with a Force suggestion, Jinn returned to Watto's shop, finding him in conversation with Sebulba.

Jinn then heard Skywalker's voice and witnessed the boy in conflict with a Rodian named Greedo. Greedo accused Skywalker of cheating at the Boonta Eve, and Skywalker beat him in anger. Jinn intervened, stopping Skywalker and telling him that violence was not the right way and he should have displayed tolerance to Greedo. As they set off toward Skywalker's house, Jinn told the boy that he had sold his podracer. At the moment, however, Jinn noticed a sled being pulled by a trio of Verpine slaves. The Verpine were visibly thirsty, but their slave owner refused to give them water. Jinn took it upon himself to give water to the dehydrated being, to which the slave owner responded by trying to attack Jinn with a barbed whip.

Arriving at the Skywalker house, Jinn gave the boy the money for the pod and told him that he was no longer a slave. Jinn, however, also had to break the news that he had been unable to free Shmi as well, but he promised to look after the boy and try to convince the Jedi Council to accept him for Jedi training.

Skywalker avoided the attack, and the attacker jumped from his speeder and engaged Jinn in lightsaber combat. Jinn was surprised to face a Dathomirian Zabrak trained in dark arts and wielding a red-bladed lightsaber all the way on Tatooine, yet he displayed shrewd readiness and parried Maul's attacks.

Using the opportunity to speak to his former Master, Kenobi told him about Skywalker and his growing powers. Just as Jinn had predicted, Skywalker was stronger than any other Jedi, yet he struggled to find balance.

His flagging stamina became a particularly notable issue due to his practice of Ataru, an incredibly tiring combat form even under ideal circumstances. Despite his mastery of Ataru, Jinn was still prey to some of the form's flaws, namely the weak defense and the lack of effectiveness in confined spaces. All these weaknesses came into play during his final duel against Darth Maul. During the duel, Jinn saw an opportunity to redirect the duel to a small melting pit room in the Naboo power core. Jinn hoped to use the confined space to prevent Maul from bringing his saberstaff to bear, giving himself the advantage. However, Maul was aware of what Jinn was attempting to accomplish, and believed that the negative effects that a small space would have on his own technique were negligible compared to the effects it would have on Jinn's. Maul allowed himself to be pushed into the melting pit room, and there, Jinn's strategy backfired as Maul had hoped it would. Closed in, forced onto the defensive, and heavily fatigued from the long duel leading up to this, Jinn was brought down. These flaws in Jinn's technique were apparent enough that Maul reasoned out exactly how he could kill Jinn after less than a minute of being exposed to the Jedi Master's fighting style."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ataru was not Jinn's only fighting style, and he had learned other forms of lightsaber combat, possibly to better handle the weaknesses of Form IV. Being apprenticed to Dooku, the most renowned fencer of the time, it is apparent that Jinn learned the classical dueling form of Makashi from his master and he was versed enough to effectively incorporate its maneuvers into his dueling style. Not only was Form II more effective against a single lightsaber-wielding opponent, but it was also more grounded, as demonstrated in Jinn's duels with Darth Maul. His knowledge was also good enough that he apparently taught Xanatos how to use Makashi. He seemed to have been well-trained in Shien and Soresu, as he could easily handle blaster-wielding opponents. When he and Kenobi fought Taxer Sundown's hypnotized soldiers, who were wielding training lightsabers, he displayed a level of mastery of Shii-Cho shared with Kit Fisto, albeit at a lesser degree."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one point during his training, Jinn tried using a whip, only to find that it \"tangles easily.\" Nonetheless, he had gained some knowledge on how to combat opponents armed with lightwhips, vibro-whips, and other whip-like weapons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During combat, Jinn preferred to adjust his technique based on the needs of the moment, rather than focusing on an overall strategy.
