The compound was the headquarters for Chodo Habat, who was in charge of the Telosian Restoration Project. When the Jedi Exile came to Citadel Station, she helped the Ithorians at the compound expose Czerka Corporation's illegal activities to the Telos Security Force and convince Loppak Slusk of the Exchange to stop harassing the Ithorians. In return, Habat helped restore some of the Exile's connection to the Force. Soon after, the Exile saved Chodo, his assistant Moza, and the rest of the Ithorians at the compound from an attack by Czerka's mercenaries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, when Darth Nihilus attacks Telos IV, the Jedi Exile, combined with troops from Dantooine, Onderon, and others, launch their counter-attack against the Sith forces aboard the station, using the Ithorian Compound as a staging ground."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the Exile chooses to follow the dark side path during Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, then she or he sides with Czerka and stops the Ithorians.
