The Force-user would tap into his/her innermost fears, pain and hate, and convert them into an intense rage. The user could then channel the anger to increase his/her own strength, speed, agility, endurance, stamina and ferocity. However, the body could not handle such rage for long periods of time, so the user became greatly weakened for some time after the rage subsided. If light side Force-users wielded Force rage, it could disrupt their connection to the light side unless something happened to interrupt the rage and bring them out of the dark side's grip. Therefore, the rage could give the wielder an instantaneous physical and mental response, but pull them into deep depression, physiological harm and the endless void of the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Very few Jedi were capable of using and mastering Force rage without falling to the dark side, one of the few examples is Jaden Korr."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This ability possesses similar attributes to Force Body, Force valor, Enhance Attribute and Battlemind, which are generally derived from the light side or are, at the very least, neutral."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Exile learns the Force Rage ability from Kreia in Knights of the Old Republic II if the player chooses the prestige dark side class Sith Marauder or randomly learns it near the end of Malachor V before she enters the Academy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Emperor's Wrath used Force Rage to channel his power, whenever he attacks or is attacked."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Players in Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast multiplayer mode can select Force Rage as one of the powers in their dark side arsenal.
