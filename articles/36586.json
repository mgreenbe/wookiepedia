In 14 BBY, Mors served as the Imperial Moff of the Outer Rim planet of Ryloth. Her underling Colonel Belkor Dray grew frustrated with her leadership and collaborated with the Free Ryloth Movement in an attempt to discredit her. Mors was caught up in a plot by Cham Syndulla to assassinate Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader. In an attempt to unseat her, Belkor collaborated with Cham.

Around the same time, she was assigned to the Outer Rim planet of Ryloth, a post she considered undesirable. Her loss and her assignment felt like a burden, one that made her neglect some of her duties. A known spice addict, she lived a luxurious lifestyle on Ryloth's largest moon while assigning the day to day affairs of her position to her disgruntled underling Colonel Belkor Dray. Mors lived in a luxurious palace and was attended by green-skinned Twi'lek servants, all women and all scantily clad, who moved like pale-green ghosts through the rooms. Although none could leave, the Moff refused to call them slaves. With Dray taken aback by Mors' irresponsible lifestyle and shady contacts, he took it upon himself to actively support a growing resistance movement on the planet in an attempt to tarnish Mors' reputation and place himself in command."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Calm before the storm"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY, Colonel Belkor visited Moff Mors at her luxurious palace on Ryloth's moon. The Moff was meeting with Nashi the Hutt, an envoy of the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. After Belkor arrived, Mors concluded her meeting with Nashi and allowed her to leave with three cases of Theenwine. When Nashi made a joke about Belkor in Huttese, Mors translated that he was as straight and rigid as a tree. Mors described Belkor as a young ambitious officer. Following Nashi's departure, Mors turned her attention to Belkor and asked if he despised her for her decadence and her dealings with the Hutts ."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Belkor denied this was the case and claimed that rank came with privilege, concealing his disdain for her. Belkor then proceeded to deliver Mors his quarterly report, which the Moff took little interest in. When Mors inquired about the Free Ryloth \"terrorists\", Belkor reported that he had dispatched his best assets to deal with the case and that things on Ryloth had been quiet for a month. Mors then mentioned a recent failed attempt by the Free Ryloth Movement to hijack an Imperial weapons shipment.

Unknown to Mors, Belkor planned to arrange for the Free Ryloth Movement to assassinate Orn Free Taa so that he could pin the blame on Mors.

Belkor claimed his resources were limited and that they did not normally patrol that far away from the planet. In truth, Belkor had diverted patrol craft and flight clearances in a way that had allowed Cham to move his ships into position. To ameliorate Mors, Belkor suggested calling for all available repair ships to give to the Perilous. Mors obliged and allowed Belkor to manage the relief efforts"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Belkor went to dispatch repair ships, Mors conferred with another official and learned that the Emperor and Darth Vader were indeed aboard the Perilous.

Breehld, Mors' pilot, informed her of the news. This was a shocking development for Mors because this was the first time that an Imperial Star Destroyer had been destroyed. Mors feared that her career was in tatters as a result of the ambush. Mors then contacted Belkor who informed her that Lord Vader and the Emperor had escaped the Perilous's destruction. Since there were many survivors landing in escape pods, Belkor directed Breehld to assist in rescuing the Emperor and Vader.

Borkas revealed that he had intercepted a transmission indicating that the rebels knew that Vader and the Emperor had escaped on a shuttle.

After questioning Meensa, Mors learned that Belkor had told the pilots that they would end up having to attack a ground target based on coordinates.

Belkor eventually discovered that the Sith Lords had taken refuge in a local village. By that stage, Cham and his forces had converged on the village for an assault.

She and Steen landed their ships on either side of the Twi'lek forces in the quarry. This allowed the Imperial stormtroopers to trap Cham's attack force. Mors remained aboard the ship for the duration of the assault and watched Vader slaying rebel soldiers with his lightsaber.

She dispatched fighters to search for the freighter, which, unbeknownst to the Moff, was actually a smuggling ship called the Eclipse that had been hired by the Free Ryloth Movement to bring in a shipment of medicine for an outbreak of disease on Ryloth. The fighters were able to track the freighter to Lessu, but after landing briefly on the city's shell to deliver its cargo, the Eclipse was able to evade its pursuers and escape back into hyperspace.
