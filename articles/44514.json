They were distinguished by the orange markings on their head and shoulders, though they sometimes had an identical appearance to that of a B1 battle droid. Their programming allowed for the operation of virtually every vehicle-allied or otherwise in existence. They would usually engage their targets from close range."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Overview"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their advanced programming allowed them to easily adapt to the controls of most vehicles. They were also effective at repairing damaged vehicles as well as slicing into enemy vehicles for capture or sabotage. Their armament included a shotgun, detonation packs, and a F-187 fusioncutter.
