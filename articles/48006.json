A grappling hook was usually attached to the end. Jango Fett employed this device against Obi-Wan Kenobi when they fought on Kamino in 22 BBY. Boba Fett used a fibercord whip against Chewbacca when he suspected him of attacking Luke Skywalker. The bounty hunter would also use that device to ensnare Skywalker at the Great Pit of Carkoon in 4 ABY. Skywalker struggled, but managed to sever the cord with a blaster bolt deflected using his lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
