He kept many locations, such as smugglers' hideouts and possible mining locations, to himself, often selling them to the local Hutt crimelords. During the Galactic Civil War, Telowe found himself the object of an intense search, ostensibly led by his long-lost sister, Masda Telowe. However, Masda turned out to be his former wife, whom he had left on Esseles with a huge debt to repay. Masda hired a group of bounty hunters to trail her after she hired some local guides to help track down Telowe. The scouts managed to find Telowe in a canyon cave, and he was approached by his wife and the bounty hunters to seek her revenge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arden Telowe appears in the article Secrets of Mos Eisley in 2001's Star Wars Gamer 7."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
