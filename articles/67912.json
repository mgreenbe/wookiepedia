They also had at least one settlement on the planet Takobo, known as Hammertown. Their natural habitat was forest or jungle. They had a unique set of twin mouths on opposite sides of their necks. They were called leathernecks as an insult by Imperial stormtroopers. Their unique throat structure prevented them from speaking Galactic Basic Standard, although an Ithorian technician appeared to be able to speak it. There were a number of devices that allowed translation from Ithorese into Basic. The Ottegan species were a genetic offshoot of the Ithorians, and had a similar physiology."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most Ithorians were peaceful and revered nature.
