Despite prosperity brought by closer ties with the Republic, historical practises do not disappear, and so while species from abroad are treated as guests, the Heaven system's natives were never liberated. While Sean states that such discriminations are in breach of Republic values and suggests that Republic intervention would solve the issue, An Ping interjects, expressing disappointment in Sean's faith in the Republic to shine its light on the shadows of the Heaven system's corruption; where there is light, there is always darkness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sean admits that the Republic is imperfect, and knows in his heart that the Republic must have knowledge of the racial persecution occurring in its allied system\u2014and yet does nothing about it. Without his master, Sean realizes that he must solve the situation by himself. An Ping hammers in his point: as beings of similar status as monkey-lizards, the Dragon people, even if set free by Republic legal mandate, will remain precious testing material for Summer Moist Pharmaceuticals, and as a mega-corporation, they will not let go; measures, such as seemingly innocuous contracts signed at birth and laws that allow the reclamation of anyone attempting to breach said contracts, are in place to ensure continual control over those people's lives as medical supply. Ultimately, the Heaven system's laws are in place to restrict individual freedoms and rights. The Padawan, having na\u00efvely believed in the system of law, is left torn and undecided."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The plot thickens"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Feeling that the secrets of Zhuang Yuanying and her people are tied to his investigation of the Heaven system, Sean delves into the underground base's database for information on the dragon people. Data show that the people were active long before colonists first arrived, and reliable records of them gradually decreased to zero three centuries past. With horns on the head and supernatural physical prowess, the Dragon people once served as religious leaders in the early phases of colonization, telling fortunes, making offerings, and praying for rainfall, leaving a legacy of legends and folklore amongst the colonists, such as the dragon people summoning winds and rains and controlling the weathers of entire worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The records also reveal that as the colonists' civilization evolved, the dragon people were ostracized from society and blamed for misfortunes. The people were gradually persecuted by the colonists, long before the time of the Heaven-earth corporation. Sean thus determined that as long as the wheels of history continue to repeat itself, even the dismantling of the corporation would not stop the persecution of the dragon people."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Chapters"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Promotional posters"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
