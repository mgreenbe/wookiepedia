They were black in color and had six legs, each of which contained a different weapon. However, while the droids were originally intended to be disposable, their design became complicated and they cost 20,270 each to manufacture, and due to their price, the CSA considered them to be less expendable than organic operatives. During the waning years of the Galactic Republic, an MRD-39B droid was dispatched to assassinate the Republic agent Klieri, inside her apartment in the city Locus on the planet Nyriaan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
