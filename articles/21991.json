Accompanied by Vebb and Jedi Master Kit Fisto, the group searched for Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, who had been recently freed from Republic captivity. Unbeknownst to the group, Gunray, along with Confederate Head of State Count Dooku, had laid a trap for the Jedi, using a homing beacon to deceive the Jedi and make them believe that Gunray was hiding in a castle on the moon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the group realized that they had fallen for a trap, the Confederate General Grievous arrived at the castle, which was in fact his personal retreat. The Jedi and clone troopers tried to capture Grievous, but after a short brawl with the Republic squad, the cyborg general fled to the stronghold's secret command center. After Grievous opened a molten incinerator pit trap, which was under Fil and the Jedi, the cyborg general released his pet roggwart, Gor, to attack them. Fil was caught by the beast, which used its tail to grab the commander. The Jedi tried to free him, but Fil was killed when Gor slammed the clone on the ground.

Fisto denied Fil's use of a thermal detonator to open the lair's door, and instead pressed a secret stone that activated the entrance. After they entered the castle, the group made their way to a room called the \"sanctum overlook,\" where a faint voice was heard. A number of B1-Series battle droids were talking to Gunray, who, unbeknownst to the Jedi and clones, was in holographic form in order to lure the Jedi into the trap. Once the group dispatched the droids, however, Vebb used the Force to turn Gunray's chair around, revealing the hologram of the Viceroy. After Gunray activated a homing beacon near his chair, his hologram faded away. Dooku contacted the Jedi, telling the group that while Gunray was unavailable for capture, he offered them an unnamed alternative prize. Fisto and Vebb knew that they had been tricked into the lair, and it was some form of a trap. Fil was worried about the current situation after the group walked down a dark hallway. Upon witnessing Kaleesh statues and replacement cyborg masks, Fisto indicated that they were in the lair of the Confederate General Grievous.

Fil ordered his men to use grappling hooks to hold Grievous, while Vebb and Fisto tried to finish Grievous off. Grievous released himself from the clones, but Fisto severed Grievous's cyborg body in half from the waist down. The cyborg general fled from the area and entered the lair's secret command center.

Fil contacted Bel and Niner, who were guarding their shuttle, and ordered them to contact their fleet, which was near the Inner Rim planet of Bestine IV, for more clone trooper reinforcements. However, one of Grievous's IG-100 MagnaGuards used a missile launcher to kill the clones. In the command center, Grievous revealed a trap to the surviving Republic squad and opened a molten incinerator pit, which was under Fil and one remaining clone trooper. Fil and the remaining trooper fell into the pit; the other clone was killed, but the commander fired his grappling hook, and with the help of Vebb and Fisto, managed to save himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grievous then decided to release his pet roggwart, Gor, to attack the group.

However, when Vebb stabbed Gor in the back with his lightsaber, Gor used his long tail to lift Fil off the ground. As Gor held onto Fil with his tail, both of the Jedi tried to save the clone commander, but it was too late. Fisto slashed at the roggwart's face with his lightsaber; Fil was slammed onto the floor by Gor and was instantly killed on impact.
