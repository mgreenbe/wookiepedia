At the end of the New Sith Wars, it was the site of the Battle of Hsskhor, after the battle the city was razed to the ground. Over time it would be rebuilt and it would be the location of the Hsskhor Tally-house Meeting Halls, within which peace talks between the Trandoshans and the Wookiees were held prior to the outbreak of the Clone Wars. During the Clone Wars, the planet itself played an important role, as negotiation stirred up between Bant Eerin's Padawan and then War Chief Raikhssa for Trandosha and its militia to stay way from part-taking in the conflict. Hsskhor was also the location of the magnificent Warlord's Palace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
