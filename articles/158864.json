As Darth Vader approaches, the Commander introduces C-3PO and R2-D2, two droids that the Imperials have captured. C-3PO attempts to introduce himself, but Vader silences the droid, addressing R2-D2 instead. C-3PO tries to inform Vader that R2 is not programmed for communication, but he is ignored. As Vader leads R2 back to his shuttle, C-3PO frantically follows, not wanting to be left behind. After docking with the Executor, the Captain is informed that Vader and his prisoners are not to be disturbed. In his private quarters, Vader asks for R2 to join him and turn to the dark side so that they can bring order to the galaxy. R2 refuses Vader's request, and he turns and flees from Dark Lord. In response, Vader tells R2 that if he will not turn, then perhaps C-3PO will. 3PO, frightened, runs from Vader, but haphazardly smashes into several parts of the ship, finally falling near the lip of a carbon-freezing chamber. Vader joins C-3PO next to the freezing chamber and informs the droid that R2 never told him what happened to his creator. C-3PO claims that R2 told him that Vader killed his creator. Vader corrects the droid, stating that he is C-3PO's creator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "C-3PO is shocked by the revelation, but he rationalizes that he would not have remembered since he had a memory wipe some time earlier. Vader attempts to use the Force to make C-3PO remember, but he is stopped by R2, who pulls a lightsaber from inside his chassis and begins to duel Vader. Using his rocket boosters R2 is able to swipe Vader's lightsaber out of his hand. With a final swing, R2 removes the chest control panel on Vader's armor. With his armor damaged, Vader's respiratory functions begin to shut down, and he is unable to breathe. C-3PO decides that this is his time to escape, and he turns to run. However, he crashes into the side of the carbon-freezing chamber and falls backwards into Vader. Vader falls into the freezing chamber and is sealed in carbonite. As the carbonite slab with Vader inside is pulled out of the chamber, both R2 and 3PO exclaim, \"Cool!!\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This story mimics several of the lines from both Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi for comedic effect.
