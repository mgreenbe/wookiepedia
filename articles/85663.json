Mal was assigned to the Old Galactic Market commercial district of Galactic City. In the aftermath of some riots, the Old Galactic Market had been overrun by refugees and a criminal organization known as the Migrant Merchants' Guild. The Guild claimed to protect the interests of the refugees, but in reality, it demanded protection money and was involved in illegal actives such as money laundering and smuggling. Though the CSF had been able to retake a portion of the Galactic Market, most of it remained under the Guild's control. a Nautolan named Nik Deleru reported to Mal that his mate, Ria Deleru, had been taken by the Guild.

He was dedicated to his job and felt it was his duty to protect. Faced with the struggles of the refugees, Mal believed that since they had no business living in the Old Galactic Market, any situation in which they became involved was partially of their own doing. The refugees in turn blamed the CSF for not stopping the Guild. Tired of being blamed for their problems by the refugees, Mal nevertheless cared for their plight. Yet with the CSF's lack of manpower and resources, he was unable to get involved and help the refugees with problems involving the Guild.
