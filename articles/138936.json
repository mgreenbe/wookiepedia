During his time in CorSec, he trained Dathnaeya Loessin who later became one of CorSec's most promising officers. By the time of the Battle of Yavin, Taarna was still on duty, assigned to the city of Nashal, on the planet Talus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 1 ABY, Agent Taarna discovered that a group of local smugglers had captured several Selonians of the Neetha Den and were keeping them as hostages in order to exploit the rest of the den. However, he was unable to intervene because CorSec could not interfere with Selonians matters. Agent Taarna thus recruited an independent spacer who previously worked with Captain Baize in order to help the Selonians without involving the CorSec. The spacer successfully crippled the smugglers and their ability to exploit the Selonians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the same time, the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic was growing ever more intense. Agent Taarna's prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Dathnaeya Loessin was facing a personal crisis and believed she could no longer stand on the side without involving herself. However, she did not know which side to take. She discussed her trouble with Taarna but her mentor was not able to help her without harming his position in the CorSec. After the resolution of the crisis between the Selonians and the smugglers, Agent Taarna realized that the spacer who assisted him so efficiently on that case was the best help Dathnaeya could receive. He thus arranged a meeting in Dearic between the spacer and Dathnaeya. Dathnaeya then tasked the spacer to work with Captain Quellium and Colonel Ekirk, respectively Rebel and Imperial officers. After achieving several missions for both officers, the spacer made a detailed report to Dathnaeya Loessin who eventually decided to join one of the factions in the Galactic Civil War. Her only regret was that her choice would prevent her to work with Taarna again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later the same year, Agent Taarna led the investigation concerning a starship that crashed in the mountains near Nashal. Taarna dispatched a spacer to investigate the area and rescue any survivors. However, the spacer quickly realized that the crash site was invaded by oversized and aggressive arachnes. The spacer then found evidences that the ship was carrying bioengineered arachnes. The spacer also discovered that most of the crew members and scientists survived the crash but they were attacked and overwhelmed by the creatures. The spacer therefore visited the survivors' camp and only found dead bodies and a damaged droid. CV-4T narrated the awful events that took place earlier and helped the spacer to locate the rest of the survivors. However, the spacer finally discovered that the other group, including Captain Narl, had already been slaughtered by the arachnes. Agent Taarna later determined that the crashed ship took off from Dearic and a CorSec scout team found a laboratory near Dearic undergoing an emergency evacuation. The lab was owned by the GeneTech Syndicate and listed as engaging in legitimate genetic manipulation on animal. Nevertheless, Taarna was suspicious and sent spacers out to investigate the laboratory. When the spacers arrived at the lab, they immediately figured out that the building was overrun by bioengineered arachnes and most of the staff had been slaughtered by the creatures. The spacers downloaded data that revealed that the project was dubbed Parasophic Arachne. Taarna therefore ordered his CorSec crew to clear the lab. With the help of 6-POC, the project manager's protocol droid, the spacers managed to delete all scientific data that could be used to restart the program. They also retrieved a self-destruct intron virus, a virus designed specifically to kill the arachnes, and injected it into every arachne eggs they found in the lab. Agent Taarna eventually tasked the spacer to eliminate the arachne queen, a gigantic arachne responsible for breeding the parasophic arachnes. The destruction of all the breeding arachnes and eggs definitely eliminated the Parasophic Arachne threat. After the planet Talus was saved from the bioenineered arachnes, the CorSec targeted the escaped Genetech Syndicate scientists and filed a complaint with the Imperial Research Division against the GeneTech Syndicate for carrying out class 5 biological experiments on an inhabited world. Nevertheless, Agent Taarna was very pessimistic about the chances of success of this investigation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taarna later sent the spacers who helped him to work with his old friend Jornel Savas, a Corsec agent on Corellia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taarna appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
