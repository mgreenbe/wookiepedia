It was little more than a hubba-shaped lump of rock, barely ten kilometers from end to end and so blanketed in dust that its thousands of craters had a soft, almost featureless look from orbit. It was the location of Supply Depot Thrago, belonging to the Chiss. Jacen Solo tricked a number of Jedi Knights, including Jaina Solo, Zekk, Tahiri Veila, Tesar Sebatyne and Lowbacca, into believing the Chiss were planning a preemptive strike on the Killiks. The Jedi used StealthXs to help Jacen attack Thrago, provoking the Chiss to attack the Killiks, as Jacen intended."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
