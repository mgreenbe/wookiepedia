Owing to their armor and weapons, garbage chute sensors believed that they were recyclable waste. Omi, a Force-sensitive carnivorous dianoga, proceeded to baptize Skywalker in accordance to her people's tradition. Luke and his companions would nearly die when the masher's walls started to close in order to compress the waste it contained. However, Skywalker's droids C-3PO and R2-D2, who had remained behind in safety, managed to disable all garbage compactors on the Detention Level of the Death Star, thus saving the rescue team from a gruesome death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
