When the planet was conquered by the Rakata, they burned his city and imprisoned the survivors. Brought out onto a cliff on the outskirts of the ruined city with a young boy named Lonai and the boy's father, the three knelt shackled before Predor Tul'kar as the Force Hound Xesh determined who among them was Forceful. Determining him to be capable of touching the Force, the Rakatan guards killed Lonai and the boy's father before escorting the Forceful Kumumgah to a ship which would take him offworld for enslavement."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
