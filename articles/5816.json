After Ordo and the clone commandos of Omega Squad neutralized a terrorist cell on Coruscant, Maze attended a victory celebration held by Kal Skirata. When the men performed the Mandalorian war chant, Dha Werda Verda, Ordo got his just desserts, with Maze \"accidentally\" punching him in the mouth several times.

From this point on, Ordo feels he and Maze have a tacit understanding."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the war progressed, Maze used his downtime to read, and developed strong opinions about the state of the Republic.

Ordo demanded to know from a wounded Zey if the Jedi did indeed try to overthrow Palpatine. Zey admitted to as much, stating that it was his duty as Palpatine had revealed himself to be a Sith Lord, known as Darth Sidious. Most tellingly, Maze wondered what the Sith were and Ordo explained that they were the exact opposite of the Jedi. Ordo left the two, Zey wounded slouching in a chair, and Maze with his blaster drawn, begging Zey to come quietly and as if he was just arresting him. Zey issued his last order, and asked Maze to execute him, as he knew what would happen if he was captured alive. Maze did not comply and missed Zey on purpose, giving Ordo the idea that he executed Zey. Later Maze contacted the Skirata Clan and asked for refuge on Kyrimorut on Mandalore. Bardan Jusik was sent to retrieve Maze and unexpectedly met with Zey who was with Maze. After arriving on Mandalore, the two greeted a stunned and surprised Ordo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
