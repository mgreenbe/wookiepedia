The Yuuzhan Vong, augmented by the Ylesian Republic, had three cruisers in the system, being outnumbered three to one by Admiral Kre'fey's fleet of nine. After jamming the planetary yammosk, Kre'fey sent in the Jedi commanded squadrons first. Once they had destroyed or crippled the Yuuzhan Vong cruisers, the fleet positioned itself in orbit, and proceeded to orbitally bombard Duro, attacking any Warrior grashals, Shaper damuteks, and starports housing the enemy. At this point, seven additional Yuuzhan Vong capital ships arrived. Kre'fey, however, decided to play it safe, and ordered the fleet to withdraw to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
