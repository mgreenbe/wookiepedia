Being too slow to avoid the blaster fire, he was damaged by the Death Watch. When R2-D2 was sent to repair them, battle droid 513 and the other droids implored him to reassemble them. While the Death Watch went to the Ming Po town and engaged Tano, R2-D2 successfully repaired the droids. When R2-D2 observed Tano captured by the Death Watch he asked the droids, including battle droid 513, to help him rescue her. R2-D2 managed to distract the Death Watch and passed Tano her lightsabers. As she dueled Pre Vizsla, the leader of Death Watch, the fight, as well as the warriors shifted outside. There, with Bonteri, R2-D2, and the other droids, battle droid 513 engaged the warriors.
