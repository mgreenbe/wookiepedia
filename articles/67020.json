IntSec was charged with the physical security of Imperial Intelligence's facilities and personnel. Originally considered a posting for those who were unambitious, IntSec revamped itself in the wake of the increasing threat posed by the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Their personnel and procedures were upgraded and retooled; however, the stigma of their previous incarnation remained and they were often the butt of jokes through Intelligence. IntSec personnel were the only Intelligence personnel permitted to openly carry weapons. They also employed plainclothes operatives who patrolled outside Intelligence installations to spot and contain potential threats before they arose."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point during the Empire's reign, Ysanne Isard served as the Security Director of Internal Security."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Internal Security Branch was first mentioned in Imperial Sourcebook.
