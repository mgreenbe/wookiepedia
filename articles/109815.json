Once, while trapped by a group of Zygerrian slavers in a building in Reestkii along with the people of the village, Bobbajo spun a fantastic yarn of how Qyp and other animals that traveled with him brought down the Galactic Empire's Death Star. Qyp was said to have faced down an Imperial astromech droid and then disabled the battle station's tractor beam. Later, he supposedly rescued Mideyean, another of Bobbajo's creatures, from a dianoga, then darted back-and-forth to confuse a probe droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
