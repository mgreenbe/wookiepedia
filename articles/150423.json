The list was created by Vicendi in 10,000 BBY as part of Arturum Galactinum, a commissioned work for the anniversary of the Galactic Republic. The list was criticized by some for emphasizing antiquity, those items linked to the formation of the Republic, and the Core Worlds. Other cultures, such as the Hutts, Bothans, Caamasi, and Humanocentrists created their own lists of wonders. The Galactic Empire, via its Imperial Ministry of Education, had a rewritten list called the Glorius Imperica, which focused mainly on Human High Culture. Many of the wonders were lost to time, but were famous in their own right nonetheless."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Twenty Wonders"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Twenty Wonders of the Galaxy were first mentioned in the sourcebook Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds.
