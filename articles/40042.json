During the battle, Corobb was slain by General Grievous, leaving Lo'gaan without a master. Soon after, Anakin Skywalker sent Lo'gaan to Felucia to aid in the ongoing battle on that world. There, he met Ekria and Zonder, fellow masterless Padawans, and he witnessed the enactment of Order 66. Fleeing back to Coruscant with his new friends, he lived his life on the run from the Inquisitorius, particularly Antinnis Tremayne."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The trio of Padawans eventually became freelance crime-fighters in Coruscant's underworld, and were involved in a Black Sun plot. Though they thought themselves safe at first, their dealings with Prince Xizor put them in grave danger, and resulted in the death of Zonder at the hands of Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith. Lo'gaan and Ekria sought revenge, and planned to assassinate Vader on Tepasi, but they had a contingency plan in place, in case the attempt failed. Lo'gaan unsuccessfully dueled with Vader, but survived the encounter thanks to trickery on Ekria's part, and the pair were able to live their lives in solitude, believed dead by the agents of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Padawan Learner"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Accepted into the Jedi Temple and the Jedi Order as an infant, Drake Lo'gaan, as per normal protocol, was trained as a youngling in the hopes of becoming a Jedi Knight's Padawan.

During Corobb's final mission, however, the pair would be separated. The Confederacy of Independent Systems invaded Coruscant, with the intent of capturing Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Corobb was one of the Masters tasked with defending the Chancellor, while Lo'gaan was left to fight the invading armies. As the battle began to wind down, Lo'gaan, on a speeder bike, sped to the Chancellor's safe house and engaged a cadre of General Grievous's IG-100 MagnaGuards. While he was fighting them, however, a group of clone commandos under the command of Stass Allie dispatched the droids. Allie, one of the other Masters tasked with defending the Chancellor, had lost contact with Masters Corobb, Moudama, and Ti."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Waiting to gain entry to the safe house, the group heard a scream of anguish from within. Realizing that Grievous must be inside, the group hurriedly entered into the bunker, searching for the occupants. Meeting up with Mace Windu, they reached the main area of the bunker, only to find Shaak Ti incapacitated, with Masters Corobb and Moudama slain. Neither Grievous nor Palpatine were in sight. Lo'gaan, distraught, cradled the body of his dead master.

He met Skywalker in the Temple one day, and asked him if he could join in the hunt for Grievous on Utapau. Skywalker explained that Master Kenobi had been chosen to hunt the General instead, but the Hero With No Fear sympathized with Lo'gaan. Lo'gaan accompanied the Jedi Knight to the staging grounds, where Skywalker gave the Council's orders to Stass Allie. Allie was to deliver reinforcements to Felucia, where Shu Mai had released deadly toxins into the water supplies. Skywalker, making an executive decision, told Lo'gaan to go with Allie, and join the Felucia task force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At Felucia, Lo'gaan met up with Masters Aayla Secura and Barriss Offee with the 327th Star Corps, as well as fellow Padawans Ekria and Zonder. The Padawans were tasked with securing a water supply station at Jiaozi, while the two masters dealt with the cities of Niango and Har Gau. Lo'gaan, showing initiative, devised a plan to lure away the Felucian resistance guarding the plant. The Selonian Zonder roared loudly, causing the Gossam and battle droid guards to attack. After a brief skirmish, Lo'gaan and the troops feigned a retreat, leading the enemy further into Felucia's jungles. They were able to reach the station before the planet wide toxins had reached it, allowing Ekria to halt the advance of the poisonous fumes.

Ekria attempted to bring the first-person cameras built into the clone trooper helmets up on the station's viewscreen, but as she did, she detected a message from Coruscant, bearing Confederate encryption. As Ekria attempted to decrypt it, the Padawans witnessed the murder of the Masters on the viewscreen. Shocked and saddened, the Padawans sought an answer to the sudden reversal of the clone troopers' allegiance. Ekria finally decrypted the message: a hologram ordering Commander CC-5052 to \"execute Order 66.\" Shortly thereafter, the Padawans received a top-priority message from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, telling them that the war was over, and that they were to return to the Jedi Temple.

Jedi were considered enemies of the Galactic Empire, and were to be killed on sight. As such, the Padawans had to limit their use of the Force to a bare minimum, so as to avoid detection. The group began to believe they were the only Jedi left in the galaxy, but Ekria had faith that they were simply in hiding, and would return to Coruscant to right Palpatine's wrongs. To start with, the trio infiltrated the abandoned Jedi Temple, and Ekria erased all traces of them from the Jedi Archives. They sought refuge in the Coruscant Underworld, but barely scraped together enough credits to feed themselves. Lo'gaan ventured into local gambling dens, influencing the outcome of dice games to his favor, so that the group was able to buy food. One time, in the Uscru Entertainment District, Lo'gaan was detected as being underage, and stormtroopers swept in to apprehend him. He was aided in his escape by Zonder and Ekria, but he had to use the Force to quell the stormtrooper advance.

She told Lo'gaan and Zonder to get honest jobs. Lo'gaan, aged 13, with no documentation, guardians, and a death mark on his head, was skeptical as to his ability to get a job. Wandering into Employment Center D4176, he was told by several members of the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order that he was in a Non-Human Only area. Passing himself off as \"Jodd Sonta,\" he was led by the COMPNOR members to the Jrade District and separated from Zonder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the Jrade District, Lo'gaan attended a COMPNOR Sub-Adult Group function, hosted by Inquisitor Antinnis Tremayne. During a speech, Tremayne preached Human superiority, and claimed that Palpatine had great faith in the Sub-Adult Group. He also mentioned that SAGroup members would be above curfew, and that there were several career openings available for members. Lo'gaan, interested, joined the SAGroup. However, his presence was detected by Tremayne and his fellow Inquisitor Halmere, if not his identity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ekria disapproved of Lo'gaan's career choice, but the young Padawan passed it off as an infiltration mission. He was able to provide Ekria with ample credits, and Zonder was doing well in his new job as a construction worker.

Wary, though, the Padawans found a new hiding place."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lo'gaan, or \"Sonta,\" was assigned to security detail, at transport platform DN6-4435. There, he met Onnelly Praji, a young girl who was departing for \"Emerald Splendor,\" a resort where Zonder was due to be shipped in several days' time. As Praji departed, Lo'gaan was ordered by a dock hand to not mix the girl's belongings in with those of the Non-Humans. When Lo'gaan learned that the belongings of the Non-Humans were to be liquidated, he realized that Zonder was going to become a slave. As he attempted to flee the platform, he was set upon by stormtroopers, who had been ordered by Tremayne to detain him. Tremayne had discovered that \"Sonta's\" backstory didn't quite match up, and so the Inquisitor deduced that he was the elusive Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reaching Ekria's new hideout, Lo'gaan marveled at the sheer size of the location. Apparently, an elderly widow from Qiilura had bequeathed her apartment to the Jedi Order, and Ekria had manipulated the holding rights to her favor. She informed Lo'gaan that his cover was blown at COMPNOR before showing him the arsenal of weaponry and armor that she had compiled. Disguising himself with a modified clone trooper helmet, he set out with Ekria to rescue Zonder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pair successfully infiltrated the slave ship, but Ekria was unable to pinpoint Zonder's exact location. While Lo'gaan worked through Zonder's possible locations, he encountered Inquisitor Tremayne. Tremayne, taunting Lo'gaan, revealed Zonder to be on Level Nine of the ship, and Ekria, who had been listening, hurriedly traveled there. She saved Zonder, who insisted on liberating his fellow slaves. Meanwhile, Lo'gaan engaged Tremayne in a lightsaber duel, with the Inquisitor goading the Padawan with promises of respect and power. Lo'gaan did not falter, however, and with a swift kick to Tremayne's jaw was able to defeat the Inquisitor. Tremayne was not to be bested, however, and ordered the execution of Zonder. Inquisitors Halmere, Ap-Llewff, and Pasiq were dispatched to stop the slave riot, but were soundly beaten back by Zonder and Ekria. Stormtroopers began to open fire, and Tremayne ordered the lockdown of the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lo'gaan was reunited with his friends, and they were able to reach a skiff to escape, but Lo'gaan doubled back. He found Praji, and told her of what the Empire planned to do with the aliens. He surmised that if she went with them on the slave ship, she would never return. Tremayne finally caught up with Lo'gaan before he could tell her anything else, but the Padawan quickly jumped out a nearby window, escaping the Inquisitor's wrath.

Lo'gaan took on the adopted alias of \"Spike,\" with Ekria as \"Blue\" and Zonder as \"Paws.\" One night, they stopped a band of Nashtah Gang thugs from robbing an Omwati couple, Kodo and Aleema Finn.

However, the bounty hunter Boushh, who had been hired by Xizor to succeed where the Nashtahs had failed, burst into the residence, using explosives. Zonder escorted the Omwati couple away from the scene, while Lo'gaan stayed and fought with the Ubese hunter. While they were grappling, stormtroopers burst into the residence, surrounding the two combatants.

The Padawans knew that Xizor Transport was actually a Black Sun front, explaining the attacks. The group journeyed to Xizor's headquarters, where they battled guards and droidekas. Entering the Prince's office, Lo'gaan was able to convince Xizor to discontinue the bounty on Finn's head, and allow him to leave Coruscant, in exchange for TaggeCo intelligence. Xizor agreed, but warned Finn to never return. Xizor had left tracking devices on the Padawans as they left, hoping to glean the location of their hideout, but Ekria was able to locate them, and attached the devices to a set of rodents, throwing off the trail.

Lo'gaan and Ekria traveled to his last known location, seeking clues. By this time, Zonder had been delivered into the clutches of the Inquisitorius, and Darth Vader. Vader took Zonder's communicator, and activated it, transmitting a holographic image of what was transpiring inside the Inquisitorius headquarters to the Padawans. Lo'gaan looked on in horror as Zonder dueled with the Dark Lord, a one-sided duel resulting in the Selonian's decapitation. Distraught, Lo'gaan resolved to destroy Vader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lo'gaan trained hard for his predicted encounter with Vader, while Ekria tracked down the Dark Lord's location. She determined that Vader would be leaving for Tepasi from platform NL1922. She also learned that Vader's intent was to confront Baron Tagge, over a political dispute. As the pair departed for NL1922, Ekria detonated several charges within their home, effectively destroying it. A Low Altitude Assault Transport, carrying Inquisitor Tremayne. The Inquisitor, with the help of Imperial Intelligence Director Armand Isard, had tracked down the location of the remaining Padawans. A harrowing chase ensued through Imperial City, until Lo'gaan finally reached NL1922. Ekria was forced to escape, though, due to the heavy fire from the gunship. Sure enough, Vader was making ready to depart when Lo'gaan landed on the platform. Cutting his way through Vader's stormtroopers, Lo'gaan was eventually subdued by the Dark Lord's Noghri bodyguards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The captive of Vader, Lo'gaan was subjected to the Dark Lord's tales of the Jedi Rebellion as the shuttle sped towards Tepasi. Vader also knew Lo'gaan's real name; a fact that piqued the young Padawan's curiosity. Though Lo'gaan did not know it, Vader was in fact Anakin Skywalker, transformed and twisted into a Sith by Palpatine. He told the young Padawan that the Jedi had been plotting to overthrow Palpatine, and that Mace Windu and Shaak Ti had slain Roron Corobb, not Grievous. He also told Lo'gaan that Anakin Skywalker had been murdered by Obi-Wan Kenobi. Vader then invited Lo'gaan to join the Inquisitorius, but unlike his earlier encounter with Tremayne, Lo'gaan began to have second thoughts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader arrived on Tepasi, demanding to speak with Baron Orman Tagge, while Lo'gaan was kept in tow. Meanwhile, Ekria, who had managed to commandeer the freighter Casuistic, was able to convince the Baron to inspect the foundries. Vader found the Baron, and began to throttle the unarmed Tagge. Lo'gaan was outraged, and threw away all doubts he had about Vader. The Dark Lord ignored him, however, and proceeded to blind the Baron with his lightsaber. At that moment, Ekria, who had made her way to Tepasi, revealed herself, and opened fire on the Imperials. She threw an electromagnetic grenade at Vader, incapacitating the Dark Lord and disabling Lo'gaan's binding cuffs. CC-5052 (Commander Bly), who had been given the opportunity by Vader to finally complete his mission from Felucia, barged into the room with his troops, and opened fire on Ekria.

Feigning rage, Lo'gaan viciously attacked CC-5052 and his troops, incapacitating them. He then collapsed, seemingly distraught. Vader loomed over him, goading him to give into his anger and embrace the dark side of the Force. Lo'gaan responded by activating a nearby magnet, which grasped Vader's lightsaber, before the Dark Lord crushed the machine with the Force. However, Lo'gaan was able to get to Vader's saber first, while the Dark Lord was forced to call upon the fallen Ekria's saber. Unbeknownst to Vader, Ekria had in fact altered the workings of her saber to give it approximately the same power as that of a youngling's training saber. Vader began dueling with Lo'gaan. Though Lo'gaan was much younger and less experienced than Vader, he was able to hold his ground until CC-5052 shot him in the back.

He had no qualms in cheating people out of their money, so long as they were able to survive, but Ekria soon changed his view on the matter. When he joined COMPNOR, he savored the respect he was given, claiming that it reminded him of his time as a Jedi. Eventually, Lo'gaan dedicated his skills not to preserving himself, but helping others in need. In his time as a crime fighter, he willingly risked his life for the safety of total strangers, and asked for nothing else in return. When helping the Finns, he put his identity in jeopardy, a choice that would later result in the death of his friend, Zonder.
