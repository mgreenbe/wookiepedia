He gave it to her for good fortune, and so she would remember him once he left for the Jedi Order. Years later, after Skywalker and Amidala had fallen in love and secretly married, Amidala still wore the japor snippet around her neck. After her death on Polis Massa, and Skywalker's fall to the dark side of the Force, the japor snippet adorned Amidala's body during her funeral on Naboo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The snippet was later stored inside a glass case, outside Amidala's tomb on Naboo. When Skywalker, now Darth Vader, was investigating the cover-up behind his wife's true death, his search led him to the tomb. Upon seeing the snippet, Vader was reminded of when he first gave the snippet to Amidala. He also thought of the misery he created since, including attacking and wounding a group of Amidala's supporters moments before."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The japor snippet first appeared in the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.
