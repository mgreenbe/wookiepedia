That year, Ferrouz contacted the Alliance to Restore the Republic leader Vestin Axlon, and offered the Alliance a base in the Candoras region. However, contacting the Rebellion was not Ferrouz's choice, as he had been forced to do so as a set of conditions forced upon him by the Warlord Nuso Esva who had taken Ferrouz's wife and daughter hostage. Even though the Emperor's Hand Mara Jade was originally supposed to kill him for contacting the Rebellion, she later spared him, which was exactly what Emperor Palpatine wanted her to do, according to her later telepathic conversation with him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
