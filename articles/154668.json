He and the rest of Kareen's crew agreed with San Maxus to start helping the Separatists and Count Dooku in order to make enough money to retire from podracing all together. While working on Mon Gazza the Rodian aided Maxus in fending off the undercover Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, as Skywalker had been snooping around Kidd Kareen's pit looking for Separatist contraband. The Rodian declared that an attack on one crew member was an attack on all crew members. The Rodian led a Gamorrean mechanic, two Nikto mechanics, an Aqualish mechanic, and a Toydarian mechanic into the fight. Kareen arrived shortly after the fight began and broke it up. Later the Rodian handed off the intel Skywalker was looking for to Maxus at the beginning of of the third lap of the Mon Gazza Maze during a pit-stop. Skywalker tried to stop Maxus but failed. The Rodian and the rest of the crew arrived, this time armed with blasters, to fend off the Jedi and his clone trooper again. Anakin was able to throw debris at the Rodian and two others, knocking them out from the fight. Later, Kareen indicated that after it all only Maxus had been retired from the crew after being killed by Ahsoka Tano, Skywalker's Jedi Padawan. Kareen in fact offered Tano to take a job as a replacement for Maxus, but Tano refused."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
