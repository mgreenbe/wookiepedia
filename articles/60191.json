During the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire, he was tasked with delivering a large number of specimens from rare species to the personal zoo of Galactic Emperor Palpatine on the planet Coruscant. He traveled with the specimens onboard a class four container transport commanded by Captain Zarda. During the journey, the transport was approached by the VCX-100 light freighter Ghost, which quickly came under attack from the Imperial vessel's TIE/ln space superiority starfighters. The freighter managed to destroy several of the TIEs and evade the rest. Hazlekk then approached Zarda on the transport's bridge and demanded to know why the starfighters had not destroyed the enemy vessel. Zarda began to reassure the doctor that everything was under control, but was cut off by an alarm signalling a hull breach."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hazlekk first appeared in the 2018 comic book story Endangered, Part 1, which was written by Sholly Fisch, illustrated by Sean Galloway and released in Star Wars Adventures 7."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
