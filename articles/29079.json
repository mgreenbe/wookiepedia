ConJob grew the flowers in a small hydroponic garden he maintained in his quarters. The business was a brisk one; ConJob soon found that even the hardest spacers and pirates needed something to brighten their quarters with, or to remind them of their homeworld. The business was actually a front for ConJob's activities as an infochant and NewsNet code dealer, but was a pretty decent business in itself. ConJob often practiced with his lightsaber in front of the stall to both entertain himself and attract business."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
