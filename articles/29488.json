Over ten years later, the value of the bounty had increased to half a million credits and when the heroes traveled to the moon Nar Shaddaa, they were attacked by a group of bounty hunters, who wanted to collect the bounty. Ryntz felt guilty about forgetting to cancel the contract after Wir had died, so he met with the heroes and attempted to get the Hutts to cancel the bounty. The Hutts eventually agreed to suspend, but not cancel, the contract."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
