Both sides were on the hunt for Ziro, who escaped from the custody of both the Galactic Republic and the Grand Hutt Council, but found him dead on Teth after he was killed by Sy Snootles at the behest of Jabba the Hutt. The Jedi engaged Bane in combat in the hopes of capturing him, due to Bane holding the Galactic Senate hostage, but the bounty hunter escaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
