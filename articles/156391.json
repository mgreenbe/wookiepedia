She managed to arrive and seduce the commander of the vessel. However, C-3PO and R2-D2, who were suspicious of what was going on, reported to Luke Skywalker about what is going on directly (failing to get the commander to report on it). She ended up encountering Chewbacca's son, Lumpy, onboard the vessel (who was about to be delivered back to Kashyyyk after he had snuck out), and under the guise of telling him a story on how to operate a starship, proceeded to sabotage the power systems via a dance routine. Her efforts were ultimately undone by the timely arrival of Chewbacca."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial saboteur was a planned major antagonist in the early story treatment for The Star Wars Holiday Special.
