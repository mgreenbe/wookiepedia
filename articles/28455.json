When Jedi Master Kirak Infil'a came, they both greeted him and he told them the tale of how he had killed a Sith and that now he wanted to go kill the Galactic Emperor as well and restore light to the galaxy.

Suddenly, Infil'a felt Vader coming and dropped the materials, with Colli running to protect both herself and her sibling. Colli gave the baby to her father and when they came out, Vader challenged Infil'a to a lightsaber duel. Even though the others were confused, Colli asked if Vader was the Sith, but Infil'a told them all to go back to the garage and fix the ship.
