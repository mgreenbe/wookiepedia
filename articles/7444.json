Contacted by Seti Ashgad in 13 ABY, Getelles was offered a way to conquer the Meridian sector. The Loronar Corporation supplied dissidents on Meridian with weapons, and Ashgad planned to release the Death Seed Plague across; the plot was foiled by the intervention of republic personnel Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa Solo and Han Solo. Halting the plague and killing Ashgad, the Republic seized the planet under the leadership of Admiral Gial Ackbar and his two fleets. When Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon took the reigns of the Remnant, the world joined with the seasoned Admiral, but was conquered once more by Ackbar.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
