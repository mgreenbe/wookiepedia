The Republic forces fought valiantly alongside the Twi'lek Resistance; however, the Separatists were able to create a blockade around the world which prevented any supplies or reinforcements being delivered to Di and his men or the natives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During heavy fighting, Cham Syndulla, leader of the Twi'lek Resistance, approached Di and Clone Captain Keeli and informed the Jedi that their forces' food and energy supplies were running low. Di contacted Republic Admiral Dao, whose Venator-class Star Destroyer still remained in orbit, and requested that supplies be delivered as quickly as possible. Dao was unable to help, as his ship was low on fuel as well as ammunition and so instead he contacted the Jedi High Council to request aid. During the holographic transmission with the council, Dao's vessel was destroyed, leaving Di's forces without any support in the space above Ryloth ."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seemingly alone, the Twi'leks and clones under Di's command were slowly pushed back by the Separatist forces, and their right flank soon collapsed, leaving the Separatists to close in on the Jedi's location. Despite spotty communications, Di promised Syndulla that the Republic would come through with reinforcements, but the Twi'lek was unconvinced and believing that the Separatists would soon overrun them ordered his people to leave. Keeli explained to Syndulla that without the right flank all of them were trapped and could not escape, and so would have to continue fighting the Separatists together."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Twi'leks still began preparing to evacuate, but soon realized that the single Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry that the Republic forces had left was not enough to carry them and their families. Di then created an alternate plan, in which the transport would be used as a bomb after its fuel systems were reconfigured. If the explosion was used to collapse one of the two routes leading to their position it would force the Separatists to confront them in the other, a narrow ravine. He explained that while the Republic held the ravine, the Twi'leks could escape by foot over the mountains. Keeli praised the plan and then informed the troops of their orders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the troops prepared for battle, Syndulla's subordinate Gobi Glie approached Di and informed him that Syndulla was still angry at being let down by the Republic. Di expressed his sympathies and told Glie to pass them on, warning that the Twi'leks would need to be quick, as he and the clones could only hold out for so long. He then ordered Keeli to check the transport was ready and prepared to engage the approaching Separatists. The LAAT/I's destruction successfully destroyed the pass, and so the Separatists moved to confront Di and his men in the ravine as planned."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Sacrifice"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Twi'leks fled, Di led his troops in battle at the ravine, deflecting many blaster bolts with his lightsaber as the Republic forces held their ground. The clones quickly began taking heavy casualties and Keeli was downed by the explosion of a thermal detonator. Believing his friend to be dead, Di moved to fight the huge Separatist force alone, but was surprised when Keeli got up and kept fighting. The pair then fought back to back, holding out as long as possible but were soon overwhelmed by fire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Keeli died first, after which Di received word from a group of three Pelta-class frigates that they had broken through the blockade and were en route to deliver supplies to the Twi'leks. Gladdened by the knowledge that the Twi'leks would live to fight another day, Di deflected several more bolts back at his attackers, but then took multiple shots to the torso, killing him. The Battle of Ryloth would continue long after the Jedi Master's death, but would eventually end with a Republic victory, partly thanks to Di's sacrifice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Di was a Kajain'sa'Nikto male with orange skin and blue eyes.

In his last moments, Di and Keeli held out alone, trying to make their last moments memorable ones.
