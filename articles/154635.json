At some point, the Rodian was hired by the corpulent Rodian crime lord Reelo Baruk. The Rodian was eventually employed to Baruk's Bar located on the moon Nar Shaddaa, and together with another Rodian he acted as a doorman. The pair of Rodians would hang out in the bar and welcome arriving guests, while confiscating their weapons. When Baruk began supplying weapons and mercenaries to the Imperial Remnant forces of Galak Fyyar and the Dark Jedi Desann, the crime boss had attracted the attention of the New Republic government, who were engaged in a conflict with Fyyar's forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mercenary and Jedi Kyle Katarn was eventually dispatched to Nar Shaddaa to find and eliminate Baruk. Katarn first went to Baruk's Bar to look for leads, and upon entering he was greeted by the Rodian bounty hunter and his partner. The Rodian confiscated Katarn's Bryar pistol and other weapons before allowing Katarn entry into the cantina. The Rodian, however, failed to acquire Katarn's lightsaber. When Katarn was double-crossed by the Chiss bartender, Baldarek, the bounty hunters turned on Katarn with their own weapons. The Rodian, having taken the weapons to a room above the bar area, rushed into the fray with an E-11 blaster rifle. The Rodian, and all of the other bounty hunters and cantina patrons, were killed by Katarn. The bartender was spared, however, after Katarn extracted further information from him. Eventually, with the help of a man named Lando Calrissian, Katarn ended Baruk's part in the war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rodian was abrupt and too the point when it came to confiscating Katarn's weapons.

While enemies can be routinely disarmed throughout the game and be left unharmed, this Rodian, as well as all bounty hunters during his portion of the level, had to be killed in order to trigger the next cutscene. All Rodians were voiced by either Michael Gough or Tom Kane, credited as Rodian 2 and Rodian 1 respectively.
