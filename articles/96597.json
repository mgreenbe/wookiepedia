They were primarily used to severely reduce enemy resistance on a planet, while allowing Imperial troopers, mainly radtroopers, to capture a vital building or resource. Due to the severity of radiation after a neutron bomb, unprotected life forms would not be able to enter the bombed area for quite some time. The use of neutron bombs after the fall of the Empire was minimal, as their production was discontinued."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
