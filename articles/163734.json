Little was known of Wex Dafid's early career with the Alliance among those he trained during the early Galactic Civil War. Stories circulating among rookie pilots told that he had ignored practically every rule of combat and was almost killed on several occasions. Though these were only stories, his early career left him with a three-inch scar on his cheek, a mechanical hand and the nickname \"TIE-Die.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 1 BBY, Dafid was serving as Starfighter Command's chief tactical training officer aboard the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Independence, having the rank of commander and an office near the ship's simulator room. Dafid oversaw the training of many recruits, including the Agamarians Keyan Farlander and Sunnar Jan-lo, taking them through simulated missions and teaching the lessons they would need to stay alive in combat. Rarely were pilots allowed near a real starfighter until they had completed every training scenario to Dafid's satisfaction. Keyan Farlander was a rare exception, entering active duty on General Jan Dodonna's orders after achieving near perfect simulator scores, even though Dafid felt the young pilot was not ready. After leaving Dafid's training, pilots often entered service in one of the Independence's starfighter squadrons, though some later moved to other assignments. In addition to training recruits, Dafid also retrained those pilots who had demonstrated weaknesses at certain skills."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "the following explanation"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dafid was a tough, no-nonsense officer whose early experiences in combat were rumored to have taught him the importance of proper tactical flying. His often intense personality, combined with the three-inch scar on his cheek and his mechanical hand, the strength of which he struggled to gauge, ensured that the young recruits were often intimidated by the man. As he first examined Farlander's class, observing each pilot in turn while muttering to himself, Farlander's first impression was that Dafid was a \"nut case.\" Nevertheless, Dafid was a competent instructor who cared for the wellbeing of those he trained, and was determined not to let them enter combat until they were ready. Every training mission was designed to teach a specific lesson and Dafid did not care how many attempts it took trainees to complete them, as long as they demonstrated that they had fully understood the lessons being taught. He tended to refer to his pilots by their last name, only calling Farlander by his first name after the pilot was promoted from his class. He did have a sense of humor, though the intimidated recruits in his class rarely laughed at his jokes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wex Dafid was created by Rusel DeMaria for the 1993 book X-Wing: The Official Strategy Guide, which presented the story of Keyan Farlander, the player character in the game Star Wars: X-Wing. In the book Dafid serves as the tactical training officer aboard the Independence while Farlander is undergoing training. In the game, however, Farlander's tactical training takes place away from the Independence, at an EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate which serves as a training center, and the scenario briefings are given by General Dodonna."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
