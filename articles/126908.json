Gwishi and Da had sabotaged the starship Steady Wing before its departure from the planet Haileap with a Dalnan diplomatic delegation onboard, hoping to prevent the Galactic Republic from expanding into the Dalnan sector. Although they had succeeded in destroying the Steady Wing and killing most of those onboard, a small group consisting of Rwoh, Padawan Imri Cantaros, Avon Starros, Starros' droid J-6 and Honesty Weft, the son of the Dalnan ambassador, had escaped in a sabotaged maintenance shuttle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pirates followed the shuttle to Wevo, the nearest safe landing spot, and attempted to kill the young party, a task made difficult by the dense jungle. Rwoh unwittingly damaged the pirates' stolen cargo hauler by telekinetically hurling a boulder in its direction, ensuring that Gwishi and Da could not leave. The Jedi party eventually discovered the pirates' presence, and Rwoh made a plan to capture the pirates. However, Cantaros, who was struggling with severely negative emotions following the death of his Master, Douglas Sunvale, on the Steady Wing, persuaded Weft, who was upset about his father's death, to sneak off and attack the pirates themselves. However, they were quickly captured to be used as bait."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon discovering the boys' absence in the morning, Rwoh, Starros and J-6 set off to rescue them. Rwoh was able to subdue Gwishi while J-6, a repurposed bodyguard droid, freed the boys. However, when Rwoh was confronted by Da, a freed Cantaros gave in to his anger and attempted to Force choke her to death. Rwoh Force-threw Cantaros away, and she and J-6 restrained the pirates. The young Mirialan Jedi then went after Cantaros, subduing him in a lightsaber duel to prevent him from falling to the dark side of the Force. After a Jedi rescue party picked them up a few days later, they were taken to the Starlight Beacon. On the advice of Jedi Master Sskeer, Rwoh took Cantaros as her own Padawan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
