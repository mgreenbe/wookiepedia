The ice planet was a holy world to the Jedi Order, but it served as a staging ground for surprise attacks by the Republic Military during the war as a result of its unknown location and difficult-to-navigate hyperlanes. Even after the Sith attack, the planet would remain in the hands of the Republic and the Jedi Order until several years after the Treaty of Coruscant in 3653 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A battle on Ilum during the Great Galactic War was first mentioned in the article \"The Setting\", on The Old Republic website in October 2008.
