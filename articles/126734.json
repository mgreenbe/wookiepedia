Just as the Padawan arrived, however, a team of Flesh Raiders broke through the village's lines and planted toxin mines in the Twi'leks' agricultural fields, poisoning their crops. At the request of the village's Matriarch Ranna Tao'Ven, the Padawan braved the poisonous clouds using the Force and disabled the mines, defeating the saboteurs and ensuring the village's safety."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3643 BBY, near the end of the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, the native Flesh Raiders of the Jedi Order's homeworld of Tython began attacking in greater numbers. The Order had recently discovered that the former Padawan of Jedi Master Orgus Din, the Nautolan Bengel Morr\u2014who had vanished during the Sacking of Coruscant ten years ago\u2014was the mastermind behind the Flesh Raiders' invasion.

The apprentice agreed and rushed to the fields, where the enemy had planted three toxin mines. Using the Force power known as breath control to stop most of the poisonous effects of the gas, the Padawan began to disable the mines. However, several Flesh Raiders had buried themselves in the ground and burst out to attack the Jedi in an attempt to stop the apprentice, but the apprentice defeated them and successfully saved the village's crops from further harm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning to the Matriarch's building, the apprentice was thanked by Tao'Ven for the help. After giving the Jedi a token of the village's thanks, she left to tell the village the good news. The apprentice, meanwhile, contacted Master Din via holocomm and learned of his success against the Flesh Raiders. When the Padawan informed Din of Morr's goal of destroying the Jedi so he could ultimately rebuild them and destroy the Sith, he was relieved to hear that his former apprentice was not a Sith himself. During the attack on the Flesh Raiders' command base, Din had found the locations of many other camps\u2014too many camps for the Jedi Council to only send Jedi Masters. As a result, Din requested that his apprentice take out the base located in the ruins of Kaleth, since the apprentice had already defeated some of the natives who had been based at that camp."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The skirmish in the Kalikori Village fields appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011.
