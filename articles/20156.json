During the First Order/Resistance War, the First Order imposed a blockade on the Atterra system, plundering fuel and minerals and cutting off all travel and communications between the twin worlds Atterra Bravo and Atterra Alpha. Bravo Rising had a small fleet of starfighters and transport ships at their disposal and were making supply runs between the two planets. However, the rebels were short on fuel, food, weapons, drinking water and medical equipment and turned to the Resistance for help."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
