When crazed Jedi Master Cin Tykan opened the tunnels leading to the headquarters of the Republic Expeditionary Forces in 3643 BBY, Ripclaw was one of the many rakghouls that flooded the base. However, a Jedi Consular who was seeking to stop Tykan arrived at the base, sealed the tunnels and cleared the headquarters of the rakghouls, killing Ripclaw in the process."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
