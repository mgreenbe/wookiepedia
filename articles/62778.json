Its success came largely from the fact that it had amassed much of its influence by currying favor with the larger houses. This had led to many aristocratic jokes concerning the Baliss's that they had served as a vassal for every noble family of any significance. Following the death of the Queen, House Baliss remained neutral when warfare broke out between the houses and preferred to wait for a decisive victor to emerge before declaring any form of allegiance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the family had suffered a loss when the Baliss estate was overrun by Killiks and forced the nobles of the house to abandon their home. This had led to the taking refuge with House Teraan who were another minor family. Duke Yun Baliss decided to capitalize on the chaos that engulfed Alderaan and made the Teraan estate the new home of the house."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A delegate of House Baliss attended the Alderaan Peace Summit at Sendoth Ruins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this time, two banners of the house were displayed within Pallista Spaceport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
