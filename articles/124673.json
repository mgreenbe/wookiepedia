Tooke-trap plants grew and flourished in these \"soil pockets\", creating a symbiotic relationship nicknamed a \"shiro-trap\". Tooke-traps provide camouflage for shiros from larger predators, especially from the saw-toothed grank which was the Shiro's main predator due to its ability to break through tough shells with its large, crushing jaws. In return, shiros provided locomotion for the tooke-traps."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
