Thus, LucasArts worked in conjunction with Industrial Light & Magic, Pixelux Entertainment, and NaturalMotion to create a next-gen Star Wars experience. The game showcases Digital Molecular Matter (DMM), an extremely detailed and realistic material physics engine developed by Pixelux, and euphoria, a realistic bio-mechanical A.I. engine by NaturalMotion. The Force Unleashed was originally slated for release in November 2007 but was delayed to the spring of 2008 and later delayed again to that summer. The final version of the game was released on September 16, 2008. A demo was made available on Xbox Live and Playstation Network for download on August 21, 2008.

Now that Chop'aa was dead, Starkiller came before Bel Iblis and told him that he was safe. Galen attempted to inform Garm that Rahm Kota sent him, but Bel Iblis was already aware of this and knew of his plans for a rebellion. When Starkiller asked the senator if he was with them, Garm replied by stating that he had spoke out against the Emperor too many times, which resulted in Palpatine issuing death warrants against him and his family.

After dispatching a snowspeeder with his lightsaber and exiting his AT-AT, Marek began his attack on Echo Base. Captain Keenah - who was to act as Marek's attack group liaison - planned an infiltration route for the dark lord to enter Echo Base via ice caverns adjacent to the base. The caverns were infested with wampas, who Marek dispatched with ease. As ice columns the Sith had been jumping across started to collapse, Captain Keenah contacted Marek on his comlink to inform him of the cavern's instability and admitted that the most likely cause was the walker invasion force.

Marek continued to push his way into the base violently slaughtering all Rebels as well as many wampas which entered the base during the battle. Lieutenant Marsen contacted Starkiller about the presence of a group of Rebels ahead of his location that likely had an officer with them - he was not incorrect, and Marek had finally found the young force-user he was after. Upon confronting Luke alone, Starkiller revealed the truth about Luke's father in an attempt to infuriate and confuse him, although he denied it. Despite the surrounding turmoil of the invasion, Luke kept his cool in the lightsaber and force duel that followed. Luke even tried to turn Marek away from the dark side by telling him he could sense the good in him, but his attempts in all respects failed and Luke was forced to let three wampas out of containment to cover his escape.

Luke claimed he would not run away from Starkiller or his own destiny. Another duel ensued, this time as the hangar was engulfed in fighting between Rebel and Imperial soldiers. Starkiller overpowered and continued to humiliate Luke, drawing Luke toward the Dark Side. As snowtroopers ran up to capture Skywalker, he tapped into the passionate forces of the Dark Side to defeat them and was reinvigorated for battle against Starkiller. Skywalker began using red Force lightning, wild lightsaber attacks, and boasting that even though Obi-Wan could not defeat Marek, he could. Although Luke's powers were very aggressive and damaging, Starkiller absorbed his opponent's powerful lightning into his lightsaber and launched it back at him throughout the battle and bested him in lightsaber combat. Marek threw Luke into the path of an outbound T-47 Snowspeeder. Luke then charged at him and after a series of strikes, Marek stripped Luke of his lightsaber and used it to cut the bearer's right hand. As Marek readied for a final stab, the blast doors protecting the Millennium Falcon opened behind him and the ship shot off through the hangar, ready to escape the planet. Starkiller reacted quickly and withdrew from his attack to catch the ship with the Force. Marek told Luke that he could only save his friends with the power of the Dark Side of the Force and the now-fallen Jedi quickly obliged by shooting force lightning out again. Marek then blocked it with his lightsaber and pushed back the lightning to him. Although Luke had succeeded in distracting Marek with the attack, allowing the Millennium Falcon to escape, he was beaten and had embraced the power of the dark side. Marek then congratulated Luke and addressed him as his new apprentice.
