After several proton torpedo hits, the interdictor's shields collapsed, forcing it to retreat from the battle. Green Squadron then turned on the Star Destroyers and brought down their shields as well. At some point during the melee, the light Calamari Cruiser Condor entered the fray and added its own firepower to the Liberty's own. Eventually, the Rebel fighters were able to disable the Star Destroyers with ion cannons and finish them off."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Goff was a comparatively easy victory for the Alliance despite the fact that they were up against two Star Destroyers with only one Calamari Cruiser and its complement of fighters.
