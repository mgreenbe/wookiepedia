From then on, the city was owned by Baron Merillion Tarko, who operated many casinos and bars on Tarko-se, including the Infinite Nebstar Casino. But Tarko's main and greatest attraction was his famous Tarko-se Arena. Rebel general Rahm Kota was held prisoner in the city during his reign. When Starkiller, a clone of Galen Marek, arrived to rescue Kota, he was forced to fight his way from the eastern bridge to the western bridge of the city. After locating Kota inside the city's arena, Baron Tarko released the Gorog creature, ignoring his own servants' warnings about the integrity of the arena structure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a long battle with the Gorog, Starkiller sent most of the arena falling to the surface below. Starkiller then assisted Kota in defeating Tarko's stormtrooper guards, thus leaving the Baron defenseless. When Tarko was about to surrender, the Gorog grabbed him out of the observation booth and devoured him. After his death, the rest of the arena caved in, and the Gorog fell to its doom."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
