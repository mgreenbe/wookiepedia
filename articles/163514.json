Upon learning that the Son was planning to escape Mortis (an act that ultimately would defy a cardinal planetary law by which the Ones\u2014Father, Son and Daughter\u2014were bound, resulting in a catastrophic imbalance in the Force), Anakin Skywalker followed the instructions of the ghost of Qui-Gon Jinn to go to the Well. After riding his speeder bike to the bottom of the Well, Skywalker encountered the Son. Shaken by the Son's vision of the future that was shown him (not unlike Anakin's disturbing Holt Kazed cave vision antecedent to the Battle of Nelvaan in which he glimpsed his own monstrous future), the young Jedi Knight willingly followed the Force's dark-side embodiment in order to avoid realization of the Son's heinous, premeditated act. By the time Obi-Wan Kenobi rode his own speeder bike to the bottom of the Well, Kenobi could only watch in horror as Skywalker left the sanctum of the Well to take his place alongside the Son, who was intent still on leaving Mortis (the planet symbolizing universal creation). Fortunately, Ahsoka Tano arrived on her own speeder bike to pick up the Jedi Master and pursue, for all three Jedi, a route to ultimate rescue from the visionary realm, as well as (albeit through death of the Ones) a preservation of balance in the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Well of the Dark Side was introduced in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars third season episode \"Ghosts of Mortis\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At first, the fiery location's concept shares similarities where a showdown on the planet Mustafar occurs in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.
