Though the exact cause of the planet's destruction was unknown, the leading theory was that the main reactor of the Anaxes shipyards malfunctioned and caused a massive stockpile of hypermatter to detonate. However, there were also a multitude of other, more wild explanations, ranging from Separatist superweapons to Jedi-engineered planetary collisions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the war, PM-6986 served as the location of a stronghold used by Harch Separatist Admiral Trench as part of his attacks against Anaxes.
