The system lay at the crossroads of the Triellus Trade Route and the Old Corellian Run in the Arkanis sector of the the Slice's Outer Rim segment. In Huttese, the dominant language on Tatooine, the twin suns were known as \"Gi Dopa Gasha.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tatoo II was formed when a hydrogen molecular cloud collapsed. Through most of the its life, energy was produced by nuclear fusion which converted hydrogen into helium. Each second, millions of metric tons of matter were converted into energy within Tatoo II's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation. It had a lifespan of roughly ten billion years as a main sequence star. Tatoo II did not have enough mass to explode as a supernova. At the end of their lifespan, stars of its kind entered a red giant phase, their outer layers expanding as the hydrogen fuel in the core was consumed and the core contracted and heated up."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Children on Tatooine would tell stories of huge, powerful dragons that lived inside the two great suns that shone down upon them.
