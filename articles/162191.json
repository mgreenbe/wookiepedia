He had formerly been a part of an Imperial Army garrison. Vryant had served six years on Herdessa and two years in the trenches of Phorsa Gedd before he was assigned to Mrinzebon. The planet was abandoned after the death of Emperor Palpatine in the Battle of Endor. Vryant remained behind when his garrison left, taking control of Greater Xnapolis' gangs. When Major Soran Keize of the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing came to Mrinzebon under an alias, his activities drew the attention of Vryant, who offered him either a job or payment to leave. Keize killed Vryant, setting the communications tower where he operated alight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
