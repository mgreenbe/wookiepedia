It was housed in the Old Republic-era fort, which was the original government building. Because of this, the owner, Mortimon Galli, kept the pre-Imperial appearance of dim lighting with many old wooden tables and chairs. Games of sabacc and other forms of gambling were always taking place in the back. It was the perfect place for clandestine meetings, a good game of sabacc and getting to know the real denizens of Ord Mynock Freeport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
