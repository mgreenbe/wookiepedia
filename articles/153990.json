In 32 BBY the planet was invaded by the Trade Federation, an extremely wealthy galactic trading corporation. This resulted in the Trade Federation's Droid Army targeting Spinnaker in order to secure funds for the invasion. Prior to attacking the city the army, under the command of the droid OOM-9 took control of the small village. The security forces in the town attempted to hold out against the droids but were quickly forced to surrender. The town was used as a base for the Federation to attack Spinnaker and it's inhabitants were captured."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The village makes it's only appearance in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds in the third level of the Trade Federation campaign.
