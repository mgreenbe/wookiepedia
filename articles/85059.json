Upon becoming a franchise, Madame Tussauds has opened in several other countries beyond Great Britain and include a whole range of other figures besides aristocracy. They include world leaders, activists, artists, A-list celebrities, musicians, athletes, TV and film characters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Attractions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On February 3, 2015 Madame Tussauds London announced they would be doing a multi-million pound expansion to their world famous attraction with a major new experience near the end of the tour; based on the Star Wars series. Created in close collaboration with Disney and Lucasfilms, the mini-attraction contains recreations of scenes from nearly all the original and prequel trilogy installments; except for Attack of the Clones. It took 180 arists to put the whole thing together as some of them went of scouting trips to the Skywalker Ranch where they took several photos of original screen-used props (ex. the lightsabers) and costumes for studio reference; some were even borrowed by hand to make pitch-perfect replicas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Madame Tussauds Star Wars had a VIP opening party on May 12, 2015 featuring appearances from press members of Team Jedi News, Pip Andersen who played a First Order Stormtrooper in The Force Awakens, and Jeremy Bulloch while the attraction officially opened on May 16.   The attraction begins with guests walking down a hallway based on the Trade Federation ship Saak'ak from The Phantom Menace with two windows that gaze out into a fibre-optic lit galaxy, the left side featuring a scale model of the planet Naboo; and in the center is a blast door. As guests descend the stairways into the attraction, the first show scene they come across is a re-enactment of the Duel of the Fates where Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi clash blades with Darth Maul. Alongside decals that represent the architecture of the Theed power generator are two cylindrical tubes of optical fiber that simulate the Plasma Refinery Complex. The next showroom is based off Battle of the Heroes from Revenge of the Sith with fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker standing on a Mustafar barge with red aura projected around his wax figure. Crossing over to the original movie, the first thing guests see coming is a recreation of the Mos Eisley cantina with a wax figure of Han Solo, as painted by colourist Alex Garnett; lounging in the seat where he first negotiated with the protoganists and shot Greedo. On the other side of the room is C-3PO and R2-D2 standing in front of a backdrop of the Tatooine desert, each with electronic lights and the latter droid making his iconic beep-boop sounds. The next scene is Han's Wookiee sidekick Chewbacca in a recreation of the Millennium Falcon cockpit where guests can sit in the seat opposite to him and press a button; activating a video on the screen that shows it going into lightspeed. According to hair inserter Hannah Scott, Chewie was the hardest one to work on as he was made from yak hair; an entire body suit was made to accomodate his fur, with over 800 hours spent and 10 artists needed to make this specific figure. Crossing over to the dark side, guests find themselves in the hallways of the Death Star where two Imperial Stormtroopers stand on guard. The next stop is down a long, winding hallway that leads guests into the swampy forests of Dagobah where they find Master Yoda (modelled after one of the original puppets) sitting on a log as archival clips of his most famous lines play on loop. Based on the climax of The Empire Strikes Back, the preceding showroom is a recreation of the Cloud City reactor shaft where visitors can stand opposite of Darth Vader as the famous \"I am your father\" line plays on a hidden speaker. The last few tableaus based off Return of the Jedi, the first room is a large show scene based off Jabba's Palace with wax figures of the slug crime-lord himself, Princess Leia Organa in her chain-metal bikini, and Salacious B. Crumb. The \"final\" room (when it first opened) was based on the portions of the Battle of Endor that took place inside the Emperor's throne room with Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker clashing their lightsabers as Darth Sidious watches from his chair in devious intent. For both figures of Vader, the Tussauds artists worked very closely with casts from the OT costumes as provided by a Lucasfilm employee; going so far as to recreate unnoticed details like the dents on his helmet.  On July 16 2016, a wax figure of Rey was first unveiled during a press conference at the annual [[Celebration Europe (2016}|Star Wars Europe celebration]] and was later installed at the London museum on August 9 where she wields her quarterstaff, her tableau mimicking a Jakku marketplace, and is accompanied by a SFX replica of BB-8.  The article mentioned that she would be exported to the Berlin wax museum as well,  but that may have never happened. Despite the many Star Wars products that have been released since Disney's acquisition of the franchise, no other characters have been added to the attraction since Rey's inclusion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On May 11, 2015 another Star Wars exhibit opened much earlier for Madame Tussauds Berlin where its opening party contained appearances from German celebrities like Nico Schwanz, Marc Barthel, Jimmy Blue and Natascha Ochsenknecht, Umut Kekili, Katja Keuhne, Heike Kloss, Alexander Posth, Betty Taube, DJ Chino and Mateo of the band Culcha Candela, Kristin Meyer, Lovelynn, Gabby Rinne, and Rolf Scheider.  It contains roughly the same figures, but is a lot smaller ommits characters like Anakin & Jabba. The experience starts off with Ben and Maul like always, though Qui-Gon is nowhere to be found in the German version. Instead of their version of Yoda being based off him in his exile years, they depicted him during his prime as Jedi Master; seated in a replcia of his chair from the Coruscant Jedi Academy (To promote the exhibit, Yoda's figure was placed outside the world-famous Brandenburg Gate).  The final section takes place entirely inside the Death Star hallway with Luke and Vader locked in combat as two Stormtroopers watch from behind the latter. This time around, Han's figure is shown standing up right while Leia's figure is dressed in a replica of her all-white costume from A New Hope. The last figures guests see before exiting through the gift shop are Artoo and Threepio."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
