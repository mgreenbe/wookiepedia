They were slightly larger than the Scrap Guardian, but were second in size when compared to the Junk Titan. Junk behemoths were used to hold back Galen Marek in his attempt to raid the Raxus Prime Jedi Temple and kill Paratus. Galen ran into two of the make-shift droids before encountering Paratus himself. Paratus used pieces from old Separatist droids to construct them; the CIS logo was visible on the chest, and the arms were the wings of vulture droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
