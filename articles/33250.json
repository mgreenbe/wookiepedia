It consists of 180 cards (90 Dark Side and 90 Light Side cards) and was introduced in December of 1999. This set consists of 80 rare, 50 uncommon, and 50 common cards. This set introduced many of the classic characters from Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back that were involved with the events occurring on Dagobah. This set also introduced bounty hunters and the Executor to game play. Some of the notable cards include Yoda, Son of Skywalker, IG-88, Bossk, Zuckuss, Dengar, and 4-LOM."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because this is an expansion set, it bears an expansion-set symbol, which is located near the top right corner of the card to the right of the lore and below the destiny number. The symbol for this set is Yoda's green eye."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This set was sold in 9-card expansion packs and 30-pack expansion boxes. Each pack included one rare card, three uncommon cards, and five common cards. Starter decks were never produced for this set. This set is almost identical to Dagobah Limited except for some minor game text revisions and the fact that the borders in this set are white instead of black."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
