About 2/3rds the size of a YT-1300 light freighter, it had a blunt, rounded bow. It had thick stubby wings and rounded thick body that narrowed back to a flattened tail section. It did not work well with modifications, particularly those made with non-SoroSuub parts. Han Solo's Bria was a heavily-modified Starmite-class freighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
