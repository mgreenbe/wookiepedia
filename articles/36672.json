The variant Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor was also used by the Jedi during the Clone Wars. The Delta-7 would also be used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic in their early campaigns against the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Manufactured by Kuat Systems Engineering, the Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor was a Jedi-used starfighter that saw extensive action during the last years of the Galactic Republic, and was designed specifically with the Jedi in mind. The Delta-7's designers worked with the Jedi Order to create a starfighter with fewer internal systems than other starships, and focused on making the controls as responsive as possible due to the Jedi's Force-sensitive capabilities. An elite transport, it could accommodate a single pilot and an integrated astromech droid, as unlike later starfighter models, the wings were too thin for a full astromech socket. Instead, a modified astromech was hardwired into a socket on the vessel's wing, with its dome remaining intact but its components plugged directly into the ships computer. The droid therefore, would play an important part in assisting the pilot with navigation, damage control, and hyperspace travel coordinates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike most ships in the galaxy, the Delta-7 Jedi starfighter did not feature a built-in hyperdrive, but instead relied on external hyperspace transport rings that attached to the starship, allowing it to enter the trans-dimensional realm. Despite this, the ship could still attain speeds of 1,260 kph in realspace, and was painted red, the color which represented the diplomatic immunity the Jedi enjoyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Republic service"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Delta-7 entered service with the Jedi Order prior to or during 32 BBY.

The bounty hunter Jango Fett served as the cloning template, and was also a suspect in a plot to assassinate Padm\u00e9 Amidala.

Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala attempted to stage a rescue, but were also apprehended and sentenced to death in the Petranaki Arena. A Jedi assault team deployed to rescue the trio, but were severely depleted and on the verge of defeat when Yoda arrived with the Grand Army of the Republic.
