They were combined with Omega Squad's RC-1309, nicknamed \"Niner\", and Darman Skirata to form Squad 40 of the 501st Legion. On their first mission as a squad, they were sent to the planet Celen to capture Jilam Kester, an Antarian Ranger who was helping Jedi escape capture from the Empire. Upon storming the Kester's residence, the commandos came face to face with Jedi Master Iri Camas, who had previously commanded the Special Operations Brigade. Camas distracted the commandos, allowing Kester to escape, and ended his own life by igniting a gas line and causing the building to explode. Bry was killed in the explosion while the rest of his squad managed to escape. Following his death, his body was returned to Coruscant where Ennen demanded he be cremated per the tradition of a Corellian in exile, a heritage the two commandos clung to from their training sergeant. Squad 40's new commanding officer following the disappearance of Sa Cuis, Roly Melusar, gave Bry the proper cremation, putting the man to rest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
