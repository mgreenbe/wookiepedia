During the Flesh Raider uprising, Laotah saw security images of Flesh Raiders establishing a base in the Forsaken Den, one of the caves near Kaleth. Seeking out the answers to the Flesh Raiders attacks alone, he believed that the Flesh Raiders had a connection to the dark side of the Force, thus provoking their attacks on the Order.
