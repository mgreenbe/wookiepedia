His skills were put to use when he began serving aboard a freighter. When he met Drednar, he defected from his ship and joined Drednar's pirates as an astronavigator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His directional skills were particularly useful when navigating though asteroid fields and when locating hyperspace routes.
