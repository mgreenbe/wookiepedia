In 138 ABY, under the command of Captain Shenes, the Fist of the Empire participated on the allied assault against Coruscant alongside Fel-loyalist vessels such as the War Hammer and the fleet of the Galactic Alliance Remnant. During the battle, however, the Fist of the Empire suffered heavy damage from Sith Annihilator-class starfighters. Though Captain Shenes requested assistance, the starship was destroyed shortly afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
