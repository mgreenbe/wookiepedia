Green's ambitions to replace the Underlord were well known to Xizor, but he was not considered a credible threat. Many of Green's operatives were double agents with affiliations to Durga the Hutt. Few of Green's rackets were sufficiently profitable in Xizor's eyes. Eventually, Xizor discovered that he was spying on Black Sun for an unknown outside organization. As a result, Xizor had Guri kill Green in front of his other Vigos as a message."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Green was middle-aged, and his hair was receding.
