For his three lines of dialogue, his voice was dubbed over with that of an uncredited American actor. Burnett's own, cockney-accented reading of his first two lines - telling Luke Skywalker that his droids must wait outside the Cantina -  can be heard in the rough cut Cantina sequence in the Star Wars: Behind the Magic CD-ROM, and his reading of his third and final line - pleading with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Doctor Evazan not to use blasters when the two engage in an altercation - can be heard in the first theatrical trailer for the film."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
