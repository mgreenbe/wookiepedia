Droid starfighters of the squadron were equipped with comparatively minimal defenses and shielding, as well as blaster cannons, discord missiles, and energy torpedoes. They were provided with basic targeting and defensive systems. When grounded, 88th Flight droids were less maneuverable on land than in flight. However, units were able to redirect power not being used for starfighter combat into weapons and shields, balancing their performance as ground assault units."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Certain units of the squadron were upgraded for command operations, and were equipped with better targeting and shielding systems.

The droid fighter scored a damaging hit on the Republic bomber, only to be destroyed following an evasive maneuver performed by R2-D2. The rest of the squadron engaged in the battle assisted in the repulsion of Republic forces\u2014as well as the destruction of Adi Gallia's flagship\u2014resulting in the capture of the Jedi by Grievous."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On July 26, 2008, the 88th Flight was first represented as a miniature in the Clone Wars expansion of WizKids's Star Wars PocketModel TCG.

The expansion also included representative 88th Flight Command units, which were elite members of the squadron marked with yellow stripes on their wing pods."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Images of the vulture droid squadron were provided by Lucasfilm, Ltd., taken directly from episodes of the series to be printed by WizKids on styrene miniatures. As with other units in the game, the name 88th Flight was provided by Lucasfilm, Ltd. to WizKids to identify the squadron in the supplied episode images. The coloration and design of the units\u2014as with other color and design schemes for other flights and squadrons\u2014served to distinctly identify the unit apart from other squadrons. This was done to preview the material of the series to the public only just before the airing of episodes, giving fans supplemental information of characters and organizations outside of episode dialog.
