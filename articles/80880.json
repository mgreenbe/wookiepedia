Jarl was Captain of the company's Barloz-class freighter Aggressive Negotiation, while Gille was its accountant. The Cularin Militia paid the company for some weapons during the Clone Wars and Jarl flew the Aggressive Negotiation to the Cularin system with them aboard it. However, before he could deliver the cargo, the ship encountered a Thaereian military patrol and was boarded. The Thaereians killed Jarl and all of the crew except Gille and her and Jarl's daughter, Kalee Narvis. The ship was left dead in space and the Heroes of Cularin arrived to rescue Gille and Kalee. Gille continued to run the company as the sole owner of it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
