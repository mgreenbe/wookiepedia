As the entirety of the 204th scrambled to fend off the invaders, Lykan managed to kill one of the New Republic pilots, named Ubellikos, with the Needle maneuver, where the New Republic pilot was pinned to the ground and left with nowhere to go. Shortly after, the 204th, Lykan included, made their escape from the battle, in a bulk freighter given to them by Troithe's Imperial governor, Fara Yadeez.

However, due to signal bursts from the fighter wing's bulk freighter, which had been named the Yadeez, Syndulla's battle group traced the 204th to the Ciaox Verith system and attacked the unit.
