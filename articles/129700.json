Anakin immediately begins to fight the MagnaGuards in his personal starfighter. Asajj orders the droids to destroy the Jedi as she heads down to a planet below. Meanwhile, Ahsoka mentions that she has figured out the controls of the Twilight. The Twilight is then shown going into its landing mode and plummeting to the planet below. Anakin then manages to destroy one MagnaGuard starfighter. Still highly outnumbered, Skywalker attempts spinning his ship. This simply send his ship into an out-of-control spin and the starfighters surround his own. Suddenly, several of the MagnaGuards explode as Ahsoka returns flanked by two Republic gunships. While the gunships finish off the droids, the Twilight attaches a cable to Anakin's ship, who remarks that Obi-Wan Kenobi isn't there to see this. One of the gunships opens to reveal Obi-Wan who then is told about a problem from the pilot. The problem turns out to be a tractor beam which drags the four ships to the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"TO BE CONTINUED\u2026\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
