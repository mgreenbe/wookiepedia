It was housed in an old building with actual hinged doors far away from any of the city's main entertainment districts. It was not considered the best music school on the planet, but it attracted students from across Naboo who were sent there due to the conservatory's fondness for tradition. Musicians trained there were considered dependable and reliable, able to pass on traditions to their students and listeners. Students ended their training the year they turned fourteen, at which time they took their final exams and usually continued on to an apprenticeship. Tsabin, daughter of a family of musicians, was sent to the school to train as her brothers had already gone there. Like her brothers, she played the hallikset, but did not go on to an apprenticeship as she was recruited to become a handmaiden and body double for newly-elected Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
