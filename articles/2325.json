It was an updated version of the AAL-1971/9.1 Troop Transport, used by the First Order. The ship had the same structure as the AAL-1971/9.1 Troop Transport, with a disembarkation ramp and a troop compartment. It also featured a blaster cannon mounted by a Sith trooper on the top section of the craft. Unlike its predecessor, the AAL-2100/9.5 did not have a tall cockpit, instead sporting a low one near the stern. It saw action at the Battle of Exegol during the end of the First Order/Resistance War, deploying Sith troopers onto the hull of the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Steadfast to engage Resistance forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
