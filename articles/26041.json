If the Chief of State was incapacitated, incommunicado, or dead, the chairman of the Ministry Council selected an acting Chief of State from among the following: any former Chief of State, the current Minister of State, or any former Minister of State.

The election of a Chief of State could be blocked by the Ruling Council on a unanimous vote. In practice, the power of the Ruling Council to void an election and initiate the recall of a sitting Chief of State meant any candidate proposed by or approved by the Ruling Council was likely to be elected by the Senate. The Ruling Council consisted of the chairbeings of the six Senate councils and the President of the Senate (the Chief of State). The Chief of State had the power to select any member of the Ruling Council to conduct the business of the Senate in their absence from that body."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike the Galactic Republic, the New Republic Chiefs of State did not have enforced term limits: Mon Mothma served for fourteen years and Leia Organa Solo for twelve."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "List of Chiefs of State"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "New Republic"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Elections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
