The military submarines were secretly developed by the League on their homeworld Mon Cala, where the Mon Calamari had made the vehicle illegal. When civil war did erupt, UTS Pikes were deployed during the Battle of Mon Cala. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, the Quarren made use of UTS Pikes in the aftermath of the Battle of Dac City. When compared to the Mon Calamari's OMS Devilfish, the UTS Pike was faster but not as well armed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
