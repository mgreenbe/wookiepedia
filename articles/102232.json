One such sector was the Bright Jewel Oversector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Oversectors and the rank of Grand Moff were both created at the suggestion of Governor Wilhuff Tarkin in the fifth year of Emperor Palpatine's reign. Tarkin became the first ever Grand Moff. Grand Moffs in control of an oversector had absolute authority over all other administrators and control of resources, whether it was civilian or military. It was established when a group of smaller sectors became too much of a threat, and the Grand Moffs that controlled them became significant powers in the galaxy, and were on nearly equal footing with Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader or the Inquisitors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
