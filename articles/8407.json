The stadium was a copy of the Rols'Kus arena on the planet Coyn and many Coynites viewed the Arena of Games unfavorably, because they believed that it made a mockery of their combative system of honor. During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance agent Shondra Del was captured by the Empire and sentenced to death in the Arena of Games, and she was forced to fight against some of Hul's Coynite gladiators. However. Del was subsequently rescued from the area by the con artist Mikos Argdran and a group of Rebel agents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
