To do so, however, required the cooperation of Beri Tulon, Tantor's old mentor, who had been assigned to an AT-AT factory for years. The complication was that Tulon had been captured by the Galactic Empire during an attempt to defect\u2014by Tantor, in fact\u2014and was sent to Tarkin Detention Facility on Ruul."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under the close supervision of General Tyr Taskeen, Tantor took a light force to Ruul, where he set up to ambush the convoy escorting Tulon to the prison. Before Tulon got there, however, a lighter force passed, escorting a captured leader of the Ruulian Rebels. Tantor swiftly eliminated the guards and returned the leader to his people nearby."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tulon's escort passed by not long after. Tantor's troopers descended from the hills, bringing down the stormtroopers and walkers that guarded him. Tulon was quickly bundled into a transport and the party rushed to the designated evacuation zone, running into Imperial patrols and turrets along the way."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once safe, Tantor questioned Tulon as to the location of the factory. Tulon revealed that it was on the asteroid Trasse, but could not be approached without the proper codes.

Once Beri Tulon had sliced the codes from the facility, Tantor and his forces faded away as quickly as they had struck."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
