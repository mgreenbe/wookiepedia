Although heavily traveled, the route was a challenge even for the most seasoned astronavigators and was marked by a series of nav beacons attached to \"lightstation\" space stations to assist in navigating the route successfully. Prior to the lightstations, travelers had to follow the annual path of the rainbow comet, just as Baobab had when first pioneering the route."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
