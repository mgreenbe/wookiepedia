They had pointed ears that assisted with heat dissipation and thin fur to insulate their bodies at night. The fur was brown in color, and males usually had longer fur. The fur could cover the entire body except for the face, hands and tail. They had small nasal and oral openings, but large eyes to improve their nightvision."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lasat society was held together by a long-standing oral tradition, featuring clever and stealthy heroes. Their social structure was largely nomadic, though powerful city-states existed, with buildings constructed of mud and brick. Both the cities and the tribes were ruled by hereditary religious figures, with laws being enforced by a warrior-police caste."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Political and economic concerns lead frequently to wars in which the tribal nomads often served as mercenaries.\nThe Lasat were considered \"crafty\" or \"sneaky\" by the galaxy at large due to their tendency to capture their food by trapping.

They did use pronouns when referring to other beings as they preferred to not user other's names."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Lasat in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Only a relatively small number of Lasat left their homeworld, apparently as slaves.
