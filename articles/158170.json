As part of Windu's strike team assembled to rescue Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala from execution by the Confederacy leaders, Du landed on the plains of Geonosis outside the Petranaki arena. While her comrades attacked the arena from the grandstands, Master Du delved deep into the catacombs. Amidst the damp quiet of the insect-constructed facility, was the first Jedi to encounter the monstrous General Grievous, a Kaleesh cyborg who was poised to lead the Separatist Droid Army in the coming Clone Wars. Wielding her lightsaber against Grievous' electrostaff, Du fought valiantly but was overpowered and killed by the General. Collecting her lightsaber as a trophy, Grievous left her body where it laid, his existence remaining a secret from the Republic until he was ready to unleash his full might on the Grand Army of the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This Jedi was the creation of artist Joe Corroney, who modeled her after fellow artist Jan Duursema, from whom the character also takes her name.
