The starship's dorsal surface featured twenty-six point-defense laser cannons for protection against starfighters, and six tractor beam projectors were located on the ship's bow. The ship was said to have more firepower than a dozen Star Destroyers combined.

The Fulminatrix and the rest of the First Order forces engaged in the siege of D'Qar, where the Fulminatrix destroyed the Resistance base located there using its underbelly autocannons. As a counterattack, Resistance Commander Poe Dameron destroyed the point defense cannons using his T-70 X-wing starfighter Black One. He proceeded to lead a bombing run of MG-100 StarFortress SF-17 bombers before the Fulminatrix could target the Resistance navy. After an intense space battle, the final Resistance bomber, though fatally damaged, managed to destroy the Fulminatrix and allow the Resistance to escape the Ileenium system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time after its escape from Castilon, the Colossus arrived over D'Qar to the site of the battle. In desperate need of coaxium, members of the Colossus raided the wreckage of the Fulminatrix which still had power.

In response, Hux led a fleet of Resurgent-class Star Destroyers and at least one Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought. Despite the Tah'Nuhna pleading that they were neutral and their culture compelled them to help travelers in need, Hux ordered the planet's destruction. As a result, the Mandator IV-class fired on the planet, while First Order TIE bombers bombed areas and snowtroopers massacred the people in a city."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mandator IV-class warship was unveiled on August 23, 2017, on the Star Wars Show on YouTube, alongside the All Terrain MegaCaliber Six, showcasing several vehicles that have appeared in Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Kevin Jenkins, the design supervisor for The Last Jedi, the ship was already indicated in the initial script, but its design did not occur until post-production. He also indicated that director Rian Johnson specifically requested for a bigger battleship known as a dreadnought for the film and that it would act as a gun platform as well as a flat surface with lots of cannons on it. He also indicated that the design was taken from multiple real-world elements, namely World War II (especially the use of big guns among several things like the Yamato super-battleship and others) as well as the Korean War, and that the historical inspirations even went right up to the 1960s. He also indicated that similar to other ships in the Sequel trilogy, the ship was based largely on designs from the original trilogy, at least insofar as it resembling an ILM model. They also ultimately decided on just using big guns instead of other elements like a Flash Gordon-based design as well as radar equipment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Star Wars: Card Trader app previously labeled this vessel as a Mandator III-class Siege Dreadnought, which currently only exists in Star Wars Legends, although this was corrected in the app."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
