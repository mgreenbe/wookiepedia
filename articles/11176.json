Each pod had a large tail but the starboard pod contained the cockpit while the port-side pod contained a navigation dish. A large circular canopy allowed a 180-degree field of view for the pilot and crew. The ship rested on three articulated landing struts when at rest and which could be retracted into the main hull for flight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
