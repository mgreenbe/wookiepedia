The burning gel's primary purpose to burn through doors, hatchways, and machine compartments that are otherwise inaccessible, though it is also commonly used to cut holes in damaged or derelict starships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the gel is used, it burns through almost any substance and in any environment. Contrary to cutting torches and welders, it emits no flame and requires no oxygen, allowing its use in the vacuum of space. These qualities allowed it to be very popular among salvage crews, archaeologists, and other less savory characters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The gel has two primary components: a stable, extremely caustic acid suspended in a clear gel that sticks to almost any surface and a pair of thin electrodes. Both are contained in a dispenser unit that includes a refillable tank of gel and electrode wire, a very small power generator, and a pistol-grip applicator as well as the necessary wiring. Once a desired amount of burning gel has been used, the power generator activates and runs a quick, high-powered charge through the gel to activate the acid, which immediately begins eating away at whatever it has been applied to."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
