Elections for membership of the Oversight Committee were held every five years from among the city's adult Quarren population and the body served the purpose of keeping in check the actions of the Chief Manager, the city's elected leader. The Oversight Committee convened once a week to review the actions of the Chief Manager and if they disagreed with a decision that the Chief Manager had made, they could request that the Manager reconsider the action. If the Chief Manager then refused to overturn the decision, the Oversight Committee could call for a vote of confidence in the Manager to be held among the city's population."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
