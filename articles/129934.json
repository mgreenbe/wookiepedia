In 3 ABY, the weapons dealer Orion Ferret used a quantity of spritzer to ensnare the Wookiee Chewbacca inside of his private office on the space station Bazarre. Although the spritzer in question was quite dense, it was not strong enough to keep Chewbacca imprisoned for long. Within minutes, the Wookiee was able to claw his way free of the chemical mass and apprehend Ferret."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
