She thus recruited a spacer who had previously worked for the Corellian government with Gallura Handerin. She tasked the spacer to meet with the  informant in a warehouse in Coronet. However, when the spacer arrived in the warehouse, the informant was assassinated by a group of criminals made of former members of the Corellian Security Force, the Rogue CorSec. The spacer tried to recover the informant's hidden datadisk but was unable to do so. The spacer then reported the situation to Spondoon who was very disappointed and worried that the information was lost. Brantlee Spondoon ignored that the spacer was in fact working for CorSec Lieutenant Mack Jasper. Jasper and the spacer decided to investigate the Rogue CorSec, and were finally able to foil the plot against the Diktat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brantlee Spondoon was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brantlee Spondoon and Daclif Gallamby were present in the original release of the game. Like most quest giver NPCs in the earliest versions of the game, they proposed \"minor quests\" to the players. These quests did not provide any experience and just consisted in moving to a random location in order to kill or protect one or several NPCs. These minor quests were removed from the game with the release of the expansion Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan, on November 1, 2005, since both characters were included in a new story arc, i.e., the Rogue CorSec plot against the Diktat. This questline was later slightly revamped with the release of the \"Publish 27\", on February 15, 2006, as the story arc was inserted into the \"Legacy Quest\", the main questline in the game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
