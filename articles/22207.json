The canisters were either stored in the launcher, or in the magazine of the weapon, which could hold four extra canisters. An adapter, the PL/1G, was available that could convert the CSPL-12 to fire grenades."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The CSPL-12 had the ability to fire several canister types; a dye canister which was able to mark terrain in a ten-meter radius, a smoke canister for obscuring vision and marking terrain, a T-238 canister which induced nausea and incapacitated targets, CryoBan canisters which froze targets and incapacitated them, Plank Gas canisters which delivered corrosive damage, Spore/B canisters which caused unconsciousness through the use of Bothan stun spores, and a Fex-M3 canister which released nerve gas, causing death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The CSPL-12 was known to periodically jam, igniting the canister in the chamber. However, it was found that this only generally occurred when the soldier handling the weapon failed to properly clean and maintain the weapon.
