Early in his career he supported his fellow racer Zak Quiglee's attempt along with Friggy Squig to get their reckless competitors Neb Neb Goodrow and Spleed Nukkels banned from the sport on accusations of collusion, greatly endangering the lives of others and giving the sport a bad name with their reckless driving. However their charges were thrown out by the Gungan race commissioner and never reached the Gungan High Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after the battle of Naboo he took part in the Otoh Gunga challenge, where he drove a monobubble bongo Bongo, along with a large number of contestants including Friggy, Quiglee, Neb Neb, Spleed and veteran racer Brooboo Seep along with twenty six other vessels including the Opee Fleer. The race had a large number of spectators including Boss Rugor Nass and the Ithorian ambassador as well as large number of tourists and Gungans. Once the race began the Opee Fleer took the lead with Tup Tup, Friggy and Quiglee close behind it in their respective vessels. However Spleed, Broo boo and Neb Neb quickly caught up much to the Tup Tup and his friend's annoyance. In an attempt to stop Spleed overtaking the trio Friggy Squig performed a 'twisty', rolling his Bongo to prevent her passing; however she rammed her bongo into his fins causing him to crash. Angered by the humiliation of their friend Tup Tup and Quiglee then began working together to block Spleed and Neb Neb but the male Gungan managed to slip passed and took the lead catching the Opee killer in his craft's wake. The large vessel was slowed by the faster ship and in his over eagerness to catch up to Neb Neb, Tup Tup accelerated straight into the side of the Opee Fleer, destroying both bongos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tub Tub was forced to eject from his ship and floated to the surface of lake Paonga.
