In 22 BBY, two lovers, Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker and Republic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, used the names of Set and Ver\u00e9, respectively, to secretly elope.

In 22 BBY, immediately after the First Battle of Geonosis, these names were used as aliases by Republic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker, respectively. Knowing matrimony to be contrary to the Jedi Order's belief that such an attachment, through passion, brought one close to the dark side of the Force, the young lovers used the archaic monikers to anonymously marry, not even allowing their pastor, Pontifex Maxiron Agolerga, to know their true identities. \"Set\" and \"Ver\u00e9\" were blissfully wed, and Agolerga was instructed to tell no one of the ceremony, ensuring the only record of the short procession would be a scroll in his Brotherhood's archives. When Agolerga eventually learned who they really were, he informed Amidala's niece, Pooja Naberrie, of the union."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ver\u00e9 was originally created during the What's The Story? campaign on StarWars.com, in which Hyperspace members were allowed to author backstories for various background characters from the Star Wars films for inclusion in the StarWars.com Databank and canon with respect to the Star Wars Legends continuity. The particular \"Maxiron Agolerga\" entry, written by Tim Veekhoven under the handle \"Sompeetalay,\" covered Agolerga around the time he was solicited to oversee the Skywalker\u2013Amidala unity, as seen in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, establishing Ver\u00e9 and Set as legendary characters in its text.
