With his Mandalorian armor, IB-94 blaster pistol, Amban sniper rifle, and distinctive beskar helmet, Djarin was both well-equipped and enigmatic\u2014a stranger whose past was shrouded in mystery to others. Orphaned during the Republic Era, he was raised as a foundling by the Children of the Watch, a group that had broken off from mainstream Mandalorian society. Djarin was not aware of this and believed that all Mandalorians followed the Children of the Watch's beliefs. He was trained to become a Mandalorian warrior and eventually joined the Tribe, which operated in a secret covert on Nevarro and was affiliated with the Children of the Watch. Djarin became battle-hardened, a man of few words, and a formidable hunter in an increasingly dangerous galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the fall of the Galactic Empire, Djarin made a reputation for himself as a member of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, collecting bounties as he traveled across the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories\u2014far from the authority of the New Republic\u2014in his personal starship, the Razor Crest. Around 9 ABY, Djarin was hired on Nevarro by a client of an Imperial remnant faction, who offered a substantial reward for the acquisition of an asset located on the world Arvala-7. During his mission on Arvala-7, he met an Ugnaught named Kuiil, who guided him to the location of the asset. On his way to the asset, Djarin encountered a bounty hunter droid, IG-11 who first shot Djarin, oblivious to the fact that he was part of the Bounty Hunters' Guild. After Djarin verified his identity, the two entered the building in the encampment guarded by mercenaries where the asset was kept. Upon seeing the asset itself, they discovered that it was in fact a Force-sensitive child. Unbeknownst to Djarin, the child was a former Jedi youngling named Grogu, and belonged to the same species as Jedi Grand Master Yoda. Djarin, who was tasked with bringing Grogu in alive, shot IG-11 in the head, who was about to kill Grogu, and saved the infant, taking him into his custody."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Discovering Grogu's Force-sensitivity during his time on Arvala-7, Djarin then took Grogu back to the Client and collected his reward.

Djarin then gathered his allies\u2014Dune, Kuiil, and a re-programmed IG-11\u2014and met with Karga on Nevarro. Djarin and his allies entered the city and fought the Imperials led by Moff Gideon, later retreating to the Tribe's covert after facing heavy opposition. The Mandalorian known as \"the Armorer,\" who had remained in the hideout after the covert's attempted relocation, tasked Djarin with returning Grogu to his people, and declared the creation of his clan. After dealing with Gideon and his remaining Imperials, Djarin departed the planet with the infant and began his search for Grogu's people."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Djarin and Grogu wandered the galaxy, they went on many missions together, such as a run-in with the Marshal of Mos Pelgo, Cobb Vanth, a meeting with another group of Mandalorians, and another mission with Cara Dune and Greef Karga on Nevarro. Eventually, the pair made it to Corvus, where they encountered a former Jedi named Ahsoka Tano, who was able to communicate with Grogu through the Force, revealing the child's name and history to the Mandalorian. After Djarin assisted Tano with liberating the city of Calodan from an Imperial magistrate named Morgan Elsbeth, Tano gifted Elsbeth's beskar spear to Djarin and directed him to Tython, a planet where Grogu could reach out to any other Jedi willing to train him. On Tython, as Grogu was attempting to reach a Jedi, Djarin met Boba Fett, the son of another Mandalorian, who wanted his armor back in exchange for not harming the Child. However, before Djarin could give Fett the armor, Gideon's Imperial remnant attacked and captured Grogu."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After receiving his armor, Fett agreed to help Djarin rescue Grogu, and, with the help of Cara Dune, Migs Mayfeld, and Fennec Shand, locate Gideon's light cruiser. Djarin, alongside the Nite Owls, Dune, and Shand, stormed the cruiser and managed to locate the Child. In the process, though, Djarin unintentionally became a potential heir to the title of Mand'alor after defeating Gideon in combat and claiming the Darksaber. However, as the team attempted to escape, they were cornered by a platoon of dark troopers before being rescued by Luke Skywalker, the Jedi that Grogu had reached out to. When the dark troopers were finally destroyed, Skywalker left the ship with Grogu, but not before Djarin said his goodbyes to the youngling and promised they would see each other again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a child, Din Djarin resided in the settlement of Aq Vetina.

Unknown to Djarin, the Tribe followed the ways of the Children of the Watch.

During the rise of the New Republic, Djarin traveled across the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories collecting bounties as a member of the Bounty Hunters' Guild. In that time, he developed a reputation for being an expensive, yet famous and formidable, bounty hunter in an increasingly dangerous galaxy. At some point, Djarin had worked alongside criminal Ranzar Malk, and the Twi'lek mercenaries Xi'an and Qin, who were also siblings. One such mission was on Alzoc III.

As Djarin made his way to the counter, one of the human trawlers approached him and claimed he had spilled his drink, speaking in Huttese. The bartender translated his statement, but Djarin remained silent. As the bartender proceeded to make another drink, the trawler's Quarren and cyborg human companions made their way to the counter, slowly surrounding Djarin.

When the Quarren attempted to escape the bar, Djarin used his whipcord thrower to pull him back towards him and shot the controls for the door, allowing it to close on the Quarren and bisect him. After dealing with the trawlers, Djarin approached the Mythrol, who thanked him for saving his life. However, Djarin displayed the Mythrol's holopuck in front of him.

The pilot drove the Mandalorian and the Mythrol to the Razor Crest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After he left them, the speeder pilot was attacked by a ravinak, who pulled the speeder under the ice. Djarin pulled the Mythrol out of the way of the beast as they boarded the ship to take off.

While making their way to Nevarro, Djarin remained silent while the Mythrol attempted to spark a conversation with him. He then allowed the Mythrol to use the Razor Crest's vacc tube in the lower deck.

The Client told Djarin that Karga had called him \"the best in the parsec.\" While speaking to the bounty hunter, his scientist, Doctor Pershing, entered the room and startled Djarin, prompting him to draw his weapons. The stormtroopers trained their own blasters at him. The Client introduced Pershing to the Mandalorian, before ordering Djarin to lower his blaster. Djarin told the Client to order his stormtroopers to lower their blasters first, before being told that Karga also stated that the bounty hunter's services were expensive.

The Client acknowledged how complicated bounty hunting could be, and stated that the asset's termination was acceptable for a lower reward. When Djarin demanded the puck of the target, the Client forwent the traditional method of bounty pucks and revealed that he could only offer the asset's tracking fob.

She told him it was gathered during the Great Purge, an event which saw the deaths of most of the Mandalorian people, and added that it was beneficial that it was returned to the Tribe. Djarin was asked if his signet had been revealed, and replied that it hadn't yet. When the Armorer said that the excess would sponsor many foundlings, Djarin recounted that he had been one in the past.

Djarin then attempted to tame the foal one last time and successfully hopped on its back without startling it. Afterwards, Kuiil guided the bounty hunter to the asset's location in the hope that the ensuing battle would lead to the deaths of the mercenaries whose presence disrupted the peace on Arvala-7.

Djarin questioned the infant's age, to which the droid replied his species may have aged considerably slower compared to others. As IG-11 raised his blaster to kill the infant, Djarin stopped him and stated that they should bring him in alive. The assassin droid replied that the commission was quite specific and stated that Grogu was to be terminated.
