A strong spray of condensed air or water could separate mudmen into small forms. Smaller mudmen could be kept as pets and exported throughout the galaxy. They were harmless and loved shiny things. Unlike most of the organisms found on the planet, they were believed to be native to Roon. They were not intelligent enough to be a threat or interfere with colonists, and would only be a disturbance if a particularly shiny object was loose."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kaminoans possessed at least one sample of mudmen for eventual cloning.
