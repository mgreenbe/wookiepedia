Naturally they lived for only twenty-four hours, however the Kubaz chef Zubindi Ebsuk could keep a member of the species alive for up to five years using growth enzymes, which caused many changes to the gnats. Those with extended lives could sing and whistle and in the fifth year of their life they developed tentacles with which they could move around on. In 13 ABY, the Hutt Jedi Knight Beldorion served a gnat that Ebsuk had raised for a year to the Human diplomat Leia Organa Solo after he captured her on the planet Nam Chorios. The gnat was blue and cherry-like in appearance when it was served and both the Hutt and Organa enjoyed it immensely due to the fact it was sweet, meaty, juicy, and subtly chambered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rodian kelp gnats first appeared in Planet of Twilight, a novel written by Barbara Hambly and released in 1997."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
