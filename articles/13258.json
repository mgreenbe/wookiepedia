Following the mission's successful conclusion, he also held a party there to celebrate. He again used the bistro to launch a mission to rescue a \"lost courier\" on Depatar. However, the \"courier\" was actually the Jedi Knight Alec, who had uncovered a plan of Wefos to attack a number of cities on Genarius. When Wefos's agents realized his true motives they switched sides. Returning to Rabbud's to confront Wefos he instead sent an astromech droid rigged with a bomb to harm the agents.
