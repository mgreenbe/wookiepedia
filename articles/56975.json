In the year 0 ABY, the Green/Besh was stationed on the edge of the Mid Rim's Ringali Nebula alongside the IPV-1 Green/Aura and the Lancer-class frigate Rage at the Imperial Bavos-II military space platform Station 1B6/Green. It was armed with four turbolasers, could reach a speed of one thousand kilometers per hour, and acted as an inter-system patrol and customs craft. The Green/Besh was produced by the company Sienar Fleet Systems, and was 150 meters long."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Green/Besh was first mentioned in 1998's The Far Orbit Project, by Timothy S. O'Brien. The book was a supplement to West End Games's Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game and was a sequel of sorts to the previous publication Pirates & Privateers, carrying on that book's theme by following the privateering EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Far Orbit. Players could attack Station 1B6/Green with the Far Orbit as a part of the scenerio hook \"Who Is The More Foolish\u2026?\".
