It was probably formed by Stagorr following his imprisonment in Ice Mountain. He used the mirror as his sole portal to the outside world. The special abilities of the object allowed Stagorr to witness events all over the moon, such as things happening in Bright Tree Village. After Stagorr's death, the ice mirror remained in Ice Mountain without an owner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
