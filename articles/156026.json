Circa 21 BBY, a group of freelance agents traveled to New Dawn at the behest of the station's commander, Jedi Knight Renij Jaa. The clone sergeant commanded a squad of clone troopers that were sent to greet the agents and the clones escorted them to a conference room, where Jaa met with the agents. Once Jaa had finished speaking to the agents, he signaled to the sergeant to lead them to their starship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
