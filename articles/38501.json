It was weaker and did less damage than a disruptor rifle, but could still vaporize whatever it hit. Primitive forms of the disruptor pistol existed as early as 3958 BBY, and was used by mainly criminal cartels and the Mandalorians due to the fact that it was outlawed in the Republic because most believed it was inhumane. However, it was widely used by officers in the Sith army during the New Sith Wars. It was still widely used by criminal organizations by the time of the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
