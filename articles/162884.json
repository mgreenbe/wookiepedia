He was the only survivor of the group of Eluthans who were rescued from an Imperial prison by the freedom fighter known as Flame, during the early months of the New Order. All of the other Eluthans, including Vira, later died in the civil war that engulfed the planet when the Empire abandoned it.

This presented a problem, because his daughter was married to a Sood."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Clive Flax arrived on Acherin to learn more about Flame's history, he hoped to meet with Warlin and discuss his rescue.
