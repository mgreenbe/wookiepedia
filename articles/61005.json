The grave was thought to hold the remains of some of the first settlers of Tatooine. The site consisted of several small graves, forming a circle of stones, that surrounded a bigger center stone which might house the corpse of the leader. Thousands of years later, during the Galactic Civil War, an explorer by the name of Tinrilo x'Rilsam traveled to the grave. Unfortunately, he was not able to find any information about the people buried there since the site was plundered long ago."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hero's Grave was a location in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
