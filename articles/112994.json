This emergency command was used when encountering a disaster of some kind which must be very serious. A Red Zero always had top priority and would be transmitted to all ships and vessels within reach as well as to the operational HQ."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "367 days after the First Battle of Geonosis, Omega Squad boarded a disguised Separatist transport during a TIOPS mission. One of the legitimate freighters traveling in the three ship convoy fired on the TIV, unaware that it was a Republic special forces ship. This caused a serious hull breach and forced Omega to signal a \"Red Zero\". Captain Ordo in Coruscant HQ received the message and relayed it to fleet command; RAS Fearless, Majestic and Delta Squad (on board a captured Neimoidian vessel) responded to this request. Eventually, Omega was saved by Delta Squad, who reached their position first, and Fearless, who saved them from a Separatist attack ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
