It had been discovered and charted in the distant past, but was not considered important enough to be named or given a designation. The world was abundant with life, but had no signs of technology. Qui-Gon Jinn was guided to the world by the Force, and felt the presence of the dark side. When Jinn entered a dark side monument, he had a Force vision, but was able to break free from it once the light side found its way to him. He left the world, having concluded that violence could lead the Jedi to become what they claimed to fight against."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
