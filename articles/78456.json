They lived on a diet of insects, using their long snout to snatch their prey from inside hives. This did not make them very popular with sentient insectoid species, such as the Geonosians. They had dark skin, long snouts, and sensitive eyesight causing them to require protective eyewear. On the whole, their appearance resembled that of the northern Mustafarians. Kubaz were unable to pronounce the phonemes of Galactic Basic Standard, and their language was made of whirring syllables."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One notable member of this species was Garindan ezz Zavor, an informant who worked for the highest bidder. Another was Ooblamon, a junk dealer from Taris who claimed to have recovered the red-bladed lightsaber that had belonged to Darth Vader. Another Kubaz was Rikard Lovas, a male banker who regularly conducted business on the planet Jakku that fell into gambling debts owed to the Irving Boys."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An unidentified member of the Kubaz worked as a ferryman on the ice planet Maldo Kreis around 9 ABY.
