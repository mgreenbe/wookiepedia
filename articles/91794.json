The name of the system built upon the mention of the astronomical object Mistar-5 in the 1993 book Monsters and Aliens from George Lucas, a publication that combines creature designs and photographs from various projects of George Lucas, creator of the Star Wars franchise, with original text by Bob Carrau. In the book, Mistar-5 is described as a terrestrial celestial body where the attorney known as The Wavering Oeklass appropriated a boat, thereby violating the terms of an ownership agreement with the other attorneys of the law firm Nani, Medypsh, Effervesence, & Oeklass. Lucasfilm employee Leland Chee, who maintains the Holocron continuity database, has indicated that information contained in Monsters and Aliens from George Lucas is non-canonical with respect to the Star Wars Legends continuity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
