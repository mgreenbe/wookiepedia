The mansion's compound overlooked the artificial waters of a nearby bay. It contained large domed enclosures, gilded columns, polished stone floors, high-ceilinged rooms, and stately colonnades. Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum found it to be impersonal and an ostentatious blend of Core Classic and Mid Rim Ornate. Valorum and the rest of his Coruscant delegation stayed at the mansion during the Eriadu Trade Summit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tarkin relocated to the Eriadu Governor's Palace after becoming governor of the Seswenna sector in 29 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
