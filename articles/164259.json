The character was initially identified by the Legends Star Wars Customizable Card Game released in 1997, with his name being brought into canon by the Star Wars: Card Trader digital app. Based on the ice-cream-maker-like prop Hood carries in the film, he is often known to fans as \"Ice Cream Guy,\" \"Ice Cream Maker Guy,\" or \"Ice Cream Man.\" A tradition was established at Star Wars celebration called \"The Running of the Hoods\" in which fans dress up in orange jumpsuits similar to Hood's, put on fake mustaches, and run around the convention with ice cream makers. This has given the character somewhat of a hero status among fans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During production of The Mandalorian TV series, Jon Favreau shared photos on his Instagram account, one of which featured a container similar to the one carried by Hood in The Empire Strikes Back.
