By the time following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Commander Orde oversaw operations against the Rebel Alliance. When many of his officers became jaded, Orde turned to a new Imperial rookie to help shake things up. Orde believed it was necessary to remain vigilant for Rebels lurking around the periphery, looking for weak points to exploit. To deter their efforts, Orde tasked his Imperial rookie with tracking down a hidden Rebel scouting party. The Imperial rookie succeeded in this task, and managed to kill two Rebel scouts in the process."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rebel Rescue Team"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orde was impressed by the rookie's outstanding success in eliminating the two Rebels. However, the Imperial commander knew that the Rebel's would surely send a rescue party to search for their missing scouts. Hoping to take advantage of this situation, Orde asked his loyal operative to arrange a surprise attack against whatever group the Rebel's might send. The astute Imperial commander had no misgiving about inflicting collateral damage in the process. Orde received intelligence reports regarding unexplained activity in one sector outside of the fortress. He believed that would be a good place to start, and instructed the rookie to search the area. The reports proved to be accurate. Two Rebel commandos were in the area, searching for the missing scouts. Caught off guard, the Imperial rookie attacked and killed the two of them, much to Orde's gratification, who commended the rookie for a \"first-rate job.\""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mobile Rebel Base"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fact that Orde had to deal with both a Rebel scouting group and a subsequent search party within such a short amount of time proved telling. The Imperial commander believed this was indicative of some sort of mobile command center, which allowed the Rebels to carry out operations on jungle moon. When the rookie asked Orde why he was so sure of this, the commander assured his subordinate that as the commander of an Imperial base, he had access to intelligence reports which supported his conclusion. With that, Orde instructed his operative to locate the leader of the mobile base, and to destroy him and any other Rebels in the surrounding area. Orde's hypothesis proved correct. The Imperial rookie discovered the location of the temporary base led by a Rebel colonel. The colonel was accompanied by an additional scout, two commandos, and a Rebel second lieutenant. Despite being up against five Rebels, the Imperial rookie dispatched by Orde managed to kill them in the ensuring firefight. Commander Orde was again pleased with the successful nature of his operative's work. He commended the individual for doing the Empire a great service. While he believed eliminating the mobile base would keep the Rebel's at bay for a while, he viewed the Rebels as vermin, which could not be gotten rid of entirely."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vraker Orde had tan skin, gray hair, brown eyebrows, and brown-colored eyes. Loyal and committed to the Galactic Empire, Orde vowed not to rest until every Rebel on Yavin 4 was dead. He viewed Rebels as vermin, and he expressed disdain towards any individual who exhibited sympathies with their cause. He detested failure, but he also commended success, as evidenced by his adulation of the Imperial rookie who succeeded in carrying out his assignments. Orde believed that if he had someone like his operative among his officers, he would have been able to clean Yavin 4 of Rebel activity in no time. Indeed, many of Orde's officers became jaded, which impeded upon their ability to root out Rebel activity effectively."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As an Imperial officer, Vraker Orde wore many elements of a typical Imperial officer's uniform. This uniform consisted of a grey tunic affixed with a rank insignia plaque and two code cylinders, indicating his rank as a commander in the Imperial Military. He also wore tan-colored trousers, a grey cap with an affixed officer's disc, a black belt with a silver-colored buckle, and gray uniform boots. Despite his allegiance to the Empire, Orde possessed an arsenal of weapons typically carried by members of the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vraker Orde is listed as a non-player character in the 2004 Star Wars Galaxies: Jump to Lightspeed: Prima Official Game Guide. The reference guide was created for the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. In the guide, Vraker Orde is listed as a townsperson located on Yavin 4. The guide also indicates that Orde possessed \"Rebel weapons.\""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cut content"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite being listed in the aforementioned reference guide, Vraker Orde is not definitively known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. If Orde was ever included as an NPC, then the character was removed from the game before its existence could be properly verified. According to an archived 2003 Star Wars Galaxies forum thread, a user named AcowebaAbi indicated that Orde could be found at an Imperial base on Yavin 4. In another archived 2003 thread, a user named RayBothan presumed a similar possibility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The game's directory tree files and source data place Orde among the many NPCs who gave players simple kill, delivery, and escort quests. The files contain information for three of these quests, each of which were kill missions which would have required the player to kill a Rebel scout, commando, and colonel respectively. Each of these quests would have awarded the player 250 Imperial faction points. At least one emulator project incorporates Vraker Orde and his quests, however, as emulator projects are not officially licensed, this does not constitute a definitive appearance. Because of the ambiguity surrounding Orde's actual inclusion to Star Wars Galaxies, this article assumes the gameplay information to be cut, and that only the information contained in the Star Wars Galaxies: Jump to Lightspeed: Prima Official Game Guide is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
