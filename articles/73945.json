This was in stark contrast to Kanjiklub's chief rivals, the Guavian Death Gang. Shortly before the Battle of Starkiller Base, Kanjiklub put aside their differences with the Guavians in order to confront longtime smuggler Han Solo over debts that he had failed to repay. Leech confronted Solo and his first mate, Chewbacca, aboard Solo's Eravana. However, a trio of dangerous rathtars were released into the session, and the beasts killed Leech, his lieutenant Qin-Fee, Volzang Li-Thrull, Crokind Shand, Tolomar Reez, multiple Kanjiklubbers, and at least three Guavian security soldiers, which allowed Solo and his companions to escape.
