They often used this fact to their advantage, allowing prosperous masters to keep them as pets to secure themselves shelter and a constant supply of food. They were often ignored, and could therefore sneak unnoticed into palaces or ships and complete secretive tasks. The Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure kept the Frog-dog known as Buboicullaar as a pet, despite his sentience, and used him to spy on his many courtiers. Buboicullaar protected the Hutt from many assassination attempts. Frog-dogs like Bubo could pull 119 kilograms, or 262 pounds with their tongue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
