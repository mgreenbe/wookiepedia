The Republic sent Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi to the pirate base on Florrum to confirm the capture of Dooku. Hondo Ohnaka, the leader of the gang, was eager to triple the ransom, so he captured the Jedi too. The Sith Lord and the Jedi tried to escape on many an occasion, but were recaptured each time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During one such escape, the prisoners attempted to escape by pole-vaulting over the wall of the pirate outpost. They succeeded only partially, with Skywalker clinging to the edge of the wall, while Kenobi and Dooku held on to his legs. Meanwhile Flask and several other pirates opened fire upon the escapees. Anakin couldn't hold on any longer and told Kenobi to drop Dooku. Suddenly, Flask ordered a cease-fire. Ohnaka was then standing on the wall, and told his men to arrest the prisoners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two years later, Dagu fought alongside Hondo against their own pirates that defected to side with Darth Maul and Savage Opress in their conquest for power.
