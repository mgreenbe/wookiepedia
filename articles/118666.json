By 32 BBY, the holocron was in the hands of Zippa the Toydarian. He tried unsuccessfully to sell the holocron to Lorn Pavan. By unknown means, it ended up in the Imperial Palace, where it became part of Darth Vader's collection. Haninum Tyk Rhinann, in an attempt to find a way to protect himself from his Sith master, Darth Vader, stole the holocron from Catalog Nineteen of the palace archives. Immediately afterward, Darth Vader took Rhinann to the Factory District, where the Dark Lord was en route to capture Jax Pavan. Rhinann escaped from Lord Vader, temporarily allied himself with Pavan, and gave Pavan the holocron. I-5YQ, a protocol droid, recognized it as the one that Lorn Pavan had been searching for and remembered that the Sith holocron contained information of an ancient order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
