It was seemingly lost when BT-1 destroyed the base after killing the personnel in a homicidal rampage. However, the assassin droid 0-0-0, another product of the Tarkin Initiative, was fluent in all its internal test languages, including the base's R&D language, and was able to reactivate BT-1."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Source"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
