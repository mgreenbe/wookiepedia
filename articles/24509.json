Their race evolved from ocean-dwelling invertebrates to the ancestors that eventually lived on land in Celegia. To move their jellyfish-like bodies, the Celegians created a form of locomotion similar to a repulsorlift generator. Their soft fleshy bodies, great tentacles, and dependence upon life-support chambers made the Celegians look as though they were always swimming or floating. Celegians communicated using a form of telepathy, and had no written or spoken language."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Celegians in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Celegians tended to be explorers, and were often found in the company of other species with the same interests.
