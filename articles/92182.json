This caused a rush of investors and shipbuilders from many other planets to migrate to Aduba-3 to make their fortunes. Not surprisingly, the chromium dried up in less than a year. Penniless, businesses were forced to abandon any plants or factories they had produced and leave, which Modirin was able to purchase at massive discounts. They then rented out these structures to Aduban merchants, turning a huge profit in the end."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
