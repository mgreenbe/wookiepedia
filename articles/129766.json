In the year 22 BBY, Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi utilized the Spirit for transportation to the planet Tatooine, where the Jedi Master met and negotiated with the Hutt crime lord, Jabba Desilijic Tiure, concerning the rescue of his recently kidnapped son, Rotta. Upon the completion of their terse negotiations, Kenobi returned to the Spirit via his Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor, and ordered the cruiser to depart for Teth. There, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Skywalker's Padawan Ahsoka Tano, and Torrent Company's clone troopers were attempting to rescue the missing Hutt child from the battle droids of the CIS."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Serving as the flagship of Republic admiral Wullf Yularen, the warship Spirit of the Republic emerged from hyperspace over Teth and moved into the planet's atmosphere, only to be swept up in the ongoing battle being waged between Skywalker's 501st Legion soldiers, and the droid army under the authority of Dark Acolyte and Separatist commander, Asajj Ventress. While Kenobi launched an attack on the ancient B'omarr monastery at the heart of the fighting, leading a squadron of V-19 Torrent starfighters and LAAT/i gunships from his starfighter, the Spirit engaged a Confederate Munificent-class star frigate in the upper atmosphere. It was during this battle with the Confederate frigate that transponder code scanners aboard the Spirit of the Republic picked up an incoming CIS transponder signal, and opened fire on what turned out to be General Skywalker aboard the commandeered freighter vessel, the Twilight; after suffering a number of Separatist suicide runs in the past, the Spirit's \"shoot first\" standard operating procedure had been solidified. However, once Skywalker managed to convince Admiral Yularen of the Twilight's true allegiances, the Spirit's deflector shields were temporarily lowered in order to provide the Jedi General access to the rear port hangar bay to land. Skywalker had been under fire from three pursuing Vulture droids, however, and when the Spirit's port rear hangar was opened, the three Vultures rammed themselves into the open hangar bay. The subsequent explosion from their impact killed the clone naval officers overseeing the hangar, and severely damaged the bay. Skywalker was forced to take the young Huttlet he managed to rescue from the monastery back to his father Jabba on Tatooine aboard the Twilight, with only his Padawan and astromech droid R2-D2 for support."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Spirit of the Republic first appeared in the 2008 adult novelization of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars film, written by author Karen Traviss.
