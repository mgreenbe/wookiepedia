Manufactured by Structgalactis, Inc., it was designed for such heavy work as clearing fields, digging ditches, grading terrain, and putting up new buildings. It was one of the first models equipped with a set of frictionless omnidirectional treads ever to be commercially deployed. Shaped like a cube whose sides were 3 meters in length, a Z7 unit had two symmetric arms that could be fitted with various attachments such as shovels, power lifters, hooks, hoes, wrecking rams, and stack manipulators."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One such droid, commonly designated as Zeta because her full designation was too long to say easily, was once part of the crew that built a settlement in the tundra of Cro-Akon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
