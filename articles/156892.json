After twenty years of caring for children, the nanny droid had several parts in need of replacement and was retired for use in a training exercise held on the grounds of the planet Lothal's Academy for Young Imperials. Though old, she was of a newer model than that of Auntie Nags, a similar nanny droid that had been in the Leonis family for many generations. She was captured as a \"high-value target\" as part of the training exercise and then obliterated by Nazhros Oleg via blaster, even though nobody had given an order to fire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
