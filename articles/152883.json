Kessek was employed by the syndicate to collect satchels of credits at various shadowports, from couriers working for a company controlled by members of the Hutt species. The Shadowport and Hutt companies' courier would change with each delivery as would the identity that Prit assumed. The credits were payment from the shipping magnate Brevis Taug to the Thanda clan of Zygerrian slavers, whom Taug had helped purchase a fleet of slaveship which he paid upkeep and maintenance for. Prit would then deliver the credits to Atlee Thanda, a member of the Thanda clan, above Zygerria, a planet to which the syndicate had links."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The courier operation run by the syndicate was put to an end when a group of hired spacers impersonating a courier, replaced Prit and then captured Atlee and handed him over to the authorities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Herglic crime syndicate was first mentioned in the 2003 Star Wars Roleplaying Game adventure Zygerrian Takedown which was released online by Wizards of the Coast and designed by Jason Fry.
