They had venomous claws used to weaken their prey, the venom of which was odorless and tasteless. Though illegal, sand panthers were often hunted by poachers for their prized fur and toxic venom. Their hide was used to make leather for fine clothing and purses which fetched a very high price due to its rarity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sand panthers lived primarily in desert environments, but could sometimes be found in more temperate zones as well. Their coats were a light yellow or tan to help them blend into their arid surroundings, although the rare albino or silver-furred panther had been known to exist. They were solitary hunters, but were occasionally seen hunting in small family units. The sand panther was one of the galaxy's quietest hunters, able to approach within centimeters of prey without drawing attention."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the creatures were not nocturnal they were very rarely seen amongst Corellians and were virtually impossible to tame."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Doallyn's sand panther encounter"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime before 4 ABY the Geranite hunter Doallyn went game hunting on Corellia.
