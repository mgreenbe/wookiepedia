After completing his training in the Alliance's base near Beggar's Canyon, the young Rebel fought in the battle of Tatooine, during which his squadron led an assault on an Imperial-class Star Destroyer, and later helped to buy time for the safe evacuation of personnel from Gamma Base on Hoth during an Imperial attack.

As part of Rascal Squadron, Rookie One destroyed the Arah mining facility, but soon after witnessed the Phantom TIEs when his group was attacked and he was the sole survivor. With this information, Rookie One traveled to Imdaar where, with the cooperation of Ru Murleen, he managed to infiltrate the Super Star Destroyer Terror and steal one of the new starfighters.

Hack was impressed with the young pilot's enthusiasm for the Rebellion and desire to help defeat the Empire, and helped Rookie One to join the Alliance for training as a starfighter pilot. Hack soon became like a \"big brother\" to the young recruit, taking him under his wing and doing what he could to help him develop into one of best pilots in the fleet.

After successfully navigating the canyon, Rookie One moved onto the second part of the trial, navigating in formation through the rocky terrain while engaging in target practice against a number of target drones.

On Kolaador Rookie One met Ru Murleen, then the youngest commander in the Alliance, who would serve as his final instructor. The difficult course required him to follow her lead in his R-22 through the planet's hazardous crystalline rock formations.

Rookie One was selected to join Commander Murleen and another rookie pilot, Thurlow Harris, for the mission. The group came out of hyperspace to find an Imperial-class Star Destroyer in orbit. Murleen knew that with the Star Destroyer coordinating the attack below, the Rebels would likely be defeated, so instructed her group to eliminate its command center before proceeding to the surface. In a series of strafing runs, the group weakened the ship's defenses while holding off the Star Destroyer's TIE fighters. When the deflector shields protecting the bridge finally fell, Murleen instructed Rookie One to arm his proton torpedoes and commence an attack run on the unprotected command tower.

Acting quickly to prevent the TIEs reporting their presence back to their commanders, Rookie One gave chase through Beggar's Canyon and destroyed all three Imperial fighters. Joined by Captain Merrick Simms, the Rebels proceeded to Mos Eisley where the Empire was deploying ground forces. While Murleen left to attempt to cut off the Imperial supply lines, Rookie One joined Simms and Harris in engaging All Terrain Scout Transports and Imperial landing craft. After causing as much damage to the Imperial forces as they could, and with TIE fighters incoming, the group was forced to withdraw.

For some time the Empire had been developing the Death Star, a battlestation with enough power to destroy a planet. Though the Alliance had been able to acquire the plans to the superweapon, the Empire had learned the location of their base and the Death Star was en route to Yavin. Fortunately, analysis of the plans indicated a weakness which would make the battlestation vulnerable to a starfighter attack. With just three hours before its arrival, Rookie One participated in a hastily arranged training mission to prepare the pilots for the upcoming battle in which he was required to destroy target drones while navigating through a narrow river bed on the jungle moon. By the end of the training mission, the Death Star had arrived in the system, and Rookie One formed up with the other Rebel starfighters for the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rookie One was assigned to Blue Squadron for the Battle of Yavin, flying under the command of Merrick Simms. As the squadron approached the battlestation, a Star Destroyer in the Death Star's support fleet launched TIE fighters to intercept them.

When Harris was unable to get a lock, Rookie One acted quickly to eliminate the threat and save his commander. Once through the perimeter, Simms instructed Rookie One and Ru Murleen to commence strafing runs on the Death Star's turbolaser batteries. The battle plan called for navigating a trench along the surface in order to reach a thermal exhaust port\u2014a direct hit from a proton torpedo would trigger a chain reaction to destroy the station. However, before the assault on the trench could begin, a heavy cannon situated near the exhaust port needed to be eliminated.

The next day, he was informed that he would be accompanying his wing leader, Commander Kirby, on a patrol near Dreighton. Deciding not to take any chances, Rookie One prepared for the mission by practicing heavily in his base's B-wing simulator. As Rookie One and Kirby conducted their patrol, they intercepted a distress call from the YT-1300 light freighter Corellia Star, which was under attack from Imperial fighters. The pilot claimed to be carrying information which was vital to the Alliance, though signal interference prevented the Rebels from hearing the whole message. Nevertheless, the two Rebels attempted to mount a rescue, but were quickly intercepted by a swarm of TIE fighters. Despite being heavily outnumbered, their B-wings were able to eliminate the enemy fighters, but not before the Imperials boarded and captured the freighter. With the area now clear of threats, Rookie One and Kirby began searching for the freighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebels were suspicious of how quickly the TIEs had reached them from the freighter and suspected there might be more. Their suspicions were proved correct when, moments after Rookie One detected an emergency distress beacon from the Corellia Star, they suddenly came under attack from Imperial fighters. Kirby's B-wing was destroyed while Rookie One's lost a wing, sending him out of control towards the planet below. He was able to eject moments before impact and, still tracking the distress beacon, began crossing the desert in search of the freighter, eventually coming upon an Imperial base. With little other option, Rookie One decided to risk entering the base and attempt to escape in the freighter. After breaking into the base, he fought his way past stormtroopers to reach the hangar where the Corellia Star sat, almost depleting his ammunition against the numerous Imperial troops. Killing the guards, the Rebel boarded the ship and attempted to escape. However, the Imperials sealed the hangar, leaving Rookie One with no hope of escape other than to fly the ship into the mining tunnels of the planet.

Meanwhile, the Rebels were able to recover the Corellia Star's mission recorders and retrieve the full distress message. The message revealed that the Empire had a secret mining facility in the Belt of Arah where it was processing oridium ore to fuel a new weapon. Six days after the Dreighton mission, Rookie One learned that Admiral Gial Ackbar was planning to send a squadron to investigate the facility and decided to volunteer for the mission. In a briefing by the admiral, Rookie One was selected to join the strike team tasked with returning to the Dreighton Nebula and conducting a search of the Belt of Arah. Upon discovering the Imperial complex, they were to destroy its production capabilities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mission saw Rookie One flying as part of Rascal Squadron, along with Ace Merrick and Ina Rece.

Admiral Ackbar realized that a fleet of the TIE Phantoms could prove disastrous for the Alliance, allowing the Empire to attack with impunity. Alliance Intelligence had reported high levels of Imperial Navy activity near the planet Imdaar in recent weeks, and, with the Super Star Destroyer Terror en route to Imdaar, Ackbar suspected that this was the likely location for the mass deployment of the new starfighters.

The training involved flying the fragile fighter through a narrow canyon; however, Rookie One's experiences in Beggar's Canyon saw him complete the trial with little difficulty, and he was soon ready to begin the mission. Rookie One was given a Y-wing for the mission and would be escorted on the journey by Krane and Darnell Reggs.

In order to infiltrate the Terror, the two would first need to gain access to the Empire's planetary supply base, from which Murleen hoped to gain transportation to the Star Destroyer.

With the Imperials alerted to their presence, the Rebels raced toward their objective but were soon stopped by a sealed door, leaving Rookie One to fight off stormtroopers while Ru attempted to force a manual override. After fighting past more stormtroopers, the two reached a chasm and were unable to activate the bridge.
