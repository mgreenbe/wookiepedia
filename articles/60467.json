It was one of the most powerful type of blaster rifles, however the greater power came at a cost of a lower ammunition capacity of 30 shots. The heavy blaster rifle included a single-shot mode and an autofire mode for rapid automatic fire, as well as a close range stun setting. The most popular model included the DLT-19 heavy blaster rifle which was used during the time of the Galactic Empire. Other models included the StarAnvil heavy blaster rifle and the RT-97C heavy blaster rifle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Heavy blaster rifles were used by cold assault battle droids and clone trooper commanders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
