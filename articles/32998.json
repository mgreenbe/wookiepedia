That year, DS-73-3 participated in the Battle of Yavin, where the Alliance to Restore the Republic attempted to destroy the Galactic Empire's DS-1 Orbital Battle Station superweapon, and numerous TIE/LN starfighters attempted to defend the Imperial battlestation from the attacking Alliance starfighters.

Identified on the card as the TIE fighter, the 2008 The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia would instead identify DS-73-3 as the fighter's pilot. This article assumes the later source is correct."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Furthermore, the DS-73-3 Star Wars Trading Card Game image shows a TIE fighter which was destroyed by Han Solo from aboard the YT-1300 light freighter|freighter Millennium Falcon during that ship's escape from the DS-1 Orbital Battle Station in a scene from the 1977 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, that takes place prior to the film's later Battle of Yavin scenes. This contradicts The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, which lists DS-73-3 as a TIE pilot active during the Battle of Yavin.
