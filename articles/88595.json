The prison was administrated by Warden Luta. Megalox space station also generated a gravity field that shielded the prison from Megalox Beta's high gravity, which was ten times the standard gravity. In 34 ABY, the station was visited by Poe Dameron and his Black Squadron, who wanted to question Grakkus the Hutt about the explorer Lor San Tekka. While the pilots visited the prison, their droids BB-8, O-R10N, R2-HA, and R4 waited aboard the station in their T-70 X-wing starfighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When negotiations with Grakkus were complicated by the presence of the First Order Agent Terex, Poe dispatched the droids to disable the station's primary security field generator. After knocking out several guards, they managed to access the field generator in Deck Twelve. The prison security dispatched a security droid which disintegrated 0-R10N. Following a fight, BB-8 managed to disable the security droid. The other droids then shut down the shield generator, allowing Black Squadron to rescue Grakkus. Poe then negotiated a deal for his squadron and Grakkus to leave the prison in return for handing back control of the prison to Luta."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Black Squadron and Grakkus joined the droids in the hangar, they departed in their X-wings and a shuttle. BB-8 then restored control of the prison to Warden Luta. However, a vengeful Grakkus attacked the prison with his ship Carrion Spike, disabling the gravity field for good. When Luta scrambled shuttles to evacuate the prisoners, Terex attack their shuttles. Black Squadron then turned around and drove the Carrions Spike away, allowing the prison authorities to continue their evacuation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
