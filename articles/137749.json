During its time there, the company attempted to intervene when civilians began killing each other, making the situation worse as a result. Around 5 ABY, the 61st was deployed on the planet Troithe, where a portion of the company eventually took refuge at a three story speeder garage in the Highgarden District. When one New Republic soldier on watch suggested intervening in a distant riot, Sergeant Carver cited their time at Switchmount as to why he thought the former's idea would not work."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Switchmount was mentioned in the 2020 novel Shadow Fall, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
