Star Wars: Clone Wars aired on Cartoon Network from 2003 to 2005, produced by Genndy Tartakovsky. Star Wars: The Clone Wars was then announced at April 2005's Celebration III, which Lucas referred to as \"a 3-D continuation of the pilot series.\" Dave Filoni was hired as supervising director, and was familiar with previous Star Wars animation projects. Filoni's initial idea for the series revolved around a recurring cast of characters who traveled aboard a spaceship similar to the Millennium Falcon; the ship's crew would have included a smuggler, his girlfriend, a Gungan named Lunker, a Jedi padawan named Ashla, and her Jedi Master. This early concept for The Clone Wars was designed not to interfere with existing continuity, and as such would have included only occasional appearances from film characters, such as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. However, once Lucas became involved, he decided that the show would focus on the film characters, but would also include some of Filoni's ideas, such as Ashla (whose name was ultimately changed to Ahsoka)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By February 2006, Lucasfilm Animation was working on animation tests and initial scripts, with Lucas playing a large part in the entire process. The crew used Autodesk software to animate both the film and the series. The Maya 3D modeling program was used to create highly detailed worlds, characters, and creatures. Lucas and the animation team used this to create Zviz, a system that allowed the animation team complete freedom in framing shots. Script, character design, and art direction were completed at ILM, with the animation and rendering done at Lucasfilm Animation Singapore, and also Polygon Pictures between 2011 and 2013. No rotoscoping was involved, however, ILM did use motion capture. The final assembly of each episode was done at Skywalker Ranch. Lucas's involvement resulted in rewrites of most of the scripts, as Lucas insisted on more character development and that the show should not be based in one location, but as many as possible so as to make the story as interesting as possible to the viewer. The animation style was inspired by 1960s-era puppets-in-space serials such as Gerry Anderson's Thunderbirds, as well as the character designs from the original Clone Wars series. Each episode of The Clone Wars was designed to be stand-alone, with an opening narration and moral to each story. In terms of story and cinematography, the series was directed as if it were a live-action series, and the episodes were produced in widescreen. Writer Henry Gilroy gained inspiration for the episode titles from the pulpy adventure sci-fi serials of the 1930s. The series utilized unused ideas from Lucas' previous Star Wars projects. Paul Dini pitched at least two rejected ideas for episodes: One involved Jar Jar Binks trying to convince the Galactic Senate that there is life on an obscure planet, and the other involved Anakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala hiring an Ewok assassin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Filoni and Gilroy, while Lucas gave them creative freedom for most of the series, there were several characters and locations that were off-limits. In respect to the characters, Lucas asked not to use Han Solo, Chewbacca, Boba Fett, or Jabba the Hutt when Gilroy was writing the show bible, but by the time of the next meeting, Lucas had changed his mind about the latter two characters. In respect to the locations, Lucas asked Gilroy and Filoni to not explore the planets seen in the films, with the exception of Coruscant. But as with the character restrictions, he eventually changed his mind."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On March 11, 2013, a video appeared on StarWars.com, in which the crew explained that they were \"winding down\" the production of the series, and that they had finished the active production of new episodes.

Writer Brent Friedman revealed on his Twitter account that scripts for the unproduced seasons 7 and 8 had been written prior to the series' cancellation. James Arnold Taylor, Obi-Wan Kenobi's voice actor, has stated that prior to the series' cancellation, the actors had recorded at least two remaining unproduced seasons.
