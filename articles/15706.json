Zeroes and Nines urge Finn to focus on their objective, leaving Slip behind. Finn orders the two others, Nines and Zeroes, to split up, making them draw enemy fire and allowing Finn to save Slip, as well as giving him an opening to make it all the way to the Republic base and finish off the last Republic soldiers with a devastating grenade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Captain Phasma congratulates the squad on a job well done, before mentioning to Finn that he shouldn't help weaker cadets as it will only hurt the group.

According to Phasma, Republic agents were causing dissent and chaos in the mining operation. In reality, the mining negotiators had called a strike to protest the harsh working conditions. Phasma however orders her stormtroopers to execute the negotiators. Finn doesn't pull the trigger, and watches while his fellow stormtroopers kill the protesters.

As a child growing up in a colony on the jungle moon of Yavin 4, Poe had been raised on stories of his mother, Shara Bey, and father, Kes Dameron's, exploits during the Galactic Civil War. Years later, Poe is the Commander in Rapier Squadron, a four-member T-85 X-wing squadron in the Republic Navy.

After studying the cargo freighter's inventory, Dameron reasons that the First Order was interested in the ship's high-capacity charging arrays, which could be converted into military turbolasers. Poe managed to track the stolen freighter's coordinates to the remote OR-Kappa-2722 system where he also discovers a sizeable First Order fleet. Poe manages to locate the freighter in one of the Star Destroyers but is pursued by First Order TIE fighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following a brief dogfight, Poe manages to flee into hyperspace and return to the Mirrin system.

Poe is summoned for a meeting with General Leia Organa, the leader of the Resistance, a splinter faction of the New Republic Defense Force that monitors the activities of the First Order. General Leia convinces Poe to join the Resistance since the New Republic military is unwilling to take the threat of the First Order seriously. Poe and his remaining Rapier Squadron mates join the Resistance and are transferred to the refitted MC80 Star Cruiser Echo of Hope."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a member of the Resistance, Poe is handpicked by General Leia for a covert mission called Operation: Sabre Strike to steal Senator Erudo Ro-Kiintor's luxury yacht Hevurion Grace. General Leia suspects Senator Ro-Kiinto of secretly colluding with the First Order but lacks hard evidence. She wants to seize the ship's computer in order to get to the bottom of the matter. Since the Resistance cannot officially be involved, Poe and his comrades Iolo and Kare disguise themselves as members of the Irving Boys, a criminal group. To conceal their identities, they don bulky EVA suits and fly three vintage Z-95 Headhunters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Poe's plan involves intercepting the Hevurion Grace as the ship exits hyperspace in the Uvoss system.

Poe then boards the ship and forces Senator Ro-Kiintor and his crew to evacuate into the escape pods at gunpoint.

Following a risky maneuver, the three pilots managed to flee into hyperspace with the Hevurion Grace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back at the Echo of Hope, General Leia congratulates Poe and his squadron mates for their bravery and success in capturing the Hevurion Grace. The operation confirms Senator Ro-Kiintor's treason and dealings with the First Order.

While examining the ship's computers, C-3PO discovers a piece of a puzzle that is relevant to something involving Leia's ongoing quest to find her brother Luke Skywalker.
