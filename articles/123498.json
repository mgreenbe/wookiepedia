As she attempted to root out the conspiracy from ARC Trooper Fives, she clashed with Kaminoan Chief Medical Scientist Nala Se, who was attempting to dispel his claims regarding the chips' true purpose. Despite her efforts to the contrary, Ti was unable to help Fives as he suffered a breakdown, and upon his death, his secrets passed on to only a few.

Upon arriving to the planet, Kenobi learned that the deceased Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas had, years earlier, secretly ordered a clone army from the Kaminoans with the help of a man named Tyranus. On Kamino, Kenobi found a bounty hunter named Jango Fett, whom the clones were created from, and believed him to be Amidala's attempted assassin. Later, while following Fett to Geonosis, Kenobi discovered that the Separatists were creating their own army made up of droids, but was captured by Dooku's forces moments after contacting the Jedi Temple to report his findings.

Ti and Master Luminara Unduli ignited their lightsabers simultaneously, and quickly joined the battle. Dooku unleashed hordes of battle droids to counterattack the Jedi, who were quickly overwhelmed. The onslaught resulted in the deaths of nearly the entire assault team, with the surviving Jedi, including Ti, encircled by Dooku's forces. The Droid Army was ready to end the survivors when Grand Master Yoda arrived with the newly deployed Grand Army of the Republic. Several LAAT/i gunships formed a perimeter around the Jedi. Ti, Unduli, and Master Saesee Tiin boarded a gunship and were airlifted out of the arena and brought to the front lines of the battle, where the clone army was in combat with the Separatist forces. Once there, Ti was among many Jedi who led the assault on the Separatist core ships.

Ti and Kaminoan doctor Nala Se then began their testing on Tup. Se conducted a hyper test, a practice Ti was not fond of.

Sidious was the mastermind behind the creation of both the clone and droid armies, as well as Dooku's Sith mentor. After Sidious revealed to Skywalker his true identity, Windu gathered together Fisto, Tiin, and Agen Kolar to arrest the Supreme Chancellor for his crimes. Sidious killed Windu's team in quick succession, with Windu falling shortly thereafter courtesy of Skywalker's betrayal. With the promise of saving those he loved from dying, Sidious turned Skywalker to the dark side of the Force. He enacted Order 66, which used the clones' inhibitor chips to turn them against the Jedi. As the Jedi spread across the galaxy were being massacred, the temple was attacked by Skywalker, newly christened Darth Vader, aided by the 501st clone legion. Ti recorded a message on a holocron urging whoever found the message to continue the legacy of the Force, and not to let the Purge be the end of the Jedi.

Sometime between 0 ABY and 1 ABY, Vader's son Luke Skywalker was kidnapped by Grakkus after a series of skirmishes in the streets of Nar Shadaa, during which he brandished his father's former lightsaber and revealed his intention of sneaking into the old Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Skywalker awoke in the Hutt's palace, where the Hutt showed him a holocron. Knowing that Skywalker must have had some connection to the Force, Grakkus ordered that he open the holocron. While under pressure from the Hutt, he opened several holocrons in the room, among which was Ti's. Luke listened to her recorded plea before once again facing the Hutt. In 4 ABY, Luke, by then a Jedi Knight, helped redeem Vader and end Sidious' rule over the galaxy. In the years afterward, Luke began researching and rediscovering the history of the long-dead and forgotten Jedi Order.

Around her eyes were large white markings, a pigmentation unique to Ti. She had a jeweled headdress adorning her face that lay along the border between her face and her montrals, which along with her lekku were marked by gray stripes. Ti's colorful features were a hereditary pattern evolved by Togruta to confuse the predators of their homeworld, Shili. Ti was regarded as wise and patient, and a devoted believer in the ways of the Jedi. According to Luke Skywalker, Ti was likely given the assignment to oversee the training of clones because she excelled as both a teacher and a combatant. The lessons she passed onto the clones proved to be far more effective than she imagined. During her deployment to Kamino, she often struggled to balance the need to produce capable soldiers for the war effort and her compassion for the clones, which was made all the more difficult by her power struggle with the Kaminoan leadership. Despite her feelings for the clones, however, she could be tough on her students in order to bring the best out of them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a member of the Jedi High Council, Ti took part in many important meetings alongside the greatest Jedi in the Order. She held a seat on the Council from her inception following Master Yaddle's retirement to her death during the siege of the Jedi Temple. She often remained silent during meetings, showing emotion though calm expressions, though she sometimes interjected into conversations to voice her opinion on a matter. At the meeting wherein the Council debated Quinlan Vos' loyalty, Ti sided with Obi-Wan in his trust in Vos, saying that the Council could discern his loyalty by allowing him to take on smaller assignments. Ti's commitment to the Jedi made her willing to act against the orders of others, for instance arranging for the data on Tup's breakdown and subsequent investigation be sent to the Jedi Temple before the Republic Medical Facility, which went against the direct command of the Supreme Chancellor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ti was noted by Fives to be a helping and caring individual, valuing the lives of the clones not as objects but as people. This often led to conflict with the Kaminoans, who regarded them as property. She openly opposed the Kaminoan's preferred methods of handling clones, such as hyper tests and termination, as well their mistreatment of the soldiers. The Kaminoans in turn criticized Ti and the Jedi, citing their compassion and creative thinking as poor influences on the clones. Ti had a particularly difficult relationship with Doctor Nala Se, who had little regard for her moral and spiritual beliefs. Although the two had some respect for each other, their relationship quickly soured as they tried to track down the rogue Fives. Despite the need to keep the situation professional, Ti stood up for Fives against Se where she could, disputing her baseless claims and trying to ease Fives whenever Se would instigate him. Ti became increasingly suspicious of Se as they worked together during the crisis, and even though Fives' behavior and discoveries deeply troubled her, Ti decided to invoke her authority over Se to allow Fives a chance to present his findings to the Chancellor. When Fives thanked her for what she had done for him, Ti told him that she had made the decision not because she believed in either side, but because it was the right thing to do."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Jedi Temple came under siege by Vader and his clone forces, Ti accepted that the Order would not prevail that night and, instead of fighting, attempted to preserve what knowledge she could by recording a message on a holocron, urging its future finder to continue the Jedi way."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Force-sensitive, Ti was skilled in using telekinesis during battle.

As a Togruta, Ti's hollow montrals allowed her to sense the movement of objects around them. This echolocation, which could reach up to 82 feet, paired with her natural Force abilities allowed Ti to be very perceptive of her surroundings.
