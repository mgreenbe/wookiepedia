While still in the academy, Amersu was approached by Padawan Aayla Secura who presented her with a Heart of Fire, a stone that Secura's master had given her during her training. Eventually the Twi'lek graduated from the academy and was selected by the Anx Jedi Master J'Mikel to become his Padawan. During her early years of training with him, the pair were exploring the Coruscant underworld in the Temple Precinct with Master Peerce when the three were ambushed by the bounty hunter Aurra Sing. Amersu could do nothing but watch as both Peerce and her master were slain by the bounty hunter, who only spared the young girl so that she could grow stronger in the Force to make a worthy opponent one day."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Heart of Fire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning to the Temple to report the attack by Sing, the Council of Reassignment paired her with another master to continue her training. Not long after J'Mikel was killed, Amersu sought out the amnesic Jedi Quinlan Vos in one of the meditation gardens high in the Temple Ziggurat. Telling how he had kept informed on Vos's Padawan, her old friend Aayla Secura, Amersu gave Vos her Heart of Fire in hopes it would jog his memories. After years of training with her new master, Amersu passed her Trials of Knighthood and was elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight. When the Clone Wars broke out across the galaxy, Amersu dutifully took up the rank of General in the Grand Army of the Republic. As she prepared to lead her first battle, her old friend Jedi Secura approached her and returned Master J'Mikel's lightsaber to Amersu; Sing had taken the weapon as a trophy when she killed the Anx, and Secura had retrieved it when she arrested Sing on Devaron."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Siege of Saleucami"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the years of war Amersu developed a close relationship with fellow Jedi A'Sharad Hett. Accepting many missions together, she sobbed on his shoulder during a brief pause in the fighting on Saleucami when she learned of Councilor Oppo Rancisis' death. With the Thisspiasian's passing, Master Vos was placed in charge of coordinating the assault on the Morgukai clone army base. Leading Blue Squadron during the air battle, Jedi Amersu's interceptor sustained critical damage during the battle. Despite the urging of Jedi Hett to withdraw from the fight, Amersu directed her doomed fighter into the heart of the CIS's ion cannon and deflector shield generator, knocking out their defenses. Her death proved vital to the Republic's victory at Saleucami, though it was short lived as the Order and the Republic were overthrown by the Galactic Empire in the ensuing weeks."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While attachment was strictly forbidden by the Jedi Code, Amersu and fellow Jedi A'Sharad Hett developed strong emotional ties to one another during the Clone Wars. When Amersu gave her life during the Siege of Saleucami, Hett appeared to come to terms with his loss; however, he soon fell to the dark side of the Force following the start of the Great Jedi Purge. Reappearing after more then a hundred years in hiding, Hett reemerged as Darth Krayt and the leader of a new empire of Sith.
