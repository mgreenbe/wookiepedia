Pike kept R2-S4 even after these tests were complete, however, bringing the droid into the field with him. Because R2-S4 was adept at breaking into then controlling spaceships onboard computers, particularly those of Imperial-model small or medium starships and transports, Pike would often bring him along in his attempts to steal starships. R2-S4, like most R2 units, was very independent and would tend to wander off whenever he was bored."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
