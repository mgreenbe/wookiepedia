These droids were equipped with a long-range communications antenna, which protruded from the top of their spherical bodies. While infiltrating Starkiller Base during the Battle of Starkiller Base, the Resistance fighters Han Solo, Chewbacca and Finn avoided a patrol droid moving through the exterior regions of the base. The droid's sensors failed to pick them up due to the heavy snow and forest cover the three were hidden behind and a thermal distorter that Chewbacca was carrying which masked their heat signatures."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The First Order's patrol droids first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in 2015.
