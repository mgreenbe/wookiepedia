The white-colored energy bolts fired from the disintegrator passed through most personal energy shields and caused much more damage than contemporary disruptor pistol designs. The weapon was similar in appearance to the Mandalorian ripper, another disruptor weapon around at the same time as the disintegrator; it was silver in color, with a brown-colored hand grip and a wide barrel. Human-sized species needed one hand to operate the weapon, which was capable of receiving upgrades to its firing chamber, power cell, and targeting scope."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Designed by the warlike Mandalorian culture, the Mandalorian disintegrator was the deadliest disruptor pistol in existence during the Dark Wars, a string of conflicts that were fought between leftovers of the Sith Empire and the forces of the Galactic Republic after the Jedi Civil War.
