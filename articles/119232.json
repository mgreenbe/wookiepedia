He came from a military family and was an avowed hawk. After Captain Wedge Antilles disappeared during a mission to the planet Akiva, Saff along with Admiral Gial Ackbar and Commander Kyrsta Agate attended a hologram conference with General Crix Madine and Chancellor Mon Mothma. During the meeting, Saff recommended sending in a fleet to Akiva. He recommended outfitting the fleet with two light cruisers and a contingent of starfighters from Gold Squadron to investigate the Imperial presence there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In response, Chancellor Mothma cautioned that the New Republic had to be careful not to cultivate an aggressive image in the Outer Rim Territories. Captain Melor disagreed with the Chancellor and told her that Akiva was a marginal world and that the Satrapy of Myrra was in the Empire's pocket. When Melor dismissed Akiva as strategically unimportant to the New Republic, Mothma countered that the people were their concern and that they had received news of a rebellion there. Melor was about to voice his disagreement when Admiral Ackbar supported the Chancellor, closing the matter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Melor was the only member of the meeting to disagree with Admiral Ackbar's proposal to send a small strike team of New Republic Special Forces soldiers to investigate the situation on Akiva.

He was a haughty man with a frustrated and dubious brow that extended upward to express excessive incredulity. Melor came from a military family and was known for his intellectual arrogance. As a hawk, Saff advocated sending military ships to Akiva to demonstrate the New Republic's might. He regarded Akiva as a strategically unimportant planet. While Melor disagreed with Ackbar's proposal that they send a small strike team of soldiers to investigate the situation on the ground, he concurred with the group's agenda to maintain a show of unity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Saff Melor first appeared as a supporting character in Chuck Wendig's 2015 novel Aftermath."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
