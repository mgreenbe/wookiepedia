Dra III's perilous and chaotic weather produced similarly dangerous wildlife, and the world was renowned for its dangerous and uncontrollable beasts. The most well-known of Dra III's fauna was the nashtah, also known as the Dravian hound, as it was the only of the world's native animals to ever be domesticated. Tireless six-legged predators, nashtahs were sometimes seen in the wider galaxy as guard beasts for gangsters.
