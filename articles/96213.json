When she reached the Number Two storage bay and opened the hatch, Deyland and the other officers drifting to the sides of the passageway, foreshadowing Rossi's negative reaction to First weapons officer Thrawn storing Clone Wars antiques. When Rossi asked Thrawn for an explanation, Deyland stepped in, but was quickly shut down by Rossi. When Rossi ordered Thrawn to dispose of his artifacts, Thrawn proposed an alternative, with Deyland keen on listening. Rossi agreed to listen to Thrawn's proposal, which was that in his collection were two Mark One Pistoeka sabotage droids, which were rare and thus valuable to collectors, and that since they were property of the vessel and since Rossi was the captain of the vessel, the droids were technically hers. Thrawn indicated that they were valuable to officers in Imperial High Command, which Rossi could use for her advantage. In the end, Rossi agreed to Thrawn's proposal, and Deyland was content with the end result."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
