They stole the access codes to the Nyemari Imperial Military Installation from the Duchess' palace. After tripping the silent alarm, the Rebels fled the palace and their pursuers, members of the Royal guard on 74-Z speeder bikes. The Rebels avoided the guards and returned to the South Anem Spaceport where they hid their ship, the Millennium Falcon with the Nyemarian Li Preni. Preni told them they had been pursued, so the Rebels cornered the Glymphid who followed them. The Glymphid played a hologram from Rezi Soresh directing the Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker to come to Soresh; the Glymphid then died from a time-delayed poison, and the Rebels left Nyemari."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Nyemarians in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nyemari had an Imperial Military base and a sophisticated spaceport.
