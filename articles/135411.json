Typically worn on belts or any kind of armor, they were capable of generating a field around the wear that blurred and faded shapes and colors, while also interfering sensors and scanners. Far from perfect, the generators functioned only for a few short minutes before requiring new power cells. Furthermore, users still needed to know how to move stealthily and how to use cover and shadows to their advantage. The wearer was also unable to move quicker than walking, or the field would break down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
