Compromises between the Republic and these corporate interests fuelled the division in the Galactic Republic and its Galactic Senate, pushing the Senate away from the interests of the citizens, and leaned more towards the interests of the companies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the Age of the Empire, the Corporate Sector was made up of a series of loosely-aligned autonomous star systems, independent from the Galactic Republic, which were home to numerous corporations as well as tax evaders, arms merchants, and pirates. The majority of these systems remained neutral during the Clone Wars of 22 BBY to 19 BBY, thus also gaining a reputation for harboring war profiteers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even five years after the end of the war, technologies that had previously belonged to the former Confederacy of Independent Systems as well as the Trade Federation were still appearing in the sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 18 BBY, these star systems were considered to be slowly coalescing into a unified entity. Fearful of this opposition, forces of the newly-formed Galactic Empire under Moff Wilhuff Tarkin invaded and occupied the Salient system on the edge of the sector, intending to send a message to defiant systems and gain a staging area for further military incursions into Corporate space. The prolonged campaign drew in smugglers and mercenaries from across the sector as well as from other sectors as far away as Tingel Arm, including Saw Gerrera's Partisans, but the Empire eventually proved victorious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite this, the Corporate Sector would remain in existence, and its systems would eventually coalesce to create the Corporate Sector Authority (CSA). The Empire viewed it as a haven for former Separatists, with Moff Tarkin suspecting the warship that attacked Sentinel Base originated in the Corporate Sector; when the Moff later traveled to Coruscant, some speculated he was going to be sent on a mission to the sector to hunt down Separatist recidivists. Berch Teller, the leader of the rebel cell that was responsible for the ensuing series of attacks, suggested his fellow rebels flee to the Corporate Sector to avoid Imperial capture."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "New Republic Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the New Republic Era, the Corporate Sector was still controlled by the Corporate Sector Authority. This bought the attention of the First Order, who used it as a way to bribe New Republic Senator Erudo Ro-Kiintor, who received credits through shells and third-party corporations with the connivance of the CSA. It served as a haven for war profiteers who sold munitions to both sides in the Cold War."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rise of the First Order"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the First Order/Resistance War, the Corporate Sector world of Cantonica was a destination for wealthy tourists and war profiteers, who visited the casinos and racing tracks of Canto Bight. Following the Evacuation of D'Qar, the Resistance operatives Finn, Rose Tico, and BB-8 traveled there on a mission to recruit the Master Codebreaker to disable the First Order's hyperspace tracker.
