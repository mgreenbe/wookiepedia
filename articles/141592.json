The temple, rising high above the city wall, was held sacred by those who followed the teachings of the Church of the Force. The Temple was destroyed when the Galactic Empire tested the first Death Star's superlaser on the Holy City. Previously, the temple had been looted of the kyber crystals it contained, and the Guardians of the Whills, the temple's guardians, sent out into the street."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Temple of the Kyber was located in the Holy City on Jedha. There were tunnels that led to the temple underneath, which had kyber crystals growing on the roof and in the ground. Lining the tunnels were 2,304 statues made entirely out of kyber. One statue in particular depicted a Jedi battling a serpent-like creature. The tunnels were guarded by the temple's guardians, who protected the temple as their solemn vow."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early Imperial Era, Dok-Ondar along with Hondo Ohnaka and Quadoro successfully managed to steal one of the statues lining the tunnels underneath the temple. Dok-Ondar stated that the statue he took must've been at least 2000 years old, being able to tell from the growth of kyber at the base. He also stated that the statue must've been carved by a Jedi with their lightsaber. The group faced many guardians of the temple when entering to retrieve the relic, however they all were defeated by Hondo and his blaster. Only when leaving did the group face Chirrut \u00cemwe, who was able to both dodge Hondo's blaster bolts and disarm him. Dok-Ondar was able to reason with \u00cemwe, stating that the statue was only one of 2,304 statues that lined the tunnels underneath the temple. Dok-Ondar also stated that the statue was of specific importance to him, as he inherited one of the same statues from his parents when they died. After hearing Dok-Ondar's reasoning, \u00cemwe allowed him and Hondo to leave with the statue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Whills first appeared in the original drafts of A New Hope as an equivalent name for the Force.
