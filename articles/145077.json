The facility's usage changed numerous times, as did its name, which gave homage to at least two different Grand Lords\u2014the heads of the planet's ruling government, the Lost Tribe of Sith\u2014over the course of just over one thousand years. At one point, the facility housed the last surviving members of various predator species from Kesh, but the Sith had since killed the creatures for sport. By 3960 BBY, the facility was used to house uvak, and spectators were granted access to the facility to watch as the uvak were prepared for their gladiatorial competitions, called rake-riding, in the Korsinata stadium.

Candra's daughter, having recently discovered the location of the only space-capable vessel on the planet, later came to the zoo, hoping that her mother could help her gain political leverage. After disabling a guard, Kitai offered to free her mother, but Candra refused, under the pretense that she would only slow Kitai down. However, Candra betrayed Kitai, using the information her daughter had given her regarding the starship in exchange for, according to Grand Lord Venn, \"improved working conditions.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"The zoo,\" the formal name of which has yet to be canonically provided, first appeared in Lost Tribe of the Sith: Sentinel, the sixth book in the Lost Tribe of the Sith eBook series.
