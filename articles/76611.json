Trained since childhood to move and fight in the three-dimensional realm below the surfaces of Glee Anselm's vast oceans, starfighter combat comes as second nature to him. Jedi training has only perfected his skills, while the precise and responsive controls of his ship enhance them even further. His tactics are as graceful as they are deadly, inspiring awe and respect in friend and foe alike. Though he was as skilled a pilot as any in the Jedi Order, Kit Fisto preferred engaging in planetside combat, and took command of Republic forces in many unorthodox campaigns. As a result of his preference and skill, Kit Fisto did fewer performance enhancing modifications to his Delta-7 than many other Jedi. Instead, he strengthened its airframe, struts and landing gear to help it withstand high-speed reentry and rough landings, reasoning that the faster he could get on the ground, the sooner he'd be able to get into the fight. He used a droid called R4-H5 in this starfighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
