Although that particular Ewok cannot be seen holding a wokling in the final cut of the film, she can still be spotted in the background, wearing a white belt at the entrance of a hut and scratching her right ear."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
