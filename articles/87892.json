He used it to fight the Inquisitors, and later the Jedi rebels who came to Malachor seeking Sith knowledge. Maul later used it on his hunt for Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, slaughtering several Tusken Raiders with it before confronting his old nemesis. It was in this final duel that Maul was defeated, the lightsaber was bisected in a similar manner to his first when Kenobi sliced it in two. However, unlike last time, both halves of the lightsaber remained functional, only deactivating when Maul lost grip of them as he succumbed to his wounds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lightsaber produced two crimson-red blades, and the upper grip-guard resembled that of the Inquisitors' lightsabers, albeit broken and bent outward. He would hide the hilt by attaching a piece of wood to it, and pretending it was a walking stick, all the while masquerading as a feeble old man."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 10 BBY, Maul already possessed the lightsaber. When Qi'ra contacted Maul after the death of Dryden Vos, Maul activated it while threatening her, adding that they would be working more closely in the future."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In an interview with The Star Wars Show, Sam Witwer explained that the production of Solo: A Star Wars Story had originally planned to reintroduce Maul's original lightsaber during his scene with Qi'ra.
