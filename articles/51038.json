It participated during the battle of D'Qar, where it fired its orbital autocannons on the Resistance base and eradicated it, though an evacuation of the base had already been completed. Resistance Commander Poe Dameron launched a single-handed attack on the Fulminatrix, destroying its point-defense cannons in order to clear the way for Resistance bombers to make an attack run. The Fulminatrix scrambled its TIE fighters in an almost successful attempt to fend off the attack, leading to the destruction of all but one of the bombers. It was subsequently destroyed by the last bomber when it dropped its bomb payload, going down with all hands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after its destruction, Team Colossus boarded the remains of the Fulminatrix to find coaxium fuel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Construction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Fulminatrix was commissioned and constructed by the First Order some time prior to 34 ABY. Her class, aptly named the Siege Dreadnought, was more than twice the length of the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer, a standard ship of the line which otherwise dominated the First Order Navy. The red lighting which came from the Fulminatrix was to help the night vision of the gunnery crews as they switched back and forth between targeting scopes and visual scans of the surrounding space. This monster of a warship, like all members of her class, was armed with two orbital bombardment cannons designed to penetrate planetary shields. With an arsenal of weapons that demanded competent leadership, the dreadnought was assigned to Captain Moden Canady, a veteran of the old Empire. Over time, these dreadnoughts amassed a particularly fearsome reputation, nicknamed \"fleet killers\" by some Resistance pilots."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Deployment at D'Qar"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Resistance's successful destruction of the Starkiller superweapon, General Armitage Hux hastily ordered his fleet to the newly discovered Resistance base on D'Qar. The Resistance received the schematics of a First Order dreadnought from Inferno Squad, which Leia passed to Poe Dameron for examination. There he found a caravan of Resistance ships, busy evacuating the planet as Hux's armada descended on their position. However, General Hux had reserved the task of obliterating the Resistance base for the Fulminatrix, which arrived shortly thereafter, Captain Canady at the helm. Canady immediately deployed the Fulminatrix's orbital autocannons against the planetary base, eradicating the structures and leftover equipment, though personnel had fully evacuated. Much to his chagrin, however, Hux had mistakenly allowed a T-70 X-wing starfighter\u2014the Black One, piloted by Resistance hero Poe Dameron\u2014behind the First Order's line of fire, allowing the small craft to accelerate towards the Fulminatrix and eliminate its surface turbolasers. The unexpected strategy was effective, and Canady scrambled his ship's complement of TIE Fighters and Special Force TIE fighters to counter the assault."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the dreadnought's surface turbolasers offline, Dameron engaged the second step of his plan. Cobalt Squadron\u2014a unit of Resistance bombers\u2014advanced towards the dreadnought, flanked by a number of smaller fighters. Notified of the bombers' approach, Canady ordered his autocannons to be recharged and directed towards the Resistance flagship Raddus, where most of the rebel leadership had converged. A majority of the Resistance bombers were wiped out in the ensuing dogfight, especially after one spiraling TIE cockpit collided with a bomber that had armed its payload, causing a chain reaction that crippled two further craft. However, one final Cobalt bomber, the Cobalt Hammer, under the watch of Paige Tico, managed to drop its payload. The bombs struck a weak point, causing a cataclysmic series of explosions which brought an end to the final bomber, the dreadnought, Captain Canady and his loyal crew."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Post destruction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Free from danger, the Resistance fleet leaped into hyperspace, unaware they were being tracked by advanced First Order technology. As they escaped, Snoke, Supreme Leader of the First Order, contacted Hux and expressed his dissatisfaction with the latter's performance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the battle over D'Qar, the Colossus, a supertanker fuel depot and home to a Resistance cell, arrived in the system, as Resistance member Kazuda Xiono believed the Resistance base was still standing. While the refueling station was in desperate need of supplies that the base could have provided, Xiono realized the remains of the Fulminatrix may have coaxium fuel onboard, which the crew needed for the Colossus's hyperdrive. To board the dreadnought, the Resistance members turned to the Warbird gang, a group of pirates who had allied with the Resistance during the attack on Castilon, although the Warbird leader Kragan Gorr only agreed to help after learning of possible weapons and technology aboard. Using the Galleon, the Warbirds, Xiono, Neeku Vozo, and CB-23 boarded the Fulminatrix, and Vozo helped salvage supplies like the pirates, as the mechanic was interested in their lifestyle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Skreek pointed them to the coaxium, Xiono, Gorr, CB-23, and Synara San\u2014who were soon joined by Vozo\u2014arrived in the hyperdrive room, and, although the drive itself had been badly damaged, a reserve canister of coaxium remained."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
