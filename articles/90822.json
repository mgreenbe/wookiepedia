Their appearance varied from yellow-green skin to paler skin very similar to many Humans. Mirialans were very flexible and agile, making them fast and formidable foes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A near-Human species, Mirialans were nearly physiologically identical to Humans. The greatest difference in their biology was their green skin and their flexibility. The latter trait gave them the upper hand over Humans in terms of agility and the martial arts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mirialan people were deeply religious and practiced a primitive understanding of the Force. They believed each individual's actions contributed to their destiny, building upon past successes and failures to drive them towards their fates. A Mirialan would place a unique, often geometrically repeated tattoo on their face and hands to signify that they had completed a certain test or task, or achieved sufficient aptitude for a certain skill. The number of tattoos would thus often act as a good indicator of how mature and/or skilled a Mirialan was."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because the more markings brought about a form of status, Mirialan society was stratified and allowed the heavily marked citizens to access greater opportunities. Despite its importance, most Mirialans did not know the entirety of the tattoo lexicon due to its complexity. The interaction between placement and positioning of the shapes was incredibly subtle and changed the meaning greatly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within their belief system was the view that individual actions ripple through the Force, also affecting the destiny of the species as a whole. Because the Force was understood through the notion of the Cosmic Force on a basic level, the cultural significance of the energy was defined as fate. Those who were not sensitive to its call still had faith in fate, and felt that it guided their lives. Mirialans always had a presence within the ranks of the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Doctor Eckard Lokin, a member of the Sith Empire's Imperial Science Bureau during the Great Galactic War, recalled a shared interest in Mirialan cuisine with his colleague Cipher Twelve during a conversation with the Imperial agent known as Cipher Nine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Sith Empire's return and invasion of the Galactic Republic, sparking the Great Galactic War, the Mirialans promoted their planet as a safe haven for refugees from the Outer Rim. This surge of victims of war led a large number of Mirialans to enlist in the Republic Military, and others to utilise their abilities in the Force with the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point before the Invasion of Naboo, Mirial fought in a war against a nearby planet. The notorious pirate Arwen Cohl helped lead the Mirialans to victory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Mirialans in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hylo Visz was a Mirialan smuggler during the days of the Old Republic who led a coalition of smugglers to break a Mandalorian blockade and deliver raw goods to Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arwen Cohl was active as a Mirialan freedom fighter decades before the Clone Wars. Luminara Unduli and her Padawan learner Barriss Offee were Mirialan Jedi who fought in the Clone Wars.
