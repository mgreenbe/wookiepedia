The ship had received numerous modifications from the Guild mechanic, Nazrita Villache. The ship was adorned with extra hull armor, the double laser cannon was given a power boost and the shields overhauled. On top of this, the ship was outfitted with a concealed proton torpedo tube, capable of holding up to five torpedoes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship was given to Platt Okeefe on hire/purchase, along with its WED Treadwell repair droid, Bee-Zerobee. Okeefe named the ship after her homeworld of Brentaal IV. The smuggler progressively got behind on her loan repayments, and the Guild leader, Pok Nar-Ten, hired the bounty hunter Zo'Tannath to capture Okeefe. Okeefe was flying the Brentaal Princess to Wroona at the time. It is unknown what happened to the ship after Okeefe was captured. The smuggler was later sold into slavery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
