Jessica's expert flying prevents them from being blasted into pieces, and they receive assistance from a very unlikely source \u2013 IG-88.

In order to secure Mon Julpa's position as ruler, he must return the royal scepter to the Keeper of the Tower at the top of the royal palace by the first sun of the equinox.

Back at the townhouse, IG-88 grabs the royal scepter and uses it to capture Mon Julpa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All of the prisoners (including Jessica) are taken back to the royal palace where they are thrown into a pit containing a large monster known as a Durkii. R2-D2 calms the creature down by removing several bothersome insects known as Kleex from its scales. With the pests removed from its hide, the Durkii ceases to be a threat. Once they escape, they race to the uppermost towers of the palace to stop Zatec-Cha before the first sun. They succeed in intercepting him and Mon Julpa places the royal scepter in its housing, thereby solidifying himself as the proper ruler of Tammuz-an. To show his gratitude he makes Jann an advisor to his court."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"The New King\" was released as part of the feature film The Pirates and the Prince on VHS format in 1999 and on the Star Wars: Droids DVD in 2004."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This episode marks the first appearance of the craft retconned to be the R-22 Spearhead, although it is identified in the episode as an A-wing.
