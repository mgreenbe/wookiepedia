During the Clone Wars the Jedi Master Luminara Unduli came to the Arena of Doom, asking for the location of the Confederacy of Independent Systems's new droid factory, which Mondo-Mod had obtained.

After the first two fights, Unduli was victorious but badly hurt. The third fight was composed of Unduli facing a gladiator droid called Evil Supreme; everyone believed that the battle droid would easily win, including Sniddly. Sniddly announced the fight and began taking more bets, and was surprised to find a unknown spacer, who had lost over 200,000 credits earlier that day, was betting ten million credits on the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sniddly took the bet, thinking that the arena would win big on the wager, but he was dumbfounded when Unduli beat Evil Supreme in under a minute, by kicking a pebble into the massive droid's faceplate.
