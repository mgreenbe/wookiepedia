After the Battle of Yavin, Lucien Bender placed a bounty on his three sons. However, he ignored that a much larger bounty was placed on him and his gang. Around 1 ABY, the Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk captured Louis Bender and intended to force his brothers Hraykken and Draykken to handle Lucien for him so he could collect the most substantial bounty. However, a spacer affiliated with the Meatlump gang arrived at Bossk's little camp near the Bofa Treat Gang's bunker. Bossk forced the Meatlump to take down the Bofa Treat Gang and their leader for him in exchange of Louis Bender. The spacer entered the building and fought his way through the bunker until he finally met Lucien in the depths of the hideout. The adventurer confronted Lucien Bender and finally killed him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bofa Treat Gang bunker was a location in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011.
