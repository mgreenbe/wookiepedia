Probably because of the sedate confines of Senate and diplomatic escort duty Jek became obsessed with weapons as an outlet. He was an expert in all manner of small arms blaster weaponry, and had even gone so far as requisitioning and obtaining heavy weapons even though they weren't part of his mission requirements."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, Jek finally got the chance to test some of his favorite weapons in action when he and his fellow trooper Rys under the command of Lieutenant Thire were assigned to escort Jedi Master Yoda to a diplomatic mission to Rugosa. When their transport came under attack by Separatist frigates, Yoda and the troopers landed on the moon's surface in the escape pod. The clones helped Yoda to get past a whole battalion of T81 Division's B1-Series battle droids along with Armored Assault Tanks, sent by Asajj Ventress to intercept them as a challenge to the competency of the Jedi and the Republic's forces, in order to secure a treaty with Toydarian King Katuunko. During the mission, Yoda advised Jek that his most powerful weapon was not the hardware that he lugged around, but his mind. The lesson stuck with Jek, who along with his fellow clones was able to improvise a critical rescue when Yoda was outnumbered by approaching droidekas by shooting a rocky overhang, making it collapse on the droidekas, which allowed them to successfully complete their mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A loyal yet laconic clone trooper, Jek preferred to let his Z-6 rotary blaster do the talking.
