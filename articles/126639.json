Unbeknownst to the Avengers, a Yuuzhan Vong worldship had landed on the planet and set up a sizable base. When they ventured closer to the planet, they encountered small, asteroid-like objects grouping near them. Without warning, the asteroids opened fire on the Avengers, who realized that the objects were not asteroids at all, but a kind of starfighter analog. The Avengers fought off the enemy starfighters (later dubbed coralskippers), and were faring well until the Yuuzhan Vong began using dovin basals to strip the Avengers' fighters of their shields. Without their shields, the Avengers were quickly decimated. Remaining fighters tried to escape but they were attacked by Grutchins. Miko Reglia crashed onto Helska and died not long after, and Durron and an unknown A-wing pilot made blind jumps into hyperspace. Kyp Durron was the only survivor of the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
