One hunt led Hundar to a failing Zabrak colony world, where the hunter was impressed by one of the locals, a tenacious Zabrak named Vril Vrakth. Taking him on as an apprentice bounty hunter, Hundar trained the Zabrak in the craft, soon using him as backup on dangerous hunts. On one such hunt, Hundar was too slow to capture their target, a vicious Rodian, and Vrakth was forced to complete the hunt. This victory launched the Zabrak into a successful career."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The text of The First to Strike implies that Hundar died during the hunt for the Rodian, but this is not explicitly stated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
