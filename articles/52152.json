He placed his hand on the statue and vowed to never forget his mother and father. Hondo Ohnaka then called over to Dok-Ondar with some information about the Kendoh Gang led by Kendoh Voss. Hondo labeled them as dangerous but is quickly interrupted by Dok-Ondar who ushers him inside but not before a camera picked up their conversation and playing it to Kendoh and her fellow crew members. Hondo is angry with Ondar that he didn't tell him the Kendoh knew about the Sword of Khashyun.

Dok-Ondar brought along three Shistavanens for the mission to provide extra muscle. Aphra and Ondar discussed the cursed sword, the history behind it and how to get it before they reached the surface of Moraband. As they began to walk through the Sith temple the doctor noted that the Sith temple was filled with booby traps. One of the Shistavanens stepped on a booby trap and a mummified Sith warrior came out of the shadows and killed the Shistavanen with it's mace. Aphra threw a thermal detonator at the Sith warrior caused it to explode. Back on Dok-Ondar's ship he and other Shistavanen are trying to get a transmission to Doctor Aphra when 0-0-0 appears.

The Sword of Khashyun was planted into the ground blade first in front of a mummified Dowutin Sith. Doctor Aphra claimed it was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen.

As Aphra laid there on the ground complaining about a sprained ankle the warbeast leaped at her but was killed by the lasers as it set off a booby trap.
