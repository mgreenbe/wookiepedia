At least one such cruiser was captured and modified into a pirate ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Consular III-class space cruiser was a vessel conceived by the Corellian Engineering Corporation. It was used by the Galactic Republic to provide safe transport for its diplomats. Following old Republican conventions, its hull was coated in crimson to denote the vessel's status of neutrality. The cruiser was shaped like one of the archaic sailing ships that were used for aquatic transport prior to space travel. Even though the design of the Consular III differed drastically from usual construction, it was no unicum. Vessels with similar designs were built throughout galactic history, such as the Fairwind, a large gunship once owned by Jedi Lord and Master Valenthyne Farfalla, or the Merriweather, a bulk cruiser of Tof make."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Consular III belonged to the same line as the earlier Consular-class cruiser, which was put into service by 990 BBY and was still used around the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY.
