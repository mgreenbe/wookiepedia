Their mission was to deliver cargo items to Solo's friend Verhandle. Verhandle wanted to pay Solo only seven-five percent of their agreed upon fee for the cargo items, which did not suit well for Solo. When Verhandle lowered it to sixty percent, Solo agreed and gave his friend the cargo. Unbeknownst to Solo and Chewbacca, a group of soldiers working for Verhandle entered Solo's freighter, the Millennium Falcon, to commandeer it. When Solo and Chewbacca departed the planet, the soldiers revealed themselves, only to be defeated by Chewbacca."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
