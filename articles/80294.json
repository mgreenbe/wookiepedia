It was used for ensnaring moving creatures or even sentient beings. The Quorks of Endor used lassos when they needed to capture living beings during their raids. Similarly, the Nightsisters of Dathomir used wrist-mounted lassos when they wished to take \"malelings\" as their new slaves. There existed more technologically advanced versions of those, such as the laser lasso, which emitted a \"laser\" that could wrap around its intended targets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
