With this dark, opaque liquid, Morag intended to poison the Ewoks' berry bushes with it so they would starve to death. The witch enlisted the services of her pet mantigrue to spread the poison throughout the forest, covering the bushes with a thick, wooly fog. However, the Ewok shaman Logray created another potion that had the double effect of disinfecting the berries and making them toxic to Morag only."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
