The unit, equipped with Z-95 Headhunters, was based on the Nebulon-B2 frigate Colada. It fought against the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Rage during the latter's attack on the Airam-owned supply platform in the Goff system. There, realizing that the most serious danger to the craft evacuating the platform came from the interdictor cruiser Compellor, the Z-95s made that vessel their primary target, attacking it with concussion missiles. The squadron was no match for the attacking Imperial forces, however, and was torn to shreds by the modified TIE/IN interceptors of Avenger Squadron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
