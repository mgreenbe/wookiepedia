The Jedi hoped to stop the dark side being Abeloth from continuing to cause a mysterious psychosis among several of the Jedi Order's Jedi Knights, while the Sith, who pretended to have the goal of protecting their apprentices from the psychosis, secretly planned to force Abeloth to join them and then kill the Jedi. Shortly after the alliance was formed, Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker suggested that the allied forces wait for the help of his friend, Lando Calrissian, who owned an asteroid tug which they could use for navigation in the Maw. The Sith agreed, and the fleet decided to wait at Klatooine, where the Sith's leader, High Lord Sarasu Taalon, discovered the sacred Fountain of Ancients and became obsessed with it. During the stopover, the Force-sensitive Dyon Stadd, who had accompanied the Jedi, succumbed to the psychosis. Luke's son, Ben, along with the Sith Vestara Khai, managed to help capture Stadd, who was sedated and placed aboard the Skywalkers' ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The allies left Klatooine to await Calrissian just outside the Maw, and Taalon left two frigates behind to wait for Calrissian in case something went wrong, although their actual intent was to take wintrium samples from the Fountain. Their raid went poorly, however, and one frigate was captured. Its crew was put on trial by the recently arrived Calrissian and Jedi Knight Jaina Solo and condemned to death. Calrissian, Solo, and the other frigate then met up with the rest of the fleet and entered the Maw. After they discovered that the space station Sinkhole Station had been destroyed, the allies traveled to Abeloth's planet, where Taalon, Luke, Sith Saber Gavar Khai, and Captain Leeha Faal walked beyond shadows. They failed to locate Abeloth, but Vestara placed a homing beacon on Stadd\u2014who, being under Abeloth's influence, knew where to find her\u2014and set him free, allowing the allies to track him to Abeloth.

Ben intervened and dueled Gavar, which allowed Luke to fight Abeloth while the other Sith tried to capture her. Abeloth suddenly scattered them with a Force blast and fled; the Jedi and Sith recovered quickly and ran after her. Luke found her first and, despite another attempt of hers to trick him, stabbed her in the chest, which apparently resulted in her death.

The Jedi and Sith then agreed to repair their alliance, ordering Calrissian, Solo, and the entire Sith armada to leave while Taalon, the Skywalkers, and the Khais remained to investigate further into Abeloth.

As a result, tensions arose between the Jedi Order and the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, as the Alliance decided to encase the afflicted Jedi in carbonite, while the Jedi Order desired to have the affected Knights available for study in the Jedi Temple. Meanwhile, Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker was tried and exiled from Coruscant and the Jedi Order for dereliction of duty for failing to prevent his nephew Jacen Solo's fall to the dark side during the recent Second Galactic Civil War; he then embarked on a quest with his son, Ben, to find the cause of Solo's fall. Their journey eventually led them to the Mind Walkers\u2014beings who used a Force technique called Mind Walking to separate their minds from their bodies in order to enter the realm that they called beyond shadows\u2014at the Sinkhole space station in the Maw."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the Lost Tribe of Sith, descendants of a group of Sith who had been stranded on the remote planet Kesh thousands of years previously, dispatched a strike team to recover the Sith Meditation Sphere Ship\u2014who had helped the Tribe build an armada over the past past two years, before suddenly deserting the Sith\u2014as well as to kill the Skywalkers in order to pave the way for an invasion of the galaxy. The strike team's mission took them first to a planet in the Maw, where they encountered a powerful being known as Abeloth, who was able to control the world's deadly plants and had also compelled Ship into her service. Meanwhile, the Skywalkers saw Abeloth beyond shadows, and they later speculated that she might be the cause of the psychosis that plagued the Jedi Order. After she discovered that the Skywalkers were on Sinkhole Station, Abeloth finally allowed Ship to return to the Sith, who had suffered several losses to the planet's carnivorous plants.

The Sith Lord Viun Gaalan led a group of Sith to the surface and captured the Nightsisters, but while Khai went to retrieve one last witch, Gaalan was confronted by the Skywalkers and their Force-sensitive friend, Dyon Stadd. The Jedi dueled and defeated the Sith, although Gaalan managed to escape.

Taalon lied that the Lost Tribe's own apprentices had begun suffering from the same psychosis that was afflicting the Jedi Knights, and Luke Skywalker, although dubious and reluctant at first, accepted Taalon's offer. In reality, the Sith planned to force Abeloth into their service, before they betrayed and killed the Jedi. Also with the Sith fleet was Khai's father, the Sith Saber Gavar, whom the Skywalkers allowed to come aboard their ship, the Jade Shadow, for a private conversation with his daughter. Gavar spoke in the Keshiri language and urged Vestara to use her attraction to Ben\u2014and his to her\u2014to see if she could get any information from him or even turn him to the dark side; he also informed her that the Sith's alliance was a ploy, although he did not tell her their actual plans.

Calrissian responded that he could supply a Colossus I Beta Series asteroid tug, the Rockhound, although he added that he would need approximately two weeks to prepare the vessel. Luke urged Calrissian to move as quickly as possible, as he did not want to remain in the company of the Sith any longer than he had to.

Meanwhile, Ben and Vestara descended to the surface with Stadd to restock their supplies, where Stadd succumbed to the psychosis, stole a speeder bike, and fled toward the Fountain. Ben and Vestara stopped him from entering the Fountain's technology-forbidden surrounding area, but all three were apprehended by Klatooinian guards and were brought to the Detention Area in Treema, Klatooine's capital city.

Luke felt that the Sith were too dangerous\u2014Vestara in particular with regard to her and Ben's relationship\u2014to remain waiting with them at Klatooine, and decided that they should move the fleet to await Calrissian just outside the Maw. After Luke informed Calrissian of the decision, Taalon convinced the Grand Master to allow him to leave two frigates behind, the Starstalker and the Winged Dagger, under the premise that they were to wait at Klatooine in case any problems arose.

However, they were attacked by Klatooinian guards who were armed with primitive weapons such as swords and arrows. Despite the loss of one Sith Saber to an acid weapon, the Sith managed to hold off the Klatooinian guards.

Solo, who had hoped to aid the Skywalkers, had originally intended to bring a full Jedi strike team with her, but the rest of the Jedi had been trapped when Alliance Chief of State Natasi Daala had authorized a Mandalorian siege of the Temple.

Faal blamed Holpur and his crew for acting independently during the raid, and although Solo and Calrissian knew that she was lying, they were unable to prove it, as Holpur himself upheld her lie. After considering the issue and hearing from each side, Solo and Calrissian declared Holpur and his crew guilty of violating the Fountain; the entire crew of the Starstalker was thus condemned to death by Klatooinian law. The mediators went on to announce that although the Hutts had failed to prevent the violation of the Fountain, they had done everything within their ability to protect it, thus upholding the treaty. The ruling came too late, however\u2014Klatooinains across the planet had already begun to riot and revolt against their Hutt rulers, which resulted in a violent planetwide uprising.

Solo also offered Luke her assistance on the mission; he accepted, even though such cooperation with another Jedi bordered on violating the terms of his exile. Upon his return to the Jade Shadow, Luke contacted Taalon, informing him that he was aware of the incident at the Fountain and blaming the High Lord for instigating the resultant uprising, although Taalon insisted that Holpur had acted on his own.

As the Rockhound moved the frigate that it had saved away from the debris field, Vestara and the Skywalkers deduced that Sinkhole Station had been created to contain Abeloth, but that she had grown so powerful that she had been able to destroy it.

However, when Khai arrived she began to trick Stadd\u2014she lied to him that they were all impostors, but reasoned that that meant that she was not really a Sith. She told him that she was opposing those who had replaced the Jedi, claiming that everyone who had chosen to serve as an impostor for a Sith was doing so. Stadd still didn't believe her, but she insisted that\u2014since the Sith were associated with Ship, and Ship was serving Abeloth\u2014it made sense that the Sith were serving her as well. Khai then asked if Stadd would lead the Sith to Abeloth, and he replied that he would. She gave him an antidote to his sedative and used the Force to scramble the machine that had been monitoring him so that it would appear on the monitor that she had given him an extra dose of the sedative.

Vestara and the Jedi then met with Gavar, Taalon, and Faal, and Luke suggested that they try Mind Walking to locate Abeloth. Taalon agreed to the proposal and ordered Gavar and Faal to accompany him beyond shadows with Luke. Ben, meanwhile, remained behind to monitor his father's body and keep watch over Vestara.

Luke spoke briefly with Mara, revealing to her that he had felt her presence aboard the Jade Shadow throughout the mission thus far, confiding in her his comfort that she had been with him. However, Mara replied that she had not been with him; whomever he had felt had been someone else. Luke was shocked, realizing that the presence he had felt had been a trick of Abeloth's.

As the Skywalkers confronted Vestara, she revealed that she had convinced Stadd that she was on his side, and that he had told her that he knew where to find Abeloth. While she had been reassuring Stadd that the Sith were supporters of Abeloth, she had placed a tracking device on him, so that they could follow him to Abeloth.

They spoke briefly, moving closer together, and Stadd told her that he wanted to be with her. Abeloth responded that he would be with her as long as she lived, which would be forever. She began to draw upon Stadd's life energy, causing him extreme pain and finally making him realize that she was not what she seemed to be.

Still, the allies decided to go to the cave and find out if she was there. Upon their entry, they found only Stadd on the cave floor, barely clinging to his life. Awakening, Stadd apologized to Ben for his actions, revealing that now that he was aware of Abeloth's treachery, he was able to resist her influence on his mind.

She then tricked Luke into believing that she was his former lover, Callista, taking on Callista's appearance and asserting her love for him. He was shocked, but quickly decided that he wanted to help her separate herself from the dark side; however, she responded with a desire to instead make Luke become like she was. Remembering then his wife's claim that Abeloth was never what she appeared to be, Luke recognized that Abeloth was not, in fact, Callista. He realized that Abeloth had completely consumed Callista\u2014just as she had attempted to do with Stadd\u2014and he refused to help her.

There, Ben realized that Ship had taken them there so that Abeloth could steal one of their ships and flee. Meanwhile, Taalon saw the Throne of Balance in the pool upon which sat an unknown Jedi queen. He demanded to know who she was, as feared that she might prevent the Sith from taking their place as rulers of the galaxy. When the Jedi neglected to reply, Taalon decided to dive into the pool himself. The scene quickly erupted into violence, and Luke collapsed the grotto upon the Sith and fled. The Sith survived, and Taalon beat Vestara before he sent her to catch up with the Skywalkers to spy on them, in an attempt to make it appear as though she had been attacked by the High Lord and her father, but had escaped. Back at the beach where they had landed their vessels, the Jedi found that Abeloth had stolen the Jade Shadow. When Vestara arrived, Luke did not fall for her ploy\u2014even when Taalon arrived and attacked her. He fired on Taalon and Gavar Khai with his blaster before further slowing down their advance with a thermal detonator, and allowed Vestara to come along as the Jedi left the planet in Taalon's shuttle, the Emiax. Their journey led them to the Force-sensitive faction known as the Fallanassi on the moon Pydyr. Meanwhile, Taalon, having been immersed in the Pool of Knowledge, began to morph into the same kind of entity that Abeloth was. The Sith and Jedi eventually found Abeloth in hiding on Pydyr and again confronted her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mission to the Maw served as one of the primary plotlines in the fifth novel of the nine-part Fate of the Jedi series, Fate of the Jedi: Allies, written by Christie Golden and released on May 25, 2010. The mission's events also served as a resolution to the issue of the Jedi falling prey to the mysterious psychosis caused by Abeloth, which had been a major plotline in each of the first four novels of the series. There is one inconsistency of information on the battle\u2014on page 305 of Allies, shortly before the Sith and Jedi enter the tunnel in the back of Abeloth's cave, Taalon nods to two Sith, indicating for them to stay behind with Stadd. However, on page 319, the prose mentions three Sith who had stayed behind with Stadd. The final battle of the mission was later pictured in The Essential Guide to Warfare, a sourcebook published April 3, 2012. Later in the same year, the battle received a mention in The Essential Reader's Companion, another sourcebook published in October 2."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
