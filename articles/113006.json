It was used by Gungans to create a tasty salad dressing, and sold in markets by the Humans of that world as a delicacy. The red tint in Gungan bubble dwellings was derived from red glie."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The plant grew on the surface of the Naboo swamps and freshwater lakes. It was highly dependent on sunlight, and whole colonies would die if the weather remained cloudy for substantial lengths of time.
