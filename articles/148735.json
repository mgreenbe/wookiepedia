Under the command of Jedi General Halsey, he led the Jedi Master's unit alongside Jedi Commander Knox. In 20 BBY, when Devaron's Temple of Eedit was attacked by Separatist forces, Trauma fought alongside Master Halsey and Padawan Knox in defense of the temple. During the battle, Count Dooku's freshly-christened Sith apprentice Savage Opress arrived and began to turn the tide in the Separatists' favor. Realizing this, Trauma engaged Opress in a brief confrontation but was quickly dispatched by the deadly Nightbrother. The remaining Republic defenses, including the two Jedi, fell soon after and the Temple of Eedit was consequently seized by the Separatists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Advanced Recon Force Scout Trooper who adopted the nickname Trauma was a clone of the human male bounty hunter Jango Fett, born and raised on the planet Kamino.

He acquired the rank of Clone Commander and was assigned to Halsey's unit, under the command of Jedi General Halsey.

Alongside Jedi Master Halsey and Padawan Knox, who stood at the Temple's front steps in an effort to guard the doors, Trauma and his troops almost repelled the invasion force. During the battle however, Count Dooku's newly-anointed Sith apprentice Savage Opress entered Devaron's atmosphere at the behest of his master, and landed his Geonosian solar sailer on the Temple's front walkway. After he had exited his ship, the Nightbrother violently pushed his way past numerous B1-series battle droids and B2-series super battle droids, eager to confront the Republic forces. He received a single plasma blast from one of Trauma's men, before beginning a slaughter of the Temple's defenders with his spear."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trauma, realizing that Opress was near single-handedly winning the battle, ordered his troops to attack him but the apprentice ruthlessly cut down all resistance. Trauma proceeded to charge at Opress and came to a crouched stop in front of the warrior. He attempted to fire his blaster but was killed after being simultaneously stabbed and launched into the air by Opress's spear. After Trauma's death, Opress continued to advance towards the Eedit Temple. He succeeded in murdering both Halsey and Knox, and contacted his master to report that the Temple now fell under their control. After the massacre, Delta Squad retrieved the bodies of the two Jedi on Devaron and transported them to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. They reported back to a group of four Jedi High Council members, including Obi-Wan Kenobi, where clone commando Sergeant RC-1138 stated that the battle left no survivors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like all clones of the human male bounty hunter Jango Fett, Trauma stood at 1.83 meters tall.
