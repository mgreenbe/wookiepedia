The planet sat at the intersection of the Pabol Hutta and Pabol Sleheyron hyperlanes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sleheyron was a volcanic world where the few remaining wilderness were uninhabitable, made of jagged spires of basalt slag. Most of the planet was covered of urban areas, including numerous industrial areas, spaceports and refinery districts. Sleheyron economic muscle was second only to Nar Shaddaa, as was the level of intrigue that occurred there. Most of this economy was based on slave trade and on the refinement of tibanna gas in starship fuel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Pre-Republic era, Sleheyron was originally a world of the Rakata Empire. The planet was explored and colonized by the Hutts between 27,500 and 25,000 BBY, before the formation of the Galactic Republic. Sleheyron joined the Hutt Empire and stayed in Hutt control for most of its history. However, Sleheyron was not explored by Republic explorers until the period between 15,000 and 8000 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 25,100 BBY, Sleheyron marked the boundaries of the Hutts' true dominion. Xim the Despot tried to take the planet in order to make it his ninth Throne. In the 25th year of his rule, Xim launched a two-pronged strike at Sleheyron and Ko Vari but was he successfully repelled by the Hutts. This defeat started the conflict that finally lead to the fall of Xim's empire. By this time, Sleheyron was a treasure world into which only the most trusted slaves were allowed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several years before the Jedi Civil War, Yuthura Ban was sold into slavery at a young age to Omeesh the Hutt, a Hutt slaver who tortured his slaves regularly. Yuthura Ban eventually entered her master's bedchamber and stabbed the sleeping Hutt to death before leaving the planet and join the Jedi Order. Following the Mandalorian Wars, Bochaba the Hutt became a prominent presence on Sleheyron, thanks in no small part to the assassination protocols of HK-47. In fact, the assassin droid slaughtered 322 of Bochaba's \"meatbag\" enemies in a single year for his master, including two Hutt households. Later, HK-47 would claim that some of his finest work was completed on this world. In the end, however, the Hutt was slaughtered in a particularly gruesome manner by the Exchange. In the time following the Jedi Civil War, the planet's fuel reserves, one of the largest caches in the Outer Rim, were owned by Vogga the Hutt. After the destruction of the Peragus Mining Facility in 3951 BBY, Vogga was influenced by the Jedi Exile regarding the shipment of Sleheyron fuel to Citadel Station, on Telos IV."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his early days, Ziro the Hutt worked as a loan shark on the planet before moving his operations to Coruscant.
