He approached Asajj Ventress and flirted with her. She activated one of her lightsabers and ignited it through his chest. The rest of the patrons in the cantina barely seemed to notice and went back to their drinks. Bossk approached Ventress afterwards and told her that she had killed one of their team. He and Latts agreed to have her replace Oked in the group. His body was later dragged by the bartender out of the cantina."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
