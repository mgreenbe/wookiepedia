Built by Lucky Malnock, it was well situated and originally catered to miners and construction workers. As the colony expanded, the location of the bar meant that its clientele became more suited to administrative workers. Malnock ended up selling the place to a group of investors. After passing through a series of owners, Lucky's Tavern was bought by Jacc Mandelbrot. Mandelbrot bought neighboring properties and knocked them through into one location, creating the Royal Casino."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
