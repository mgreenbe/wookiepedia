It was located on the Mountain of Light. In their beliefs, a holy light that emanated from the tree kept the village safe from daylight incursions by the Night Spirit. The Ewoks believed that the Tree of Light required Light Dust in order to retain its power. As a right of passage, young warriors often traveled to the tree to administer the holy substance. Those who complete the task were presented a Feather of Light, and the village celebrated the Light Festival."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
