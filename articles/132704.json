Benefiting from the renewed interest in Star Wars sparked by Timothy Zahn's The Thrawn Trilogy and building on the popularity of flight simulation software (Lawrence Holland's three previous World War II air combat games had all been huge successes for LucasArts), X-Wing achieved what few subsequent Star Wars games could by being critically acclaimed, embraced by fans and a financial success. Players assumed the role of a young pilot in the Rebel Alliance and were given the opportunity to pilot the eponymous X-wing, as well as the Y-wing, the A-wing, and, eventually, the B-wing starfighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Original release"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "X-Wing was developed for LucasArts by the team which would later become Totally Games with the story created by Lawrence Holland, Edward Kilham, David Wessman and David Maxwell.

Each provided a tour of duty with an additional twenty missions while B-Wing also gave access to its namesake, the B-wing starfighter and another six historical missions for that ship. Two of these missions were remade versions of the tour of duty Death Star missions, allowing the player to fly the B-wing instead of an X-wing in the attack against the battlestation."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Collector Editions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A year later (1994) X-Wing was re-released as X-Wing Collector's CD-ROM, with the expansion packs included. It tweaks various areas of the game by including bug fixes, easy versions of some old missions, improved graphics, rehashed cutscenes, and bonus missions, as well as voiceovers for the mission briefings (unlike the in-game radio messages).
