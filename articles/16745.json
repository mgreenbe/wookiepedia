He conducted research on the planet Joralla, including on the extinct Wasilsi species. He advanced a theory that the Wasilsi were not native to Jorella, but either established a colony on the planet or otherwise crashed there, and were subsequently wiped out by a plague. His research was harried by violent encounters with Tikiarri tribes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
