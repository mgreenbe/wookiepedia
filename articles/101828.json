Active Jedi would visit Ossus City to recover from external and internal ailments, seeking the care of the rotating crew of Jedi healers that lived in the village. At the heart of the city stood a small Temple of Healing, where visitors would receive expert care for their wounds. Surrounding the Temple were a collection of huts and cottages that slept three patients and one healer. Beyond these care cottages was a community of tents, huts and cabins reserved for elderly Jedi who had retired from active duty and sought to get away from the hustle and bustle of Knossa. These Masters welcomed visitors from the Temple of Healing and were always willing to share their knowledge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was on the outskirts of Ossus City that Jedi apprentice Freedon Nadd slew his Master Matta Tremayne in a lightsaber duel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
