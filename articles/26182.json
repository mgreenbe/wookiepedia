Most of the exodus moved to planets such as Avidich, Rentor and Sarvchi. This exodus to other worlds was kept a secret from most in the Ascendancy. Instead, historical accounts of the event taught that Csilla's population had moved underground, leaving out the fact that the number of Chiss below the surface was far below the population of four billion before Csilla's climate change. Nevertheless, the headquarters of both the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet and Syndicure, along with many merchant and cargo installations, were kept on Csilla. Additionally, most of the Chiss Ruling Families did not want to abandon their capital world entirely, though some did move their homesteads to other planets.

After learning of an ambitious mid-ranking Xodlak family Councilor on the planet Celwis by the name of Lakuviv, Haplif settled on Celwis for a time. On Celwis, Haplif manipulated Lakuviv into declaring a family emergency and trying to forcibly seize a purported Agbui mining world rich in the valuable metal nyix.

Seeking counsel upon his return, the Ascendancy ruled that the time had come to judge whether or not the Galactic Empire would be a suitable ally, and that it was time to infiltrate the Empire in order to either make them an ally or to weaken them as easy prey for the threat to attack instead of the Chiss. With the blessing of the Aristocra, Thrawn chose a planet in Wild Space to begin his fake exile and gain the attention of the Galactic Empire.

Eli and Ar'alani then boarded the Grysk warship to see the Empire had captured two Grysk prisoners. There was a tense exchange between Ar'alani and one of the Grysk's. Soon after, the Chiss entered Imperial space to warn the Empire about the Grysks and to also warn the Grysk Hegemony to depart. The Grysk commander mockingly asked if the Chiss were serving the Empire and tried to brush off the recent Grysk defeats.
