From his throne, the Emperor asked his apprentice if he had been aware of the governor's orders to which Vader did not reply. Looking down at the holo-pad before his throne, the Emperor chided Vader, reminding him that he was his apprentice and that while none outranked him he was not a bureaucrat like the governor was.

Still kneeling, Vader replied that the Inquisitorius had been given to him to which the Emperor stated they were his but no longer would be stationed on Coruscant.
