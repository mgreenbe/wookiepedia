Working with Sergeant Fideltin Rusk of the Republic Military's 301st Infantry, the Jedi fought the forces of both the Sith Empire and the White Maw pirate organization across the icy surface of the planet in search of first the downed shuttle believed to contain the plans, and then the shuttle's databank after it was stolen by the pirates. While the Hero and Rusk defeated the Gen'Dai Zeshatt and the Emperor's Guardsman Lassicar in two separate engagements, Leeha Narezz successfully retrieved the databank, allowing the Jedi strike team to proceed with their mission to capture the Emperor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
