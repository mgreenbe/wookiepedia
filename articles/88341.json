It was an award of some significance, although presumably secondary to the Distinguished Medal of Imperial Honor. It was presented to Imperial soldiers for conspicuous bravery on the field of battle, and was awarded in a semi-annual manner. It was also important enough that its awarding has Novatroopers present to oversee the ceremony, which is considered a rare sight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Known recipients include General Garza, who received it for her actions during the Great Galactic War; Nick Rostu and Liane Trevval; Kyle Katarn and Rom Mohc, who received the medal three times.
