Many had just stepped foot on the platform when droids shot them dead from the open windows of the entrance corridor. As B2 super battle droids scurried out onto the landing platform, the 501st repelled them. They managed to secure their landing zone then stormed into the corridors, eventually pushing their way into the lava observatory room, which granted them access to an outside walkway. Despite battle droid snipers firing at them, the stormtroopers were able to capture the walkway."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under orders to destroy the foundry, the 501st planted an orbital strike beacon on the overlook to signal for the orbiting Imperial-class Star Destroyer to bombard the base.

Though many stormtroopers were slain, Gizor Dellso was killed along with his remaining droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The troopers had just enough time to withdraw when their overhead forces executed an orbital bombardment command on the Mustafar complex, completely demolishing the droid factory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
