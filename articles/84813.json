In 19 BBY, MR-T3 was present at the Republic Center for Military Operations on the galactic capital planet of Coruscant, alongside the protocol droid R-A7. As the two droids strolled down one of the base's hallways, Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano\u2014who was attempting to escape the facility after having been framed for the murder of a prisoner there\u2014ran down the hall toward the pair. Tano leapt over MR-T3, sending the astromech spinning and letting out a series of binary beeps, while R-A7 angrily shook its fist at the Jedi. MR-T3 had black and white plating, as well as a black sensor built into its conical frustum dome."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "MR-T3 appeared in \"The Jedi Who Knew Too Much,\" the eighteenth episode of the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars' fifth season, which aired on February 16, 2013.
