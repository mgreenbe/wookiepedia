It was equipped with an internal oil fryer, and its memory included a database of donut recipes; one unit, owned by the chef Dexter Jettster, was able to access over 2,400 such recipes and choose what it considered to be the most delicious. The unit's database of donuts included varieties such as dianoga cream-filled, powdered Christophsian sugar, yowvetch custard-filled, muja fruit-filled, iced Trammistan chocolate, iced Endorian maple, iced with chopped ettel nuts, iced with shredded Ishi Tib-cracked coconut, and iced with dark matter sprinkles. Cooking droids were classified as fifth-degree droids, which were typically programmed for menial tasks and built without advanced cognitive modules."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years before 22 BBY, Dexter Jettster obtained a second-hand Crisp-E-O donut droid and arrived on the planet Coruscant, where he opened the food stand Dex's Donuts on the corner of Zevanth Street and Avenue Peth. His Crisp-E-O prepared the donuts, which were on the menu alongside freshly-brewed caf. Several years later, Jettster received a settlement payment when an inattentive air taxi driver destroyed the food stand, and he used the credits to open Dex's Diner, a small caf\u00e9 where he continued to employ his Crisp-E-O donut droid. It prepared Adarian-style donuts in its fryer daily. Although he could afford to purchase a newer droid, Jettster preferred the top-quality donuts made by his old model."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Crisp-E-O donut droid was first mentioned in \"Dining at Dex's,\" a short story detailing the menu of Dex's Diner that was written by Gregory Walker and published online through StarWars.com's Hyperspace feature in 2009. The Crisp-E-O was inspired by concept art of a whimsical donut droid by artist Doug Chiang that was originally intended to appear inside Dex's Diner in the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. Chiang's design ultimately went unused in the film's final cut, and Walker developed the Crisp-E-O due to a fondness for abandoned concepts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
