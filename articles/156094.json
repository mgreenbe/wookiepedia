In the opening stages of the Great Jedi Purge, he served under Darth Vader in the assault on the Jedi Temple. During this attack, he rendezvoused with Vader at the Jedi Archives. There, he was instructed to lead his troops and destroy the starships in the hangar, thus denying the Jedi a means of escape. When this had been accomplished, he contacted Vader once more via holoprojector, shortly before the Sith Lord's confrontation with Serra Keto and Cin Drallig. Vader subsequently ordered the commander to station troops at all exits to bar any civilian or Jedi from passing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the attack, Vader, hoping to lure any Jedi survivors of Order 66, programmed the Jedi beacon in the Jedi Temple central security station to request all Jedi to return to the Jedi Temple. When Obi-Wan Kenobi arrived at the Temple to deactivate the beacon, he encountered the clone commander in the Jedi Archives directing his contingent of troops to assemble in the northwestern tower. When Kenobi refused the clone commander's demands to surrender, the commander opened fire with his cluster grenade launcher and ordered his troops to attack. In the ensuing skirmish, he was killed by Kenobi, along with most of the soldiers in his command."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The commander's armor bore a resemblance to that of CC-2224's Phase II clone trooper armor, albeit with purple markings. In his confrontation with Obi-Wan Kenobi, he wielded a grenade launcher that launched cluster grenades. The troopers under his command, beyond the standard blaster rifles, were also known to employ liberal use of shotguns, plasma disruptors, and repeating slugthrowers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clone commander is an end-level boss during Obi-Wan Kenobi's story mode for the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance versions of the video game adaptation of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, released in 2005. His presence in the video game poses a slight point of contention, in that the clone commander of Operation: Knightfall has been established to have been CC-1119, otherwise known as Appo, of the 501st Legion. Though no source has explicitly ruled out the involvement of another clone trooper commander, the purple markings of this clone commander's armor also contradicts the standard blue markings of the armor of the 501st Legion, implying that he and his troops did not belong to that particular legion, though other sources depict the 501st as the only unit to have partaken in the assault on the Jedi Temple."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the boss battle, the clone commander employs hit-and-run tactics, though as with other bosses in the game, he is programmed to attack in strict patterns. Two troopers wielding shotguns will attack in conjunction, and upon being defeated, the commander will reveal himself momentarily to fire his cluster grenade launcher alongside a bodyguard wielding a plasma disruptor, giving the player a window of opportunity to strike at him. Though the bodyguard stays behind indefinitely unless killed, the commander will withdraw to send out a new wave of two shotgunners. The cycle repeats itself until the commander is damaged enough times to be killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
