Lika was dumped out of the Trandoshan cruiser at night and managed to survive the blaster fire, fired by the Trandoshans. However, the next day, she met her fate when she, along with another prisoner Katt Mol were walking along the jungle. Suddenly, a Trandoshan hunter Ratter fired at them, killing Katt Mol. Lika tried to flee, jumping from tree to tree, but she was soon also killed by Ratter's partner, Sochek. As Ahsoka went to help Lika, Kalifa pulled her back to keep cover."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
