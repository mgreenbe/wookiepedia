When she insulted him, Jacen ordered that the hyperdrive should be sabotaged to fail upon a second jump, knowing that smugglers usually jumped to a remote location before continuing onto their destination. However, the Dark Jedi Alema Rar had stowed away in the hold, trusting that Lavint would be able to help her track down Han and Leia Solo. Alema helped her repair the hyperdrive in exchange for her help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two took the Duracrud to the Errant Venture in order to hunt for the Solos. However Booster Terrik and a team including the Solos, Wedge and Iella Antilles, Corran Horn, Jagged Fel and Jaina Solo all sprung an ambush, forcing Alema to steal the Duracrud to make her escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The freighter was then piloted by Alema to Gilatter VIII, where she knew that the Confederation summit was being held. Lavint had informed her that the Solos would be present, and then informed the Solos that Alema would be present as heads-up to the family. When Jacen Solo was trapped aboard a satellite resort by the Confederation, the Solos flew to the dome to rescue him with Luke and Mara Skywalker. Alema set the Duracrud up among the other parked ships several kilometers away and set waypoints in the nav computer. As Alema and Lumiya joined forces to attack the Solos and the Skywalkers, the Duracrud began to accelerate towards the dome, smashing through it and the floor beneath it, punching through the station's axis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
