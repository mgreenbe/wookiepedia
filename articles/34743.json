A former Nagai warlord, Nihl had been recruited into the One Sith by Darth Krayt, and was initially made into his Fist, or military leader. However, this changed when Krayt's Hand, or enforcer, died, and Nihl was promoted to the position in 130 ABY as a result. One of Nihl's first missions was leading the assault on the Jedi Praxeum at Ossus, in which he killed Jedi Master Kol Skywalker and mortally wounded the Zabrak Master Wolf Sazen. Nihl returned to Coruscant and participated in Krayt's ascension to Galactic Emperor, in which the former Emperor of the Fel Empire, Roan Fel, was thought to be slain, although he actually survived."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next seven years, Nihl acted as Krayt's top enforcer over the galaxy, until the Dark Lord promoted another, Darth Talon, to also serve in the position of Hand. Talon was sent to capture Fel's daughter, Marasiah, and Nihl was sent to reinforce her during the confrontation on Vendaxa between the Sith, Fel, Imperial Knights, and the Jedi who aided them. Skywalker's son, the bounty hunter Cade was among those who aided Fel, and confronted Nihl during the battle on Vendaxa, hoping to kill the Sith Lord for revenge over his father's death. Though Nihl did not defeat Skywalker, he later captured the bounty hunter when Skywalker infiltrated the Temple of the Sith to rescue the Bothan Jedi Knight Hosk Trey'lis. While Krayt attempted to turn Skywalker to the dark side of the Force, Nihl expressed doubts with Krayt's decisions, especially his obsession over Skywalker. Skywalker subsequently escaped, and the Emperor's Hand was sent to defeat him in combat. Nihl was bested in a duel, and had his right arm chopped off while Skywalker escaped. As a result, he was stripped of his title of Hand for his failure to defeat Skywalker and was put under Darth Maladi's charge so that she could perform experiments on him using Yuuzhan Vong biots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Nihl was later summoned to the planet Wayland by Maladi, with whom he engaged in a discussion about the current state of the One Sith Order following Darth Krayt's defeat during the battle on Had Abbadon. Nihl left for Korriban at Maladi's suggestion, to determine the truth about Darth Krayt's demise, something of which Nihl himself was unsure. After arriving on Korriban and entering the Sith temple's Stasis Room where Krayt supposedly rested, Nihl, alongside Darth Talon, discovered only Krayt's empty armor\u2014leaving them considerably interested in the whereabouts of the Dark Lord of the Sith. Nihl contacted Darth Wyyrlok soon afterward and told him that Lord Krayt's body was missing, and later accompanied the Chagrian when he arrived to investigate. Claiming that Krayt must have been murdered by a member of the One Sith, Wyyrlok and Nihl conspired to maintain the secrecy of Krayt's apparent demise. Nihl, now acting in the role of Wyyrlok's foremost advisor while he assumed leadership of the Sith, was assigned to find the also missing Darth Talon, whom Wyyrlok suggested might be responsible for whatever fate had befallen Darth Krayt. His search led him to Korriban, where he found and dueled Talon within the depths of the tombs of the ancient Sith. A resurrected Darth Krayt revealed himself just then, and unveiled his plan to crush the rebellion once and for all to both Nihl and Talon. The two joined the Dark Lord as he stormed Coruscant to confront the usurper Darth Wyyrlok, and Nihl cut down several of those Sith loyal to the Chagrian while Wyyrlok himself was dispatched by Darth Krayt. Nihl was later given command of a contingent of the Dark Lord's elite Sith troopers as Imperial forces prepared to lay siege to the hidden Jedi Temple on Taivas. When the Dark Lord's trap was sprung, Nihl dispatched the troopers, who cut through friend and foe without regard as they descended upon the planet. The Nagai later led the Sith troopers in a counterattack against the allied force's ambuscade of Coruscant. Darth Krayt was, however, killed in battle against Cade Skywalker, at which point Darth Nihl commanded the execution of all of Krayt's troopers. In the wake of the enemy's victory, Nihl retreated to an undisclosed location and ordered the remnants of the defeated One Sith into hiding with a new purpose: the destruction of their enemies from within."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Nagai Warlord"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Nihl, a male Nagai who originated from the planet Nagi, was a warlord on his homeworld, where he used his latent Force abilities to lead bands of marauders in raids all across the world. He was found by Darth Krayt, who was rebuilding the Sith Order and was offered a place within the One Sith. Nihl agreed and went through a training to become a Sith Lord. After Nihl had experienced the Embrace of Pain for the first time, his anger and pain drove him into slaying an entire village. He was known to be Krayt's top enforcer in Krayt's Sith Order, and served the Dark Lord as his Fist, or military commander. In 130 ABY, Nihl was promoted to the position of Hand by Darth Krayt after his predecessor died during the war, in which the Sith allied themselves with the Fel Empire in order to bring down the current galactic government, the Galactic Alliance."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ossus"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two standard days after the Empire captured Coruscant, the capital of the Galactic Alliance, Nihl led the Sith in an attack on the Jedi Temple at Ossus\u2014with orders from Krayt to leave no Jedi alive. In the midst of carrying out his Lord's mandate, however, Nihl and his legion of Sith and stormtroopers were confronted and attacked by Kol Skywalker, a Jedi Master of the New Jedi Order, in an attempt to provide a group of Padawans a means to escape Ossus. While Skywalker and his former Padawan, Zabrak Wolf Sazen, had some initial success against the Sith, it was in vain. Nihl engaged Sazen in combat and used his long-handle lightsaber to defeat the Jedi Master. Sazen's weapon arm was severed, and afterward, he was impaled by the Sith Lord, mortally wounding the Zabrak. After Sazen's defeat, Skywalker directly fought Nihl alone, injuring him in hopes of a last stand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker's son, Cade, soon arrived to help his father in combat, who had become momentarily distracted from his duel with Nihl. The elder Skywalker commanded Cade to take the wounded Sazen to the Jedi's escape shuttle, thus preventing Nihl from slaying the wounded Master. Skywalker continued his stand against Nihl and his Sith, but to no avail; Nihl unleashed his Force lightning to kill the Jedi Master. With the majority of the Jedi on Ossus dead, Nihl left the planet, victorious over the New Jedi Order. He traveled to Coruscant, where he witnessed Krayt's ascension as Emperor of a newly created Sith Empire by killing a decoy of Emperor Roan Fel in order to take control over the Fel Empire. In the wake of the decoy's death, the Imperial Moffs swore fealty to Krayt."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Vendaxa"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seven years later, Nihl was no longer Krayt's only Hand. Darth Talon, a Twi'lek Sith, was named Krayt's second Hand, and she was sent to Socorro for her first mission: to capture and use Princess Marasiah Fel to lure her father, the former Emperor Roan Fel, into the open so that Talon could eliminate him and thus end any resistance to Krayt's full control over the galaxy. However, Talon was prevented from capturing Marasiah by the intervention of Cade Skywalker, who had turned to a career of bounty hunting after Nihl had killed his father. Skywalker and his companions, the Zeltron Engineer Deliah Blue and Human co-pilot Jariah Syn, transported Marasiah and her aide, Astraal Vao, to Vendaxa in order to meet with Vao's brother, Jedi Knight Shado, and the Jedi Nihl had presumed deceased, Wolf Sazen. Talon attacked them there, albeit unsuccessfully, and called for the Nagai's help to eliminate the Jedi and capture the princess. Nihl was commanded by Talon to silently send troops to her position, wait for the former Emperor to appear, and then ambush the Jedi and Imperials so as to kill them all."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fel arrived with an escort of two Imperial fighters, which were quickly shot down by the Sith troops positioned by Nihl and his fellow Hand. However, Fel and his accompanying Imperial Knights escaped the destroyed ships only to be confronted by Talon. At that moment, Fel revealed himself to be Imperial Knight Antares Draco. In her confusion at the deception, Talon was forced to flee and reconvene with Nihl and his troops. He planned to attack the Jedi and Imperials once more, hoping to capture Marasiah and kill the others. As they attacked, Nihl again dueled with Sazen, and mocked the Jedi Master with the prospect of killing him a second time. Skywalker, seeing the Nagai Sith dueling Sazen once more, and Marasiah mortally wounded by a Zabrak Sith, joined Sazen in combat, hoping to avenge his father. Sazen attempted to halt Skywalker's attack on Nihl, who believed that Sazen was right to stop Skywalker, and stated that wielding a lightsaber did not make him a Jedi. The Sith Lord further mocked him and explained that vengeance was not a Jedi trait, though Skywalker did not care, and continued his duel with his father's killer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Nihl's duel with Skywalker continued, Sazen was sent to bring the princess onto Cade's ship, the Mynock. Nihl, convinced that the bounty hunter could not defeat him, offered him a quick death similar to his father's, but Skywalker simply pressed on, discontent with any result besides the Nagai's death. Nihl was subsequently shot by Syn, allowing Skywalker enough time to gather himself, but his companion was soon Force pushed away by Nihl. This left him open to defeat by Skywalker, who instead escaped with his companions, the Imperials, and Jedi Vao, on the Mynock. Nihl then explained to Talon that he would soon be the only Hand once again, as he believed Talon would be killed by Krayt for the mission's failure."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Capture of Cade Skywalker"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To Nihl's disappointment, Talon was not killed for her actions on Vendaxa. Instead, a search was warranted for Skywalker, in whom Krayt had an interest because of his potential to heal through the Force. This search, once begun, was easier than expected; Skywalker came to the Sith Temple on Coruscant to save Hosk Trey'lis, a Bothan Jedi Knight whom Skywalker had handed to the Sith for a bounty before experiencing a change of heart. He was attacked by Talon, whom he defeated using the dark side of the Force. Before he could finish her off, Nihl Force choked him with the intent of killing the last Skywalker. However, Talon informed Nihl that Skywalker was wanted alive, and that she was sent to capture him. Unable to disobey Krayt's orders, Nihl obliged, and informed Krayt of Skywalker's capture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Skywalker captured, Krayt hoped to turn the former Jedi to the dark side. By threatening to kill Syn and Blue, the Sith Lord was able to persuade Skywalker to listen to his offer and reconsider being a Sith. Krayt brought Skywalker to his chambers, but when Nihl attempted to enter, Darth Wyyrlok, Krayt's chief servant, barred him from entering. Nihl attempted to argue, believing his status as a Hand was enough. Wyyrlok did not comply, and questioned Nihl's loyalty to Krayt, causing Nihl to step back. Darth Maladi, the head of Sith Intelligence and Assassination, explained to Nihl why he wasn't allowed entry; Nihl was not born a Sith. Krayt had wanted Nihl to become his Sith military leader, and only promoted Nihl to Hand because Talon had not been ready at the time of his predecessor's death. When Nihl questioned Maladi as to why she wasn't allowed to enter even though she was born Sith, she stated her complete loyalty to Krayt. However, both she and Nihl wondered at Krayt's fascination with Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Krayt's attention to Skywalker paid off, and Skywalker agreed to become a Sith, trained by Talon. As Skywalker fell further and further down the dark side, Krayt became convinced that Skywalker would be able to heal him of the Yuuzhan Vong Yorik-Kul implants that were causing his body to fail. As Skywalker began to realize his power under the training of Krayt and Talon, the Sith Lord became obsessed with Skywalker and his potential ability to heal him. This obsession Nihl disagreed with, and he told Maladi of this. She began to wonder to herself if Skywalker was capable of healing Krayt, and what would happen should he die. Nihl firmly believed in the old ways of the Sith; because Krayt had named no heir, there would be a power struggle. Therefore, Nihl believed that should Krayt fail to be healed, then Skywalker would be named his heir."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fighting another Skywalker"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Skywalker had different plans; he lied about his eagerness to be trained as a Sith, and attempted to escape the Temple of the Sith. This escape attempt was foiled by Talon, and Skywalker was brought to Krayt to kill Trey'lis, so that he could become a Sith in truth. Nihl watched as Krayt commanded him to kill Trey'lis or be killed himself, but Skywalker refused. Krayt attempted to stir Skywalker's hatred of people dying for him as motivation to kill Trey'lis, but the Bothan Jedi intervened, expressing his hope that he would not be used as a weapon of the Sith. For his interference, Krayt struck him down and a skirmish between Nihl, Talon, Krayt, and Skywalker occurred when the latter had a vision of his father. Using the Force, Skywalker pulled his father's lightsaber toward him, impaling Talon with it, and engaged Nihl in combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Nihl defended himself against Skywalker, he was betrayed by Krayt; the Dark Lord encouraged Nihl's opponent to use his anger and kill the Nagai in vengeance. The duel continued, and eventually Nihl's arm was severed by Skywalker. Defeated and unconscious, he was then attacked by Skywalker using Force lightning, whose intention was to kill Nihl as revenge for his father's death. However, upon Krayt's beckoning, Skywalker engaged the leader of the Sith in combat instead of killing Nihl. Skywalker was subsequently rescued by his mother, Morrigan Corde, who had aligned herself with her son's companions in a plan to rescue the bounty hunter. The plan was a success and Skywalker escaped, resulting in the failure of both Nihl and his fellow Hand to keep Skywalker within the clutches of the Sith.

Though the latter was not injured, Nihl and his fellow Hand were hurt extensively, and Maladi was put in charge of their healing. Since the Nagai's arm was cleanly cut, Maladi offered to have it reattached, but Krayt refused; Nihl's incompetence had failed the Sith, and Krayt felt that he was no longer worthy of his arm as a result. Instead, Nihl was to receive a Yuuzhan Vong bioform replacement for his severed limb. Krayt had originally wanted to kill Nihl for his failure, but Wyyrlok convinced him otherwise, explaining that while he was no longer able to continue his position as a Hand, Nihl still had use to the Dark Lord. Krayt then replaced Nihl with Darth Stryfe, his Fist, as his new Hand, and sent him and Talon to be healed. Nihl protested his replacement, saying he had earned his place as Krayt's Hand, but Krayt brushed the complaint off. Maladi took the two to her laboratory, and placed both Nihl and Talon in bacta tanks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the injuries he sustained were more severe than Talon's, Nihl continued to heal on Coruscant, while the Twi'lek recovered completely. The former Hand remained in bacta while Lords Krayt, Maladi, Stryfe, and Talon answered the summons of a mysterious female Jedi, who claimed to have Cade Skywalker imprisoned on the Deep Core world of Had Abbadon. Lured into a trap by Skywalker and his colleagues, which included several Imperial Knights, Nihl's fellow Sith were attacked and subsequently defeated. Though Darth Krayt survived the battle, he was murdered shortly afterward by Darth Wyyrlok, who feigned the Dark Lord's survival to all while acting in Krayt's stead as both leader of their Order and ruler of the Empire.

Nihl met with Maladi on Wayland where she disclosed her concerns that the Chagrian Sith Lord would attempt to seize power and would probably do so by exterminating those he considered a threat; Lady Maladi believed both she and Nihl, as outsiders who were not born within the Sith, would both be removed. She went on to say that she considered him a far more suitable candidate to lead the Sith and convinced him to go to Korriban to confirm her beliefs about Krayt's death and then use what he discovered as he best saw fit. Nihl made his way to the Temple on Korriban where he was met and momentarily halted at the doors of the Stasis Room by Darth Talon. When she refused him entry, Nihl lied and told her that he had been summoned by Darth Krayt himself. They entered the room together, and Talon was shocked to discover that Lord Krayt's body was gone and only his empty armor remained, an eventuality that Maladi had prepared Nihl for.

Despite already being aware of Krayt's death as well as the true culprit, Nihl quickly suggested that Darth Talon, his long-time rival, may have been responsible since she had not only entered the tomb with Nihl but had mysteriously disappeared after the discovery. Pleased that he now had a scapegoat, the Chagrian agreed and told Nihl to find and question Talon while he returned to Coruscant to tend to matters concerning the Empire.

Nihl was chided for his ambition and desire for power at Krayt's expense, but the Dark Lord spared his life nonetheless.

Darth Nihl, Talon, and two of Krayt's Sith troopers cut through swaths of the Sith loyal to Darth Wyyrlok as they made their way to the throne room, and the Chagrian met them for battle at its entrance. Those present did not interfere in the subsequent duel between he and Darth Krayt, and when Krayt emerged victorious, Nihl resumed his place by the Dark Lord's side. Soon afterward, Lord Krayt learned the location of the hidden Jedi Temple on Taivas, and readied his forces for war against his enemies.

Nihl had studied the old ways of the Sith, which was that the strongest Sith should take control of the Order, rather than an heir.
