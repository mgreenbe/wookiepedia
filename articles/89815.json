They were extraordinarily small\u2014to such a degree that they could pass through a spaceship's meteor shields\u2014but extremely powerful. The composition of a typical micromine was a grain of anti-matter in magnafield casing, making them virtually undetectable to the enemy. While originally the plan was to mass produce these demolition weapons, the full-scale use in the space around the planet Shiva IV showed that such production would be cost prohibitive and the deployment of these weapons were scrapped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another type of micromine was an antipersonnel version used by clone commandos such as Darman. These were tiny mines that could be thrown, attached to a myriad of surfaces, and could be set off by timer or by remote detonator. Darman used one such type of mine - AP Micromines - to blow up a hill side."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Types"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
