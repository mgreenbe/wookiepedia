It could wield a number of weapons, including a flamethrower, harpoon, sniper blaster, gas dispenser, and various drills and cutters. The droid was capable of emitting disruptive energy beams, which allowed it to bypass security screens. Other implements, like spy sensors, could also be attached to the droid's modular frontal tool chuck. Powering the droid was a fusion reactor, which required a power converter array to mediate the energy flux. This converter array could also double as a self-defensive electroshock device. Though ostensibly a courier, the droid was actually an assassination model made by the Malkite Poisoners. They made one for the Clawdite assassin Zam Wesell to serve as her personal assassin droid, used in an attempt to kill Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala on Coruscant prior to the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, bounty hunter Zam Wesell used the droid in an attempt to assassinate Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who was residing in a senatorial apartment in a Coruscant skyscraper. The droid cut a hole in the window of Amidala's chamber, and through this hole inserted a canister containing two kouhuns."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi sensed a disturbance in the room, they saved Padm\u00e9 by slashing through the kouhuns using their lightsabers. In order to find out who sent ASN-121, Obi-Wan jumped through the window and grabbed the fleeing droid. It attempted to shake Kenobi off, but Wesell fired a sniper rifle and destroyed it, leaving Kenobi free-falling until he was saved by Anakin's appropriated airspeeder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
