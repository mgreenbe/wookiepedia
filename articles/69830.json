They were typically over-the-top and unrealistic, featuring Jedi fighting dangerous opponents. During the Clone Wars, Jedi Action vids were available for rental from Hedrett Holovid, a holovid shop that was located in Hedrett, on Cularin. The Zabrak Jedi Knight Nek Lawsirk was a fan of the genre and would often discuss its merits with Gar Bettle, the owner of Hedrett Holovid. Bettle disliked Jedi Action vids and tried to get him to watch something different instead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Jedi Action holovids"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
