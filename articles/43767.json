He carried a bowcaster and wore a large-rimmed circular hat, which he used as a weapon or a shield. Embo was known to work as part of Sugi's band of bounty hunters, though on his own he was renowned as one of the most skilled bounty hunters of his time, at one point managing to match the Jedi Anakin Skywalker. He also owned a pet anooba named Marrok and a saucer-shaped starship called the Guillotine. After the battle of Jakku, Embo received funding from the New Republic, but when it ran out, he lived as a farmer on Felucia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Embo was born on the planet Phatrong. During the Clone Wars, Embo was working as a bounty hunter. Embo was often a part of Sugi's band of Sugi's bounty hunters, alongside Rumi Paramita and Seripas. Embo and Sugi came to be relatively close, and Sugi often relied on Embo as a favored mercenary."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Battle on Felucia"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the crew was employed by Casiss Midagatis, the leader of a farming village on the planet Felucia, to protect the villagers and their harvest of Nysillin from a gang of pirates led by Hondo Ohnaka. Shortly after they had been hired, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano crash-landed on Felucia and discovered the village. A brief standoff between the Jedi and the hunters took place before Casiss intervened, begging the two groups to work together against the pirates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi were initially reluctant to help the villagers, but were swayed after a brief encounter with Ohnaka, the leader of the gang, whom the Jedi had met once before. Refusing to be bought off by the pirates, the bounty hunters, along with the Jedi, began teaching the villagers to defend themselves. Embo, watching Skywalker train the villagers how to use a simple farming tool as a weapon, chuckled at their lack of experience. While the villagers were preparing to fight, Sugi spotted a lone pirate watching from a nearby ridge. Embo was sent to deal with the scout and the Kyuzo quickly took him out, disabling his Starhawk speeder bike with his bowcaster and blocking the pirate's shots using his metallic hat, before snapping the Weequay's neck with his bare hands. Skywalker commended Embo for his actions, but the fact that the scout would no longer check back in with Hondo meant the villagers didn't have any time to waste."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon afterwards, the pirates attacked the village. Dozens of pirates on speeder bikes swept into the village, firing at the defenders. Embo dispatched one of the pirates and commandeered a speeder bike, using it to take out several others. When Ohnaka arrived on the scene in his tank, however, Embo wasn't quick enough to avoid one of the tank's blasts and was hit. With a badly wounded right arm, Embo was helped into the main barn at the center of the village by Sugi and the others, unable to participate in the battle any longer. After Ohnaka and his pirates retreated and fled the system, Embo left in Sugi's ship, Halo, along with the Jedi, and traveled to a Republic outpost."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Freelancing"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one point, Embo and Sugi, were present at the palace of Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine.

Embo was one of the few hunters to survive the challenge, and was assigned by Count Dooku to kidnap Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Embo then traveled to Naboo to carry out the daring mission. The hunters successfully kidnapped the Chancellor, assuming the roles of Senate Commandos through the use of the holographic disguise matrix, developed by Sinrich. Embo rushed the Chancellor away but failed to escape and were arrested by Skywalker and Mace Windu."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Embo did not remain in Republic custody for long, however.

When Maul and his brother, Savage Opress, representing the Shadow Collective, threatened the Hutts, Embo and the others sprang into action to defend their employers. At first the bounty hunters were able to beat the brothers back, but they were driven back when the forces of Death Watch joined in the attack. Embo went up against Opress on his own, saved from the Nightbrother only by the strength of his hat. When it was clear that they couldn't defeat the two brothers, Embo and the others retreated, abandoning their employers."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Targeting Clovis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after this, Embo traveled to Scipio, the home planet of Rush Clovis, whom he had been hired to drive off the InterGalactic Banking Clan vault world. When Clovis arrived, along with Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Skywalker, Embo killed Amidala's aide, Teckla Minnau, and disabled the trio's ship. As they fled in a speeder, Marrok forced them to pilot down the mountainside. Embo used his hat to sled down the mountain in pursuit of the speeder carrying his target. However, he was held at bay by Skywalker until the trio was saved by R2-D2, who was piloting their ship, saving them before they could go over a cliff. Having accomplished his mission, Embo informed his employer, Darth Sidious, that Clovis had escaped\u2014just as the Dark Lord had planned."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Krayt's Claw"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the latter months of the war, Embo began taking jobs on a regular basis with Boba Fett's team of bounty hunters, Krayt's Claw. One job in particular found the crew hired by former ally of the Sith, Asajj Ventress, to assist in the rescue of her lover, Quinlan Vos, from his captivity on Serenno. This was his first time working with the Dathomirian Nightsister and former Sith apprentice. Embo and his anooba Marrok traveled to Serenno on the Guillotine and rendezvoused with Krayt's Claw and Ventress at the planet's spaceport. While the mission proved to be a failure, Embo and the rest of Fett's team escaped a direct encounter with the Sith Lord Count Dooku, alive."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Inspiring Sabine"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several years before the Battle of Yavin, Embo was depicted in some graffiti art, courtesy of Sabine Wren, aboard the Ghost, the ship of Hera Syndulla."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Hunting Lando Calrissian"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle of Endor, Embo took on a job to collect a bounty placed on Lando Calrissian, a prominent general in the Alliance to Restore the Republic who had been responsible for the destruction of the Galactic Empire's second Death Star. Embo located Lando's ship, the Millennium Falcon, at a refueling station and snuck onboard the vessel. The stowaway Embo sabotaged the ship, keeping it from taking liftoff. While Calrissian was attempting to conduct repairs, Embo cornered him with his bowcaster. Embo spoke to him, though Lando could only understand the words \"Death Star\" come from the Kyuzo. Lando realized that Embo was there to collect the bounty on him and tried to offer Embo a deal that involved splitting the bounty. Embo protested and aimed his blaster, but Lando stalled long enough for one of the Falcon's pipes to burst behind Embo, knocking the hunter into a wall and incapacitating him. While Embo got his bearings, he was tied up by Calrissian. Lando brought the captive Embo outside the ship, where he exaggerated what had happened to his co-pilot, Nien Nunb.

The Black Sun crime boss Gyuti had imposed a bounty on Emari's head. Embo joined Swift's party because he wanted to clear his debts. After learning that Niima the Hutt had taken Jas captive on Jakku, Embo and the other bounty hunters traveled to Niima's temple to pick her up. Swift went into Emari's cell to fetch her, intending to collect the bounty for himself and abandon his crew. However, Jas broke free and overpowered her captors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After escaping her captors, Jas headed to the hangar only to find Embo and Dengar guarding Swift's Corellian shuttle. They began speaking, and during the conversation Embo mentioned the death of Marrok, which had happened years before. Knowing that Embo had incurred debts, Jas tried to remind Embo that he and her aunt Sugi had worked together. Emari convinced Embo to let her take the ship, saying that he was old and that Marrok always liked her.

In return for ferrying Niima back to her temple, the Hutt crime lady had outfitted them with an old Imperial shuttle, old uniforms, and clearance codes to enter the Main Imperial base on Jakku. Embo and the rest of Swift's party cornered Jas and Niima.

However, they were unable to leave due to the Battle of Jakku. During the wait, Jas managed to convince Embo, Dengar, and Jeeta to turn against Swift. She offered to secure them pardons from the New Republic if they switched sides. Swift tried to object but was thrown out of the shuttle by Jas with the help of Dengar. Embo, Jeeta, and Dengar then became Jas' crew. They took Swift's shuttle to the Jakku Observatory where they picked up Norra, who had joined forces with Sloane and her estranged husband Brentin Lore Wexley to stop Gallius Rax from destroying Jakku as part of the late Emperor's contingency plan."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "After the Battle of Jakku"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle of Jakku and the Galactic Concordance, Embo and the rest of Emari's crew received full pardons from the New Republic with the help of Jas' friend Sinjir Rath Velus, a former Imperial loyalty officer who had become an adviser to Chancellor Mon Mothma.

Embo chose Felucia to settle on due to its value to him, starting a life as a farmer there. In 34 ABY, Embo was sought out by mercenary Bazine Netal, who was searching for the whereabouts of the Millennium Falcon. Netal learned from junk droid Teetee that a bounty hunter who once owned a pet anooba and an armored hat had been in contact with the Falcon, and she immediately recognized who the droid was referring to. Netal found Embo on Felucia, though the Kyuzo reacted poorly to her arrival and, after a short chase, he cornered her and she offered him a deal. Netal knew that he was low on credits and offered him some in exchange for information on his encounter with the Falcon. Despite the initial language barrier, Embo told her the story of his failed attempt to capture the ship and collect the bounty on Lando Calrissian's head after the Battle of Endor. Netal was underwhelmed with the story and didn't believe it was worth the credits, but held up her end of the bargain. As she prepared to make her leave, Embo gave her what information he had on the current location of the ship.

Embo was also respected by her niece Jas Emari. Having incurred debts by the time of the Battle of Jakku, Embo reluctantly accepted an offer from Mercurial Swift to join his crew and collect Boss Gyuti's bounty on Jas. However, Embo was unwilling to hurt Jas since they had worked together in the past. On one occasion, he allowed Jas to escape. On another, he and his fellow bounty hunters Dengar and Jeeta turned against Swift after Jas convinced them to join forces with her in return for securing pardons from the New Republic.
