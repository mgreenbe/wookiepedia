The 6th Regiment of every SpecForce division was comprised of Heavy Weapons Specialists. Simply put, Heavy Weapons Specialists operated SpecForce's arsenal of heavy weapons, provided other troops with cover from enemy forces including air and ground vehicles, and gave Alliance forces extra offensive punch during assault on enemy positions and facilities. Heavy Weapons Specialists suffered from a higher casualty rate than any other branch of SpecForce; their training emphasised the need to hold their positions at all costs. Once a Heavy Weapons Specialists position was identified, they became the target of enemy fire. Heavy Weapons Specialists would rather die at their posts than abandon their weapon. This mindset led to two types of Heavy Weapons Specialists; veterans and targets. There were no average Heavy Weapons Specialists. In addition to their groundside combat duties, Heavy Weapons Specialists stationed with the Alliance Fleet were expected to replace gunners incapacitated in battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Heavy Weapons Specialists fire teams were close knit, a result of the reliance each gunner placed on the other members of their unit.

They were not stupid, however, and saw the Galactic Empire for what it was, joining the Alliance as soon as they were able to. Their years of athletic training and upper body strength led them to a posting in SpecForces Heavy Weapons Specialists; the weapons needed strength to lift. Trained on all types of heavy weapons, from infantry support weapons, to repeating blasters, to capital ship guns. Following drop camp, Heavy Weapons Specialists trained on safe worlds with missile weapons, heavy blasters, and artillery. Maintenance and repair of weapons were taught, and they were rotated to a line ship for further space weapon training, usually in concert with Marines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Heavy Weapons Specialists were bold, brash, and lacked subtlety in all forms.

A rescued slave, Whumparrin was assigned as a Heavy Weapons Specialists as an act of pragmatism; he could easily carry the weapon.
