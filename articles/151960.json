It; however, ended up having its head shot off by its partner at close range, apparently due to a programming glitch, causing their commander to clutch its face in exasperation and presumably file another suboptimal weapon discharge report, which it had done at least one day prior."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The OOM command battle droid appeared in an artwork by John Van Fleet in the 2012 guidebook The Essential Guide to Warfare, titled \"Another day, another suboptimal weapon discharge report.\" According to author Jason Fry in his endnotes, it was one of the last artworks issued for the book, as well as the best in his opinion.
