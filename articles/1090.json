When Ventress nearly completely blew up the room, 327 was still inside, and was caught in the explosion. He was not destroyed, however, but merely trapped by falling debris. When Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and Padawan Ahsoka Tano sensed movement while tracking Ventress, they mistook him for her due to his movement. Luminara freed him and fixed his position on the ground before continuing pursuit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Treadwell droid's name is another conspicuous appearance of the digits \"327\", a recurring number in Lucas' productions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
