It consisted of a central arena covered with a floating canopy, surrounded by seats. Outside were stone pillars, as well as stone steps leading inside. Privileged guests sat in booths higher up than the regular seats. On warm days, repulsorlift-powered sunshades floated above the crowds to block out the sun. Leia Organa Solo considered the stadium to be enormous, and it was visible to Jaina Solo as her X-wing starfighter approached the city from space. In 28 ABY, the stadium was the site of a Ssi-ruuvi Consecration Ceremony that preceded the battle at Bakura."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
