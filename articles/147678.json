He maintained no close associates, seeking to prove his intellectual superiority without anyone else around to take the credit for it. He spent his private time on Voss alternating between long periods of deep thought and sudden bursts of text-entry into his encrypted datapad."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic War, Torius was involved in negotiations with the Voss to align with the Empire against Senator Evran. However, Torius had an ulterior motive for being on Voss. He secretly launched a plan to place a stolen Republic ZR-57 orbital strike bomb beneath the Voss capital of Voss-Ka and hold it hostage. This was out of many plans that were conceived and Torius was confident that the Voss could not foresee all of them. However, Havoc Squad discovered his plan and confronted him. Torius underestimated Havoc and died in the ensuring battle. The Voss then revealed themselves, the Mystic Ki-Ve having foreseen Torius' plan and that Havoc Squad would stop him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
