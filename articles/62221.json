The Nelvaanians believed that Anakin Skywalker was the Holt Kazed, due to his mechanical hand, which he wore during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to the legend, the Holt Kazed was a warrior who would lose his hand in battle with a great beast or monster, but who would then receive a new one that would grant him great power. With this power, the warrior would be able to defeat any enemy. The Holt Kazed, it was prophesied, would come to the Nelvaanian people in a time of great hardship and sorrow, when nature herself (the Great Mother planet) would be hurt, or violently thrown out of balance by a great illness\u2014which ultimately the hero would heal. But the legend had a dark, ominous side to it, as it foretold that the warrior's power would increase mightily to the point where it would overpower him, kill his friends, strangle his loved ones, and, eventually, utterly consume the hero himself. The legend is told through a vision that Anakin Skywalker experiences during his journey in trying to heal the Great Mother. If carefully studied, it becomes clear that the legend of Holt Kazed is actually a foretelling of Anakin's eventual transformation into the Sith Lord, Darth Vader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
