In his youth, Hotne encountered many different kinds of plants during his travels. These plants later served as an inspiration for him to become an artist who created accurate depictions of these subjects. By the time following the Battle of Yavin, cerca 1 ABY, Hotne set up shop in a small square next to the Lucky Despot hotel and casino in Mos Eisley, a city on the Outer Rim Territories planet of Tatooine. As he was overdue on his rent, Hotne was on edge about being approached by debt collectors. He had few credits to his name, and sought to create paintings as a way to make a living. He created four such paintings during his time in Mos Eisley, titled Blumbush, Boffa Plant, Mattberry Plant, and Ronka Plant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, in Tatooine's Imperial capital of Bestine, curator Lilas Dinhint oversaw the Museum of Tatooine, which served as the planet's only museum. Dinhint sought to enhance the museum's collection by offering visitors something new. To that end, the museum selected a small number of artists who would be approached for an opportunity to have their art featured in Bestine. Vanvi Hotne was one of the artists to be considered, along with Giaal Itotr, Klepa Laeel, Kahfr Oladi, Boulo Siesi, and Kolka Zteht. In order to have his paintings featured in Bestine, however, Hotne required enough votes to win over his fellow artists. Lilas Dinhint held a Bestine Museum art competition every thirty days, allowing for a period of fifteen days in between in which individuals could vote for their favorite artist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the course of his artistry career, Hotne was approached by a number of spacers, many of whom voted for him as their artist of choice. Hotne won the art competitions at various times, allowing him the opportunity to display his paintings in Bestine's museum for a period of thirty days. During the time his paintings were displayed, the corrupt curator Dinhint offered schematics of the artworks in exchange for a \"modest donation\" of 48,000 credits. This allowed the opportunity for architecturally-inclined furniture makers and traders to mass-produce copies of Hotne's paintings so that they could be purchased, collected, or displayed for personal use. With his paintings now on display in Bestine, Hotne believed his windfall would follow shortly thereafter, and that he would be able to make good on his debts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vanvi Hotne had green skin, and green-colored eyes. In his youth, Hotne was an explorer who traveled the galaxy, admiring its many forms of plantlife. In later life, Hotne was on edge about being approached by debt collectors, as he was overdue on his rent. Hotne was liable to act hostile towards any passersby who approached him, believing them to be potential collectors. However, his anxieties were put more at ease once his paintings were put on display in Bestine, as he believed this newfound success would put an end to his financial woes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his time as an artist in Mos Eisley, Hotne wore a black reinforced jumpsuit with a black mercenary bandolier, along with a brown worksman's belt. In creating his paintings, Hotne used an art palette."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vanvi Hotne was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. He was added to the game on February 11, 2004 as part of Publish 6 The Imperial Crackdown. The update featured a new Bestine Museum event, in which players could vote for a number of NPC artists in order to have one of their paintings put up for display in the museum. Vanvi Hotne was one of these artists, and players who chose to vote for him were required to first converse with him in Mos Eisley. If Hotne got the most votes, one of his paintings, either Blumbush, Boffa Plant, Mattberry Plant, or Ronka Plant, would be displayed for about a one month period, and players could purchase schematics of the paintings during a two week period for a fee of 48,000 credits. The winning artist depended on the player's input, however as the competitions were held monthly, this article assumes 100% game completion, and that Vanvi Hotne won the right to display all of his paintings on at least several occasions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
