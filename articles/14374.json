Sith forces were led by \"scores\" of Sith Lords, each riding a speeder named after an animal that personified the lord (such as Hssiss, Ng'ok, and Sleeth). During the Jedi retreat, a Sith sniper shot the Jedi coordinator who was using battle meditation, turning the retreat into a full scale slaughter. Felloux later wrote a poem on the battle. The defeat at Mizra for the Republic led to the loss of control for much of the Outer Rim Territories and some believed that central control never returned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
