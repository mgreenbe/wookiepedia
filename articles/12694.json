Although most Jedi who swore the vow did so as a method of atonement, some did it in order to re-focus themselves on the Force. From the founding of the Order to its doom, over fourteen thousand Jedi pursued Barash. After a traumatic experience as a prisoner of the dark side-steeped Drengir, Jedi Knight Dez Rydan chose to swear the vow. Jedi Master Kirak Infil'a was a notable Barash-taker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
