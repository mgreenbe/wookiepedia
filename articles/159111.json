On one occasion, Gresh ventured into the Fioer desert on the planet Zaraksander in order to capture the Supreme Leader of the Neo-Fundamentalist Phlangites. Gresh barely made it away alive and swore never to go up against the NFP again. However, the following day the bounty hunter was paid 30,000 by an associate of the corporate executive Darred Eloinie to rescue Eloinie's daughter Cyrstas, who had been captured by the NFP, and Gresh headed out into the desert to confront the Fundamentalists once again. At some point afterward, Gresh wrote about the incident in the autobiography Great Hunts I've Lived To Tell About."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
