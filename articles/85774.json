Raised in a military family, Malavai followed the footsteps of his father Rymar Quinn in joining the Imperial Military. During the Battle of Druckenwell he corrected a critical oversight by his superior Moff Broysc, allowing the Imperial victory, but was court-martialed for insubordination, ending up in a dead-end assignment on Balmorra. There he was absorbed into the intelligence network of the Sith Lord Darth Baras, who looked over Quinn's career for the next decade. Late in the Cold War Quinn assisted Baras' newest Sith apprentice in neutralizing his spy Rylon and stopping the Jedi Knight Mashallon from exposing Baras' network. As a reward, Baras awarded Quinn a posting of his choosing and the Captain choose to serve alongside the Sith apprentice, while remaining a spy for Baras."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quinn traveled with the apprentice for a long time, as the Sith grew more and more powerful, taking Jedi Padawan Jaesa Willsaam as an apprentice and killing Baras' master Darth Vengean on his orders. As the Sith's power grew, Baras set up a trap to end his apprentice's life, but the Sith was rescued by the Emperor's Hand and made the second Emperor's Wrath, tasked to undermine Baras' bid for power. Baras ordered Quinn to dispose of his former apprentice and Quinn set a trap for Wrath, luring the Sith to a space station and attacking the Wrath with two specially programmed assault droids at his side. However, the Wrath easily prevailed over Quinn, winning his loyalty and allowing him to remain at their side. The Wrath confronted Darth Baras on Korriban and killed him, after which the Dark Council fully acknowledged the Sith's authority. During his travels with the Sith, Quinn put a stop to Moff Broysc's incompetence, ending the loose end of the Republic Strategic Information Service agent Voloren and saving Major Ovech from a trap sprung through Broysc's inaction.

As a child, he idolized the Imperial Guard, as service in that unit was the highest honor a non-Sith could achieve in the Empire. Quinn became an officer of the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War, earning the rank of lieutenant by the time of Battle of Druckenwell in 3653 BBY, in which Quinn was a commanding officer assigned to Moff Broysc. Broysc made a critical oversight that nearly resulted in defeat, but Quinn chose to disobey the Moff's direct order and single-handedly returned the advantage to the Empire, resulting in a Republic defeat. However, Broysc was furious at the insubordination from Quinn, who had been tracking a Republic Strategic Information Service agent Voloren and had the man cornered when Broysc recalled Quinn to serve in the battle. The Moff took credit for Quinn's saving of the fleet, but chose to court-martial his subordinate. Fortunately for Quinn, the Sith Lord Darth Baras assigned Quinn to Balmorra, leaving Broysc to fume and block every transfer or promotion Quinn received during his time on the planet. Now part of Baras' massive intelligence network, Quinn remained posted on Balmorra for the next ten years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3643 BBY Quinn was instructed by Baras' to assist his new Sith apprentice, who was on Balmorra with a mission to neutralize Baras' spy Commander Rylon. Rylon was embedded amongst the Balmorran resistance and Jedi Master Nomen Karr had sent an investigator to expose him. Malavai Quinn directed the apprentice in covering Rylon's tracks. The most urgent was recovering data from a satellite control tower in the Markaran Plains that contained evidence of Rylon's involvement in sabotage of Balmorran defenses prior to imperial invasion. The next target was Rylon's son Durmat, who knew of his father's true allegiance and was waiting to be interrogated by the Jedi investigator. The Sith apprentice eliminated Durmat in his cell before the Jedi arrived. The Sith then went to confront Rylon at the Balmorran Arms Factory and killed him, however Quinn alerted the apprentice that the investigator sent by Nomen Karr was a Jedi Knight, who had recorded the conversation between the Sith and Rylon and was headed for the Sobrik spaceport. While the apprentice pursued the Jedi Mashallon, Quinn had intercepted her off-world transmissions, thereby keeping the Jedi in the dark."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quinn then returned to his office in Sobrik, where Baras' apprentice reported to the Sith Lord on a private call. The Sith gave credit to Quinn for his assistance in the mission, so Baras promoted him to captain and awarded him a posting of his choosing. Quinn asked the Sith to allow him to travel and serve alongside them, and his request was granted.

Together they joined the Sith on the Hunt for Jaesa Willsaam, the apprentice of Jedi Master Nomen Karr, chasing her trail on Tatooine and Alderaan before confronting her on Hutta, where the Sith tempted Jaesa to join their side as an apprentice. Baras then enacted his Plan Zero, sending his apprentice to eliminate members of Republic War Trust on Taris and Jedi Knight Xerender on Hoth. After Baras maneuvered his apprentice to kill his master Darth Vengean, he ascended to the Dark Council and, growing concerned about his apprentice's growing power, Baras set a trap for them on Quesh. However, the apprentice was rescue by the Emperor's Hand and given the title of the Emperor's Wrath.

Quinn claimed that Baras has instituted martial law on Corellia preventing any authorized ship from landing, and that the Wrath's crew needed to steal a special transponder in order to bypass the Imperial blockade. The Sith traveled to the transponder station at the coordinates Quinn provided, where the Captain revealed that there was no martial law and the entire thing was a ruse. Quinn then apologized to the Sith, whom he grew to respect, explaining that he owed Darth Baras too much and that his allegiance to him came first. He unveiled two assault droids that were programmed with combat data Quinn had gathered on the Wrath, but his overconfidence proved to be his downfall. The Wrath destroyed the droids and Force-choked Quinn for his betrayal but chose to spare him whereas Baras would not.

This included tracking down the Republic Strategic Information Service agent Voloren whom Broysc grossly underestimated and saving Major Ovech and the majority of his men from a death trap in a supposedly secret warehouse on Cato Neimoidia, sprung through Broysc's general incompetence. Eventually, Quinn and the Sith got into holoconference with Broysc, determining that he was suffering from severe dementia. Broysc had dubbed Quinn Admiral Malcontent and blamed him for defeats that occurred years before his birth. With Sith's permission, Quinn contacted Imperial High Command in hopes they would remove Broysc, but none had the courage to stand up to him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since Broysc's political and military connections would not allow him to be removed through the proper channels, Quinn decided to take matters into his own hands and abducted Broysc from a pleasure barge where he had been holed up while a battle was ongoing, bringing him to the Sith's ship. Clearly mad, Broysc ordered the Sith to surrender the vessel and its crew to his command and even kill themselves. His patience stretched to breaking point, Quinn requested the Sith's permission to execute the Moff, which was granted to him. After disposing of the body, Quinn learned from from universal chatter that the Imperials agreed to be better off without Broysc.
