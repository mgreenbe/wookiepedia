In a thread on the Jedi Council Forums on TheForce.Net, Fry clarified that the Five Veils' Tour trade route and the Five Veils Route were the same hyperlane and that the differing destinations were a result of tourism and shipping companies setting different endpoints."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
