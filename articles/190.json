As with most macrobinoculars, the 1000 contained an internal readout which provided information on distance and land elevation. It also came with low-light vision mode and could be stored in an impact resistant case. Other variants were produced, including the 1020/A, a handheld pair equipped with a long-range audio pickup unit, and a head-strapped model, the 1125."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
