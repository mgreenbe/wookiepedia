The ship sacrificed weaponry for the addition of droid automation; this lowered the amount of crewmen necessary to run the ship. In fact, this number was lowered so much that a single individual could pilot the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship was noted flying into and out of Hutt Space during the Empire's latter years, and was presumed to be owned or hired out by the Rebel Alliance. However, the craft's original owners abandoned the ship shortly after the termination of the Galactic Civil War for unknown reasons. The ship eventually ended up on an auction block to pay back outstanding fees."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
