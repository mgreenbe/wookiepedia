In exchange for hunting, the Rodians would have to pay a regular series of taxes to the Wookiees for continued use. Eventually, the location became an area regularly used by big game hunters of all species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The original treaty between the Wookiees and the Rodians was broken by the Galactic Empire when they came into power, who stripped the Wookiees of any ownership of the hunting grounds. In addition to that, they imposed a large fine on the Rodians for continued use of the hunting grounds, which they declared as Imperial controlled property. This did not deter the Rodians who accepted the increased fine to be allowed the chance to hunt. Chiss poachers were also sighted in this location which further antagonized the Wookiees as well as the Rodians. However, this did not stop the Empire from allowing the native environment to be destroyed by such hunters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hunter Ziven Tissak was one of four Rodians who had a stake in the Rodian Hunting Grounds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rodian Hunting Grounds appeared in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
