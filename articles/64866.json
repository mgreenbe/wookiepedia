When Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker infiltrated the lab, Count Dooku used the droids to attack the Jedi, though he managed to destroy all of them using his lightsaber. The failure of the unarmed droids to harm Skywalker was of no consequence to the count, who successfully captured him in the duel. In 19 BBY, many colorful lantern droids were part of Preigo's Traveling World of Wonder, and took part in the circus's performance for Hondo Ohnaka and his group of pirates on Florrum."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
