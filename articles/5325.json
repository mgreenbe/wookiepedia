At that time, Phylus Mon was trying to repair a Sith artifact known as the Darkstaff, the semi-sentient Darkstaff was modifying the galaxy around it, namely the ship, to its image, and a team sent by Jedi Master Lanius Qel-Bertuk opposed to some of Phylus Mon's activities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Darkstaff possessed Alianda to negotiate with Qel-Bertuk's team as a physical being. During the possession, Alianda's scleras turned pitch black and her voice turned raspy, disconcerting her/its opponents. When the Darkstaff decided that the negotiation was over, it simply abandoned Alianda's body. The shock of having had something that horrible inside of her could have been lethal for her, although it is unclear whether she survived or not."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alianda's voice during the possession is described as \"Imagine James Earl Jones, his throat lined with sandpaper\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
