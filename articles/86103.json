Mandalore the First's Taung warriors slew the indigenous mythosaurs and tamed the savage landscape, solidifying Mandalore's place as a powerbase and the center of Mandalorian space for millennia to come. Mandalore was covered in a rich natural landscape, largely unspoiled due to its sparse sentient population. The world was blanketed in lush veshok tree forests, dense jungle, sprawling hills and grassland well suited to farming, inhospitable deserts of white sand, and numerous rivers, lakes, and seas. It was also the only known world in the galaxy, with the exception of its moon Concordia, to possess the unique, nearly indestructible iron ore known as beskar, an element capable of withstanding blows from even a lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An independent world ruled by the Mand'alor\u2014the leader of all the Mandalorian clans, following the tradition established by Mandalore the First\u2014the planet Mandalore found itself the ally and enemy of numerous galactic governments and groups throughout the years.

With the rise of the pacifist New Mandalorian faction and their efforts to reform Mandalore's warrior ways, distancing themselves from the violent past after the disastrous events that lead to their formation, Mandalore was accepted by the Galactic Republic and was known as New Mandalore throughout the isolationist society that the New Mandalorians created. Originally neutral during the Clone Wars, after the New Mandalorian capital fell to the machinations of the Death Watch, the pacifist faction's influence dwindled.

It sat at the end of the hyperspace lane known as the Mandalorian Road, an ancient route that connected Mandalore with the planet Corsin in the Inner Rim. A terrestrial world spanning nine thousand, two hundred kilometers in diameter, Mandalore possessed standard gravity and two moons, including the one time mining base and agricultural center, Concordia. Unique to Mandalore and the Concordia moon was beskar iron ore, a nearly indestructible metal capable of withstanding blows from even a lightsaber, and used by Mandalorian metalsmiths to forge armor, weapons, and starships.

Native veshok trees covered much of Mandalore's northern hemisphere, such as the Olankur region of its northern continent, forming a dense forest that stretched nearly as far as the polar ice caps. Winters in the north of Mandalore often saw significant snowfall, and bitter cold temperatures. The herbivorous animals called shatuals could be found living within the veshok forests, as could the intelligent, six-legged strills that preyed upon them for food. Tall, long-lived galek trees with their silver-colored leaves were also a common sight on Mandalore, as were the golden amber ferns that grew in and around galek groves. Wild mushrooms were known to grow on and around Mandalore's trees, and a number of a serpentine rawl could be found in the Mandalorian wild, transplanted from their natural habitat on Naboo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Forty-five degrees north of Mandalore's equator, atop a flat granite hill nestled along a bend in the kilometers-long Kelita River, sat the city of Keldabe. Since at least 3960 BBY, Keldabe had served as the capital of Mandalore, and the center of government for much of Mandalorian space. However, following the foundation of the New Mandalorian faction, the reformist sect declared the domed city of Sundari, located in one of Mandalore's expansive and inhospitable white-sand desert regions, to be their capital. Positioned out on the flat desert plain, Sundari was constructed over a large, active beskar mine, surrounded by sand and the giant cube-cities built by the innovative builders of the New Mandalorian people who rejected the ways of Mandalore's warrior clans. Keldabe, however, found itself surrounded by woodland and the waters of the Kelita, along with gentle green hills that spread outward to fertile grassland the more agriculturally-minded Mandalorians took advantage of for farming. Keldabe boasted two of Mandalore's most renown landmarks, the hundred-meter-tall tower of the MandalMotors company headquarters, and the Oyu'baat hotel and tapcafe, one of the oldest establishments on the planet. With no formal palaces or offices among the warrior clans, the Oyu'baat was also an informal meeting place for the Mand'alor and clan chieftains, making it the unofficial center of Mandalore's clan-based government until 40 ABY, when this role was shared by the newly established community building, MandalMotors Hall."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Other cities and settlements littered Mandalore's surface, including the Keldabe suburb of Bralsin near the Kelita valley, and the small town of Shuror. Most of Mandalore's settlements were built within a heavy fortification that contributed to the ease with which they could be defended from potential invaders. An example of such a settlement was the hill-fort town of Norg Bral, home to several members of Clan Bralor. The water supply to these settlements was provided by lengths of pipelines and deeply-dug wells, often making use of both to ensure the certainty of available water. Further south and away from Keldabe, Mandalore's tropic regions boasted warmer weather and was where varos fruit could be found growing. Roads on Mandalore were rarely straight, designed so as to grant Mandalorians the advantage in ambushing and pinning down hostiles as they traveled. Traditional dwellings known as vheh'yaime\u2014made from wood, woven vines, and matted mud\u2014were a common choice for the homes of Mandalore's warrior clans and numerous vheh'yaime of varying sizes could be found across Mandalore. Due to the varied nature of the different species and backgrounds that comprised the greater Mandalorian people, the architecture of Mandalore differed greatly depending on the region and that area's particular inhabitants, from towers of transparisteel and granite, to durasteel, and even tree-bound abodes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mandalore was once a wild and savage world, uninhabited by sentients, where the dominate life forms were the gigantic mythosaurs.

Forced from the planet Coruscant in the Core Worlds long before the foundation of the Galactic Republic by the Human Battalions of Zhell, the Taung fled to Roon, before arriving at the Outer Rim world they came to call Mandalore circa 7000 BBY. In honor of their leader, Mandalore the First, the Taungs named the world Manda'yaim, or \"home of the Mand'alor,\" which was later transliterated as Mandalore in Galactic Basic Standard. Similarly, the Taungs recast themselves as the Mandalorians, or Mando'ade: \"sons and daughters of Mandalore.\" The newly branded Mandalorians set to taming their new world, and in the process slaughtered the enormous mythosaurs, leaving only their skeletons behind. Mandalore became the home of fierce clans of masked Taung warriors led by a single warlord who always adopted the name Mand'alor,\u2014a title which meant \"sole ruler\" in the Mando'a language\u2014after Mandalore the First. But a single new planet was not enough for the Mandalorian Taungs who craved fresh conquests, and though Mandalore remained the center of what was to become Mandalorian space, it was largely abandoned by the time of the Great Sith War in 3996 BBY, as Mandalore the Indomitable led the clans outward as Mandalorian Crusaders to bring new star systems under Mandalorian control."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attacks of the Crusaders only intensified as time passed, and though Mandalore the Indomitable fell in battle while engaging the Republic's military with the Brotherhood of the Sith Mandalore the Ultimate quickly replaced him.

There on the Mandalorian homeworld existed the unorthodox warrior sect known as the Neo-Crusaders. These warriors deviated from the Crusader norm by wearing identical suits of armor and implementing a more rigid chain of command. Following Fett's advice, Mandalore the Ultimate made the Neo-Crusaders the backbone of his new army, and by the time he had instigated the Mandalorian Wars with the Republic, Neo-Crusaders comprised most of Mandalore's warriors. As the Neo-Crusader army conquered more and more worlds, the planet Mandalore became the center of a Mandalore sector that stretched across the majority of the galaxy's northern quadrant. Mandalore the Ultimate's endeavors were doomed to failure, however, and when the Jedi Knight Revan slew the Mand'alor in single combat at Malachor V, the Mandalorian Wars were brought to a swift end. With no purpose, many defeated Mandalorians turned to lives as mercenaries, bounty hunters, and even bandits, while others returned home to Mandalore."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thousands of years later, during the period known to history as the Republic Dark Age, an epidemic of the Candorian plague spread across the galaxy. One of many worlds struck by the plague, Mandalore was devastated by the deadly illness. Furthermore, a weakened Mandalore sector had come under attack by raiders from the lawless regions of space that surrounded it to such a degree that Mandalorian vessels were forced to form defensive caravans in order to move about. When the veteran mercenary Aga Awaud returned home to Mandalore 1058 BBY to discover most of his clan had perished to the plague and Mandalorian space was under siege from outlaws, it wasn't long before he took up the then-vacant role of Mand'alor. In a move to stem the chaos before him, Awaud began a movement that came to be known as the Return, calling upon Mandalorians living throughout the galaxy to rally to the defense of Mandalorian space.

Unwilling to suffer through a second war with the Mandalorians, in 738 BBY the Jedi led a Republic strike force in a brief and overwhelming conflict known as the Mandalorian Excision that brought devastation to the Mandalore sector, and transformed parts of Mandalore into inhospitable deserts of white sand. Out of this disaster arose a pacifist sect calling themselves the New Mandalorians; the reformist political faction formed from the remnant of the pre-Excision peace movement renounced violence and the warrior codes of Mandalore's past, in what they believed to be an effort to save Mandalore and survive in a hostile galaxy. Instead, the New Mandalorians preached peace, neutrality, and tolerance.

In spite of this, a significant number of Mandalorians continued to live much as they had for generations, continuing their warrior traditions in locations such as Keldabe. These traditional practitioners came to be known as \"Old Mandalorians,\" the Aka'liit, or in some cases, the \"Mandalorian Faithful.\" Among many of the so-called Faithful, the New Mandalorians were, in turn, deemed the Faithless, for turning their backs upon the Mandalorians' cultural heritage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The year 60 BBY saw the ascension of Jaster Mereel to the role of Mand'alor. Born on the planet Concord Dawn, Mereel served as a member of the world's law officers known as the Journeyman Protectors until his strong moral code drove him to kill a corrupt superior officer; Mereel was exiled from Concord Dawn as punishment for his own crime, and joined the Mandalorian culture soon after. Having noticed many Mandalorians' dissatisfaction with the wide-spread savagery that had become prevalent in certain warrior circles, Mereel hoped to hold the Mandalorians to a higher standard of behavior. As Mand'alor, Mereel instituted the Supercommando Codex, a new behavioral guideline influenced by Mereel's own moral ideals, in which Mereel decreed that any Mandalorians who wished to fight would be merely highly-paid soldiers, and should conduct themselves as honorable mercenaries. Mereel was opposed in this effort by a number of amoral Mandalorians who resented Mereel for his attempts to rein in their lifestyles of unaccountability. These malcontents rallied to a barbaric Mandalorian soldier named Tor Vizsla, and therein formed a splinter group known as the Death Watch with Vizsla as their leader, a Secret Mandalore in opposition to Mereel, who pledged to destroy the New Mandalorian regime, and return the Mandalorians to their ancient roots as conquerors and raiders, with the ultimate goal of instigating another war of galactic conquest. Around this time, Chieftain Nam Beroya departed Mandalore with numerous members of Clan Awaud, having grown disillusioned with the divisive politics that were overtaking Mandalore, instead seeking a simpler way of life for him and his clan. Civil war soon broke out between the Death Watch and Mereel's loyal supercommandos\u2014now calling themselves the \"True Mandalorians\"\u2014while the New Mandalorians kept to their ideals of pacifism and non-violence, rejecting both groups and remaining out of the conflict."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In spite of its philosophical and ideological importance to the Mandalorian people, the war had was fought between two relatively small factions of soldiers, in what was seen by some as little more than a common power struggle.

He sent a Death Watch operative to attack a Republic cruiser, and disseminated rumors of Mandalore raising an army for the Confederacy, drawing the attention of the Jedi Council who dispatched Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi to Mandalore.

Trade routes to Mandalore were closed, leaving the world to its own resources without aid from the interstellar government, and forcing the New Mandalorian people to invest heavily in black market dealings in order to obtain much-needed supplies. This foray into the world of illegal goods had the unintended side effect of rampant greed and corruption spreading through the New Mandalorian government and police force. To help alleviate these tensions, Duchess Kryze invited Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala to Mandalore for a diplomatic visit to discuss the crisis. It was during Amidala's stay on Mandalore that the corruption within the New Mandalorian customs department allowed for a large number of New Mandalorian school children to be poisoned by slabin-laced tea that had been imported by smugglers.

Perhaps worst of all the issues plaguing Mandalore on its road to recovery were the food shortages that came as a result of the farmland that had been poisoned by the Vong, and the severely reduced population. These were two issues that were brought before a meeting of Mandalorian clan chieftains at MandalMotors Hall in Keldabe. Presiding over the gathering of clan leaders and corporate executives, Mand'alor Boba Fett agreed to an idea put forth by the Mandalorian soldier Graad to decree a recall of two million Mandalorians living offworld throughout the galaxy to return to Mandalore in order to bolster the population. The Carid clan took up the responsibility of allocating Mandalore's abandoned fallow farmland to any Mandalorian arrivals from offworld who wished to claim ownership.

The newly discovered beskar enabled the start of a new era of economic resurgence on Mandalore. When news of Mandalore's beskar discovery became publicly known, the Verpine of Roche declared their interest in purchasing an amount of the powerful metal, but also made mention of the Verpine hive's concerns about potential Mandalorian aggression while their representative Sass Sikili was in talks with Boba Fett. Fett was able to quell the Verpine's fears by offering a treaty between Mandalore and Roche, wherein a pact of nonaggression was made, and a mutual aid system was established: Mandalore would provide martial service and beskar iron, in exchange for exclusive Verpine technology, and access to Verpine technical facilities.
