Designed to be worn by cybernetically-enhanced humans, they communicated via high-frequency data streams transmitted from the central sensor and broadcasting dish in their faceplates. An arterial chemical shunt worn on the leg acted as a second heart, injecting a secret mixture of chemicals that boost a Guavian's speed and aggressiveness. Cybernetic armor made its user immune to a blaster's stun setting and allowed them to survive in a vacuum and underwater for up to ten minutes. Guavian security soldiers equipped with micro-grenade launchers wore a heavy variant of the armor that offered more protection."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Guavian Death Gang security soldier armor first appeared in the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens.
