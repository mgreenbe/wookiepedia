It could fire a large circular energy blast that could disable the power systems of entire fleets. The Subjugator-class heavy cruiser superweapon Malevolence was equipped with two mega-ion cannons, one each on the port and starboard. However, the Malevolence was destroyed when it crashed into the Dead Moon of Antar in the Prindaar system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, during the Galactic Civil War, the Chief of Rebel Intelligence for the Rebel Alliance, General Airen Cracken, wrote in a report to Commander-in-Chief Mon Mothma about Imperial weapons projects. In the report, he analyzed the mega-ion cannons on the Malevolence, and was curious as to why the Imperial Navy had not integrated it into its own armada."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
