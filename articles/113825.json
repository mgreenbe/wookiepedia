They were commanded by Captain Jace Dallin from the flagship Mersel Kebir, and had at least five other Dreadnaughts within the fleet. When the pro-Separatist Independent Provisional Government took power, Lieutenant Mellor Yago arrested Captain Jace Dallin aboard the flagship after he attempted to lead the fleet in defection to the Republic, along with the Jedi who had come, hoping to withdraw and join the Confederacy's forces\u2014with him in command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the help of the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Quinlan Vos and Republic Captain Jan Dodonna, Captain Dallin recaptured the command ship, turning the fire of the Home Defense Fleet on the Separatist ships that had joined the battle, winning a resounding victory for the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the incident gave Palpatine the pretext for placing the autonomous naval defense forces of Republic worlds under his executive command. The ships of the Rendili Home Defense Fleet were converted into dungeon ships, and shortly after the Declaration of a New Order, Jace Dallin had the dubious distinction of being the first Captain in the Imperial Navy to be summarily executed by Darth Vader for refusing to comply."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is unclear how many Dreadnaughts formed the Home Defense Fleet. Although Rendili is known to have had the industrial capacity to launch the two hundred Dreadnaughts of the Katana fleet a few years earlier, no scene in the Dreadnaughts of Rendili comic series shows more than six ships, and a Captain would be unlikely to serve as commander of a fleet of scores of Dreadnaughts. It may be that this single squadron was the entire battle line of the Home Defense Fleet, but it is nevertheless possible that this represented just a command element of a larger force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In The Dreadnaughts of Rendili, officers on the bridge of the Home Defense Fleet flagship wear a blue uniform with a padded leather collar covering the shoulders, and a decorative tabard. In The Stark Hyperspace War, however, Jace Dallin appears in scenes set in both 44 BBY and 30 BBY wearing a blue tunic and blue-gray breeches, apparently a variant of the standard lancer uniform worn by personnel of the Galactic Republic and later the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It may be that Dallin was at this time attached to the military forces answerable to the Judicial Department, but it is possible that what he wears is an undress variation of the Rendili uniform, comparable to the red tunic worn by Ranulph Tarkin, which Tarkin wears as a Senator prior to his formation of the Republic Navy, and which could be associated with the military of Eriadu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
