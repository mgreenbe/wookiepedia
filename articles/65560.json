The group reportedly had only about 700 men in service. The successful project was a joint operation between the Ubiqtorate of the Imperial Intelligence and the Imperial Navy to create mobile infantry that did not require the use of the Imperial Army. The navy's aim was to eliminate their dependency on the army to establish beachheads on targeted planets, as the SpecNav Force troopers would be the first on the battlefield and serve as an advance force. The Ubiqtorate aim was to have troopers with special training necessary to allow them to be assigned on a wide variety of missions. These elite troopers were trained at Base D8-Red base in the Ringali Nebula. They were typically organized into squads of ten. These troops were hazardous, in addition to be deceptively quiet, crafty, and skilled. They were apparently trained in some form of hand-to-hand combat in addition to other weaponry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Yavin, a Imperial SpecNav unit known as the Venom Guard was deployed by Moff Sakai of the Thuris sector to eliminate Reekeene's Roughnecks, an Alliance to Restore the Republic guerrilla unit.
