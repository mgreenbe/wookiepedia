Although only cousins, the two had a very good relationship, more like that of brother and sister. The Queen's cousin served the Republic during the Clone Wars and was a tactical officer aboard the Republic Navy starship Bespin Dancer. In 22 BBY, the Bespin Dancer engaged Separatist forces over the planet Falleen. During the battle, all Republic ships in the engagement were destroyed, including the Bespin Dancer. The destruction of the warship killed Organa's cousin, who was aboard the ship at the time. On the planet Coruscant, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi affirmed the destruction of the Bespin Dancer and the death of Organa's cousin when he spoke to Senator Bail Prestor Organa, the Queen's husband.
