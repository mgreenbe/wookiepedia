Xalto became close to G-3PO and re-named him Uncle Gee. When Xalto's father founded the Droid Abolitionist Movement, G-3PO remained loyal to his obsessed master, risking his own life. G-3PO was the very first droid infected with the emancipation virus created by Babalabbet Swoont and Sneerzick. With all of Sneerzick's other devotees, G-3PO was onboard the Argent Lady when its cargo hold of R5 units reacted to their strain of the emancipation virus and attacked the abolitionists. G-3PO was destroyed by a blaster during the firefight onboard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
