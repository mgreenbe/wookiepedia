The hunter's peers were amazed by his talents, and many believed he would go on to become a hunting legend. Not all of Harno's fellow hunters admired him however, and a rival named Neevat began spreading rumors that the hunter tranquilized all of his prey before killing them.

He would attempt to overcome any challenge he encountered, and constantly pushed himself to the edge. After fleeing from his homeworld he pledged that he would someday return with his reputation and honor restored, and For this purpose he kept trophies from his greatest kills for himself, hoping to one day to present them as proof of his worth to his kin back on Rodia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Harno took offence at the belief of some Rodians that hunting non-sentients was not honorable, although he would hunt other sentients if the situation presented itself, including bounty hunters who attempted to track him down, or in fact anyone who realized he was a wanted man.

He was detailed in an article titled Harno: Rogue Big Game Hunter, which was written by Eric Cagle and published on Wizards.com as part of the Bounty Postings series of articles. The article gives no specific time period of activity for Harno, as he was designed to be usable by players in any era of play. No specific meeting between harno and players is detailed, although it is suggested that they might either meet him while he is out hunting, try and track him down to claim the bounty on him, or be hired by him to help transport cargo before being hunted by him after discovering his identity. As these are simply adventure seeds this article does not assume any of them actually took place."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
