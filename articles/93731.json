During the Nihil\u2019s attack on the Republic Fair taking place in the city, the animals in the zoo broke free. The zoo\u2019s mudhorn soon charged Jedi Padawans Ram Jomaram and Lula Talisola, but Talisola used the Force to trip the animal. The mudhorn crashed sideways into the ground and slid into a storefront, causing it to shatter. The creature then stood and lumbered away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 9 ABY, a mudhorn encountered and fought Din Djarin, a Mandalorian bounty hunter, as the latter attempted to retrieve an egg from the mudhorn's cave.
