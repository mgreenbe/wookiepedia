The design dated back centuries to early Sith probe droid models based on schematics provided by Sith holocrons. The DRK-1 version featured a trio of imaging sensors: a central photoreceptor, a magnetic imaging device, and a thermal imager. An antenna atop the DRK-1's dome allowed its master to relay commands to the probot, programming it to seek out individuals or information. Data was then sent back to headquarters via the transmission antennae."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sith probe droids were designed as passive spy units, and were plated with energy-absorbing stealth armor that baffled most sensor scans. However, weaponry could be mounted on the DRK-1 in many configurations, the most common being a miniaturized grenade launcher. Armaments adopted by the Sith included blaster cannons, stun blasters, and dart launchers loaded with poison needles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "DRK-1 probe droids were commonly seen in the years prior to the Ruusan campaign. Darth Maul carried three DRK-1 probe droids aboard the Scimitar during his time as the apprentice of Darth Sidious. Maul recreated these spherical robots using the most disparate, off-the-shelf pieces. He also used his probots to spy on a Black Sun meeting on Ralltiir, and later used them to track down Qui-Gon Jinn on Tatooine, where the Jedi struck down one of the spying probes. The act resulted in a misunderstanding that cost the life of Pa'lowick pilot Aneesa Dym at the hands of Maul."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Maul's presumed death at the hands of Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Sith Infiltrator, presumably along with the last two remaining probe droids, was taken into custody on Naboo by the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The DRK-1 closely resembled the R-1 recon droid, which were used by snipers from the Invasion of Naboo to the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, many bounty hunters found droids of this model very useful and effective in tracking their prey throughout the galaxy.
