A T-14 generator was used in the Naboo Royal Starship, as internally it was a modified J-type 327 Nubian, that served as the vessel of Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala on Naboo. After escaping from Naboo during the Trade Federation's occupation of the planet, the ship landed on Tatooine to repair its hyperdrive generator. Watto, a Toydarian junk dealer, sold a T-14 in his shop, which Qui-Gon Jinn later won in a podracing bet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
