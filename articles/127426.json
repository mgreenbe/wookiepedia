The Master of Ceremonies sold it on Carrick Station and Vaiken Spacedock. It had bells which jingled when the speeder moved and parcels in the back. Largely because of this, the Sith Empire also banned the vehicle and issued strict warnings to evade if possible should they speed by partly due to them believing from the noise of the bells that the parcels and Life Day paraphernalia might contain explosives, and overall due to Imperial disdain for the holiday."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
