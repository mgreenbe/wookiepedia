During the ensuing insurgent attack on Imperial troops, \u00cemwe came to Erso and Andor's aid and defeated a group of stormtroopers, leading Malbus to shoot several more troopers in order to protect his blind comrade. The two friends and their Rebel acquaintances were subsequently captured and taken to the Catacombs of Cadera by Saw Gerrera's followers. Imprisoned with Andor while Jyn spoke with Gerrera, Andor recognized the Imperial defector Bodhi Rook, whom he had been tasked with locating. When the Death Star obliterated NiJedha, Andor managed to free Malbus along with \u00cemwe, telling Malbus to free Rook as he left to locate Jyn.

The assignment led to a firefight between Imperial and Alliance forces, resulting in the death of the elder Erso.

In spite of the Alliance leadership's unwillingness to act, Erso was joined by Malbus, \u00cemwe, and a group of soldiers in an unsanctioned mission to Scarif. The newly formed Rogue One successfully infiltrated the Imperial stronghold, but were forced to fight a battle against the planet's garrison while Erso and Andor searched for the plans in the Imperial security complex. During the battle, Malbus and his squad fired on the garrison that was deployed to combat them before fleeing from a All Terrain Armored Cargo Transport. Malbus would later fire on the walker but failed to bring it down. However, the transport was then destroyed by a T-65B X-wing starfighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the battle wore on and their squad suffered heavy losses, Malbus and the others were tasked with helping Rook make contact with the Alliance Fleet. \u00cemwe sacrificed his life to help deactivate the planetary deflector shield to allow the signal through, causing Malbus to begin repeating his good friend's mantra. After witnessing the explosion of SW-0608 in the distance, Malbus proceeded to kill several death troopers, maintaining the offensive and ultimately gunning them all down. Malbus himself was later killed by a grenade from a fallen trooper, but before he died, Malbus was able to glance at Chirrut's body for one last time.
