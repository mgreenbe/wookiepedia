Chemical thrust engines were an old concept for spacedrives, and left a superheated trail in its wake that could be easily picked up by sensors for hours after the ship had made its transit. Baffled drives overcame this problem by using supercooled gases and thrust modules to scatter the exhaust to leave as small a wake as possible. While inefficient, vessels using baffled drives were harder to detect. Rendili StarDrive manufactured the WhisperThrust Engine during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
