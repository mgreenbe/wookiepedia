He supplied a number of nobles on the planet Procopia with illegal weapons and exotic items, and as such they encouraged customs officials on the planet to overlook his activity. Since Hailbrock kept a low profile, most officials were happy to leave him alone. He sympathized with the Alliance during the war and provided Rebel cells in the Tapani sector with weaponry and armor at great personal risk, as if his ties to the Alliance were revealed his career would have quickly been over."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jan Hailbrock first appeared as a possible ally for Rebel heroes in the campaign guide included in Lords of the Expanse, a 1997 supplement to Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game by West End Games.
