In 1 ABY, during the Galactic Civil War, former Baron Administrator Dominic Raynor, who had gambled away the city in a game of sabacc against Calrissian, hired the bounty hunter Bossk to hunt down the new Administrator because he believed that Calrissian had cheated in order to win their game."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bossk brought a band of mercenaries and cutthroats\u2014a Twi'lek scoundrel, another scoundrel of the same species, a Duro mercenary, and a Quarren assassin\u2014to the city and set a trap for Calrissian. Impersonating the city's chief engineer, the bounty hunter reported that a primary repulsorlift pod was about to break down\u2014a failure that would drop the floating city into the gas giant's molten core.
