One of the Geonosian guards attempted to direct it with a stun rod, but it, upon being shocked, pounced the guard, evidentially being fed up with the shock, and mauled him to death, before other Geonosians recovered the guard's corpse. The three manage to escape from their chains and fight back against the creatures. The nexu wounded Senator Amidala (who had climbed up a pole earlier) but she was able to knock the nexu off the perch she is on and onto the ground. The impact of the fall temporarily knocked it out, although it regained consciousness, and was about to strike again when Skywalker, riding his newly tamed reek, head-butted into the nexu and killed it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}]}
