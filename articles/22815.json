Along with a band of mercenaries of the Klatooinan Trade Guild, Calliose agreed to join the Barabel in return for a share of the bounty. He planned to have Skahtul and her Barabel comrades secretly killed during the battle on Kothlis; instructing his mercenaries to fire at Skahtul's men instead of Skywalker's forces. Skahtul discovered the plot and ambushed Calliose, capturing him and bringing him back to the Klatooinian Guild for a bounty on his own head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
