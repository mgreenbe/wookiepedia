Landing on the plains of Geonosis, this Twi'lek and the other two hundred-some Jedi stormed the Petranaki arena and fought against the Separatist Droid Army in an attempt to free the captives. While the battle was counted as a victory for the Republic, the Jedi lost the majority their original force, except for a few dozen.
