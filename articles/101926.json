Primarily featuring marine animals that inhabited the swamps and undersea trenches of Naboo, the zoo also kept terrestrial beasts and avian species. Each species of creature was kept in a custom habitat where a small holodisplay presented information on the animal so that visitors might learn and visualize how the animal behaved in the wild."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maintained by highly trained keepers, such as Yr'Apaly Omin, the ZRF was a secure area, with its own security. Containing a research institute that investigated all manner of scientific inquiry, marine scientists, biologists, and researchers milled about the ZRF on a daily basis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime before the Invasion of Naboo, Jar Jar Binks accidentally deactivated half of the bubbles containing the wildlife. Releasing several animals from the zoo into the city caused a major commotion and upset Boss Rugor Nass, who sentenced Binks to six months of hard labor in the Quarry penal colony."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
