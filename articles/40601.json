It was published on the Wizards of the Coast website on July 1, 2004 and took the form of a paper written by San Herrera and Nia Reston entitled \"Droid Rights.\" Its thesis was that droids are sentient and deserve freedom. The authors, therefore, called on the owning of droids or \"synthetic persons\" to be outlawed throughout the Galactic Republic. They sent their paper as a press release to every news agency and government office in the Cularin system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
