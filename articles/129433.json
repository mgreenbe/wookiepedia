The repulsorcraft was large in comparison to typical landspeeders and speeder bikes, and models included the A-A4B truckspeeder owned by Moloch, as well as the A-A5 Speeder Truck used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Truckspeeders were known for having stronger antigravity generators than the typical landspeeder, but were lacking in acceleration."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When escaping from Imperial scout troopers on Lothal alongside the bounty hunter Bossk with a speeder bike, Ezra Bridger drove into a tunnel in the opposite direction, necessitating him to evade a sanitation repulsortruck amongst other repulsorlift vehicles. Further down the tunnel, Bridger encountered a wide and tall repulsortruck that forced him to swing his speeder close to the tunnel's ceiling to avoid being hit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The speeder truck first appeared in canon in the 2014 junior novel Ezra's Gamble, written by Ryder Windham."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
