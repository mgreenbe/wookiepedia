These small wedge-shaped craft used combination repulsorlift/ion afterburners to achieve supersonic speeds, while sophisticated vector controls and atmospheric streamlining gave them incredible maneuverability. Many variants of Conjo fighters existed, including ground attack, air superiority and trainer models."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were three squadrons of Conjo fighters in the G'rho Defense Force.
