Vich ascended to the position at a young age, and was still considered young when the Empire revealed itself to the greater galaxy and initiated a massive war with the Galactic Republic. Shortly after the beginning of the conflict, Darth Vich discovered the planet Rattatak and its warlike inhabitants. He took hundreds of Rattataki tribes from the world and transformed them into his personal army, which he later attempted to use in an effort to take power in the Empire.

At a young age, Vich was promoted to the rank of Sith Lord, and he served under the Empire's ruling Dark Council in that capacity until at least 3681 BBY.

The Sith Lord was intrigued by its inhabitants, the Rattataki, who had become a fierce warrior people after generations of infighting and countless struggles for survival on the bleak world. Recognizing their potential, Vich took hundreds of Rattataki tribes from the world and reorganized them into his personal army. His forces were formidable opponents in battle, and he eventually discovered that dozens of his soldiers were sensitive to the Force. Vich took the Force-sensitive Rattataki and trained them as Sith Acolytes to operate under his command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vich eventually grew ambitious for more authority in the Empire, and so used his Rattataki army in a play for power that ultimately failed. Following the attempt, Vich's army was disbanded, with the surviving Rattataki being either executed or enslaved by the Dark Council.
