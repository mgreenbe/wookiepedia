It maintained a headquarters in Lothal's Capital City. While searching the Imperial data network for Zare Leonis' missing sister Dhara Leonis, the young slicer Merei Spanjaf infiltrated the Transportation Ministry's headquarters disguised as a Phelarion School student doing fundraising. She managed to plant three snooper programs in the building which enabled her to hack into the entire Imperial data network on Lothal.
