The officer informed Omega that she was not authorized to be there, and ordered the other clones to pack up the squad's gear. Afterward, the officer stated that Omega was going to go with him and grabbed her, but AZI intervened by grabbing the officer's arm and stated that as medical personnel, they would not follow the officer. The shock trooper officer then told the droid not to touch him, and stunned AZI, shutting it down.
