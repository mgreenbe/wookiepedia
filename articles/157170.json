While accompanying Darth Vader on a mission to the planet, the assassin droids 0-0-0 and BT-1 encountered the protocol droid. Triple-Zero asked the droid if it could help them get through a door, but it told them that only droids with the correct clearance codes were allowed to enter the palace grounds. As the droid walked away, Beetee suggested torturing it, which Triple-Zero refused, stating that he did not torture droids. However, this gave him an idea, and he lured the protocol droid into an empty room. When the droid entered, Triple-Zero disabled its pain receptors and stripped its data core, using it to open the door."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
