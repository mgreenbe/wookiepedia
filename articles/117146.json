In 22 BBY, Ronto, alongside fellow pilot \"Skifter\", were dispatched from their home world to the Arkanis Sector to take part in the First Battle of Geonosis. After arriving on the planet in an Acclamator-class assault ship, Ronto's LAAT/i began its transport run towards the Im'g'twe Hills to drop off a platoon of clone troopers. Before they could reach their destination however, Ronto's gunship came under attack by a group of Nantex-class fighters. Ronto managed to destroy a handful of these ships, which allowed the LAAT/i to safely land with only slight damage to its back quarter. For the rest of the battle, Ronto kept unloading platoons of clone troopers and shooting down Geonosian fighters, until he eventually headed back to his Acclamator once the battle had reached its conclusion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A clone of Jango Fett, Ronto stood at a height of 1.83 meters. Being a clone pilot during the phase 1 era of the Clone Wars, Ronto wore specialized clone trooper armor equipped with a box attached to the chest plate which supplied his helmet with oxygen.

On May 6th 2014, A Soldier's Story: I was a Gunship Pilot was brought back in the form of one of the many cut stories from The Essential Guide to Warfare, in the eight issue of the StarWars.com blog Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare Author's Cut, Part 8: Tales of the Clone Wars. In this blog, Jason Fry and Erich Schoeneweiss explain that the story was too familiar to Clone Trooper Falls in a Hole..., which is why it was cut."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
