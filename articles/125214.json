The planet was destroyed by a cataclysm, and the native Sibilaari survived by creating hardened shelters on the most stable parts of the planet's crust. When the planet was destroyed, the chunks of crust were flung out into space, carrying the shelters with dormant Sibilaari safely inside."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
