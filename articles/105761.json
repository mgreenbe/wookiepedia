Despite being in the wrong latitude, plants thrived there, and crab-harps were constantly walking around to provide music. Holy relics were stored opposite of temples dedicated to the Gods. Prior to the Defense of Mon Calamari, the Yuuzhan Vong attempted to sacrifice one thousand prisoners to the Gods to invoke their favor.
