The Laser Master's last words remained in Canonhaus' mind as his Imperial Star Destroyer traversed the Hoth asteroid belt as part of Death Squadron in 3 ABY, hoping that none of the asteroid fragments would penetrate his ship's deflector shields. However, during Canonhaus' holographic meeting with Darth Vader and other Death Squadron commanding officers, an asteroid flew into Canonhaus' Star Destroyer, obliterating its bridge and killing the officer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Laser Masters was mentioned in the short story \"The Final Order,\" written by Seth Dickinson and published in 2020 as part of the book From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back.
