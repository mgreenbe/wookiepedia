First created after a failed assassination attempt in 3950 BBY, the Voice allowed the Emperor to protect his true form as a Force entity while still delivering commands to his servants and carrying out his will. The Emperor utilized many Voices of different species, genders, and ages throughout his lifetime, transferring his consciousness and powers from body to body as his hosts succumbed to the ravaging effects of the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Galactic War ignited between the Empire and the Galactic Republic in 3642 BBY, the Dark Councilor Darth Baras began a coup years in the making as he attempted to take the place of the Voice and thereby become the supreme authority within the Empire. Trapping the true Voice on the planet of Voss with the aid of the dark entity Sel-Makor, Baras secured his power base and proclaimed himself to be the Voice of the Emperor before the Dark Council. However, Baras' former apprentice and the newly-appointed Emperor's Wrath killed the true Voice in order to free the Emperor's essence and struck down Baras for his transgression. The Emperor's next Voice would fall in battle with the prodigal Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython, forcing the Emperor's essence into hiding and abolishing the post of Emperor's Voice while his essence healed. While not a true Voice in terms of its place in the Sith Empire, the body of the Human Valkorion had served as the Emperor's second body for centuries, ruling over the Eternal Empire of the planet Zakuul even as he controlled the Sith Empire through his Voice.

The host's mind was completely suppressed, crushed beneath the weight of the Emperor's mind, and their body literally became the Sith's own. The process also conferred the Emperor's immense strength in the Force upon the Voice, though his abilities could be bolstered by the host's own powers\u2014the Emperor utilized a Voss Mystic as his Voice during the Cold War in order to take advantage of the Voss' prophetic abilities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the host Voice died, the Emperor's essence was released from the body and returned to the care of his Hand\u2014the twelve Servants who carried out their master's will across the galaxy. Servant Two, a member of the Emperor's Hand, was mentally linked to the Emperor more so than all of his other agents, and as a result, the prophetic Servant was always aware of the Voice's presence and location even when the Emperor was dormant. Upon receiving their master's essence, the Hand would procure a new Voice for the Emperor and aid him in establishing control of the host body. Unbeknownst to all but the Hand, Vitiate\u2014as the Sith Emperor was once again known as after splitting with the Sith Empire near the end of his life\u2014also had a second host body that he controlled simultaneously with the Voice: the Human Valkorion, whose form he used to rule the Eternal Empire of the planet Zakuul for centuries."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A new empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Emperor created his first Voice around 3950 BBY, after a failed attack by the Jedi Master Revan and his allies brought the Emperor's body within arms' reach of harm. The Emperor took Revan captive and imprisoned him, but the Emperor\u2014who feared only death\u2014was terrified by the close brush with death. As a result, the Empire's supreme ruler delved into further studies of the dark side in order to preserve his physical form\u2014a body that had been rendered ageless but not invulnerable by the dark ritual the Emperor had performed over a thousand years earlier.

Serving as the focal point of the Emperor's energies, the Voice allowed his consciousness to reach out across the galaxy to direct his agents and observe his enemies. Among the beings that the Emperor used were a young female Human and an elderly Sith pureblood, and during the early years of the Great Galactic War with the Galactic Republic, the position of Voice was filled by a male Human. The Dark Council and the rest of the Sith Empire were unaware, however, that the Voice was not the only host of their ruler\u2014growing tired of the galaxy and the Sith teachings that limited him, the Emperor established a new kingdom\u2014an Eternal Empire based on the planet Zakuul in Wild Space\u2014and ruled over it through a host body named Valkorion. Unlike the Voices, the Emperor ensured that the Valkorion body survived for centuries, sparing it the ravaging effects of the dark side. The Emperor split his consciousness and focus between the two Empires, but gradually abandoned the Sith Empire as time went on and invested more of his attentions to Zakuul."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Plans for immortality"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 3645 BBY, the planet of Voss was discovered by the Empire, and the Emperor was intrigued by the prophetic abilities of the native species.

Before the Emperor could reach out to his Hand and explain Baras' betrayal, Sel-Makor seized control of the Voice and began to battle the Emperor for control of both his host and the Sith's own powers in the Force. With the true Voice out of the way, Baras began his attempt to proclaim himself the Voice, betraying his apprentice in the process. However, acting on the fragments of instructions that the Emperor was able to send them during his struggle, the Hand appointed Baras' apprentice the newest Emperor's Wrath and unleashed the Sith Warrior upon Baras' allies. The Wrath eventually located the true Voice on Voss, and after defeating it in battle when Sel-Makor seized control of the body, the Wrath was ordered to kill the Voss host in order to free the Emperor's essence.

Forced from their host, the Emperor's energies were left without an anchor and fell into a deep slumber at the shock of the blow.

Shortly afterward, the Yavin Coalition, a joint task force between the Empire and the Republic that aimed to stop Vitiate's plans, then found Valkorion, who was slain in the ensuing confrontation. Vitiate was thus forced to bond himself to the Outlander, leader of the Yavin Coalition, although he sought to ally with the Outlander and did not make his new host into a true Voice.
