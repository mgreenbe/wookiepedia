The two droids were present on the Bridge of the ship as Grievous gloated over the captured Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin Skywalker. Skywalker's astromech, R2-D2, was able to distract those on the bridge for Kenobi to use the force take his lightsaber back from Grievous, with Skywalker taking his back afterwards. Grievous ordered the droids to attack, with IG-101 focusing Kenobi, and IG-102 focusing on Skywalker. 102 was able to press Skywalker for a while, but the Jedi managed to find an opening in his defense and cut the droid in half at the waist, destroying it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
