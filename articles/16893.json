It was designed to pull hot air from the lower levels of the planet's massive city and disperse it throughout the upper levels. However, it was also used as a traffic interchange for many skylanes. The center of the Big Snarl was restricted because of its strong air currents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
