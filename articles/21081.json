He accompanied Darth Vader and a team of snowtroopers to Tython, following a lead regarding the Rebel Alliance base provided by Doctor Chelli Aphra. Though Bryce was unsure of Aphra's claim, as their fleet's scans detected no trace of a base in the area, Vader instructed the colonel to conduct scans of the Martyrium of Frozen Tears. Aphra, who had intentionally led Vader away from the true base on Hoth, turned on the Imperial forces. Vader ordered Bryce to withdraw, but the colonel and his snowtroopers were killed by the assassin droid 0-0-0, who slashed Bryce with the blades mounted on his hand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bryce was created for the 2019 comic Doctor Aphra 40, written by Simon Spurrier.
