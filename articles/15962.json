Ships working for the criminal empire would be emblazoned with the Bellixan logo in order to divert attention from their cargo. The ship's manifest would often be falsified to show that their cargo consisted of soil samples or other mundane items; weapons would be shipped as survey equipment. The organization did indeed engage in some legitimate scouting, using its own scouting ships and treating its employees fairly. This small portion of the organization was dwarfed by the amount of smuggling that was done under the company's logo, however. During the Galactic Civil War, Bellixan ships smuggling cargo were favored targets of the Rebellion. The organization did not survive the death of Prince Xizor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
