In 3640 BBY, he and General Grann were stationed on Corellia where they led their Imperial forces to take Guardian Hold Four with the assistance of the Children of the Emperor. However, the Barsen'thor and the Rift Alliance were able to reclaim the base and defeat both the Imperial Guard and the Child of the Emperor stationed there, Daresha. Both generals were captured, though Merion refused to cooperate with his captors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point during the Battle of Corellia, he and his compatriot General Grann took command of Guardian Hold Four after it was compromised from within by Corporal Daresha, secretly a Child of the Emperor. However, he and Grann did not have much time to consolidate their holding before it came under attack from the current Barsen'thor and his forces. Balmorran droids under the Barsen'thor's command sabotaged the Guardian Hold's security, while a team of Voss commandos and the Barsen'thor himself breached the compound."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grann, Merion, and Daresha were in the Guardian Hold's conference room when the Barsen'thor arrived.

Grann and Merion were captured by Republic forces shortly thereafter. Grann chose to cooperate with the Republic, despite Merion's protests, and revealed that the First Son may have hidden himself in Guardian Hold One with the remnants of the Corellian Council. The Barsen'thor left to pursue the First Son, and Grann and Merion were escorted into custody."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
