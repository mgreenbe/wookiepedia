Collected by an agent of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine during a humanitarian mission to Aleen, the dram was lost when the agent mysteriously vanished. The vial was kept by the Aleena mystics that maintained the Great Seal, and kept within one of the colossi that dotted the planet's surface, revering it as sacred and using it occasionally in their healing rituals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
