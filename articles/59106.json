After his service at Echo Base ended in 3 ABY, Alliance to Restore the Republic historian Voren Na'al visited the library, compiling a good deal of background information on the Hoth system and on the geography of Hoth for his records. Shortly after the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Na'al was dispatched to Halowan in order to infiltrate the Imperial data storage facilities and attempt to compile a report on the Imperial command structure at Endor. Na'al deceived Imperial security forces into allowing him access to restricted files by posing as a special agent of Fakir sector Moff Lorin. After one day of research, Na'al had finished his report and rejoined the Alliance Fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The PC game Star Wars: Rebellion mistakenly places the Fakir Sector and, consequently, Halowan, in the Galactic Core."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
