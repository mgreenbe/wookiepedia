Pendon operated as a pirate during the Galactic Civil War, leading a fleet from his CR90 corvette Safonne's Sword. His forces included the Ithorian Venithon Twins, several heavily-modified light freighters, two DP20 frigates, and a GAT-12 Skipray Blastboat. Pendon's base of operations were located in the Mieru'kar sector, on the icy planet of Seltaya Major. He discovered the world after a failed raid against an Imperial Star Galleon-class frigate. During the height of the Galactic Empire, Pendon sold the merchandise he plundered to other criminal elements, and on occasion, the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pendon's organization was big enough to rival with the Hy'thor pirate group. Due to this, on 2 ABY, Hy'thor leader Ompiach sent some of his pirates (including the Venithon Twins) to negotiate a treaty with Pendon. Unfortunately, the meeting became a naval battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the battle, the crossfire damaged a Rebel freighter with a valuable cargo.

Starting in 6 ABY, Pendon began targeting New Republic starships, and each time overwhelming pirate forces forced the surrender of New Republic ships. The New Republic posted a reward of 12,500 credits for Pendon's capture on the charges of piracy, theft, and sabotage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Safonne Pendon was a Rodian male who was 1.75 meters tall.
