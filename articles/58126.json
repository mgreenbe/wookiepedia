Individuals engaging in this practice used slings to throw off balls of liquid paint and color various objects, including dancing astromech droids. The Gungan performers grew their natural \"paint balls\" in their underwater city of Otoh Gunga. In 32 BBY, four members of the Gungan Sling Brigade made a demonstration of this art in the Theed Coliseum, to honor the victory of the unified peoples of Naboo\u2014Gungans and Human inhabitants\u2014against the Trade Federation's invasion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The painting of dancing droids with slings was one of the six activities featured in Star Wars: Early Learning Activity Center, a children's video game released in 2000 by Lucas Learning."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
