RA-7 protocol droid 4A-2R was a valued member of the gang."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the gang managed to operate during the Clone Wars, it was dissolved during the Galactic Empire's rise. During the Imperial Era, Ohnaka continued to work, but he was now only a small-time pirate and smuggler.

After Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala asked that two Jedi confirm that his gang did have Dooku, Ohnaka demanded they arrive unarmed. When Obi-Wan Kenobi and Skywalker arrived, Ohnaka and his gang checked for weapons. Despite Skywalker's attempt to reclaim his lightsaber, Ohnaka and his gang took them to see Dooku. After reporting Dooku's capture, the gang invited the Jedi to a banquet. The Pirates were able to drug Kenobi and Skywalker and tied them with up with Dooku.

During the time, Ohnaka and his gang were able to prevent, Kenobi, Skywalker, and Dooku from escaping. Falso and his men were able to steal the ransom, but lost it when Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks and Commander Stone's escort retrieved. Falso told Ohnaka about this, saying the Republic was attacking with an army and would give them the ransom.

Kenobi and Skywalker were able to retrieve their lightsabers and take Ohnaka hostage. During this time, Dooku was able to sneak away. Dooku strangled Falso and forced him to shoot Mentir, who were also trying to leave the compound, and escaped on a pirate ship. As Kenobi and Skywalker made their way to the Twilight with Ohnaka, they were joined by Binks and Stone's troops. Ohnaka was released and in return they were allowed to leave.

Ohnaka and his men allowed Master Plo Koon and Padawan Tano to land. When Sing escaped, Ohnaka and his men allowed Tano to take one of their bikes to pursue her.

Shortly afterward, General Grievous and an army of battle droids, seeking revenge for Ohnaka's capture of Dooku earlier in the war, arrived on Florrum, forcing the pirates and Jedi to band together to fight their common enemy. Though Ohnaka, accompanied by several of his pirates, the Jedi, R2-D2, and Professor Huyang, escaped the planet aboard the Slave I, allowing him to return the Jedi and their droids to a Republic task force and unsuccessfully attempt to barter with Kenobi, Grievous's attack left the pirate operation in ruins."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, self-proclaimed Sith Lords Maul and Savage Opress arrived.

Though Gallia was killed during the fighting by Oppress, the rogue pirates rejoined Ohnaka after they were trapped at gunpoint, with the captain explaining that the Sith were only interested in Kenobi. With his gang reunified, Ohnaka and his pirates fired on the two dark side adepts as they fled, even bringing down their YV-865 Aurore-class freighter with a rocket launcher. As his men scoured the cargo from the Sith Lords' transport, Ohnaka was left with the impression that the two Force-sensitives had been killed, though Kenobi correctly assumed they had survived."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after the Galactic Empire's formation, the Ohnaka Gang was broken up.
