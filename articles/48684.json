Formed from the Imperial Army of the Galactic Empire, it was responsible for maintaining order throughout First Order space as well as the gradual conquest and colonization of the Unknown Regions. In order to quickly and efficiently raise a capable army, the First Order abandoned the practices of the Galactic Empire, trading volunteer conscripts for the kidnapping and indoctrination of infants throughout the galaxy. The Unknown Regions provided a safe haven for the hermit state to effectively train and mobilize an army of fierce Stormtroopers with a zealous loyalty to their Supreme Leader. From 29 ABY to 34 ABY, the ground forces of the First Order would often engage in skirmishes against the Resistance, a private military organization founded by General Leia Organa which rejected the complacency of the New Republic. However, upon the decapitation of the Republic's Galactic Senate during the Hosnian Cataclysm, Supreme Leader Snoke unleashed his legions upon the galaxy, seizing military control of all major star systems within weeks of the initial invasion. As the galactic siege progressed, Snoke's disciple, the dark warrior Kylo Ren, eventually assassinated the Supreme Leader, usurping both military and political control of the First Order. Supreme Leader Ren then personally spearheaded his year-long campaign against the galaxy, offering neither pity nor mercy to worlds that dared to resist his rule."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Origins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the defeat of the Galactic Empire at the Battle of Jakku and its surrender with the signing of the Galactic Concordance, the First Order and its military eventually formed in the Unknown Regions where it plotted its eventual return to power.
