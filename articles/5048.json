During the Imperial Era, Viceroy Bail Organa and his rebel agents, including his daughter Leia Organa, often sent out ships from the fleet to supply rebel cells by having them be attacked and stolen by the rebels. The Alderaanian fleet eventually became part of the larger Alliance Fleet of the Rebel Alliance, with the Tantive IV being part of the naval force by the Battle of Scarif. The Alderaanian fleet's security force, the Alderaanian consular security, crewed other vessels of the Alliance Fleet, such as the MC75 Star Cruiser Profundity and the RHA Consonance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
