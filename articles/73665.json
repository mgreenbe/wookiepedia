Kallerans were tall and flexible; their hands and feet had three prehensile digits on each, which led Kallerans to avoid wearing shoes or boots. The majority of Kallerans had green skin patterned with distinctive black stripes. The species had dense muscles that assisted them in the protection of their otherwise delicate bodies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kalleran head was distinguished by fin-like folds on the tops and sides of their faces. These fins augmented a Kalleran's hearing, allowing sound to bounce back and be picked up by the two antennae crowning their head. These antenna were sensory organs that served as olfactory and aural receptors, and a contributing factor in the Kalleran language."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kallerans had lungs adapted to breathe above water, though the majority of their respiration was done through their skin. A holdover from their amphibious past, their skin could draw oxygen in from the air and filter out carbon dioxide. Their respiratory system required them to consume more water than other species their size to keep their skin moist and supple. Because they did not primarily breathe through their mouths, Kallerans did not evolve noses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Above all else, Kalleran's valued personal achievement over collective accomplishments. Because of this, the people of Kaller had never united to form great societies or participate in galactic affairs. Much of the cultural expansion on Kaller was brought by colonists, both friendly and violent, who had settled the world over the course of millennia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kallerans developed a functioning civilization on Kaller, but due to their cultural beliefs of individualism, had never expanded beyond their own homeworld. Several extraplanetary groups had visited Kaller during the time of the Galactic Republic, and formed headquarters and colonies across the world, including the Mandalorians and the Pykes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the High Republic Era, Larep Reza, a Kalleran served as Vice Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, under Chancellor Lina Soh."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Separatists took control of Kaller and began pressuring their villages for workers and supplies. Separatist General Kleeve and his staff billeted on the world at the expense of a Kalleran named Gamut Key. Republic forces eventually began fighting the Separatists for control of the Kallerans' homeworld, and under the command of Jedi Master Depa Billaba and her Padawan Caleb Dume successfully defeated Separatist forces, causing Kleeve to flee. Billaba and some her men visited Key after the end of the battle and told them they need not worry about the Separatist forces any more. Key and the other Kallerans however were not sure that there was any difference between the Republic or Separatist forces occupying their planet. Janus Kasmir, another Kalleran, informed the Jedi of this, and after Dume became angry Billaba informed the Kallerans that the Republic forces would sleep in nearby fields in order not to billet at the Kallerans' expense."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kallerans first appeared in Kanan 1, a comic book written by Greg Weisman, illustrated by Pepe Larraz and published in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
