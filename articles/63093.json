Standing on six large, clawed legs, they had three heads with six eyes on long necks, with large mouths with gnashing teeth, and a long, spiny tail. They could breath noxious gases, and were native to their homeworld's extensive jungles. During the High Republic Era, several hragscythes were kept in the zoo of Lonisa City on Valo. Before the Republic Fair began, Jedi Master Elzar Mann visited the zoo and observed the hragscythes. A Nihil attack on the city let the creatures loose, one exiting through the zoo's front entrance and destroying the gate. It ate several pirates, and Jedi Padawans Lula Talisola and Ram Jomaram encountered and avoided the creature in the chaos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another or possibly the same hragscythe mauled Mantessa Chekkat when she and her daughter Klerin Chekkat had left their bodyguard Ty Yorrick during the chaos caused by the Nihil. Mann tried to calm the creature, but his own destructive acts earlier made the predator see him as a threat. Luckily, Yorrick returned to the fight and was forced to kill the hragscythe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hragscythes debuted simultaneously in The High Republic: Race to Crashpoint Tower, a novel by Daniel Jos\u00e9 Older, and The High Republic: The Rising Storm, a novel by Cavan Scott, both of which were released on June 29, 2021."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
