A red giant near the end of its life, it exploded as a supernova, destroying the system during the Galactic Civil War. In 22 BBY, the star was analyzed by scientists at the University of Sanbra, with the findings released 13:3:14. Cosmology Professor Deakis Ronse explained that they found Demophon to have chromospheric instabilities and spectrographic readings of iron and carbon ejecta. Its life expectancy was deemed short, to end in a supernova within the century (50 to 75 standard years). It unfortunately went supernova far before that timeframe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
