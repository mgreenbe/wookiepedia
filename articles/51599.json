As expert welding could turn a piece of salvage from unsaleable junk to a profitable find, he offered his services in Niima as a welder to scavengers in exchange for inert gas canisters, filler metals, good jokes, or a power recharge. The droid and his mechanical colleague EGL-21 could sometimes be spotted in the shade trading jokes that their customers had brought them. He was equipped with a plasma arc welder torch, brown plating, and a shielded faceplate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "GTAW-74 first appeared as a minor background character in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in 2015.
