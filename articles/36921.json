He met up with Andra, leader of the illegal government protest party Preserve Our Wild Endangered Resources, or POWER for short. While Andra and Den would often butt heads over issues of character, the two became allies. Den, like most other Telosians, spent his free time betting on events held in the main Katharsis dome located in Telos IV's capital city, Thani.

He became a hero of Telos when, at the cumulation of different events, he resisted the temptation of abandoning his allies and instead revealed what the government and UniFy were doing to Telos IV's sacred places. Later, Den married Andra, and the two fought for Telos's freedom from invading corporations; however, as time went on, the future continued to grow bleak. To help cope with Andra's continuing depression, Den offered an escape, through the charismatic leader Uni and his plan for a self-sustaining roaming ship, the BioCruiser. The couple settled on the ship, and Den was tasked with monitoring plants aboard the ship. Twelve years after he had originally met Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, he met up with Obi-Wan once again, this time with his Padawan Anakin Skywalker. Together, the three managed to discover and stop the plans of the power-hungry Vox Chun and saved countless lives and livelihoods aboard the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Den was a loyal companion to those he befriended, even in their scrutinizing.

There, he was employed as a tech worker by a number of different companies for his technical skills and abilities. One of such employers was UniFy, one of the most powerful and widespread corporations on Telos. Unfortunately, Den was also fired from most of these jobs. He was also a competent petty criminal, mainly experienced with thefts of data by slicing computers. At least one of his unemployment periods was due to a botched attempt, after which he quickly quit before action could be taken against him. He also worked for his landlord, Riva, who hired him to paint the exterior of the building he was renting; however, because she could not decide on an appropriate coloring, and constantly changed the color choice while Denetrus was in the middle of painting it, the building remained unfinished and covered in multiple different colors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time after his tenure at the UniFy building, he met with Andra, leader of the government protest group Preserve Our Wild Endangered Resources, or POWER for short, party.

Den could tell they were on the run from something, so he offered them a seat, pointing to the vacated ones beside himself. The two strangers obliged, thanked Den, and revealed their names: Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Unknown to Denetrus, the two tourists were actually Jedi on a mission to discover what was occurring on Telos; the two, not knowing Den's involvement in the ways of Telosian government, also withheld the fact that they were indeed Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Den answered the two tourists' questions, and after the end of the first match, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi left the arena, citing a meeting they had to attend. Den, knowledgeable of the daily events during a Katharsis event, knew the two could not have had a meeting at that time, and determined to follow them. When he caught up to the two, Denetrus noted a viewscreen with Qui-Gon Jinn's \"wanted\" status, even though the older man attempted to avert his gaze. Leading them further down the street, Den led them straight to the unmarked gray building, where he inquired as to the nature of the meeting. After learning that this meeting wasn't to occur for another day, he offered the two a place to rest for the night."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even though Den realized that the two viewed him as someone to be wary of, they accepted anyway, and started following Denetrus through the maze of buildings. Eventually the three made their way to a more modest, residential part of Thani, where Den led them into an alley with an entrance to the residence. Unfortunately for Denetrus, he had unwittingly led them into a trap, as foot soldiers made their way to Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Den."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the new situation, the two tourists felt that the need for the disguising of their status could be shed. When they drew their lightsabers, Den backpedaled, caught unawares that the two were, in fact, Jedi. Den felt that it was time for him too to reveal that he was not simply a gambler but also a small-time thief, and went on to reveal his involvement with Telosian security forces; when he had seen them earlier in the Katharsis arena, he feared they were looking for him. In order to gain back the trust of his two companions, both thinking he had led them into a trap, Denetrus revealed a way to escape, first through a garbage chute, then a garden, and finally through a sewer pipe. After a brief chase, the group managed to shake the pursuing forces and, at Den's suggestion, made their way to another place Den felt they could hide."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The POWER Party"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This new destination was the home of Andra.

When Den mentioned his past employment and subsequent departure from UniFy, a plan began to form in his mind. Utilizing some key cards he had \"forgotten\" to return and stolen gray jumpsuits, the three were to infiltrate the facility and browse through the computer systems to try and find proof of Offworld Mining Corporation activities.

After another successful entry, Qui-Gon ordered that the sifting be done in shifts, each member working on one hundred entries at a time. Den, however, moved his attention to the Katharsis files, where he learned the true nature of the popular game of chance; the chance had been largely removed, and instead was a massive money-making front for UniFy. Unfortunately, an unforeseen security measure caused the computers to freeze. Den escaped the room by claiming he was departing to figure out what was up, leaving the Jedi alone. However, once clear of the room and the Jedi inside, Den escaped the compound, abandoning the Jedi. Instead of truly abandoning the mission, however, Denetrus once again made contact with Andra and revealed what had transpired."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi had been apprehended by the Telosian security forces, who subsequently placed them under arrest per the Galactic Criminals Act. Held inside a dank underground cell, the two Jedi learned that they were to be put to death for crimes they were believed to have committed. It was there they were met by Xanatos, Qui-Gon's second Padawan, now head of the Offworld Mining Corporation. Xanatos was, along with his father, responsible for the civil war that engulfed Telos IV and involved Qui-Gon Jinn killing his father, leading Xanatos to the dark side. However, Xanatos shrewdly twisted the facts to make Qui-Gon look like the guilty party, while Xanatos was held as a hero in the eyes of the Telosians. Xanatos was the one who informed the two Jedi of their fate, as well as the main witness against the two in the short, condemning trial."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Knowing of the public executions which had become something of a sport in Telosian life, Andra developed another plan, one to rescue the captured Jinn and Kenobi. Den was goaded into aiding Andra again and so attempted to repair the damage he had caused by abandoning his allies. When the execution ceremony began, Andra and Den approached the suspended cages on separate swoop bikes. Both Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan noted Andra's presence, and began their escape plan. Once they rendezvoused with their two allies, the chase began.

Den explained his rationale, and revealed how the Katharsis games were rigged in UniFy's favor; the winner was selected before the events had begun, even down to the final scores and necessary modifications to take place on the different tools used in the final event. Denetrus went further, suggesting that the group could use this to either fund their operations or for other reasons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Qui-Gon decided upon a plan of action that he hoped would expose Xanatos's true motives, the connection between UniFy and Offworld, and the effect Katharsis was having on the economy of Telos IV. The plan was twofold - first, Den would infiltrate UniFy's systems again and set himself up as the rigged winner of Katharsis's major event. After Andra questioned Qui-Gon's choice of utilizing Denetrus in this tempting role, and even going so far as to truly question Den's integrity and motivation, Den protested vehemently, insisting that he was not going to escape with the treasury. Qui-Gon also stood by his decision, and presented the other phase of his plan. During the time utilized in the rigging process, Andra and her followers would investigate firsthand what was happening to Telos's sacred places. It was then that Andra told her allies that she was the lone member of the POWER Party, as the others had fallen away after the destruction of a team with similar objectives. Obi-Wan, much to Qui-Gon's apparent dismay, offered to fill this role."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Bringing down Xanatos, UniFy, and Katharsis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the plan progressed, Den was successful in his venture, and was listed in the relevant files. He also made careful note of the winner, how much the winner would win by, and even what would cause the winner to emerge victorious.

By the time Andra and Obi-Wan did return, however, it was almost time for the final event. Qui-Gon made his way to the projection booth, and successfully planted the recording device Obi-Wan had returned with.

Xanatos was facing the crowds and, thus, away from the screens behind; he did not notice the different slides. The crowd, however, did and, with ever-intensifying force, began to yell out to Xanatos to explain what they saw. Xanatos attempted to quell the disturbance by offering the explanation that it was Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan's fault; soon after, their pictures were displayed, and a Telosian sitting in front of them recognized and called out the Jedi. Swiftly apprehended, the Jedi were about to be dispatched when Den spoke up, demanding the treasures he was entitled to."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All eyes turned toward Den and Xanatos as he produced the crystalline box, filled with the vast treasures promised. While Den was tempted, he resisted the urge to take the money and run, and instead made reference to the same durasheet he had offered the Governor. As the Governor read it, the crowds began murmuring again, at which point Den spoke up once again, revealing the atrocities that Katharsis, UniFy, and Xanatos were performing. Once again the boiling point in the crowd rose greatly, urging Xanatos to explain himself. After motioning the crowds to quiet down, Xanatos admonished the crowd, and bolted for the winner's heavily modified swoop bike, ignoring Den completely."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This distraction was enough for Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon to break free of their restraints, and grab two swoops parked nearby. Once again, the two Jedi attempted to chase down Qui-Gon's old Padawan; unfortunately, as Xanatos's craft was specially modified, he was able to travel at greater velocities, almost losing the Jedi completely. Den made contact again with Andra, and the two also took off after Jinn and Kenobi. They eventually reached the two, now involved in a duel with Xanatos.

During this time, Andra convinced her new husband to abandon his past of criminal acts, which she accomplished, though with Denetrus always looking for a way to use his abilities in his more familiar element. Unfortunately for the two, with the hole filled originally by Offworld empty, other equally powerful corporations began operations on Telos IV. Den could see Andra becoming more and more depressed as all she had worked for was beginning to fade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Den heard of hope in the form of a new, charismatic leader with ideals. Under the name Uni, he promised a way to unite the people against the creeping influence of pirate groups and other shady and destructive business ventures. Den persuaded Andra to attend a meeting with Uni, which, after some gentle prodding, she did, and instantly became involved in the planning of a large starship under the designation BioCruiser.

He looked forward to helping Obi-Wan again and, in order to prove this willingness, produced a stack of durasheet papers with different information concerning different elements Den thought were suspicious. After browsing through them, Obi-Wan determined that they didn't provide any hard proof to anything amiss aboard, to Den's dismay.

Uni, whom Obi-Wan knew better as Kad Chun, the son of Vox Chun, calmly dictated that the Jedi were to leave the ship to prevent any further breeches in security; both Anakin and Obi-Wan thought it wise, though inconvenient, to follow, and so they did. However, Obi-Wan enlisted Den to break them out of the room they were held in. After accomplishing that task with a lock-pick device he fashioned, the three decided that an investigation of Vox Chun's room was in order. This investigation revealed that greed still ran powerfully through Vox and, with further exploring, that the immense cobbled-together ship was to fall under attack by a group of Offworld ships.

At the start of their arguments, Kad kept his faith in his father, however, as the events Obi-Wan was referring to began to conspire, Kad quickly turned face and demanded the truth out of Vox. Though reluctant at first, Vox eventually told the four gathered with him the plan, which involved the sabotage of the BioCruiser and a subsequent robbing of the treasury, and then made his way to the docking bay where an escape pod and Kern were waiting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The foursome followed him hoping to convince Kern to stop whatever invasion force was to come. Kern, however, attempted to dispatch the Jedi and Kad, while making his way to the escape pod; once there, he blasted the frail Vox Chun in the chest to make room in the pod for himself and the treasury. Unfortunately, the departure of Kern did not alleviate the situation, as the Offworld ships began to attack the cobbled-together starship, revealing that Kern had changed the arrangement between both Vox and Offworld and was stealing the wealth for himself. Young Anakin and Garen managed to utilize space vessels to combat the invading forces, while Obi-Wan and Kad sprinted off to the bridge.
