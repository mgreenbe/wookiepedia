Originally intended as a resort for the wealthy, the station was owned by a company based on Derilyn. When Imperial forces took control of Derilyn, company records were wiped so there was no official ownership of the station. The Alliance quietly took control of the station, using it as a listening post directed towards Imperial Interdicted Space. On the surface, the station is maintained as an independent space facility, and the Alliance presence is well hidden."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
