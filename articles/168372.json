These structures were built on the planet of Gobindi by the native people. They were made of slabs of stone stacked on top of each other, each slab a little bit smaller than the one below it, so that the sides of the structures looked like giant staircases. The natives built them to contain a deadly virus. By 0 ABY, all civilization on Gobindi was based in buildings built atop the ziggurats."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another example of a ziggurat was the Old City of Tython, as shown in a drawing by Je'daii Order Master Jake Fenn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Temple of Pomojema was also considered a ziggurat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
