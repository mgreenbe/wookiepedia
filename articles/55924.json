These vessels were painted in Separatist colors. Several ships served in the fleet of the super tactical droid Aut-O. The Black Sun criminal syndicate modified Gozantis and used them as frigates. After the takeover of Mandalore by the Shadow Collective, both Separatist and Black Sun Gozantis were seen using the city of Sundari as a stopover point."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars Insider 63 incorrectly identifies the Gozanti Cruiser and the Taylander shuttle as \"Brocklander ships.\" Star Wars Insider 65 corrects the mistake, stating that \"Brocklander\" was only a nickname used during production."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
