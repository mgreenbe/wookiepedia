He and his three brothers attempted to kidnap a high-ranking Muun officer in the InterGalactic Banking Clan. However, their assault went awry; two of brothers were killed by the security forces, another one was apprehended, and Salto himself was forced to go to a hospital to recuperate from his injuries. The Banking Clan placed an extremely high bounty on his head, and bounty hunters from the Mid Rim to the Outer Rim, including Lucia, hunted him down, finally tracking him to a hospital on Bandomeer, where the nurse Serra determined Zendar was not fit to be moved until stabilized. There, they attacked him, and during the ensuing skirmish, he was counted among the victims."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
