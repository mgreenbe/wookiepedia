In 19 BBY, when the droid armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems attacked the coastal city of Kachirho in one of the final battles of the Clone Wars, Zittaasabba was one of many Wookiees who fought to resist the invaders. Serving under General Tarfful as a sergeant, Zittaasabba piloted an Oevvaor jet catamaran through the lines of Confederate assault tanks during the battle. The Wookiee Chewbacca acted as co-pilot while two other crewmembers attacked the enemy with thermal detonators and a heavy blaster rifle. The battle droids eventually surrendered to the combined forces of the Wookiees and their allies from the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zittaasabba was a Wookiee who lived on the planet Kashyyyk in 19 BBY, during the galaxy-spanning Clone Wars. In that year, the droid armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems invaded the Wookiee homeworld in an attempt to secure hyperspace routes from a guild of navigators who resided in the city of Kachirho. Wookiees from across Kashyyyk flocked to the coastal city to aid in its defense. Their efforts were organized and commanded by General Tarfful, the leader of Kachirho, under whom Zittaasabba served as a sergeant. The Wookiee forces were bolstered by support from the Galactic Republic, the Confederacy's opponent in the war. Clone troopers and Jedi Masters arrived in Kachirho, and the joint forces established defensive positions on the city's beaches."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fighting began when Confederate assault vehicles crossed Kachirho's lagoon. Zittaasabba served as the pilot of an Oevvaor jet catamaran, an unarmed Wookiee aerial vehicle, during the fray. Fellow Wookiee Eugroothwa sat immediately to Zittaasabba's rear in the vehicle's starboard pod and utilized a portable heavy blaster rifle, acting as a gunner. Father and son warriors Attichitcuk and Chewbacca were in the catamaran's portside pod, throwing thermal detonators and co-piloting, respectively. Hundreds of catamarans darted through the lines of Confederate vehicles during the battle, and, after a fierce skirmish, the Wookiee and Republic forces gained a considerable edge and forced the battle droids to surrender. The war itself ended shortly thereafter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zittaasabba was one of many Wookiees who volunteered to defend Kachirho from invading Confederate forces. In addition to being an expert in unarmed combat, Zittaasabba was an able pilot and flew an Oevvaor jet catamaran during the battle. The sergeant had brown fur that was streaked with blond and white, and hair that was tied into braids which fell back behind the Wookiee's head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zittaasabba was created by author Curtis Saxton and was introduced into Star Wars canon in Saxton's April 2005 reference book, Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross-Sections. A single page of the book depicts Zittaasabba piloting an Oevvaor jet catamaran during the defense of Kachirho, an event that later occurred in George Lucas's Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, a film released in May of the same year. There are few details about Zittaasabba in the book, and no indication of the character's sex is included. The illustration of Zittaasabba was done by Hans Jenssen. All of the content in the book was later reprinted in 2007's Star Wars: Complete Cross-Sections."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
