Tors piloted a Ghtroc Class 720 freighter carrying Lieutenant Page, Sergeant Keleman Ciro, Kaiya Adrimetrum, Gottu, and Vandro. Posing as a nondescript freighter, Tors intended to try and blend in with the civilian traffic fleeing the New Republic task force assault the planet. As the rest of the freighters were directed to designated landing fields, Tors piloted the vessel towards a pre-determined target to rendezvous with the team's Pathfinder, Lilla Dade, who had been on the planet for three days."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tors almost managed to get the freighter down when it was targeted by an Atgar 1.4 FD P-Tower on the Imperial Government Complex. The laser blast destroyed the ship's starboard repulsorlift, sending the freighter crashing to the ground. The ship skidded through grassland and decorative shrubberies before punching through the perimeter death fence. Despite crashing, Tors managed to put the vessel in between two hills that put it out of sight of any of the Complex's weapon emplacements. After setting an explosive booby-trap on the freighter, Tors joined the rest of the commando team in waiting for Pathfinder Lilla Dade to make contact."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dade sent a local contact, the Defel Kl'aal, to rendezvous with the command team and he lead them to the Pathfinder. Dade had found an access into the Complex, allowing the commandos to infiltrate Sarne's command center. Splitting his force, Page led Tors, Ciro, and Vandro to cut off the Moff's escape while Adrimetrum, Dade, Gottu, and Kl'aal headed to Sarne's detention level. Before reaching Sarne's escape vessel, a hidden Carrack-class light cruiser, the four commandos were incapacitated by Sarne using a piece of exotic technology. The mind-numbing field laid the team low, allowing the Moff to reach his ship. Despite Ciro destroying the module, the cruiser launched before the commandos could recover. Ciro managed to use a beamdrill to freeze the Complex's shields in the off position when the ship launched, completing the commando's primary mission. With the shields down, Page ordered Tors to contact the admiral in command of the New Republic fleet and inform him of the situation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tors flew an assault shuttle to extract Gottu and Idow from the planet Jendorn.

She was selected to join the Katarn Commandos because of her high level of morale, courage, skill and devotion to the New Republic's cause. Like all members of the team, Tors was a jack-of-all-trades with a variety of skills that allowed her to complete missions independently if needed. She also specialized in piloting starships when the Katarn Commandos were able to take their own transportation. Tors was also a communications expert, capable of operating any comm unit and breaking through any jamming signal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
