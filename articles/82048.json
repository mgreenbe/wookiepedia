He discovered the Worm during one race when he was forced into a side tunnel as he tried to pass a YT-1300 light freighter with his Z-95 Headhunter. Convinced that Riboga the Hutt would space him if he lost the race, he lucked out when he scanned the wall beyond the Worm's tip and discovered it was very thin. Ramming through, he emerged just ahead of the YT-1300 and won the race."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
