At least nineteen of the frigates had been delivered to the Bothan military, with more to be purchased. Despite their impressive firepower and armor, the vessels were outmatched by the Galactic Alliance warship Bounty and the frigate Daring. Of the nineteen vessels that engaged the Alliance patrol near Bothawui, twelve were destroyed or crippled by Alliance fire. They were not, however, fully crewed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
