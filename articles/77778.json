It had a cribblycrunch topping and was cylindrical in shape, with a dollop of white icing on each piece. At some point prior to its destruction during the first two years of the Galactic Empire's reign, the eatery known as Dex's Diner on the planet Coruscant sold the crumb cake for 2.7 credits per slice. The menu of the diner described the Kowakian crumb cake as an old-fashioned favorite that was made from scratch using only the finest ingredients. It also claimed that the cake's cribblycrunch topping could satisfy Kowakian monkey-lizards, who were native to Kowak."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A platter of the cake was on a counter in the diner when Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi visited the restaurant shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kowakian crumb cake was created for the film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, released on May 16, 2002.
