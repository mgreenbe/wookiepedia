An element of six TIEs attacked the X-wings providing top cover, while Vader himself and two wing guards engaged the ships making the trench run. It is not often appreciated these TIE pilots were significantly outnumbered during the battle, but the members of Black Squadron were among the finest the Empire had to offer: they fought hard, and were responsible for many of the Alliance casualties."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The unit itself survived, and was later present for the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable members"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All members of Black Squadron piloted the TIE/LN Starfighters, with the exception of Black Leader, aka Darth Vader, who instead piloted a prototype TIE Advanced x1 that had been personally designed by Vader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Star Wars PocketModel TCG includes both Black Squadron and Black Eight Squadron in the game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
