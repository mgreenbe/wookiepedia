When a cooking competition was held in the castle of the pirate Maz Kanata on the planet Takodana in order to find the establishment's new sous-chef, the Mon Calamari/Quarren hybrid contestant Jom Jarusch used basa root flour to bake the base of a spicy fruit tart during the breakfast-themed first round. Strono Tuggs, the castle's head chef, was unimpressed when he saw Jarusch using the flour during the cooking process as he did not consider the use of the flour a surprise. The contestant handled the use of the flour well though and the end result was surprisingly flavourful, pleasing Tuggs when he tasted it and keeping Jarusch in the competition."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Basa root flour first appeared in the short story \"A Recipe for Death\", which was written by Landry Q.
