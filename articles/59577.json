The two lowest eyes were larger and roughly twice the size of the four smaller eyes. Harch walked on two legs and had six arms, with the second and third set of arm protruding from behind the first pair rather than directly above or below them. These arms were covered in thick hair and ended in three-fingered hands. The Harch were distantly related to the Aqualish species and there was much debate among geneticists regarding the relationship between the Harch and the Aqualish Ualaq subspecies. However, the Harch themselves considered such discussions to be obscene."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Confederacy of Independent Systems admiral named Trench was a member of this species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the last century of the Galactic Republic, the Harch ruling nests allied themselves against the Andoan Free Colonies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the rise of the Galactic Empire, Harch raiders fought against the new regime during the Noolian Crisis in 18 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
