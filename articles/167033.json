They need credits, soon, so they can get off Tatooine, because they are wanted women. Brea knows that Jabba the Hutt has a job, so the sisters go to his palace. There, they find that Jabba has placed a bounty on their associate Han Solo, for not paying his debts to the crime lord. Upon their return to Mos Eisley, and after getting up the next day, the sisters discuss the job. Brea thinks that they could get Han to go quietly, but Senni points out that his Wookiee bodyguard will be a problem."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They ultimately decide to try something else: stealing the Millennium Falcon, because they need a fast ship and Han is always boasting that his is the fastest around. Needing to find out where the Falcon is docked, Brea and Senni head to Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, and eventually overhear that it's in Docking Bay 94. They go there, only to have to hide quickly when they find out that Jabba is there as well. Senni tells Brea, after they sneak out of the docking bay, that there's something strange going on. After the Falcon blasts its way out of the port, the sisters decided to steal another ship from a different bay, as the recent events left much of the space port unguarded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
