The operation was known as the Mission to Myrkr."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Result"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mission was a success with Jacen Solo destroying the voxyn queen, but it came at a huge price: six Jedi - almost half of the task force - were killed, including strike team commander Anakin Solo. Jacen Solo was taken prisoner by Vergere after killing the queen. The craft Raynar Thul stayed on was hijacked by Nightsister Lomi Plo and Dark Jedi Welk, and all three were presumed lost during Myrkr outbound. Jaina Solo and the remaining eight members of the strike team hijacked Nom Anor's craft Ksstarr and survived Myrkr outbound."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eight years later, the survivors of the strike team all received a desperate call through the Force, emanating from the Unknown Regions. The Jedi journeyed to the Unknown Regions, and fell under the influence of the Dark Nest. Alema Rar turned against her fellow Jedi, and all except Jacen (and Tenel Ka, who refused to leave Hapes due to her duty as Queen Mother) became Joiners, their minds open to manipulation by Raynar Thul\u2014now known as UnuThul\u2014Welk and Lomi Plo, who survived the Myrkr outbound and crash-landed elsewhere. The influence marked the beginning of the Dark Nest Crisis which eventually led to the Swarm War. Five years after the war, Jacen Solo turned to the dark side and was taught the ways of the Sith during the Second Galactic Civil War. He would later flow-walk with Tahiri back to the mission where she passionately kissed Anakin Solo before he was killed. As a result, Tahiri joined Jacen in his attempt to bring peace to the galaxy. By then the Sith Lord Darth Caedus, Jacen was eventually killed by his sister Jaina in 41 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Statistics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before leaving the Eclipse Station, tacticians projected that the successful rate of the mission would be 72%, which would decrease by 2% per standard hour. Once Anakin Solo applied Plan D during Myrkr inbound, the success rate decreased to 21% with a casualty projection of over 90%. Ulaha Kore stayed behind aboard the Exquisite Death to boost the successful rate to around 50%, which decreased by 0.2% per standard minute. As the strike team carried the mission for over at least thirty standard hours, one can state that the strike team achieved the impossible against all odds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taking Jedi and droids into calculation, 40% of the original strike team participants were killed in action, 45% survived the mission and the outbound, 10% were missing in action, and 5% were captured by the enemy. 10% of the original strike team survivors were later killed in the Yuuzhan Vong War.

He would later die in action, allowing the remaining Jedi to flee slaughter. Second-in-command, Jacen Solo was named Meld coordinator; the individual that would keep spirits high on the mission. He was also the animal expert out of the group, an ability that would come in use when dealing with the bioforms of the Vong technology. Jacen would be captured by Vergere and tortured while the surviving task force members fled Baanu Rass. Jaina Solo was third-in-command, and the pilot for the group. Her task was to located and operate the hijacked Ksstarr out of the worldship. Ganner Rhysode served as the decoy commander on the assignment; used to draw fire away from Anakin Solo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Zekk served as the equipment scavenger; picking up as many weapons as he could to assist in the operation. Tahiri Veila used her abilities to understand the Vongese as the group's translator. Lowbacca and his droid Em Teedee were the biomechanics experts, while Tekli served as the groups field medic. Tesar Sebatyne and Alema Rar were meant to be used as stealth and underground infiltration agents, but both were forced into action with the rest of the team."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ulaha Kore would lend her piloting and tactical analyst skills before being killed in action; Eryl Besa would contribute her powers of space navigation before being killed in the worldship.
