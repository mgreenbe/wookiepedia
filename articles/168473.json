It was located just north of the capital, Rhire, and halted at the foot of the Sennes Mountains. Wild gabals subsisted on the surface of the glacier and were hunted by native Rhinnalians for their wool. Rhinnalian fireheads burrowed into the ice of the glacier from above, and the oceans underneath the glacier teemed with spectacular, undiscovered life forms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
