Shortly after the destruction of the planet Alderaan, the fugitive siblings Anandra and Santigo Milon met with a Pau'an criminal and his Herglic partner in the cantina. The group discussed the criminal employing and sheltering the siblings, but the Pau'an would not take on Santigo as he was too young, and so the fugitives refused the offer. A stormtrooper and a Coruscant underworld police officer then entered the cantina, causing the Milons to flee. The stormtrooper chased the siblings out of the building, and was followed by the Herglic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cantina first appeared in \"One Thousand Levels Down\", a short story written by Alexander Freed and published in 2014 in Star Wars Insider 151."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
