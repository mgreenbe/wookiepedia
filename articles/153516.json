However, the Jedi was captured by remnants of the Inquisitorius, an order of Dark Jedi that had served the Galactic Empire, and the Jedi was imprisoned inside the Citadel Inquisitorius. There, the Inquisitors slowly began turning the Jedi to the dark side of the Force, and a rescue party was dispatched to free the Jedi. The Inquisitor Shynne greeted the rescuers when they arrived on Prakith and she planned to force the captured Jedi to fight them, as a final step to force the Jedi to submit to the dark side."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
