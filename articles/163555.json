Wright-Sims carried out his trade, despite its seemingly questionable nature on the Imperial capital, with the expressed permission of the Emperor himself, who used Wright-Sims' impeccable taste in quality spice to ensure his elite citizens indulged only in the finest product available in the galaxy. Wright-Sims therefore humbled himself before the Emperor's good graces and also paid dues to Dark Prince Xizor of the Black Sun crime syndicate, who prevented his own spice dealers from interfering in Wright-Sims' business as a professional courtesy. In turn, Wright-Sims frequently presented Xizor with several kilograms of the best-quality spice to maintain Black Sun's favor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wright-Sims did not indulge in his own merchandise, however, instead enjoying the extravagant lifestyle of Coruscant high society.

True to his nature as a Coruscanti socialite, Wright-Sims strove to maintain a fashionable, trendy appearance, both in dress and speech, studying to make sure he wore the day's latest styles and spoke with a practiced, cultured vernacular.

Whereas spice may have seemed like a natural commodity to be highly regulated, if not banned outright, on the Imperial capital, Wright-Sims' spice-dealing venture nevertheless thrived with the expressed permission of Emperor Palpatine himself. The Emperor wished for the Coruscanti elite to indulge only in the best-quality spice available, and so he allowed Wright-Sims\u2014a man of impeccable taste in spice and the smugglers who delivered the drug to Coruscant\u2014to pursue his import trade. Wright-Sims thus ensured that the spice flowing into Coruscant was the most refined of its kind in the galaxy, lest an inferior product should taint those considered the wealthiest and most fortunate members of galactic society."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To supplement his business, Wright-Sims, an affluent Coruscanti socialite in his own right, frequently attended social engagements with his Imperial Center clients to fulfill his market's needs.

Wright-Sims recognized the generosity of the Emperor, for example, and was always willing to assist the Empire's emissaries. He also acknowledged the Dark Prince Xizor, leader of the Black Sun crime syndicate, who, as a professional courtesy, intentionally kept his own spice dealers out of Wright-Sims' business affairs. To demonstrate his appreciation and maintain the Dark Prince's favor, Wright-Sims often personally delivered to Xizor several kilograms of the choicest spice\u2014a cheap insurance for Wright-Sims, even though the spice allotment likely valued several million credits on the streets. Xizor did not indulge in spice himself, but he appreciated the gesture nevertheless, perfectly aware that Wright-Sims was only doing what was necessary to curry favor among his clients and competitors."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Reigniting an old flame"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In mid\u20133 ABY, Imperial Advisor Kren Blista-Vanee, another prominent Coruscanti socialite, formally invited Wright-Sims to a gala at a Coruscant reception hall commemorating the season's debut performance of The Kallea Cycle, a Brentaal opera. Wright-Sims arrived at the party, packed with Coruscant's elite society, following The Kallea Cycle's first marathon portion, which he found exceedingly droll. Still, despite having to sit through the performance, he was prepared to be his usual charming self at the engagement, for this was part of his job as Imperial Center's premier spice dealer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With a head of finely pomaded hair and wearing that week's designer evening coattails, Wright-Sims adroitly made his way through the party from one superficial discussion or debate to another\u2014marveling at the training the opera's performers must have endured to sing for five hours straight, criticizing the loathsome Rebels for killing innocents until they were once more occupying the old Senate Building, or gossiping about a purported scandal involving the late Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and a female aide years before\u2014all the while reinforcing his dedication to those addicted to his premium spice. In the course of his hobnobbing, Wright-Sims subtly promised spice delivery to the Lady Amber Comark, daughter of Imperial Moff Jesco Comark, and Grand Admiral Miltin Takel, both regular clients of his, in the coming days."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wright-Sims eventually ran into Mayli Weng, an old flame of his, whom he had casually courted once at least two years before. Wright-Sims recalled his time with Weng, a woman with an exceptional figure, friendly demeanor, and luxuriously long, brown hair, as a pleasant time, though he could not remember the reason for their breakup. As Wright-Sims genially reintroduced himself to Weng with minor small talk and began casually escorting her to the gala's more quiet sidelines, away from the rest of the party guests, he silently noted that perhaps enduring the opera's five-hour performance was indeed going to be worth it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Weng's courteousness disappeared once they were alone.

When Wright-Sims calmly pressed further and placed an arm around her shoulder, offering a diversion to her troubles, Weng moved to back away from him, rejecting any offer of his merchandise, if that was all he wanted. But selling more spice was not Wright-Sims' intention. Instead, he simply suggested they catch up on old times with one another, perhaps over some appetizers from a server's tray and a bit of Cedrellian aged wine\u2014a worry-free evening together, no strings attached."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wright-Sims then slowly led Weng by the hand toward the reception hall's terrace arches and the balcony garden beyond, charming her with a recitation of his own rendition of the Korfani poet, Adranax: Why mourn for tomorrow in tears today/When current fleeting hours not long shall stay?/Come stroll with me, we shall find your lost peace/In an old friend's arms and a gentle kiss."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Xizor's last spice endowment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wright-Sims later paid a visit to Xizor's Palace in 3.5 ABY, on the morning of the day before Xizor was ultimately killed in battle with elements of the Imperial Navy, under the command of Darth Vader, over the skies of Coruscant. Wright-Sims, whose appointment, in fact, shortly followed Mayli Weng's own appointment with Xizor on the same day, presented the Dark Prince with ten kilograms of the highest-grade spice, his regular contribution to ensure he maintained Black Sun's favor. Although Xizor refrained from using the spice, he preferred to have some on hand in the event his guests cared to indulge, in which case Xizor would be the hospitable host. As usual, price was no issue in the transaction, and Xizor thanked Wright-Sims before sending the man on his way."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although spice dealing may have seemed like a questionable pursuit to some, especially among the upper echelons of Coruscant society, Wendell Wright-Sims figured the Emperor's noble subjects deserved to enjoy themselves.

He was careful to know his place in the Coruscant society power structure, ready to oblige both the Empire and Black Sun for permitting him to pursue his trade.

He regularly followed the newsnets with an eye out for the latest \"hot trend,\" styled his speech to employ the most popular catchphrases, and kept himself abreast of recent events that prepared him for the most cultured and sophisticated conversations.
