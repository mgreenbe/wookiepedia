These collapsible vanes sparked with electric currents while in use, and delivered a stunning shock against opponents. The weapon was held via an adhesion grip that was capable of being magnatomically paired with the gloves of a First Order stormtrooper. This magnetic grip allowed the baton to be spun in combat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The riot control stormtroopers of the First Order were trained to use non-lethal equipment as part of riot-control tactics, and utilized the Z6 baton, often in conjunction with a lightweight composite betaplast ballistic riot shield. Captain Cardinal, a key member of the First Order training hierarchy, was training recruits in the use of the baton aboard a Resurgent-class Star Destroyer when word came down that he was to be replaced by Phasma. After learning of Phasma's background, Cardinal confronted Phasma in a simulation room aboard the Absolution and both engaged in combat with one another using a Z6 baton. The Z6, capable of shocking and stunning an opponent during combat, was used by FN-2199, a trooper of the FN Corps, against the defector FN-2187 during the Battle on Takodana. Nines attacked Finn with his baton, pummeling the traitor's lightsaber until he was shot by a Wookiee bowcaster fired by Han Solo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finn wielded this weapon aboard Snoke's ship during his duel with Captain Phasma.
