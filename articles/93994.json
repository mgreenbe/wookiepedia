The platform was supported by thick columns anchored in the sea bed. It was a key target of Republic forces during the Battle of Murkhana in the final days of the Clone Wars. Led by Jedi Master Roan Shryne and Clone Commander Salvo, along with Master Bol Chatak and her Padawan Olee Starstone, the 32nd Air Combat Wing were sent in to disable a deflector shield generator that was housed in the lower levels of a medcenter, which protected the landing with overlapping particle shields. With the assistance of the clone commando unit of Ion Team, the Jedi were able to destroy the generator, paving the way for Republic, and eventually Imperial control."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
