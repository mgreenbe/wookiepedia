After the pirate captain Hondo Ohnaka captured Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, and Sith Lord and Confederate Head of State Count Dooku, the Galactic Republic prepared to pay Ohnaka and his gang a hefty ransom for exchange of the prisoners. A group led by Senator Kharrus, Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks, and Clone Commander CC-5869 \"Stone\" traveled to the planet Florrum, where Ohnaka's base of operations was located, but their shuttle was shot down by a group of treasonous pirates, led by Turk Falso. The ship crashed in the Doshar fields, with casualties including Mack, his fellow clone trooper pilot, and Kharrus. The survivors would advance towards Hondo's complex in an attempt to finish the mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
