It was a hot and humid world and a hotbed of life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among the purest locations in the entire galaxy within the energy field known as the Force, Dagobah was a mysterious, mist-shrouded, swampy planet, mostly covered in swamps and bogs, interspersed with countless shallow lakes and lagoons and multiple living caves. The continental and oceanic crusts of Dagobah were only vaguely defined, and there was little in the way of volcanic activity or earthquakes. Dagobah was home to many creatures, such as bogwings, dragonsnakes, butcherbugs, sleens, vine snakes, and swamp slugs. Examples of flora included the Lahdia plant, the Yoghurt plant, Gnarltree and Yarum seed. The planet was devoid of any advanced or indigenous civilization of sentients."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dagobah had two seasons, a dry season and a wet season. During the peak of the long dry season (over half an orbit after the rains end) the uplands become too hot for most lifeforms to survive, necessitating any that live there to migrate to the lower lands. Beneath the rapidly leafing canopies of the gnarltrees that emerge from the receding green and thick waters, the once-inundated lowlands revert back to a marshy swamp once again. As the air grows more humid, the gray overcast clouds return and before another quarter orbit passes the planet is far enough away from its sun that the dry season ends and the rains return, again flooding the lowlands and covering the trees in water, making the uplands habitable once more."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Near the end of the Clone Wars, Jedi Grand Master Yoda traveled to the planet Dagobah after hearing the voice of deceased Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. He ventured into the swamp, where he communed with Jinn, who appeared manifested as a group of fireflies. He told Yoda of how to communicate with the living after death through the connection between the Living Force and the Cosmic Force. Then, Yoda entered a cave, where he saw a vision of the Jedi fighting the clones and then the mysterious Sith Lord."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After his defeat at the hand of Sith Lord Darth Sidious following the formation of the Galactic Empire, Yoda exiled himself to Dagobah."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, Luke Skywalker of the Alliance to Restore the Republic traveled to Dagobah under the direction of late Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi in hopes of finding Yoda and being trained in the ways of the Jedi Order. Skywalker crashed into a bog upon landing and happened upon the Jedi, though he was unaware it was, in fact, Yoda at the time. The old master took Skywalker back to his hut for dinner, where he revealed his true identity to Skywalker. Initially reluctant to train Skywalker due to his age and lack of patience, Yoda was eventually convinced to teach him by the the Force spirit of Kenobi. One night during Skywalker's training, an Imperial probe droid from Project Swarm arrived on planet. The droid's operator, Maela, initially believed there was no reason to look further into the planet during the unit's patrol until she spotted Skywalker's X-wing in the swamp. Though she realized the outline of what she saw resembled an X-wing, she had realized the cruelty of the Empire after witnessing the aftermath of the Battle of Hoth, so she deleted the footage before moving on to her next droid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his training, Skywalker entered the Cave of Evil and confronted a vision of Darth Vader, who he struck down, only to see his own face in Vader's mask. Later, Skywalker ended his training early, however, once he sensed his friends Han Solo and Leia Organa were in danger. Though Yoda and Kenobi attempted to reason with Skywalker to stay, the student left the planet, promising to return and finish his training. He would keep his word, and after learning Vader was his father during their duel on Cloud City, saving Leia and Chewbacca from Vader on Cloud City, and rescuing Solo from Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine, he would return to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training. Upon arriving, he found Yoda sick and dying, who told him that his training was complete, but all he had to do was confront Vader one last time, and the old master became one with the Force. The ghost of Kenobi then revealed to Skywalker the truth that Leia was, in fact, a Skywalker and Luke's sister before Luke left the planet to confront Vader and the Emperor in hopes of turning Vader back to the light side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after the skirmish on the Minemoon, Kylo Ren, nephew of Luke Skywalker, along with his master and Supreme Leader of the First Order, Snoke, came to Dagobah in order to face Ren's darkest fears.
