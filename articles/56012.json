He was one of many to speak out against the Supreme Commander of the Imperial Fleet Gilad Pellaeon's proposal for a treaty of peace between the Imperial Remnant and the New Republic. Through statements made by High General Sutt Ramic to Pellaeon, Graemon was also suspected of embezzling Imperial funds. The investigations of Commander Dreyf, an Imperial Intelligence officer loyal to and under the orders of Pellaeon, it was found that Graemon was in fact one of three players in a conspiracy concerning the misappropriation and channeling of Imperial funds to the Cavrilhu Pirates in exchange for Preybird-class starfighters; the other two conspirators were Moff Vilim Disra and General Jaron Kyte. Backed by files taken from Disra's office on Bastion, Dreyf's investigation also uncovered numerous illegal connections to New Republic financial and commodity interests. Along with Disra and Kyte, Graemon was later arrested in the wake of the Caamas Document Crisis of the New Republic and attempted coup of the Imperial Remnant by Disra, Royal Guardsman Grodin Tierce, and the con-artist Flim."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Graemon's appearances in Specter of the Past and Vision of the Future were written long before later sources introduced the Muuns as the inhabitants of Muunilinst, his description as \"a lean man wearing the traditional Muunilinsti banker's shawl and pendant\" may be consistent with a retcon identifying him as a Muun."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
