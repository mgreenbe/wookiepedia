A Twi'lek bounty hunter suddenly arrived and shot Lucia, knocked Serra aside, and dragged Zendar away. Lucia attempted to follow but soon blacked out, and Serra quickly performed life-saving surgery on her. By the time the ensuing skirmish was over, Zendar was dead, along with four bounty hunters, two patients, and four members of the hospital staff. Afterward, Lucia vowed to protect Serra for saving her life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 987 BBY, thirteen years after the conclusion of the New Sith Wars, the Meerian Salto Zendar and his three brothers attempted to kidnap a high-ranking Muun official of the InterGalactic Banking Clan in order to hold him for ransom. They failed in their task, however\u2014two of Zendar's brothers were killed and one was captured during the venture, while Zendar himself was seriously wounded and forced to flee."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zendar was taken in at a hospital on the planet Bandomeer in the Outer Rim Territories, where he began to receive treatment for his injuries, although he remained in critical condition. Meanwhile, the InterGalactic Banking Clan put an exceptionally large bounty on Zendar's head and numerous bounty hunters from across the galaxy decided to hunt him down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The skirmish"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several bounty hunters tracked Zendar to the hospital, where the Meerian was still recovering. Lucia, a bounty hunter who had fought for the Gloom Walkers unit of the Brotherhood of Darkness during the New Sith Wars, was the first to find him. However, her path to the fugitive was blocked by Serra, a nurse who worked at the hospital. Serra refused to allow the Meerian to be moved while he remained in his critical condition, even when Lucia held her at blasterpoint."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lucia hesitated at the prospect of shooting an innocent nurse just to collect the bounty on Zendar, but a Twi'lek bounty hunter suddenly arrived and shot Lucia in the stomach from point-blank range. Serra attempted to block the Twi'lek's path, but he pistol-whipped her and then grabbed Zendar and dragged him out of the room into the hall. Lucia attempted to crawl after them, but another bounty hunter appeared, shooting the Twi'lek in the back and taking Zendar; Lucia then fell unconscious as the battle for Zendar continued."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Serra quickly moved Lucia back into the room and performed life-saving surgery on her while the firefight continued outside. Despite the fact that Lucia had held her at blasterpoint and that she had just been pistol-whipped, Serra successfully completed the surgery, saving Lucia's life. As the skirmish came to an end, four bounty hunters were counted among the dead, along with three of the hospital's security guards, one member of the hospital nursing staff, two patients, and Zendar himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From her blaster wound and subsequent surgery, Lucia obtained a scar running from her navel to her rib cage that she bore for the rest of her life. Lucia knew that she owed her life to Serra, so she vowed to watch over the young woman from that day on. At first, Serra was reluctant to have Lucia constantly protecting her, but eventually she came to appreciate having a bodyguard, and the two became close friends. When Serra married Prince Gerran of Doan, Lucia joined the Doan Royal Guard so that she could continue her duties as Serra's bodyguard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This skirmish was first mentioned in Drew Karpyshyn's 2009 novel, Darth Bane: Dynasty of Evil.
