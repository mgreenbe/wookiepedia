Utilizing Sith alchemy and the dark side of the Force, Plagueis intended to create the living embodiment of the Force. In order to do so, he tried to influence the midi-chlorians in his attempt to create life. But when his efforts bore no success, and instead wiped out his other experiments, Plagueis deemed the project a failure. Years later, during the Crisis on Naboo in 32 BBY, Plagueis was surprised to discover the existence of Anakin Skywalker, a young Human boy born without a father. Plagueis concluded that not only had the midi-chlorians resisted his will, but they had also retaliated by engineering the conception of the Jedi Order's long-awaited Chosen One, a Jedi destined to restore balance to the Force by destroying the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike his master, however, Darth Sidious saw the discovery of Skywalker as an opportunity; the chance to use the Jedi's own legend to the Sith's advantage. After he assassinated Plagueis, Sidious\u2014under the guise of his public persona as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine\u2014befriended the young padawan, and intended to slowly corrupt him over the years until Skywalker submitted to the dark side\u2014a goal in which he ultimately succeeded. However, Anakin was eventually redeemed and, turning his back on his Master and the dark side, slew the Emperor before he himself perished."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
