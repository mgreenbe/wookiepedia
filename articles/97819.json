He was able to control the masses through illusions\u2014by wiring remote explosives to controls within his gauntlets, Nol could simulate the appearance of generating destruction at will through the power of the Force. To that end, Nol posed as a Sith, an ancient order to which historical figures such as Darth Vader, Exar Kun, and Skere Kaan had belonged. Nol was specifically recognized by the people of N'ildwab as a Sith Lord, and he commanded fear among the throng of people on the planet. In 5 ABY, outside a settlement on the planet, Nol stood atop a pile of corpses near a mob of his followers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As those faithful to him attacked the settlement's walls, Nol began his oration, imploring the people within the settlement to acknowledge his power\u2014those who denied it would apparently be consumed by Nol's power, while anyone who accepted his control would be a \"part\" of him. As the \"Sith\" began firing his remote explosives through his gauntlets, he continued his speech, calling upon the mass of people to embrace their fear of him. At that moment, a new arrival swiftly approached\u2014the bounty hunter Boba Fett. The hunter swiftly struck at Nol's throat, breaking the pretender Sith Lord's neck and killing him instantly.
