Sometime between 0 ABY and 3 ABY, the rogue archaeologist Chelli Aphra and the assassin droid Triple-Zero were on the run on the planet Milvayne, being connected with proximity bombs that were set to detonate in less than ten hours. Triple-Zero's eyes were also broadcasting a live feed of his vision to the residents of Milvayne."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Above Milvayne, Okma, aboard the Enduring Pride, was discussed the situation with the chair of the CFP, minister Pitina Voor. He and the minister reviewed the viewing figures of Triple-Zero's live feed, which had reached the billions by then. Voor called it unacceptable, but Okma pointed out that an agreement between the Empire and Milvayne made it so that they could only keep an invisible presence. Voor shut his point down, comparing him a brainless stormtrooper, an irresponsible pilot and a hostile inspector. She told Okma to \"spit on can't\" and reminded the captain that they were public relations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Voor inquired on tracing the broadcasting signal, Okma told her that they needed to capture the droid. Voor then asked of the public mood, and one of Okma's controllers reported the insurrection markers to be grade 2 on Milvayne. As Okma assured the minister that the Milvayne Authority, Milvayne's law enforcement agency, was able to control this, another controller reported that the authority had just captured Aphra and Triple-Zero.

Voor recounted Milvayne's status as a \"model Imperial planet\" and the agreement the Empire had with the planet's authorities. Okma assumed she meant that they should not intervene with Aphra and Triple-Zero, but the minister convinced him she meant otherwise and ordered him to fire the Enduring Pride's railgun.

Okma refused, and so Triple-Zero murdered the captain's stormtrooper guards and then tortured Okma for the codes before killing him.
