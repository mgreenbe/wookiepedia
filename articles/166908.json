Luke Skywalker asks Yoda if Yoda is certain Luke needs a driver's license to be a Jedi. Yoda chastises Luke not to question his teaching. Han Solo asks Luke if he wants to \"drag\" before saying \"Wrong movie!\" and \"Outta my way graffiti geek!\" (referencing Harrison Ford's character in American Graffiti). Han speeds off, leaving Luke coughing in his exhaust. Darth Vader implores Luke to complete his training so the two of them can \"cruise the galaxy together,\" but Luke complains that he's trying but the vehicle he's in won't move because it's made of plastic. Then Luke uses the force to make the plastic speeder move. Vader says Luke's destiny is with him, and Yoda notes with approval that Luke at least remembered to buckle his seatbelt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
