The objective was to create an intelligent and powerful form of arachnes for the use of the Galactic Empire. Those arachnes could be released onto a world the Empire did not want to spend troops on, but did not want it to be used by its enemies. Even though the creatures would thoroughly destroy the native ecology, the planet would be effectively rendered uninhabitable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 1 ABY, the project was a success and Doctor Vigh, the chief scientist of the GeneTech Syndicate, decided to deliver the first specimens to the Empire. Bioengineered arachnes were loaded into a transport that headed to the Imperial research facility on Nubia. However, the transport crashed in the mountains near the city of Nashal just after its departure and the arachnes escaped in the wilderness. Moreover, the arachnes in the GeneTech Syndicate laboratory escaped containment and overwhelmed their creators. The Corellian Security Force eventually discovered that most of the lab staff was slaughtered by the creatures."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
