In the maneuver, slower fighters such as X-wings engaged an opponent to distract and confuse them. Once the enemy's attention was focused on the first wave of fighters, a group of speedier A-wings entered the battle to make a devastating surprise attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The A-wing Slash was first mentioned in Star Wars canon in the 2017 reference and model book Star Wars: A-wing Deluxe Book and 3D Wood Model by Michael Kogge.
