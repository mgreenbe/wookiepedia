At some point circa 5 BBY, Startron wanted to retire, but decided to have one last run with his ship. Understanding that his health was not good, Startron recruited Sapphire, a young smuggler woman with whom he was friends. Startron's health state then declined quickly and Sapphire was forced to pilot the ship on her own under challenging circumstances."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sapphire refused to take credit for her deeds, and instead people believed Startron was still in good shape. Grateful for her performance, Startron gave the Quasar to Sapphire as a gift."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon, Sapphire performed several modifications on the transport so that many of their systems were no longer original. Sapphire wanted to work as a courier, and to do so she made a fast, furtive ship that could avoid sensors: Specialized shields hid the ship's energy emanations, and the easily detectable energy weapons were replaced with fire-linked concussion missile launchers that were easier to hide, even if they were less useful in combat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
