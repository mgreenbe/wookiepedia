They first fought with the Republic Garrison under the command of Jedi General Ima-Gun Di and Capt. Keeli, before their last-ditch suicidal defense against the droid army to give the freedom fighters and their families time to escape to the mountains. During the battle, many were massacred by the droids. They were later approached by High Jedi General Mace Windu and two ARF clone troopers who asked for help in freeing Ryloth's capital with the Galactic Republic. The fighters questioned why they should help the Republic, as they did not want another army occupation. Syndulla negotiated with Senator Orn Free Taa so that the freedom fighter would not try to take power on Ryloth and the Senator would make sure the Republic troops would leave after they help rebuild the planet. After the Separatists started bombing villages, the fighters agreed to help the Republic. After a lengthy battle above a droid energy bridge, connecting it to the other side of the canyon, Obi-wan Kenobi slew the strategic droid left at the base. The combined forces of the Republic troops and the freedom fighters were able to free the capital and the planet along with it. Later they, along with Windu's troops, participated in a victory parade in Lessu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
