Throughout the duration of the Clone Wars, the Fourteenth was headquartered on the planet Ryloth and charged with the defense of the Tolonda oversector. The overall command of the Fourteenth was shared between a highly experienced Jedi General and a Governor-General who was appointed by the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. By 19 BBY, the last year of the Clone Wars, the Governor-Generals evolved into a permanent class of regional governors known as the Moffs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Clone Wars progressed, Chancellor Palpatine promoted Ravik to the rank of Moff, giving him control of the Fourteenth Army and the Tolonda sector.

Under the New Order of Emperor Palpatine, Ravik ascended to the rank of Grand Moff and maintained the Fourteenth Army. Much of the Imperial Era was marked by the Empire's massive military buildup and resulted in a vast army far larger than its Republic predecessor. Thus, the total infantry force of the Fourteenth Army and all other sector units were increased to approximately 1,572,864 troopers, most of whom were of natural birth as clones became marginalized into a minority status."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Fourteenth Army was mentioned in the 2012 Guidebook, The Essential Guide to Warfare. According to the co-author, Paul R. Urquhart, its nickname, Red Tails Command, was derived from various sources, including the head-tail colors of Twi'leks living in the capital of the Tolonda Oversector, and to the 2012 historical-fiction film Red Tails, detailing the exploits of the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II, which was directed and written by Star Wars creator George Lucas. There were also plans to have a Twi'lek moff in this section, although they decided that it simply wouldn't fly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
