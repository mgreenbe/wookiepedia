It was placed in Darpa sector, near the edge of the Ringali Nebula, rimward of Esseles and Brentaal IV. The station guarded a region that was frequently crossed by vessels that operated on the fringe, such as pirates and smugglers heading toward and away from Ado sector and the StarForge Station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like Station 2LC/Blue, 1B6/Green was under the command of Imperial naval installations at Esseles. Stationed at 1B6/Green were two IPV-1 System Patrol Craft and a Lancer-class frigate. Four squadrons of TIE/LN starfighters, a squadron of TIE/sa bombers, and a large quantity of other craft, which included shuttles, cargo tugs, and Alpha-class Xg-1 Star Wings, rounded out the station's Imperial garrison. The station was also surrounded by a ring of Type 5 hunter-killer space mines. A direct HoloNet connection was active with Esseles' Imperial garrison."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vice Admiral Alpiett Gredge, commander of the Scourge, and who was formerly in charge of 1B6/Green, occasionally visited the station on his patrols as a matter of personal interest. The stations dated back to the time of the Esselian Empire, and originally delineated part of the Esselian border."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
