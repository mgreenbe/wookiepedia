To build the city, massive loadbearing supports were built via molds using lava-proof carbon alloys, with aggregate stones and special additives mixed with the magma trapped in the molds. A number of those pillars were hollowed out to serve as buildings or turbolift shafts to the surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not only was it Sullust's capital, but it was one of its most prestigious cities. The finest entertainment, food, and culture in Sullust were found in SoroSuub Central. Offworlders prefer the surface environment but there were some offworld tourists in SoroSuub Central. It was one of the few cities on Sullust with clearly marked signs and street names, and easy-to-reference landmarks. Located in central downtown was SoroSuub Centroplex, a single three-kilometer-high support pillar that was visible throughout the city. The flagship store was located in the bottom floors, and the rest of the spire is dedicated to the corporation's bureaucracy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
