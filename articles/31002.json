It was created mainly to handle the sudden onset of a mysterious psychosis in several Jedi Knights, but it also dealt with all other affairs concerning Jedi. It was headed by the Zoolli Judge Arabelle Lorteli, who had been handpicked for the job by Daala. After Lorteli signed a writ permitting the Jedi, who were accompanied by Corran and Mirax Horn, as well as several reporters, to visit Valin and Jysella Horn, leading to a near-public relations disaster for the Galactic Alliance, Lorteli was dismissed by Daala and the court was put on hold."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
