The trade language was reintroduced to canon in Zahn's later novel, Thrawn, where it played far more notable role than in the previous literature. In an interview published on StarWars.com, Zahn confirmed that he based Sy Bisti on the Zulu language. Like Sy Bisti, Zulu has many multi-syllable words. After finding a word in Zulu, Zahn explained that he would shift all the vowels one vowel over to create a fictional language that was influenced by Zulu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
