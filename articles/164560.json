Woern commanded a sizable pirate fleet of modified freighters, and over two hundred pirates including Rodians, Gamorreans, Elomin, and Humans. Woern's command vessel was a modified Gamma-class assault shuttle. The pirate's main targets were lightly defended cargo fleets, unarmed passenger liners, and large civilian cargo transports. Although they were generally indiscriminate in choosing their targets, in 7 ABY Woern purchased New Republic trade route information and began hitting New Republic shipping exclusively."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
