When Ahsoka Tano and Plo Koon visited the bar during their investigation into the whereabouts of a young Boba Fett, the unidentified Twi'lek's performance was being watched by a male Rodian and a male Quarren who were arguing with each other over which one of them the Twi'lek would prefer. When Ahsoka was caught eavesdropping, the Twi'lek\u2014along with the other bar patrons\u2014drew a small and surprisingly well hidden blaster. However, Ahsoka's quick thinking allowed the Jedi Padawan and Plo Koon to safely leave the establishment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
