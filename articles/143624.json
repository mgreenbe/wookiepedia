The organization was also enemies of the much more destructive Skulls. They were named for the Jedi Order and attempted to live by a code of honor that separated them from most swoop Gangs. They had more difficulty evading Imperial authorities than the Skulls due to their unwillingness to risk innocent lives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
