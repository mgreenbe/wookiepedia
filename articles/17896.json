It was used by the Therans to prevent starships larger than a B-wing starfighter to escape the planet because they could send the Death Seed through the galaxy. The Station was attacked in 13 ABY by the Newcomers. After the battle, a man was able to throw explosives into the cannon, damaging it. Seti Ashgad was then able to lift off and flee."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
