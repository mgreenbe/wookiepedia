It was common practice for an interrogator using this method to begin with one of the victim's legs so as to immobilize him or her. The interrogator would repeat the process with other parts of the victim's body until the victim gave the interrogator the answers he or she wanted, until the victim perished, or the torturer satisfied."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In cases in which a victim possessed knowledge that an interrogator desired, the Burning was an extremely effective means of obtaining information. Forcing an individual to watch as another was subjected to this particularly brutal torture method also proved to be effective. However, when a victim did not have information that an interrogator wanted, the interrogator ran the risk of eventually killing the victim."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Pius Dea Era, the Burning was inflicted on Jedi Padawans\u2014along with other physical torments\u2014as part of the Trial of the Flesh stage of the Jedi Trials."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bounty hunter Feskitt Bobb, one among sundry ruthless individuals, employed the Burning during the course of his hunts. The Corporate Sector Authority's Security Police performed the technique with E-11 blaster rifles in a hunt for the leaders of an uprising against the Authority during its annexation of the Trianii colony of Fibuli. During the Galactic Empire's campaign against the Virgillian Free Alignment, stormtroopers stationed aboard the Victory-class Star Destroyer Stormwind used this technique while questioning refugees; however, they ended up killing many refugees while gaining no useful information."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Burning was first described in the pages of Han Solo at Stars' End, by author Brian Daley.
