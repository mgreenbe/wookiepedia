Shaped from the sparkbee, the razor bug was a relative of the thud bug, but served a different purpose. Essentially living knives, razor bugs had carapaces that were capable of shredding flesh and piercing certain types of armor. When thrown, the razor bug would deploy its wings which helped guide it towards the target, giving it the homing capabilities similar to the thud bug. They also had a vapid tenaciousness to continue attacking a target until either it or the razor bug was subdued."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yuuzhan Vong warriors could throw several razor bugs at once to engulf their enemies. A skilled wielder could also throw the razor bug and cause it to immediately return to his hand.
