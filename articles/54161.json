Luke Skywalker was taken deep into a geyser by Eol Sha colony leader Gantoris, ostensibly to gather lichen there, but in actuality as a test of his Force abilities. Skywalker escaped the geyser, using the Force to protect himself from the super-heated vapor. The planet Baroonda had a number of sulfur geyser fields\u2014most notably the Hoodu Geyser Fields\u2014while a number of sulphur geysers existed within the Sulphur Pits of Vulcar. The planet Togominda was known for its salt geysers. There were ice geysers on the planet Hoth that dotted the landscape.
