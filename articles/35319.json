Born to an influential family, Dofine quickly rose through the ranks of the Federation, using a combination of backstabbing and family ties. He made a reputation for himself in the Outer Rim Territories as a harasser of traders and a hunter of pirates. By 33 BBY, he was the commander of the Federation cruiser Revenue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While at Dorvalla, the Revenue was lost in an altercation with the Nebula Front terrorist group, and Dofine then found himself in command of the Acquisitor. He made his way into Viceroy Nute Gunray's inner circle, and he was made privy to Gunray's communications with the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious. Dofine later came to captain the Saak'ak, and then the Droid Control Ship Vuutun Palaa during the Federation's occupation of Naboo. He perished when the Droid Control Ship was destroyed in a battle with the Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Daultay Dofine was born to an influential family on Neimoidia, which would present him with numerous advantages later in life, although he was said, by some, to be the runt of his hive. In addition to his influence, Dofine commanded significant wealth. The Dofines had been in the service of the Trade Federation for a considerable amount of time, and at some stage, Dofine began serving the Trade Federation directly as a starship officer. He was followed in this path by his cousin, Lushros Dofine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Through a combination of back-stabbing, groveling with his superiors in the Federation, and family connections, Dofine was able to climb through the ranks, and became captain in spite of his only marginal competence. He was particularly adept at economically organizing Federation convoys, and negotiating with traders. Dofine consistently would underpay his suppliers, and made sure that those suppliers had no one else to turn to for help. He also made active efforts to eliminate smugglers and pirates. Since he had no military experience or knowledge, Dofine's main tactic was to stall his targets with platitudes while assessing how to best seize their assets. Dofine's convoys would also capture the ships and cargo of traders not under contract to the Federation; those traders would always pay compensation. As a result, Dofine quickly became an unpopular figure in the Outer Rim Territories."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Incident at Dorvalla"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 33 BBY, Dofine, now a commander, was in charge of the Lucrehulk-class LH-3210 cargo freighter Revenue. Among the ship's crew was a wide variety of non-Neimoidians\u2014a fact that Dofine did not enjoy, but he understood that the Federation had to employ such types as an obligation to their allies. He and his crew spent many months in deep space, and was dispatched to Dorvalla, several times, where the Revenue took on a significant quantity of lommite ore. The first time, Dorvalla Mining claimed that the Federation's payment was short by 20,000 Republic credits. On the second visit, the mining company claimed that the Federation was short 50,000 credits, but Dofine attempted to deflect them by having its representative recheck her figures. On the third visit, once the ship had finished loading, Dofine ordered his fighters to be recalled to the Revenue, as he wished to depart Dorvalla as soon as possible. Once the rest of his crew had returned from Dorvalla's surface, he would be free to deliver his cargo to its destination, Sluis Van. During the Revenue's third visit to the planet, it had secured and harbored within the ship's security cabin a hefty supply of aurodium ingots\u2014bribes from Outer Rim worlds that wanted to stay in the Federation's favor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before he was able to depart, Dofine again received a transmission from Dorvalla Mining, this time claiming that he was short 100,000 credits. The Human female representative talked to Dofine directly this time, confronting him on the issue. The commander dismissed the missing credits as additional expenses, citing Dorvalla's relative remoteness. The representative was not impressed, nor satisfied, but Dofine merely suggested that she take up the issue with the Trade Commission on Coruscant, before terminating the transmission. As he finished preparations to depart, Dofine noticed that the ship's scanner array was picking up something, and it was soon evident that it was incoming craft: CloakShape fighters and a Tempest-class gunship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aghast at what he correctly perceived to be an attack, Dofine began to panic. His systems officer then reported a disturbance in zone two of the ship's starboard hangar arm, claiming that the droids had begun firing at one of the cargo pods. The officer suggested that it might have been a glitch, but the commander had other concerns when his crew reported that the incoming ships bore the insignia of the Nebula Front, a group of Outer Rim terrorists. The gunship was identified as the Hawk-Bat, which was captained by Arwen Cohl. Dofine was in disbelief; Cohl had been reportedly sighted near Malastare only a day before, a substantial distance from their present coordinates. Meanwhile, the systems officer reported that eight security droids had been destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dofine was far more concerned with the incoming attack, however. The CloakShape fighters engaged the Revenue, which retaliated with its turbolasers. The nearest Federation presence was the more heavily armed Acquisitor, but commander Dofine was reluctant to call for help, considering the act humiliating. Nevertheless, he sent out a distress signal. Launching his fighters to engage the attackers, Dofine learned that several infiltrators from Dorvalla had been able to sneak aboard one of the Revenue cargo pods. They had subsequently engaged the security droids in zone two of the starboard hangar arm, causing the disturbance. In response, Dofine had the area sealed off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship continued to be pummeled by the Nebula Front's ships, and when the Revenue's shields fell to 40 percent, Dofine had the central computer activate all droids and defenses, in preparation for boarders. The commander was determined not to let Cohl's band of infiltrators set foot on his bridge, but his efforts were not enough\u2014the Nebula Front fighters, led by Cohl personally, explosive-detonated the door to the bridge, seizing Dofine and his men and taking them captive. Cohl was not interested in the lommite ore, but rather the aurodium ingots on board. Dofine was defiant at first, unwilling to surrender the location of the ingots, but Cohl threatened to destroy the Revenue within sixty minutes should the commander not cooperate. But before Dofine could acquiesce and reveal the location of the ingots, the Acquisitor entered the system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the new arrival engaged the Nebula Front ships, Cohl commanded that Dofine be placed in restraints, and led out of the bridge towards the now-disclosed location of the ingots: the ship's security cabin. There, he and his compatriots, after a moment of awe gazing at the treasure, quickly extracted the ingots. Cohl ordered that the ship's cargo pods then be jettisoned. Curious as to why the intruder would not retain the ship's lommite cargo, Dofine was told that the released lommite pods would confuse the Acquisitor's gunners. As Cohl and his men prepared to board the cargo pod they had used to infiltrate the Revenue, Dofine asked what was to become of he and his crew. The pirate captain suggested that he empty one of the other cargo pods, and use that to escape, but the Neimoidian claimed that he would not survive the experience. Cohl then suggested that he best hurry if he wished to use one of the Revenue's escape pods."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dofine and his crew successfully reached an escape pod, and contacted the commander of the Acquisitor, Nap Lagard, insisting that Dofine immediately be put into contact with Viceroy Nute Gunray. Once his pod was recovered by the Acquisitor, Dofine was greeted personally by Lagard, before speaking with Gunray via hologram. Reporting what had happened, Dofine was surprised to hear that the viceroy was pleased with the developments. Gunray then ordered the commander to take command of the Acquisitor, and withdraw from Dorvalla immediately. Meanwhile, the Revenue was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Expansion and development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the wake of the Incident at Dorvalla, Dofine took the Acquisitor back to Neimoidia. To compensate for any potential humiliation that Dofine would face in the wake of the Dorvalla Incident, Gunray brought the commander into his inner circle of advisors. While at Neimoidia, he personally met with Gunray, Rune Haako, and Hath Monchar aboard his new ship. Together, the four Neimoidians were given demonstrations of new vehicles and munitions by representatives from Haor Chall Engineering and Baktoid Armor Workshop. It was Gunray's hope that by outfitting the Federation with newer, more plentiful weapons and defenses, they could avoid a repeat of Dorvalla. The two companies had been contacted by Gunray's new ally, the clandestine Darth Sidious, as Haako noted. Both he and Dofine were disturbed by the development, but Gunray insisted that they obey Sidious, if they wanted to enjoy longevity. Dofine and Monchar aired again later their misgivings on the alliance with Sidious to Gunray, but he chose to remain in league with the Sith Lord."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that year, during the Eriadu Trade Summit, all of the Trade Federation Directorate, save for Gunray, were assassinated, making Gunray the sole leader of the Federation. In wake of the disastrous summit, Dofine joined Gunray, Monchar, and Haako aboard the Saak'ak, while Gunray communicated with Sidious. Gunray was aghast at what had occurred at Eriadu, but Sidious pointed out that the viceroy, in a position of unfettered power, was now clear to acquire an army for the Federation\u2014an army that the Sith Lord wanted to put to the test. With the Galactic Senate's taxation of trade routes as a motive, Sidious suggested that they blockade Naboo, homeworld of Senator Palpatine, who had championed the taxation bill. Sidious was confident that Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum would not directly interfere with such a movement, and advised the Neimoidians to deal swiftly with any Jedi Knights who might feel constrained to interfere with the operation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 32 BBY, only months later, the Trade Federation had commissioned Trinkatta Starships with building fifty hyperdrive-equipped droid starfighters, which later went missing. Sidious dispatched Dofine and Haako to investigate Trinkatta Starships, find the missing fighters, and silence whomever had informed the Jedi Council of their whereabouts. As their mission was to be a covert one, the pair masqueraded as Duros traders. Haako first planned to investigate the Trinkatta Starships factory. Once they reached Curamel Intergalactic Spaceport on Esseles, Dofine suggested that they contact Gunray and update him as to their situation, but Haako scolded him, reminding the captain that theirs was a clandestine mission, and that they would keep it secret."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before departing to investigate the factory, Haako and Dofine decided to enjoy some refreshments at a local cantina, The Ion Sandbox. There, they noticed Boll Trinkatta meeting with his test pilot, Bama Vook. Once Haako decided that they should move on from the cantina, Dofine noticed Vook and Trinkatta leaving with two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. The pair of Neimoidians followed the group to Docking Bay 28, where Vook's ship was parked. Once there, they overheard that the starfighters were aboard a Bartokk freighter outbound from Esseles. They reported their findings to Gunray, who in turn relayed them onto Sidious. The Sith Lord decided to deal with the matter personally, in his own way, with his personal and most effective Zabrak agent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that year, the Saak'ak was taken out into Wild Space, where Gunray hoped to keep his new army hidden from prying eyes. While there, Monchar mysteriously disappeared, apparently having taken a hyperspace-capable craft from the ship's hangar, and a holocron containing extremely sensitive information regarding the upcoming blockade of Naboo. When Sidious contacted Gunray again, Dofine and Haako were present, but the Sith Lord was curious as to why Monchar was absent. The desperate viceroy, suspecting Monchar's treachery, lied, claiming that his lieutenant had been taken ill. Sidious, rather surprisingly, didn't appear to be concerned, and he gave Dofine and Haako new instruction that they were to hide their new droids, vehicles, and weaponry in their cargo ships, in preparation for their blockade of Naboo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short time later, Dofine and Haako received a transmission from a Federation representative on Coruscant. A member of the Federation, they were told, had been killed there, and although the body had not been positively identified, a piece of cloth found at the scene belonged to the deputy viceroy's mitre\u2014that of Monchar. Another body found nearby had been positively identified: it was that of bounty hunter Mahwi Lihnn. Together, Dofine and Haako relayed their news to Gunray, and began dreading, once again, having to tell Sidious of new but unsavory developments. The Neimoidians did not suffer any repercussions from the Sith Lord."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Invasion of Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As per the Sith Lord's plan, the Trade Federation blockaded Naboo, citing the taxation of trade routes as their inspiration. Dofine was by now captain of the Saak'ak, the flagship of the Federation fleet, and he had also recently fallen under investigation by the Bureau of Ships and Services. Dofine's presence at Naboo was seen as a comfort by the Republic, as it was known that the captain preferred a non-confrontational solution to most issues. Chancellor Valorum responded to the situation by dispatching two ambassadors to the Saak'ak, in the hopes of resolving the dispute. When the ambassadors arrived, the droid assigned to wait on them, TC-14, reported to Gunray and Dofine that she believed them to be Jedi Knights. They were, in fact, Jinn and Kenobi, the Jedi figures that Dofine and Haako had spotted on Esseles. The captain believed that the Chancellor had sent the Jedi 'ambassadors' to force a settlement of the blockade, but Gunray had other ideas. He ordered Dofine to go and personally distract the Jedi while he contacted Sidious. The captain balked at the suggestion, sending TC-14 instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Gunray initiated communication again with Darth Sidious to report this rather dramatic turn of events, Dofine bounded forward, only emboldened because he was overtaken by fear, and brashly advised the Sith Lord that his scheme had failed and that they were through with his blockade\u2014that they dared not go up against Jedi Knights. Sidious, disgusted by Dofine's cowardice, utterly ignored the captain, adjuring the viceroy that his craven subordinate was never to be seen in the Sith Lord's presence again. The captain, humbled, departed, leaving Gunray and Haako to converse with their frighteningly direct and ominous lord."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi were eventually driven from the ship, at which point Sidious gave the order for Gunray to invade Naboo. The viceroy did so, and his forces were able to successfully capture Theed, the planet's capital. Once the planet appeared to be secure, the blockade was disbanded, and only the Droid Control Ship Vuutun Palaa remained. Dofine was placed in command of the Droid Control Ship, from which the entirety of the Trade Federation Droid Army presence in Naboo-space was controlled."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Naboo were able to rally together in an attempt to beat back the invaders. The Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps launched N-1 starfighters to engage the Vuutun Palaa, while the Gungan Grand Army moved to engage OOM-9's forces at the Great Grass Plains. While Dofine's own Vulture droids engaged the N-1s, he activated OOM-9's forces at Grassy Plains, allowing them to engage the Gungans. As the battle raged outside the Droid Control Ship, officer Tey How reported that the ship's main reactor was losing power. Dofine dismissed the report, claiming that nothing could have penetrated the ship's deflector shield. Nevertheless, it was true: a child, Anakin Skywalker, piloting one of the N-1 starfighters, had somehow been able to fly into the Vuutun Palaa's starboard hangar, and fire a pair of proton torpedos into the ship's main reactor. The resultant chain reaction consumed the ship, ripping it in half, as Anakin escaped through the ship's main hangar. Just as Dofine looked up to see the starfighters retreating from the ship, the control computer console in front of him and the crew exploded. The massive explosion consumed the bridge, killing Dofine and all of his cohorts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Daultay Dofine was an exceptionally fearful being, even for a Neimoidian. He especially was afraid of beings that wielded considerable power, such as Jedi Knights and Sith Lords. He was not afraid of disobeying beings such as Viceroy Nute Gunray, especially if his personal safety was in question. Dofine was, of course, quick to follow Darth Sidious' dictates, except the Sith Lord's last to him, which then, it turned out, was the last dictate he was ever to receive from Sidious (as it was also the last time he would ever be permitted to see or be in the presence of his dark employer). Even so, Dofine was supremely confident in the strength and capabilities of the technology at his disposal. Being a cowardly being, he was self-indulgent and cravenly selfish, attributes reflected in his mottled skin. Dofine's character, productivity, and usefulness also suffered from his laziness and exceptional greed. Sith apprentice Darth Maul, who had listened to Dofine's proclamation of doom from the shadows (and had been required to 'clean up' after Dofine's failures), viewed the sniveling Neimoidian with as much disgust as did his master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dofine was both proud and defiant in the face of adversity\u2014until his personal safety was threatened; he was bold enough to tell Arwen Cohl that he would live to see the Nebula Front captain hanged for attacking the Trade Federation. He believed Neimoidians to be superior to other species, and disliked having to work with the non-Neimoidian members of his crew. While he was the commander of the Revenue, Dofine had become increasingly paranoid to external threats, and he took to pacing up and down the bridge. The Neimoidian was also flippant on occasion, as when he dealt with Dorvalla Mining and its human female representative. He was also very apprehensive about Gunray's alliance with Darth Sidious\u2014a view shared by some of his colleagues, such as Hath Monchar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The captain was widely despised by independent freighter captains, whose cargoes he was in the habit of preying on and seizing immediately, with out hesitation, unless his own life was endangered. If confronted with his thievery, Dofine would always claim that he'd mistaken the independent captains for pirates. In time, Dofine racked up a significant list of complaints against his name and character, including the sudden inflation of required transport fees from previously quoted credit-figures. No legal action was taken against the captain for his purported shady practices, but he did come under close scrutiny by the Bureau of Ships and Services. The bureau was able later to provide substantiated information to the Jedi Knights who were dispatched to resolve the blockade regarding Dofine's predisposed nature, deceptive demeanor and habits, which expanded to include back-stabbing and an aversion to confrontation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Daultay Dofine was conceived by George Lucas for Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. In the revised rough draft of the film's script, Dofine was described as short and fat, although by production, the character was thin, much like the other Neimoidian characters. In the film, Dofine was played by Alan Ruscoe, although his voice was provided by Chris Sanders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The digital card game Star Wars: Force Collection features a card for Daultay Dofine that incorrectly identifies the command ship that he perished on as the Saak'ak, rather than the Droid Control Ship Vuutun Palaa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
