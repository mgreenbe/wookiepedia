Loyal to the constituents who had appointed him to the Senate, Christo placed their needs before those of all others during his career, even the clone troopers who had been bred to fight for the Grand Army of the Republic. In 21 BBY, when Senator Halle Burtoni proposed a drastic increase in clone trooper production, Christo initially considered voting for the bill, especially after several opponents to the measure were pressured into supporting it by bounty hunters. However, he rethought his position following an impassioned Senatorial address from Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A male Quarren, Christo lived during the final decades of the Galactic Republic's regime. He was eventually elected to the Republic Senate, and he remained loyal to the people who had chosen him as their Senatorial representative. While on Coruscant to attend sessions at the Senate Building, Christo lived in an apartment in a residential block on the galactic capital, one that provided an expansive view of the skyline of Galactic City. During his career in the Senate, Christo came to admire fellow Senator Bail Prestor Organa of Alderaan, whom many saw as a voice of reason amidst the frequently unruly clamor within the Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the time of the Clone Wars, Christo supported the Republic's production of clone troopers, who were bred for the Grand Army of the Republic's campaign against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, to the point that he considered their purpose to be little more than soldiers marked for death. In 21 BBY, the war's second year, Senator Halle Burtoni of Kamino, representing the Kaminoan cloners who manufactured the Republic's clone troopers, introduced an emergency appropriations bill to order five million additional clones for the war effort. Christo considered giving the bill his support, especially after some senators who were opposed to the measure were set upon by bounty hunters, who pressured them into endorsing it. However, his as-yet undecided position earned him a visit from Senators Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Onaconda Farr, two of the bill's main opponents, who desperately sought support for their side in the Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At first, Christo dismissed Amidala and Farr's claims that the troop increase for the Grand Army would mean greater death tolls on the war front\u2014as he saw it, the clones were simply serving their purpose, regardless of whether they lived or not. However, when Amidala mentioned that Bail Organa, who was also against the bill, would soon be speaking before the full Senate, Christo reconsidered his position, though he only promised that he would listen to what Organa had to say. When the time came to vote on Burtoni's bill, Organa was severely injured by bounty hunters and was unable to speak. Instead, the scheduled address from the bill's opposition was delivered by Amidala, who won support in the Senate by arguing that the longer the war went on, the more it would consume funds for the Republic citizenry's basic services. She supplemented her case with a moving account of how the war had affected the life of an everyday citizen\u2014one of her handmaidens, Teckla Minnau. Christo joined in the thunderous applause that followed Amidala's speech, which resulted in many senators joining the opposition to the bill. Despite the efforts of Amidala's coalition, however, the bill was eventually passed by the majority of the Senate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A pink-skinned male Quarren with blue eyes, Christo lived in a Coruscant apartment decorated with an aquarium, potted plants, and various works of art, including a sculpture. As a senator of the Republic, he was devoted to his constituents and placed their needs and views before all others during his career, as his people had selected him as their voice in the Senate. He did not regard the Republic's clone troopers with much importance, believing that they had been created to die for the Republic war machine. When Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Onaconda Farr tried to persuade him to vote against Halle Burtoni's bill, Christo recognized their ideology but was not willing to die for such principles. By instead supporting the measure, he sought to avoid being attacked for opposing the bill, as had been the case with several members of the opposition, including Farr himself. During Amidala's visit, he remained uncertain of how he would vote and was unswayed by her argument."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like many others in the Senate, Christo held Bail Organa in high esteem, as the Alderaanian senator was regarded as a voice of reason amidst the often indecisively argumentative Senate. After discovering that Organa was preparing to speak before the Senate on behalf of the opposition to Burtoni's bill, Christo's respect for him caused him to reconsider his endorsement of the measure. Although he intended to listen to Organa's address before the Senate, he did not promise Amidala's coalition anything more than his attention. He eventually did rethink his stance on the matter following Amidala's moving speech to the Senate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Senator Christo was developed for the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series and was first featured in the episode \"Pursuit of Peace,\" which aired in December 2010 as part of the series' third season.
