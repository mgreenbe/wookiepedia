Considered to be one of the most dangerous specializations a bounty hunter can ply, Force hunters were renowned for the training they underwent to ply their trade; mental training rendered them considerably harder to find in the Force, with a conditioned mind that allowed for a higher resistance to mind-affecting Force powers and tricks. Additionally, Force hunters trained in precision fire - techniques that allowed for carefully timed shots that compensated for a Force-users ability to block and reflect shots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
