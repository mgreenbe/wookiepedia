The varactyl's flexible neck supported its armor-plated skull, and both male and female dragonmounts had crests and a ridge of mid-body spines displayed during courting. While females sported blue-green plumage and skin, males were mostly dull shades of orange and brown. Most important were the varactyl's five-toed feet. Not only could a varactyl run very fast, but their feet were adapted with tiny hairlike structures that allowed them to climb the rocky walls of Utapau's sinkholes. This marked the varactyl as an excellent mount for the native Utapauns."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A varactyl's vocalizations were short, loud hooting calls."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Varactyls were very intelligent creatures who long remembered previous riders. The varactyl's reaction to a rider depended on how that rider had treated it previously: it would be loyal and affectionate to a good rider, but hostile and dangerous to an abusive one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Varactyl subspecies included the dwarf varactyl, varactyl venomblade, varactyl preystalker and deathspine varactyl.

Varactyl were known to be loyal and obedient steeds. Riding a varactyl was reportedly similar to riding the speedy suubatars of Ansion. Both creatures were fitted with high-backed saddles for their riders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to track down General Grievous, Obi-Wan Kenobi used a particularly swift and loyal varactyl named Boga.

When the egg was subsequently lost, it hatched, and soon dozens of varactyl populated a section of jungle on the Wookiee homeworld.
