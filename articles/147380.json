In his unassuming position Arashai was able to obtain vital important information with regards to Imperial dissent. He believed that Alderaan Senator Bail Organa was affiliated with a growing resistance faction who opposed the Galactic Empire, and killed an Imperial Intelligence agent who believed the same, to prevent the individual from exposing Organa's covert dealings. He believed that the Alderaan native's rebellion movement would sufficiently destabilize the Empire, at which time the Nagai would commence their own invasion into the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
