Shortly after the battle, a Sith Lord by the name of Darth Malgus, who had participated in the Sith's attack on the Jedi Temple during the conflict, went to the medical facility. Malgus was looking for his lover, the Twi'lek Eleena Daru, who was in the hospital after being seriously injured during the assault on the Jedi Temple. She had been denied treatment at Imperial hospitals because she was alien, as the Imperials despised non-humans. Malgus demanded that he be taken to his lover, and the nurse volunteered to do so. While the nurse took Malgus to Daru, she told him that she did not realize at first that Daru was Imperial, but that she would have treated Daru even if she knew. When they found Daru, another nurse named Tal refused to release the Twi'lek to Malgus. However, the female nurse convinced Tal to allow Malgus to take Daru, warning Tal that Malgus was a Sith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Human female, the nurse was a heavyset woman, and to Darth Malgus, her blue medical uniform looked like a tent on her stout frame. She had freckles and red hair that she pulled back in a tight bun.
