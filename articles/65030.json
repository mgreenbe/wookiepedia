These included a Rodian, Zabrak, Nikto, and two Humans. However, the Friday Feature titled The Corellian Corvette identified this individual as a Trandoshan. The Friday Feature also gave him the name of S'lee, instead of Imo Vledmo. As the Friday Feature is the only official source that definitively confirms his species, this article assumes that he was a Trandoshan, even though he never appeared as such in the game. Furthermore, the name of S'lee is assumed to be an another name for Imo Vledmo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
