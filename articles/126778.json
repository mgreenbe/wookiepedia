The New Republic pilots Lieutenant Norra Wexley and Captain Wedge Antilles had traveled to the last known coordinates of Han Solo, seeking to find the former New Republic general. However, they were attacked by TIE fighters and Commander Valent's Star Destroyer Scythe. Despite being outnumbered, Wexley and Antilles were soon rescued by New Republic reinforcements led by Commodore Kyrsta Agate, who had been informed about the Scythe's movements by the mysterious intelligence source known as the Operator; who was actually the Imperial Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax. After the New Republic Starfleet refused to search for Solo, Wexley resigned from the Starfleet and enlisted a team to find the rebel hero."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
