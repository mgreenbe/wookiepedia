Sometime between 3665 BBY and the end of the war in 3653 BBY, a Republic Military squad under the command of Sergeant Fideltin Rusk attacked the outpost in order to rescue the prisoners, basing their assault on intelligence that stated the base's reinforcements would not arrive for another day. However, the reinforcements arrived early, giving the base's personnel a significant advantage over the attackers. Despite the enemy's superior numbers, the squad was successful in rescuing the prisoners and escaped the base with no fatalities on their side. Rusk would later mention the outpost while telling the story of the mission to the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial outpost was first mentioned in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare and LucasArts in 2011, during the conversation \"Bad Intel\" with the companion character Sergeant Rusk for the Jedi Knight class.
