By 5 BBY, Bail Organa regularly conducted surveillance on these resistance groups, with Fulcrum, secretly the former padawan of Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, who also gave these cells missions.

After the defeat of Rax and his forces, Grand Vizier Mas Amedda, who had been left powerless by Rax, signed the Galactic Concordance and the Imperial Instruments of Surrender, effectively ending the war and disbanding the Galactic Empire, instead forming into numerous independent governments such as the Coruscant provisional government."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Decades later, the First Order rose from pro-Imperial factions, including a faction formed after the Galactic Concordance.
