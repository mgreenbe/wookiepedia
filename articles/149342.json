Circa 21 BBY, while he was still a child, Trik, his sister Krizta, and a number of other Tarasin were kidnapped by the Zabrak slaver Haast Aath and taken to a slave compound on the planet Tharados. From there, Trik and Krizta were transported to the planet Kemix, where they were imprisoned aboard the capital ship Rightful Dominion. The Tarasin elder Mother Tysara hired the Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents, to return KTrik and Krizta to Cularin, and the agents subsequently tracked down and rescued the two Tarasin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
