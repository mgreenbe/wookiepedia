The starship was valuable to the First Order, so they entered the Mirrin sector of New Republic space and hijacked the vessel. Rapier Squadron of the Republic received a distress signal from the freighter, and engaged the First Order's forces. However, the Republic responded too late and the stolen ship entered hyperspace. Intent on locating the commandeered freighter, Poe Dameron of Rapier Squadron began an unsanctioned mission to find the vessel and prove the First Order's involvement. Determining the Yissira Zyde's possible trajectories, he tracked the ship to OR-Kappa-2722 and encountered First Order forces. Once Dameron detected the Yissira Zyde was aboard a Resurgent-class Star Destroyer, he retreated back into New Republic territory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yissira Zyde first appeared in Before the Awakening, a junior novel written by Greg Rucka and published in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
