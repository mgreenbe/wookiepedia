In response, the Empire diverted considerable resources including three interdictor vessels to apprehend the insurgents. The Immobilizer 418 cruiser's gravity well projectors malfunctioned, triggering a space accident involving several ships that claimed the lives of 1,100 passengers aboard the MC80 Star Cruiser Stellar Vista. Following the accident, the surviving ships were towed to Obroa-skai's shipyards for repairs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obroa-skai first appeared in Heir to the Empire, a 1991 Star Wars Legends novel written by Timothy Zahn as the first entry in The Thrawn Trilogy.
