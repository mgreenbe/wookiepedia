There, he was taken to the The Loft in the city Hestobyll, where he was tortured and forced to submit to the Sith and the dark side. With One's mind broken, Calician arranged for thousands more Celegians to be brought to Byllura. By utilizing the innate telepathic abilities that Celegians possessed, Calician established a Celegian network to replace conventional communications technology, whereby Calician would make One send out telepathic messages to the other Celegians on Byllura."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In c. 1032 BBY, the Jedi Knight Kerra Holt traveled to Byllura and infiltrated The Loft.
