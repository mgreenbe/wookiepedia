Alif planned to leave the academy until he became involved in an \"unauthorized murder\" by Esorr Kayin.

Alternatively, the player can suggest that Zyn requisitions guards to protect Alif. In both cases, Alif will send a message to the player that he had been shipped off to Dromund Kaas to serve under a female Darth.
