Most were triggered by physical pressure, such as a footstep. Other mines used a beam projector attached to a shaped charge that triggered when the beam was broken.

However, many varieties contained circuitry that allowed them to distinguish between vehicles and infantry, allowing infantry to lure vehicles to their certain doom. E-mag mines detect repulsorlift fields and trigger in the presence of such a field. Many other mines used proximity mines, such as the variety placed in the Naboo waterways during the Battle of Naboo by the Trade Federation. Luke Skywalker later planted an anti-vehicle mine on an AT-AT during the Battle of Hoth, successfully destroying it."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Known anti-vehicular mine types"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sky mines"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Long after the invention of terrestrial land mines, sky mines were developed.
