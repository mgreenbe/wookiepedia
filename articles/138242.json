One T-1 shuttle was utilized when the Jedi responded to the Eiram\u2013E'ronoh crisis, in which the monarchs of the twin planets Eiram and E'ronoh were kidnapped by the Directorate and held on the lost moon. The Jedi Masters Laret Soveral and Simmix, along with their Padawans, Orla Jareni and Cohmac Vitus, responded to the planets' call for help. While Simmix, a limbless Fillithar, was aware of the safety harnesses not being configured for his species, he laughed the issue off, saying he would take his chances.

On their way from Shuraden, they located a group led by Jedi Knight Vernestra Rwoh who had been stranded on the moon Wevo after a skirmish with the Nihil. The two Jedi landed on the moon, followed by Galactic Republic forces and other Jedi, who rescued the group on the starship Radiant Blessing.

Shortly after their arrival, the Starlight Beacon was officially launched with a dedication ceremony."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the dedication, Sskeer and Trennis were dispatched on a mission to respond to a distress call in the Kazlin system. The two were accompanied aboard a T-1 shuttle, piloted by Trennis, by the Jedi bond-twins Ceret and Terec, who practiced lightsaber dueling while in transit. They arrived in the system to find a derelict vessel and docked their T-1 shuttle alongside it to board the craft, discovering that it was a Hutt Clan ship that had been attacked by the Nihil. After the Jedi learned that the ship had been carrying Vratixian barley, a component of the medical substance bacta, from the planet Sedri Minor, Jedi Master Avar Kriss sent Sskeer and Ceret to the Sedri system on the T-1 to investigate the colony there.
