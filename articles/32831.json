DEMP Ion Pistol was designed as a infantry support weapon for the Imperial Army. It is the predecessor to the more known DEMP 2 which built on the same principles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The DEMP gun had three different power settings: The first setting only jolted a droid for a short time. The second could put a droid out of commission for a while with almost the same effect as a stun bolt would have to a Human. The third setting was designed to stop heavily armored droids and would completely short out not just the power cell, but fry the motivator and memory if used on a droid without heavy armor or insulation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A larger version was also available in carbine form."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
