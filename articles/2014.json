The story would have been set five to ten years before the Battle of Yavin, or approximately twenty years before Dark Apprentice, contradicting the preexisting figure of several hundred stories that existed at the later date. With the closure of LucasArts by its owner, The Walt Disney Company, and the cancellation of that game in April 2013, this idea was not adopted because of it. Instead, while Star Wars: 1313 was still in production, a 2013 episode of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television show, \"To Catch a Jedi,\" was created to tie in obliquely to the game by including levels from 1312 to 1315. A trivia slideshow on StarWars.com that accompanied the episode established the new canonical number of levels to Coruscant, increased from Dark Apprentice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
