Despite its smaller size, the A5-RX was well armed, being equipped with a pair of dual repeating blasters, a rear beam laser cannon, and a dorsal spread missile turret that could fire six missiles per round. The tank was first used by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars, and later by the Galactic Empire in the Galactic Civil War, seeing action across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The A5-RX battle tank\u2014also known as the A5-Recon, or A5-R, Juggernaut\u2014was a much smaller variant of the original HAVw A5 Juggernaut tank. Unlike the A5 and A6 Juggernaut models, the A5-RX was equipped with tracks instead of wheels, which, along with its smaller size, allowed for better maneuverability on the battlefield. The A5-R had a cruising speed of 13 megalights, and could speed up to 16 MGLT for short amounts of time. However, in spite of the A5-RX's reduced size, the tank was more heavily armed than the A5 model, including two dual repeating blaster turrets beneath the forward cockpit, which would overheat if overused. The A5-RX also had an aft beam laser cannon\u2014which could also overheat\u2014and a large spread missile turret on the juggernaut's roof that was capable of firing six missiles per round, requiring a short time between rounds to reload the missile turret."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The juggernaut could hold a crew of up to five beings, the first being a pilot who steered the A5-RX during battles. The A5-RX also could seat four gunners, the first two who operated the juggernaut's forward blaster turrets, the third who controlled its rear beam laser, and the fourth who managed the tank's dorsal spread missile launcher. In some models of the A5-RX, the tank's pilot could take control of its repeating blaster turrets and fire them while driving the juggernaut."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The A5-RX battle tank was first utilized by the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, being driven by the Galactic Republic's clone troopers. The A5-RX was designed for reconnaissance on planets where obstacles would often block the larger A5 Juggernauts, and was very effective in battle against the Separatist's OG-9 homing spider droid. During the Clone Wars, the A5-RX fought on a variety of planets across the galaxy, including Geonosis, Ord Mantell, and Mustafar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, after the Republic was reformed in to the Galactic Empire, the battle tank was used by the Imperial Army during the Galactic Civil War against the Rebel Alliance.
