It was there that a group of future Rebels met Sithless Leethe when he was trying to sell the Limping Lady. They arranged to meet with him in a Mos Eisley cantina to finalize the deal, and would later return to take the ship. However, by the time they got back, the Lady had been impounded by the Empire in the docking bay. They somehow managed to get past the group of stormtroopers who were guarding it, and blasted off without permission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
