They were sometimes launched from electrified net guns, which fired five yellow energy balls, between which the webbing of the net formed and expanded as it approached its target. When the electro-net made contact with its victim, it ensnared them and delivered an electric shock, rendering them unconscious before dissipating. They were also capable of disabling droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Trandoshan Lo-Taren used a stun net to capture Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano on the planet Felucia during the Clone Wars.
