Locb strongly desired the artwork and prepared two distinct schemes to obtain it. He would first try a convoluted con at the end of which Locb intended to win the piece at sabacc. In case this trick failed, Locb also forged a copy of the craft and hid it on one of the specifically-designed compartments of his ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Locb's first plan succeeded and, through cheating, he won \"Stars and Moons\" from Ammar during a high-stake hand of sabacc.
