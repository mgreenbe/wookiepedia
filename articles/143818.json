He is met by Prime Minister Almec, who claims Mandalore's violence died out with the warriors on Concordia, Mandalore's moon. Satine arrives and engages with Obi-Wan in a brief, flirtatious conversation (mixed with mild aversion) before Obi-Wan shows her a hologram of a figure in Mandalorian armor attacking a Republic cruiser.

After a brief struggle, the man jumps off a balcony, preferring to commit suicide rather than being kidnapped and interrogated by the Jedi. However, Satine and Obi-Wan manage to reach the dying man on the lower floor just before the Mandalorian whispers his last words to the Duchess in the dialect of Concordia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obi-Wan and Satine travel to the moon and are greeted by Governor Pre Vizsla. The Jedi decides to secretly investigate the situation on Concordia and gives Satine an earpiece so they can communicate. He travels by a speeder bike to one of the moon's supposedly nonoperational mines where, after a small scuffle, he is captured by two armed Mandalorians. He then contacts Satine, who is drinking with Vizsla, pretending Obi-Wan is meditating in his chamber and is going to join them in a few minutes. She excuses herself, and sets off on a speeder bike towards the mine, where she shuts down the mining machine which would have crushed Kenobi. They escape through a turbolift, but are cut off by a group of Death Watch members in armor. The group's leader orders an evacuation of the mines, then reveals his face to be Governor Vizsla, who has been plotting against Satine and the Jedi. He gives Kenobi's lightsaber back to him, then brandishes his own Darksaber. They duel, and Vizsla is defeated. He orders his warriors to kill Kenobi, who escapes with Satine down the turbolift shaft. They journey back to Sundari, where Obi-Wan tells Satine he believes the Separatists are aiding Death Watch. But despite the evidence, Satine vows to stay out of the war. Anakin arrives to report for duty, and he and Obi-Wan join Satine aboard her starship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The elongated shape of the Mandalorian helmets in the episode were inspired by Boba Fett's character design in The Star Wars Holiday Special."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hexagon design seen in the chest piece of Mandalorian armor is visible in elements of Mandalorian architecture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet of Mandalore appears significantly different from all of its past appearances, as a result of its new backstory involving a conflict with the Republic.
