Due to the gang's spy, Synara San, informing Gorr that the Ace Squadron was off-platform and the targeting computer for the platform's defense turbolasers was down, Gorr and his gang were able to do much more damage than in their first attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pirates were forced to retreat when Jarek Yeager and Kazuda Xiono of Team Fireball, who had been hired to fix the computer, were able to reinstall it, allowing Captain Imanuel Doza to activate the defenses and repel the pirates.

She subsequently found work in the Colossus' loading docks as a salvage worker but maintained contact with Kragan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Captain Imanuel Doza hired Jarek Yeager's Team Fireball to repair the Colossus' turbolaser cannon system's tracking computer. The station was defenseless because its resident starfighter squadron Ace Squadron was escorting an important fuel shipment. While repairing the tracking computer, Neeku Vozo discovered that they were missing a CoMar Tri-Tracker chip.

Synara managed to obtain a tri-tracker chip from a sunken cruiser. Kaz and Tam returned to Yeager's repairs and proceeded to install the chip into the tracking computer. Captain Doza demanded that Yeager's team repair the tracking computer within the hour. Meanwhile, Synara discovered that the turbolaser defense system was online and conveyed this information to Kragan's lieutenant Drell.

Shortly later, members of the Warbirds arrived on speeder bikes and began harrying pedestrians in the Colossus marketplace and loading docks.

Meanwhile, Captain Doza dispatched two security squads to the loading docks. Tam and Kaz soon arrived at the loading dock. Leoz tried to attack Tam, but she tackled him to the ground.

Yeager used the repulsorlift vehicle to knock out the Trandoshan who was attacking Kaz. Yeager then struggled to load the tracking computer into the repulsorlift platform but was attacked by Kragan. Yeager and Kaz's first attempt to load the tracking computer failed due to a misalignment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, at the loading docks, Tam managed to fight off Skreek and found Synara huddling by a crate. A Hassk pirate tried to shoot Tam but Synara knocked him out with a punch. Synara expressed relief that her friend had come to rescue her.

Kaz came to suspect that the pirates had a spy on the Colossus. Due to the events at the loading platform, Synara came to gain Tam's trust and the two became friends.
