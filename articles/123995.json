As a result, they joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic prior to the Battle of Hoth, which was fought in 3 ABY. Bey became a lieutenant in the Alliance Fleet and primarily flew an A-wing, while Dameron was a sergeant and a ground soldier. Bey also piloted an ARC-170 starfighter for the Rebellion at some point in her career.

Bey went with her husband and boarded a EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate for medical treatment for Dameron. After Bey recommended the use of A-wing ion cannons instead of the planned heating technology, this faster method was used with multiple ion cannons to melt new tunnels, though rebel Chase Wilsorr was unaware of what setting to use, resulting in a larger briefing room than planned."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Battle at Rendezvous Point Delta-Three"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the Alliance evacuated their base on Hoth, Bey and Green Squadron flew in support of the fleet's Fourth Division at Rendezvous Point Delta-Three. They were attacked during a blockade, in which the Imperials trapped the rebel ships between a nearby star and a screen of turbolaser fire from multiple Star Destroyers and cruisers, preventing any of the rebel ships from jumping to hyperspace. Bey was amongst many pilots trapped inside the cordon and defended the fleet from the waves of TIEs, although one EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate was destroyed. Bey called for Green Squadron to form up on her A-wing to protect one of the transports being targeted. In that moment, another ship arrived, with one pilot fearing another Star Destroyer but another pilot pointed out that it had a rebel transponder. That ship was the Millennium Falcon, which swiftly destroyed a squadron of TIEs followed by a turbolaser emplacement that created a hole in the cordon big enough for all the ships to escape to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Operation Starlight"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 3 ABY, Bey was recruited to lead Starlight Squadron under the callsign Starlight Leader, as part of the Fourth Division's Operation Starlight. The squadron was tasked with finding the scattered divisions of the Rebel Alliance fleet following the Battle of Hoth, to warn them that the Galactic Empire had cracked Alliance communications and to deliver a new Trawak code that C-3PO and his team had developed. During their search, the squadron discovered wreckage of the Sixth Division near Felucia and encountered Imperial probe droids waiting nearby. The probe droids latched onto the astromechs of the X-wings and attempted to access their archives. Fearing the probe droids getting the other rendezvous points, Wedge Antilles suggested shooting them off, however Bey questioned their ability to actually pull it off. Instead, Bey ordered all pilots to set their astromech's self-destruct and eject them. However, doing this meant losing their nav data and getting back home. With no other choice, the droids ejected and detonated, saving their valuable data from the Empire. With no time to catch their breath, the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Tarkin's Will arrived and attacked the squadron."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Battle of Endor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, the Alliance learned that the Empire was building a superweapon, a second Death Star, in orbit of the Forest Moon of Endor. The Alliance Fleet assembled and launched a massive attack against the battle station. Bey flew with Green Squadron during the assault against the Death Star, while Dameron served on the ground as one of the Pathfinders, an Rebel Alliance Special Forces unit under the command of General Han Solo, to destroy the shield generator protecting the Death Star. After the Pathfinders destroyed the generator, Bey and her fellow Green Squadron pilots defended the Millennium Falcon, piloted by General Lando Calrissian, as it entered the Death Star's super structure for the final attack. Calrissian and his fellow pilots destroyed the Death Star's main reactor, setting off a fatal chain reaction inside the station. Imperial ships began to flee in order to escape certain death, including an Imperial shuttle. Bey followed the shuttle to destroy it, but she was soon contacted by its pilot, Rebel Commander and Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, who had been aboard the Death Star\u2014and whose actions led to the deaths of Emperor Palpatine and his apprentice, Darth Vader. Bey allowed Skywalker to pass unharmed, and the Death Star exploded only moments later."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the battle came to a close, Imperial forces were left in chaos and, for the most part, retreated from Endor. Bey returned to Home One, the Rebel command ship, and reunited with those fellow pilots who survived. She received permission from Lieutenant L'ulo L'ampar, acting head of Green Squadron after Green Leader Arvel Crynyd was killed during the battle, to join her fellow Rebels on Endor, where they were celebrating their victory in the home of the native Ewoks who helped the Pathfinders destroy the shield generator. Upon her arrival, she searched the Ewok village for her husband, hoping to find that he had survived the attack. Bey encountered Generals Solo and Calrissian, and she asked Solo where she could find the Pathfinders and received a compliment on her flying from Calrissian. She soon found Dameron, alive and well, and the two went for a walk in the village to talk about their future. It was their hope that the war had come to a close and they would finally be able to resume their life together."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next morning, Dameron was called away by General Solo, who told the Pathfinders that there were Imperial hold outs in an outpost on the far side of Endor. Unwilling to leave Imperials for the Ewoks to contend with alone, Solo and General Crix Madine agreed that the Pathfinders would launch an assault to destroy the outpost and drive the remaining Imperials off of the Forest Moon. Bey volunteered to pilot the Pathfinders to the outpost, and the group soon set off for the far side of the moon. Once they arrived, Bey brought the Pathfinders' shuttle in at a steep approach vector in order to hide their approach. The vessel opened fire on the outpost, quickly taking out many of its defenses. Dameron and the other Pathfinders entered the outpost while Bey remained behind, waiting for some time until they finally returned\u2014bringing with them intelligence regarding the Empire's post-Endor plans.

Bey continued to fly with Green Squadron, while Dameron went on more missions with the Pathfinders to press the decisive advantage the Alliance gained over the shattered Empire. One of the operations Bey undertook was the Beltire Liberation, where she flew assist for Rampant Squadron. Seventeen days after the Battle of Endor, Bey flew in a battle in Cawa City on the planet Sterdic IV. She and her fellow pilots destroyed a number of TIE fighters, as well as an All Terrain Armored Transport, in their successful effort to liberate Cawa City from the Empire. After the battle, she spoke with L'ulo about how much fighting had taken place since Endor and lamented the fact that the war was not yet over. Green Leader encouraged her to take a lighter assignment next, as she had been working non-stop since the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three days later, Bey had returned to the Alliance Fleet and was assigned to be the personal pilot of Princess Leia Organa, one of the leaders of the Alliance, on a mission to the planet Naboo, where Organa hoped to rally support from the planet's government for the establishment of a New Republic. Together, they flew to Naboo without an escort; despite the princess' critical value to the Alliance, there were fears that a large group of ships headed to Naboo, the Emperor's homeworld, would attract Imperial attention. While en route, Bey talked to Organa as the latter wrote condolence letters to the families of Rebels who were killed during the Battle of Endor, including Private Able Nereno, a nurse aboard the medical frigate Redemption. The princess explained that she wrote each one personally, rather than relying on a protocol droid, as her parents\u2014the late Viceroy Bail Organa and Queen Breha Organa of Alderaan\u2014had taught her the value of a personal touch."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The duo soon arrived in Theed, the capital city of Naboo. Bey was surprised to see that Naboo was so peaceful, considering it was the homeworld of the Emperor. As the princess explained, terror was the greatest weapon that the Emperor possessed. For Naboo, their terror was the knowledge that he could have destroyed their world at any time, so they remained loyal to the Empire. Soon after the duo arrived, they were greeted by Governor Donta Gesset, who escorted them to the Theed Royal Palace to meet with Queen Sosha Soruna. Once there, Organa asked the Naboo to join with the Alliance in forming the New Republic and restoring the Galactic Senate. For the queen, it was an easy decision\u2014Naboo would join the New Republic. Just as she agreed to join, the Empire began to lay siege to Naboo through the launch of Operation: Cinder, a posthumous contingency order from the Emperor to destroy the planet's environment and render it inhospitable in retaliation for his death. To carry out the order, the Empire launched satellites from an Imperial II-class Star Destroyer, the Torment, in orbit. These satellites, designed to disrupt the environment of the planet, caused major storms to erupt across Naboo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the midst of the fires, flooding, and widespread destruction across the planet, Bey deduced that there had to be satellites in orbit in order to carry out such an attack. As a result, that meant starfighters would need to be scrambled to destroy the satellites. Although the Emperor demilitarized Naboo, some N-1 starfighters left over from the Battle of Naboo many decades earlier remained hidden in a secret hangar, though there were no combat-ready pilots to fly them. The queen escorted the group to the old hangar, where Bey, Organa, and the queen herself all volunteered to fly the mission. Although Bey was in the presence of royals, she was placed in command, at Organa's suggestion, due to her combat experiences. With the question of command settled, the three starfighters took off into the storm and readied to engage Imperial forces in orbit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Bey started destroying the satellites, the princess and the queen fought against approaching TIE fighters\u2014seventy-two in total, a full complement from the Star Destroyer. Bey's fighter was damaged in the battle, enough to where she was believed she was about to die. She asked the princess not to write the condolence letter to her family, as Bey did not want to add to Organa's burdens. Before the Imperial fighter could kill her, though, the two other pilots managed to destroy the pursuing TIEs and save her life. The three of them remained outgunned as they took out the remaining satellites, but they were saved by the timely arrival of General Calrissian and the Alliance Fleet, which had learned about Operation: Cinder due to intelligence gathered by Dameron and the Pathfinders during a raid against an Imperial Security Bureau black site."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The arriving Alliances forces destroyed the Torment, prompting Imperial forces to retreat to Theed\u2014where standard protocol would be to attack the city.

The months of continued fighting saw Bey growing dispirited about the prospect of the war ending anytime soon or being able to live a normal life with her family. Dameron put in his formal request to be relieved from duty within the Alliance, but Bey felt she had an obligation to continue fighting. Nonetheless, Captain L'ulo took it upon himself to submit the request on her behalf. She objected to the gesture, but he told her that it was not desertion. She had earned the right to live a life with her family, a life free of the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the request expected to take a week to be processed, the war gave Bey one last mission to carry out. After speaking with L'ulo, she was approached by an astromech droid named R2-D2. The droid escorted her to Commander Skywalker, who was waiting in the hangar with an Imperial shuttle, the Antarra\u2014one that he said flew better with a co-pilot. He sensed that Bey was familiar and she reminded him of their close call during the destruction of the Death Star, when she nearly shot him down as he was escaping, and Skywalker also knew about her through his sister, Organa. Skywalker asked Bey to join him on a mission to the planet Vetine in the Merrick sector, a mission that she said she was honored to undertake with the famed Jedi Knight. R2-D2 joined them on the mission as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While en route, Skywalker gave Bey an Imperial officer's uniform and explained that she would be posing as Commander Alecia Beck, an agent of the Imperial Security Bureau, whose clearance codes the Pathfinders had stolen during the raid at the Wretch of Tayron. Skywalker also explained that the mission was intended to retrieve something that the Emperor had stolen, but the Jedi did not explain what he was hoping to find. The Antarra soon arrived and transmitted its clearance codes, allowing it to land safely outside the Imperial base. Bey posed as Commander Beck while Skywalker acted as her bodyguard, a ruse that saw them greeted by Commandant Hurron. Bey claimed that she, as Beck, was there to perform a surprise base inspection. Hurron, who in reality knew that they were Rebel infiltrators, feigned ignorance and allowed them entry into the base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside the facility, Hurron explained that security at the research base was tighter in the wake of the Battle of Endor, with the base even more restricted than it once was. He further explained that one particular lab, the one that Skywalker was looking for, was accessible by only himself and the Emperor, revealing that he never understood the need for such a restriction\u2014until Bey's arrival. He admitted that he knew she was not Commander Beck, as Beck was missing her left eye. Hurron brought them into the lab where they found two tree fragments. Hurron's stormtroopers took aim at the two Rebels, and he asked why they would want to break into the lab to steal 'twigs.' Skywalker explained were the last two remaining fragments of a Great Tree that had once dwelled in the heart of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, before the Emperor stole them. R2-D2, who had been secretly holding Skywalker's lightsaber, released the weapon, and a battle against the Imperial forces began. Skywalker held off the stormtroopers while Bey and R2-D2 retrieved the tree fragments; R2-D2 released the force field holding the trees in place, and Bey caught them before they fell to the ground."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The three Rebels fought their way out of the facility and into its halls, where they were confronted by stormtroopers firing a blaster cannon at them. Skywalker destroyed the weapon and took out the troopers, giving the Rebels a chance to escape back to the Antarra. Once on the landing pad, Hurron and his forces caught up with them and began firing at them, though Skywalker merely deflected the blaster shots with his blade. Realizing that blasters were ineffective, Hurron ordered his men to throw detonators at them. Skywalker used the Force to toss them back, engulfing the Imperial forces in a massive explosion and giving the Rebels a window to leave Vetine. As the Rebels began their return trip, Skywalker said that R2-D2 had overheard Bey talking to L'ulo and knew that Bey was thinking of leaving the Alliance. Bey said she was tired and she felt guilty for wanting to leave, but that she knew the war was only worth it if those who were part of it could live the lives they fought to protect. Skywalker admitted that the only reason he asked the question was because he did not expect there to be two trees, and he wanted the fragment he did not keep to find a good home\u2014one with Bey and her family."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Later years and legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The request submitted by Lieutenant L'ulo was processed, and Bey's service to the Rebel Alliance came to an end.

Sometimes, she took Poe in the cockpit with her and let him sit on her lap and hold the controls, as she kept her hands on his and helped guide him in his earliest piloting experiences. They would fly together across the moon and even into space, adventures that made Poe come to love piloting. Poe's earliest memory was when he was two or three years old and Bey brought him into space let him play with the controls of the A-wing for the first time. Curious and adventurous even at that age, Poe did a few barrel rolls around the gas giant Yavin. It was through these adventures with his mother that he knew that he wanted to be a pilot like her. Poe also grew up hearing stories about his parents' time in the war. While Kes was open with him about his war stories, Bey never liked to speak about her time in the Alliance. All she would tell him was that her own actions were not important, and what mattered is that they and other Rebels stood up to the Empire and answered the call to help free the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the end, Poe never heard more of his mother's stories; Shara Bey died six years after the Battle of Endor.

Organa remembered that Bey did not want her to send a condolence letter if Bey had died over Naboo, but Organa felt that was her pride talking and that her death warranted a letter. She promised Kes and Poe that Bey would be remembered.

Losing his mother taught him that, amidst all of the heroic sacrifice in war, there were families who lost loved ones who would never return. After joining the Republic, he found the files on his mother's service in the Alliance and found out she had received numerous commendations, as well as significant praise from her fellow pilots. Like Bey and Kes, Poe came to fear that what the Alliance fought for would be for nothing; the First Order, which had risen from the ashes of the Galactic Empire, was becoming a threat to the Republic, but the Galactic Senate turned a blind eye because they did not believe that the First Order was powerful enough to threaten the peace that was achieved at the end of the Galactic Civil War.

In the ensuing events, Poe led the mission to destroy Starkiller Base, a First Order superweapon that had delivered a significant blow to the Republic by destroying its capital.

The reality of war, however, soon set in when Bey and others realized that the Empire would continue to fight against the Alliance. This strain made her further long to reunite with her family, particularly Poe, whom she rarely saw due to her duties in the war.

In creating the character, Rucka envisioned Bey as a tired veteran of the Galactic Civil War who comes out of the Battle of Endor feeling like the war has come to a close. This followed the tone of the film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, which ends with the implication that the war is over and the Empire is no more. The war continues, however, and, through Bey, Rucka was able to show how normal people reacted to the reality that the Battle of Endor was not the definitive victory the Rebel Alliance hoped it would be. By telling this story, Rucka hoped that he could show Bey's emotions, concerns, beliefs, and actions with the same emotional resonance seen with characters like Luke Skywalker in the original trilogy films, particularly Return of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In developing both Bey and Kes Dameron, Rucka envisioned a backstory for the characters that did not get included in Shattered Empire and is subject to change in future stories. Rucka envisioned them as two people who were running a cargo service and decided to join the Rebel Alliance after the Battle of Yavin. Because of their young son, Poe, they had to consider what the future for their child would be. Rucka has said that while that origin is not set in stone in any Star Wars stories at this point, it gave the characters an emotional core and allowed him to know what Bey and Dameron were fighting for in Shattered Empire. Rucka also wrote the 2015 anthology novel Before the Awakening, part of which focused on Poe Dameron. Poe's story saw him learning more about his mother's time in the war and what motivated her to fight for the Alliance.
