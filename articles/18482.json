The Blurrg-1120 was also customizable, as it could be modified to fire explosive bolts. In addition to this, it sported nine unique firing modes, including a standard single shot mode and a two-blast burst mode. Its final firing mode consumed a lot of energy, and didn't register how many shots were fired, forcing its user to check the indicator located under the pistol to know how many shots were left. The pistol was favored by the Twi'lek rebel Hera Syndulla."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The weapon was named after the blurrg, a creature native to Ryloth, the home of its manufacturer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
