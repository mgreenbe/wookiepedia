No longer able to survive in the wild, they were confined to the rocky hills in the Hanna Wild Game Reserve. They had hooves on their feet and bony protruding spikes, which they rattled and shook in displays of dominance. A cairnmog hibernated in winter, mated in the spring, and laid eggs in the fall. Female cairnmogs abandoned their clutch of eggs in the winter, leaving their young to incubate while they attempted to survive the cold temperatures. Cairnmog hunting on Chandrila was allowed, but carefully regulated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
