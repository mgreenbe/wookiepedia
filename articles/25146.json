When a player's card defeated another card in combat, the player was awarded a \"kill\". The stronger card always won, but a number of factors determined the value of a card, including strength, will, chance, and the color of the card. A blue card trumped a white card, a red card trumped a blue card, and a black card trumped a red card. The beginning of each round of play\u2014or \"hand\"\u2014was called \"launch.\" Betting could be matched or raised by each player."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cards in a Chambers deck included Courtesans, Destroyer Droids, Imperial Guardsmen, Clone Trooper Captains, Clone Trooper Privates, Viziers, and Emperors, all of which came in a variety of colors.
