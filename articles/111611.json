Under the Empire, he hoped to return to Kadavo and rebuild the Zygerrians' slave operation that the former Galactic Republic had ended. Raney's group of slavers, residing in the ruins of Old Ord Mantell City, had captured several slaves, as well as Muchi, an adolescent rancor that belonged to Jabba the Hutt. The Hutt placed a bounty on the rescue of Muchi, and the former clone troopers of Clone Force 99 were hired to rescue Muchi by the informant Cid. Though the slavers initially captured the troopers, the young clone Omega freed Muchi, allowing her comrades to escape. During the ensuing skirmish, the clone Hunter briefly fought Raney, incapacitating the Zygerrian."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Raney appeared in \"Rampage,\" the fifth episode of the series Star Wars: The Bad Batch, released on Disney+ on May 28, 2021.
