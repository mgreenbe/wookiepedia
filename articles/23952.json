While carrying intelligence data from Coruscant, Escalon was captured by Imperial forces. The Imperials did not find the stolen data, because Escalon stored it in a Swift 78B Vessel Courier System, but did sentence him to a spice-mining prison on Sevarcos II. Escalon was rescued by an Alliance Special Operations team aided by the Sevari nomad Jax Seldam."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
