It was described as being fairly far away and in an isolated location. Several years before 3 ABY, the Ewok shaman, Logray and the Ice Demon Stagorr did battle on the slopes of Ice Mountain, resulting in a devastating loss for Stagorr. The Ice Demon was imprisoned within Ice Mountain and was unable to leave. Around 3 ABY, Stagorr summoned the Ewok Wicket Wystri Warrick to Ice Mountain to force Logray into a rematch. The encounter resulted in Stagorr's death, and his frozen form was left firmly implanted within Ice Mountain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
