At that time, the Avenger aided Death Squadron's galaxy-wide search for the Alliance to Restore the Republic's headquarters, which led to the discovery of a hidden base on the planet Hoth.

The Avenger was part of the search, and sent probe droids to the Tokmia and Allyuen systems alongside another Imperial II-class Star Destroyer, the Stalker. Death Squadron was near the Qeimet system at the time one of the Stalker's probe droids discovered the Alliance's hidden base on the planet Hoth. Death Squadron made a series of jumps through hyperspace in order to reach the Hoth system, resulting in the subsequent Battle of Hoth. During the battle, the Imperial Blizzard Force made a ground assault on the planet while the Star Destroyers of Death Squadron waited to intercept Alliance GR-75 medium transports and other Rebel ships evacuating the planet. The Avenger performed well during the battle, where it attacked evacuating Alliance transports. Following the battle, which resulted in an Imperial victory and the Alliance being forced to evacuate their headquarters, the Imperial officer was stationed on the Avenger's command bridge when the warship was charged with pursuing the fugitive YT-1300 light freighter Millennium Falcon through the Hoth system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the pursuit of the Millennium Falcon, the freighter managed to outmaneuver the Avenger, causing it to almost collide with another pursuing Star Destroyer. The Avenger chased the Falcon into the Hoth asteroid field, where the Star Destroyer lost track of the fugitive Alliance ship after its crew unknowingly took cover in the mouth of a space slug housed in one of the asteroids. Upon Darth Vader's command, the Avenger traveled into the asteroid field to search for the Falcon, where it suffered significant damage. Eventually, the Millennium Falcon reappeared, and the Avenger spotted the ship during its attempted escape. Needa had a priority signal sent to the Sith Lord's flagship, the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor, with the message that the Falcon was about to be captured."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial officer was standing next to Needa at the viewport of the Avenger's bridge when the pursuit of the Falcon reached the neighboring Anoat system. The freighter moved into what Needa assumed was attack position, and charged the bridge as alarms were set off throughout the Avenger. The Imperial officer, Needa and the rest of the command crew dove for cover before the Falcon veered away at the last moment, and seemingly disappeared from the Star Destroyer's sensors. Unbeknownst to Needa and his crew, the Millennium Falcon simply landed on a blind spot of the Avenger's conning tower. Needa ordered the Imperial officer to track the ship, believing it might come for another pass, before the Avenger's logistics officer, Commander Nemet, reported that the Falcon was no longer on the Star Destroyer's sensors, and said there was no trace of the ship. Seconds later, the Avenger's communications officer, M'Kae, reported that Lord Vader demanded an update on the pursuit of the Falcon. Needa ordered the Imperial officer to prepare a TIE/sh VIP shuttle for his visit to the Executor, where he would take full responsibility for the loss and apologize to the Sith Lord. He gave the officer one last request to continue searching the area for the Falcon\u2014again to no avail, before traveling to the Star Dreadnought to meet with Vader, where the Dark Lord executed the captain for his failure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial officer took cover along with Captain Needa and the rest of the command crew when the Millennium Falcon flew toward the Avenger's bridge.
