He was trained by the Celegian Jedi Master Ooroo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Odan-Urr was a Jedi Padawan in 5000 BBY, and during his time as the Watchman of Koros, he had a series of visions depicting the impending Sith invasion. He and his Jedi companion, Memit Nadill, attempted to warn the Galactic Senate of the Sith attack, but the Senate refused to listen. However, Odan-Urr had the backing of the armies of Empress Teta, and participated in the Battle of Kirrek, where Naga Sadow's Sith Empire attempted to crush the Republic. The Republic emerged victorious, though only at the expense of the life of Master Ooroo. In the aftermath of the war, Odan-Urr found an ancient Sith holocron\u2014the only one known to have existed at the time\u2014which he kept safely at all times. Shortly thereafter, he founded the Great Jedi Library on Ossus, where he became the Keeper of the Chamber of Antiquities for several centuries. He also studied the Jedi Code during his time as a Jedi Master, creating a revised version which lasted for thousands of years after his death, until the Great Jedi Purge in 19 BBY. He was widely regarded as one of the most influential members of the Jedi Order for that work."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Odan-Urr presided over the Conclave at Deneba in 3996 BBY, where the darksiders known as the Krath attempted to slaughter the Jedi. Odan-Urr was one of the survivors; however, the attack was one of several in the leadup to the Great Sith War\u2014a galaxy-wide conflict which took the lives of hundreds of Jedi. During the war, Dark Lord of the Sith Exar Kun learned of Odan-Urr's Sith holocron, and went to the old Master's Great Library to claim it. Odan-Urr attempted to stop him, but the young dark sider lashed out at the Draethos with the Force, killing him. The truth about his death was only known by Kun, who lied to the other Jedi, telling them Odan-Urr had made him a Jedi Master before passing away. Odan-Urr was over one thousand years old at the time of his death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life and apprenticeship"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Odan-Urr was a male member of the Draethos species and was born some time before 5000 BBY. Odan-Urr had blue eyes and gray skin. Draethos were natural predators, and they were discouraged by their planetary leaders from ever leaving their homeworld. Those that did were usually exiled because the path of the warrior was not for them, and they were stereotypically very intelligent and scholarly. Odan-Urr was one of those exiles; he was found to be Force-sensitive, and eventually joined the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Odan-Urr became the apprentice of the revered Celegian Jedi Master Ooroo, who required a cyanogen-filled life-support tank for survival on oxygen-rich worlds. Ooroo was a Jedi instructor at a small Jedi Praxeum on a remote, mountainous planet called Ossus. Unlike most other aspiring Jedi Knights taught by Ooroo, Odan-Urr did not want to make history and was content to simply read about it. He spent almost all of his time in Ooroo's great library on the training planet, studying many ancient scrolls and documents and meditating on the Force. He had a particular interest in the history of the Sith, as well as some of the more obscure branches of the Force, including the Jedi power of battle meditation, the knowledge of which he would pass on to many students. Even after he completed his Jedi training and became a fully fledged Jedi Knight, Odan-Urr was still fascinated by legend and history and remained with his master at the Jedi Praxeum. He did go on occasional offworld excursions, though always at the urging of his master, and always with great reluctance. Ooroo let his apprentice study ancient documents of the Sith where most Masters would not, because he felt that Odan-Urr would never stray from the light."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Five thousand years before the Battle of Yavin, Odan-Urr was sent on his first mission to the Koros system to help Empress Teta in her efforts to unite the seven planets of the star system. He was reluctant when his master told him of his task, but the wise Celegian replied that a Jedi had duties other than reading and studying. Ooroo chose Odan-Urr over the other Jedi at the Praxeum because he knew that the young Draethos would help save lives and restore peace, even by his very presence. Odan-Urr then departed to meet with Memit Nadill, Teta's green-skinned advisor, in the city Cinnagar on Koros major. Nadill was a far more experienced Jedi than Odan-Urr, so Ooroo planned that he would temporarily become the young Draethos' master, teaching him skills that were necessary for a fully-fledged Jedi."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Unification Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Odan-Urr met with Nadill and warned him that he was not a martial man, and that he preferred studying to combat. Nadill responded that perhaps a scholar would be more effective than the warriors who had so far failed in their attempts to unite the planets in the system. Teta had managed to unite and bring peace to six of the seven planets of the system she ruled, but her attempts to defeat the rebels on Kirrek had been disastrous. They had managed to drive back all attempts to attack them, and had recently begun firing on any ship, be it civilian or military, that flew within range of their weapons. Nadill accompanied Odan-Urr into Teta's military command center as the Empress begrudgingly announced that another full scale military assault would be the only way to gain control of Kirrek, though she feared the casualties would be astronomical for both sides. Odan-Urr then told Nadill and the Empress of battle meditation, an old Jedi art that he had learned about in his studies. The Draethos Jedi told the others that the power would not only give Teta's forces victory, but would also lower the death toll for the two armies. Battle meditation could drain the morale of enemies and boost the morale of allies, and skilled users could foresee an outcome that they desired. Memit Nadill agreed to use the power, and asked Odan-Urr to teach him as they traveled to Kirrek. Odan-Urr was slightly taken aback at the suddenness of it all, but he agreed to accompany Nadill to Kirrek and help the war effort with his battle meditation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He taught Nadill the ancient art, which the Jedi Advisor quickly mastered. They arrived on Kirrek, and together they used their shared power, breaking the spirits of their enemies while boosting the morale of the Tetan forces. Teta's men soon looked like they would prove victorious, and eventually broke through the blockade set up by the Kirrek pirates. Although many lives were saved, the broken-spirited rebels became desperate, and attempted to take down as many of Teta's men as possible, even at their own expense. That was something Odan-Urr had feared, though the rebels were eventually defeated, and their leaders later reached an agreement with Teta. Odan-Urr had played a massive part in ensuring Teta was victorious, though he was greatly distressed by the death and destruction he had witnessed. He was particularly upset at the death of two Humans piloting a supply ship that had been caught in the crossfire and had crashed. Memit Nadill reassured the young Jedi Knight that it could have been a bloodbath but for his battle meditation, and that he should never forget that."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Odan-Urr wished to return to his studies in the tranquil Jedi Praxeum, Ooroo was impressed with how well his student had performed, and assigned his student to help Teta and Nadill restore order to the newly unified worlds. He then accompanied Teta at many gatherings and parades to show the people of Koros that the Jedi Order supported their empress. Odan-Urr, however, eventually grew tired of the attention and crowds. After one such procession, he and Memit Nadill rescued two siblings, named Jori and Gav Daragon, from two elite assassins hired to kill them by the Cha'a merchant Ssk Kahorr, who was owed money by the pair of Humans. The Daragons had been cornered by Kahorr's assassins when Odan-Urr and Nadill intervened, ordering the mercenaries to leave Jori and Gav alone. They refused, and attacked the two Jedi with their primitive weapons. Using his lightsaber, Odan-Urr lashed out at one of the assassins, killing him, while Nadill sought a more peaceful resolution: he disarmed the remaining assassin and allowed him to flee. He also advised the two siblings to leave, telling them they were not safe in the Koros system. Odan-Urr was deeply ashamed of his violent actions; his people were predators and he had acted on instinct."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Visions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that evening, back in Teta's chambers, Odan-Urr had a vision of the funeral of Dark Lord of the Sith Marka Ragnos on the Sith mausoleum planet of Korriban, and the repercussions for the Republic that would ensue. In the vision, the young Jedi Consular saw two aspiring Sith Lords, Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh, duel for Ragnos's throne. Sadow and his followers wanted to expand the borders of the Sith Empire and wage war on the Galactic Republic; Kressh and his more conservative faction, however, wanted to remain hidden from the Republic, and felt that a war with such an enemy would be devastating for the Sith. During Sadow and Kressh's vicious fight, the spirit of the late Marka Ragnos appeared, telling the two Sith that though the Sith Empire was at the height of its power, its fate hung in the balance. He then told Sadow and Kressh to choose their battles wisely, for if they made the wrong decisions, all would be lost for the Sith Empire. When he awoke from the nightmare, Odan-Urr quickly rushed to find Memit Nadill, so he could share the details with the Jedi Advisor. He eventually met Nadill with Teta in the Empress's chambers; there, he recounted the dream, and told them his interpretation of it. He remembered his studies of the Sith back with Ooroo, and knew that even though most had forgotten about them, the Dark Jedi banished from the Republic almost two thousand years earlier still posed a great threat to the Republic. Nadill trusted his young companion where many would not, and asked Teta to raise the matter at her next visit to the Galactic Senate on Coruscant. Although she did not understand the Force, Teta trusted her advisor and agreed to talk to the Senate about Odan-Urr's vision when she would visit Coruscant in three days time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two Jedi accompanied Teta to Coruscant three days later. Odan-Urr had never been to the capital before, and was in awe at the sheer magnitude and population of the city planet. Nadill, who had been on the planet previously, told Odan-Urr that the Force was strong on the capital, but so were politics. Teta and her advisors then entered the great Senate Hall to speak with the assembly. Odan-Urr wanted to address the senators and the small group of Jedi who had attended himself, but Teta knew politics far better than the young Jedi, so she gave the warning instead. She told the assembly of Odan-Urr's dream and what it meant for the Republic, but the senators were highly skeptical, doubting Odan-Urr's credibility on account of his inexperience, reasoning that these were simply bad dreams, and that they had far more important things to worry about. The trio left, dejected, though Teta pledged her full military support to the defense of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When he returned to Koros, Odan-Urr remained worried and distressed with what was happening, and spent much time studying the scrolls in Teta's library. One day while Odan-Urr was studying, Memit Nadill arrived in the library, and summoned him to Teta's audience chamber. He was apprehensive with having to meet with Teta first; he was expecting to have to go on another parade, but Nadill persisted and Odan-Urr was pleasantly surprised when he reached Teta's chambers, where Master Ooroo was waiting for his young apprentice. The old Celegian had also been plagued with dreams of the Sith, and had made contact with the three Jedi Knights present at the senate meeting. He then contacted Teta to learn of his student's progress, and when he heard that Odan-Urr had been having visions too, he immediately came to see his apprentice face to face. Odan-Urr was delighted to see his master again, though he expressed his displeasure at not being able to return to his studies; Ooroo replied that a Jedi Knight must learn action as well as knowledge. The Celegian Master then told him that should the Republic confront the Sith Empire, a devastating war would ensue; a war that would cross the fabric of hyperspace. Teta then led the others out onto a massive balcony and showed them her army, vowing never to let her system fall to outside invasion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Odan-Urr was looking at ancient scrolls with Memit Nadill in Teta's chambers when a female youth jumped from a window down in front of Teta. The Empress had survived many attempted assassinations in her time as ruler of Koros, so she initially thought the young girl was a particularly bold assassin. The young girl, whose name was Jori Daragon, fell to her knees and sobbed as Teta had her guards take the young girl away, but Odan-Urr's attention was caught when Jori mentioned the Sith Empire. He beckoned for the girl to be released, and she told him how she and her brother had set foot in the Sith Empire. Hyperspace explorers, they had entered random coordinates into their nav-computer and ended up on the planet Korriban. Naga Sadow befriended the two siblings, before forcing Jori to flee without her brother during a skirmish between the forces of the two competing Sith Lords. She had returned to Cinnagar on the Starbreaker 12, but was arrested for the theft of her ship. Daragon had managed to escape and thought that Teta was the only person who could help her. Odan-Urr knew the evidence could sway the Senate and the Jedi Order. Sadow, however, had placed a tracking device on Jori's ship, and was ready to launch a full-scale invasion on the Republic."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Great Hyperspace War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nadill traveled to Coruscant to meet with the Jedi Knights, while Odan-Urr and his Master helped Teta prepare for the attack on Cinnagar. He and Ooroo were to depart for Kirrek, where Odan-Urr had previously defeated the marauding rebels. The rebels had since pledged their allegiance to Teta in an attempt to gain amnesty for their actions, and had begun fighting against the Sith alongside Teta's force. Before he left, Odan-Urr gave a spare lightsaber to Jori Daragon, who wished to aid the effort to repel the Sith. He did not want to face real combat, and was worried about all the suffering and destruction that the war would inevitably cause. Ooroo, however, remained calm and attempted to help his apprentice feel the same, telling him that even though he was in a tank, the Celegian would also be helping the war effort. Odan-Urr eventually calmed down, and knew that the pardoned rebels and Teta's men would triumph over the Sith, and the exiled rebels on Ronika, the prison planet of the system, would soon arrive to act as reinforcements."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The combined forces of Teta and commander Llaban, the leader of the former pirates, formed a perimeter around a great stone citadel, wielding a wide variety of primitive weapons. Hundreds of Sadow's warships flew in the sky, sending down thousands upon thousands of Sith pods, each filled with well over a hundred expertly-trained warriors. The Sith attacked on huge Sith war behemoths and Sith war worms, charging for the citadel, ordered by their leader, Shar Dakhan, to tear down the great building and leaving nothing but rubble. After much fighting, the reinforcements from Ronika had yet to arrive, and the Massassi, a group of elite Sith warriors, were causing the Republic many casualties. Odan-Urr had tried to use his battle meditation, which had helped him before, but Massassi possessed a kind of single-minded fury that he could not sway at all. He became very worried, and asked his master how would they fight such a vast enemy. The old Celegian told his apprentice that they would fight them to the best of their abilities, with the Force as their ally."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the marauding hordes of Massassi moved closer to the two Jedi, who had yet to engage any enemies in combat, a young soldier roared at Odan-Urr, telling him to help them fight back the Sith, who had used to ladders to climb over the citadel wall. The Sith were routing the Republic above the citadel, though Master Ooroo had foreseen that. He ordered the Tetan forces to retreat, including his apprentice, who reluctantly agreed to back away after receiving stern words from his mentor. The young Draethos Jedi Knight watched in horror as his Master and friend approached the group of Massassi, who were encouraged by the sudden withdrawal of Republic. Ooroo then punctured his cyanogen tank with one of his fleshy tentacles. The life support chamber released his poisonous gas, killing many of the Massassi instantly, while oxygen flooded into the Celegian's chamber, slowly killing him. However, more Sith continued to attack. Suddenly, hundreds of ships, originally thought to be Sadow's, appeared in the sky. They turned out to be the soldiers from Ronika, and suddenly the Sith were on the back foot. Simultaneously, Naga Sadow's concentration had been broken aboard his meditation sphere, where he had been subtly affecting the outcome of the battles across Republic space, and using Sith magic to create illusory soldiers. The Republic force's morale soared after these developments, and they successfully drove their enemies off Kirrek. The Sith eventually fled to Korriban and the other planets of the Empire. Meanwhile, Odan-Urr grieved over the loss of his mentor, who was slowly being killed by exposure to the oxygen. Ooroo said he wished he could have floated out into the great seas of his home world one last time, and Odan-Urr replied that he wished he could have stayed with his master at the Jedi Praxeum forever. Ooroo then made a prophecy that Odan-Urr would become one of the most ancient Jedi ever, and would die among his beloved scrolls. The ancient Celegian then became one with the Force, and Ooroo's former Padawan was visibly grief-stricken."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aftermath of the Great Hyperspace War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Odan-Urr was left alone to his misery on Kirrek, as the victorious soldiers set about repairing the damage done by the attempted invasion. He commented that it turned out both better and worse than in his visions; the Republic had proved victorious, yet his master Ooroo was lost for all time. The despondent Jedi watched as the former rebels and pirates of Kirrek announced their amnesty, and that they should help bring a time of peace to the Republic.

Although it was said that intense interaction with dark side objects\u2014such as the recovered Sith holocron\u2014would slowly corrupt and turn the users to the dark side, Odan-Urr was able to resist the temptation of the dark side, and along with several of the other Jedi Masters of his time, he made several insightful discoveries into the history of the Sith. There were many aspects of the corrupt device that baffled Odan-Urr, and he did not claim to ever fully understand it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Odan-Urr had some interview with Jori Daragon and Anavus Svag about the events of the war.

Although Sadow had been chased to the moon of Yavin 4, and Kressh had been killed, many of the other Dark Lords and members of the Sith Council remained at large. Odan-Urr used the little-known power of Sever Force on the remaining Sith. The power drained them completely of the Force and was irreversible. Because of its permanence, Odan-Urr had to be careful when using the power, as the fate was to be reserved for only those who had committed truly unforgivable deeds."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The founding of the Great Jedi Library"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the war, Odan-Urr began to gather many ancient documents and study the Jedi Code. He had not forgotten his Master's dying words, and decided to build a Great Jedi Library, full of the ancient books and scrolls which he cherished. Shortly after the Great Hyperspace War, construction of the Great Jedi Library began on the planet Ossus, where Ooroo had spent many years training him previously. After centuries of gathering documents and building up the Great Library, Odan-Urr had made the huge complex a great repository of knowledge of all sorts, which acted as a training center for hundreds of Jedi Knights throughout its history."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Odan-Urr had devised a categorization system for the vast amount of documents he had gathered; they were stored in separate sections, depending on the age and importance of each. The four main categories were \"Pre-Hyperdrive,\" \"Pre-Republic,\" \"Early Republic,\" and \"Mature Republic.\" Most of the data was contained on reader tapes and holographic media, although some of the more ancient knowledge was stored on traditional paper scrolls and books. Although the ancient books and scrolls was eventually translated onto electronic forms, the Chamber of Antiquities preserved the ancient writing for historical purposes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Odan-Urr became the Keeper of Antiquities, presiding over the Chamber of Antiquities, which contained all sorts of ancient items preserved in the interest in history. He was of the opinion that all knowledge\u2014even knowledge of the dark side\u2014should be kept, and might one day prove useful. He kept the Sith holocron he had found after the Great Hyperspace War, storing it in the Great Library, though only Odan-Urr and those approved by the Jedi High Council were allowed access to it, and strict supervision was always in place. The Chamber of Antiquities was deliberately built like a maze, so that it was difficult for those who had not been trained to access potentially harmful material. He also believed that any one who wished to learn should be allowed to do so, so every stairway leading to the lower levels was open."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He eventually became a Jedi Master around four hundred years after the death of Ooroo, and presided over the Jedi assembly for another six hundred years, living through such conflicts involving Jedi as the Gank Massacres and the Vultar Cataclysm. Master Odan-Urr spent much time studying ancient scrolls and artifacts at his Great Library on Ossus, eventually becoming one of the most revered Jedi Masters of the era. Many of his teachings came from these years of meditating, studying and talking with the powerful Jedi Masters of the time."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi Code"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime around when he achieved the rank of Jedi Master, Odan-Urr began to extensively study the Jedi Code. His teachings on the Code laid the foundation of the Jedi Order as it was during the Jedi Master's time, and he was described by some as the most influential Jedi ever to have lived. After examining the Code, he began to lecture and teach others on the importance and meaning of the Code. His teachings, known as The Teachings of Master Odan-Urr, and his modifications to the Code laid the foundation for the Jedi Order as it was until the Great Jedi Purge of 19 BBY. Many Jedi complained of the Code being frustratingly difficult to understand, so Odan-Urr set about clarifying and refining it, and his version of the Code lasted over four thousand years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Teachings of Master Odan-Urr were thought to be very important, and many Jedi studied them, though few really understood what the Draethos was saying. He felt that, though they may have known its words by heart, few Jedi really understood the Code, and that only with a complete understanding of the Code could a Jedi truly achieve mastery of the Force. Odan-Urr also encouraged Jedi to meditate on the Force every day. He taught his students that by meditating often, they would be able to recognize their mistakes far quicker than if they did not meditate, and thus could set them right. He had other views on the matter, though he usually left them unsaid. He knew that by regularly examining his emotions, he could ensure that emotion, love, or ignorance were not interfering with his clarity of mind. He also felt that Jedi who refused to meditate knew they had acted wrongly and were attempting to lie to themselves about it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another of Odan-Urr's teachings was that the idea that a Jedi should never lie or manipulate, even for good, was nonsense. The Jedi Master taught his students that it was justifiable for a Jedi to act deceptively if he or she had righteous aims. He also said that, though he understood justice, it was occasionally necessary for a Jedi to practice discretion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He also taught his students that their use of the Force to satisfy their curiosity should be frowned upon\u2014though it was sometimes necessary to use the Force to invade the privacy of others, one should do so in moderation. Another of Odan-Urr's teachings which formed part of the Jedi Code was one entitled \"Honor the Jedi Order.\" He told the young Jedi that if one Jedi behaved poorly in front of a Republic citizen, that person might incorrectly think that that was usual behavior for a Jedi; it would take many more well-acting Jedi to change that person's opinion. Odan-Urr told his students to never act unkindly or in an undignified way in front of people. He had many more teachings. One of his lessons was that unswerving bravery was not necessarily a good thing. Many youthful and unexperienced Jedi thought that by being brave, they were removing fear from their lives\u2014it was said that fear led to the dark side. He told Jedi to act as the Force saw fit, and not in what was the most brave way. The Draethos Master also said that if a Jedi decided to draw his lightsaber, he must have been ready to kill\u2014and if he was not, he should leave his weapon at his side. What he meant was that a lightsaber should not be used to inflict fear upon an enemy, but to end the battle as quickly and decisively as possible. One of Odan-Urr's most famous comments, though not part of his commentaries on the Code itself, was that a Jedi should make sure to learn other skills, unrelated to their Force abilities."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Conclave on Deneba"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3996 BBY, Odan-Urr called a great Jedi Convocation at Mount Meru the planet Deneba. A rising cult, calling themselves the Krath, were wreaking havoc in what was formerly known of as the Koros system; it was now called the Empress Teta system in memory of the queen who brought peace to it some one thousand years earlier. The Krath, led by two youthful siblings of the royal family named Satal and Aleema Keto, had overthrown the Tetan aristocracy and were using Sith powers to quash any attempts by the Republic to capture them. Much of the Ketos' abilities were actually learned from Sith teachings Odan-Urr had recovered and documented in the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace War. The Jedi Masters were determined to bring the Krath to justice, though they also foresaw a far greater disturbance that was about to engulf the galaxy. As well as some senior Senators, thousands of Jedi from all regions of the galaxy attended, including such Masters as Thon, Arca Jeth and Vodo-Siosk Baas, as well as the foremost Jedi Knights of the age, Nomi Sunrider and Ulic Qel-Droma.

Qel-Droma, who had been made Jedi Watchman of the Teta system just prior, told the Jedi and Senators in attendance of his plan to bring down the Krath. Qel-Droma planned to infiltrate the Krath, pretending he had joined the dark side, and learn the secrets of Satal and Aleema Keto, and then use them to bring the Krath down. The other Jedi, both Knights and Masters, blatantly wrote off the idea.

Odan-Urr was one such Jedi, and he was too old and feeble to fight. However, shielded by many of Jeth and Baas's apprentices, he managed to survive, though the same could not be said for all the Jedi Masters. Master Jeth had been brutally killed by one of the war droids, something which Qel-Droma, who had been defending his Master, felt deeply responsible for. Eventually, the battle was won, though great damage to both life and property had been done. The Jedi discovered that the droids were of Tetan manufacture, and that the Krath had planned the ambush.

Qel-Droma, stunned by the thought of a student killing his own teacher, refused to acknowledge that this would happen to him. He aggressively accused Odan-Urr of disapproving of him, and, despite the pleas of Nomi Sunrider, told the Masters that while they preferred to do nothing to prevent evil prevailing, he would risk his life to do so.

He thought there were far too much war and too much fighting; war was inevitable, but it did not make a Jedi; the Force did. Nomi then asked him about darksiders using battle meditation. Remembering Naga Sadow's ruthless attack on the Republic, he told her that it was not unheard of, though rarely practiced at the time. He told Nomi of the Dark Lords, like Sadow, who sat in their meditation chambers, creating illusory soldiers to scare off the enemy. Nomi was frightened with the prospect of having to deal with such powers, and Odan-Urr described to her an ancient Force power, which he was adept at using. A powerful Jedi could use the Force to sever another from the Force, blinding them from it forever more\u2014far more devastating for the victim than anything else. Odan-Urr then told Nomi of the little known story of the Great Hyperspace War, how he used the power to sever many of the defeated Sith's connections to the Force, and how he had obtained his Sith holocron, which was, as far as he knew, the only one in existence.

Realizing he was in the presence of a deeply dark being, Odan-Urr drew on the light side of the Force and pushed Kun into the wall, believing him to be a corrupted Dark Jedi. Kun announced that he was in fact a Dark Lord of the Sith, and used the Force to inflict great pain on the ancient Draethos. Odan-Urr was too old and frail to defeat such evil, and fell to the floor.

He was, however, not without his critics after his death, with many arguing that he was twice responsible for the emergence of the Sith. They put forward a theory that had he not saved the lives of Jori and Gav Daragon on Koros, the two siblings would never have encountered the Sith, and that the Great Hyperspace War might have been averted. Over a thousand years later, yet more historians commented that had he simply destroyed the Sith holocron he recovered in the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace War, Exar Kun's rise to power would have at the very least been delayed enough for the Republic to defeat him.

He devoted his whole life to ancient documents, and during his thousand years alive he became a great repository for Jedi lore, often using historical stories to teach people what they needed to learn. Even while acting as the Jedi Watchman of Koros, Odan-Urr managed to find time to sneak off from proceedings and spend some time looking over the scrolls there, which he carried on his person at almost all times.

However, after his companion Memit Nadill told him of other ways to defeat his enemies, he managed to keep his anger in check. Odan-Urr was a deeply compassionate being, and in his youth mourned the deaths of both those that were close to him and those that he did not know. Ooroo's death had a great effect on his apprentice, and for days afterward he felt lonely and despondent, which was not the Jedi way.

Ooroo's death caused Odan-Urr great distress. During his time of Cinnagar, he won the trust of Empress Teta, and her advisor, Memit Nadill. Nadill, an older and more experienced Jedi than Odan-Urr, taught him some skills that one picked up with experience, while Odan-Urr taught the green-skinned humanoid things he had learned in the vast library in his Jedi Praxeum. Teta also trusted her Draethos advisor, and even risked ridicule by her fellow Senators when she took his word about the Sith. Another person who made friends with Odan-Urr was Jori Daragon. He ensured she was not imprisoned by Teta's soldiers, and, realizing her Force potential, gave her a lightsaber to defend herself with during the Great Hyperspace War, although after the war Jori did not continue her training. Odan-Urr was also liked by many of the other Masters of his time, especially Ood Bnar. The two companions were the oldest Jedi during their time.

It granted the user the power to determine the outcome of a battle, and ensure victory for their side. A Jedi could literally imagine what they wished to happen with their mind's eye and it would quickly become a reality, and they could turn their enemies against each other. It could also greatly affect the morale of both allies and enemies. During the final battle of the Unification Wars, Odan-Urr used the power to break the spirits of the Kirrek pirates, while simultaneously sending the morale of Teta's men soaring. However, the power had occasional drawbacks: broken-spirited enemies could often become desperate and attempt to kill as many hostiles as possible, even if it meant harming themselves.
