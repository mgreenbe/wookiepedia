Salvaged, rebuilt, and scrapped, Podracer engines were converted from the wrecks of starfighters, turbofans, and airspeeders. Hand-built and often custom jobs, it wasn't until closer to the time of the rise of the Galactic Empire that factory customs were designed and marketed as Podracer engines."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
