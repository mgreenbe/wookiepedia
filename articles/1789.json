The 690 was considered to be a small ship, especially for a freighter. The later model 720 light freighter was scaled up in every respect. A Verpine smuggler on Abednedo owned one that he used to hold captured stormtroopers. In the decades following the Battle of Jakku, a downed 690 light freighter was found by the scavenger Rey on Jakku's surface, and with the help of fellow scavengers Devi and Strunk, she was able to restore the majority of the ship's systems and make it operational again. The three took the freighter to Niima Outpost, where Rey planned to sell it to junk-dealer Unkar Plutt, however after Rey disembarked the ship, Devi and Strunk started the ship's engines back up and left Jakku, leaving Rey without the ship or her payment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
