It was the homeworld of the sentient carnivorous plants known as the Drengir and the haven of the Great Progenitor, the first of the Drengir. Several months into the Drengir's infestation of the Galactic Frontier, the Jedi Knight Keeve Trennis managed to locate the Great Progenitor through a connection to the Drengir. Suspecting Miluta's nature as the rootworld of the Drengir, Jedi Master Avar Kriss summoned a number of Jedi to assault the world during the time of the Republic Fair on the planet Valo. Nihil Tempest Runner Pan Eyta was aware of the situation, and was confident that neither the Jedi Order or Galactic Republic would be able to respond to the marauders' attack on Valo due to the Jedi being occupied on Miluta."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
