It commemorated the lives lost at the base during the early days of the Battle of Ilum against the Sith Empire in 3640 BBY, when Imperial forces overran Fray Landing. Consisting of a torch sconce, the memorial was built by other Republic soldiers sometime before the Gree species took over the Western Ice Shelf in 3638 BBY. \"Remember Fray\" became a rallying cry among the Republic as the war continued, and the battle there helped Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh secure a massive increase in military spending."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fray Landing Memorial was introduced to the 2011 BioWare video game, Star Wars: The Old Republic, in 2013 with Game Update 1.7: Return of the Gree. The memorial is located at the former site of the Republic faction's player-vs-player (PvP) base on Ilum; Game Update 1.7 overhauled the Western Ice Shelf and removed the PvP zone from the base, renaming it to Fray Landing. In January 2012, the early days of PvP combat on the planet Ilum, combat imbalance between the two factions after Game Update 1.1 allowed Imperial players to repeatedly push all the way into the then-unnamed Republic base. Republic players were immediately killed by mobs of Imperials upon respawning in the base, necessitating an emergency patch to fix the issue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
