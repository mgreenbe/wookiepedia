Unsatisfied with his station, he sought to become absolute ruler of the planet and went to great extremes to subvert the authority of the ruling monarch, Prince Mon Julpa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several years before the Galactic Civil War, Ko Zatec-Cha embarked upon a scheme to do away with Prince Mon Julpa for good. He used his magic to transform the prince into an addle-brained amnesiac. Dressing him up as a broken-down android, he exiled him from Tammuz-an, forcing him to wander the galaxy as a simple-minded drifter. One of Mon Julpa's loyal followers, Sollag Den, stole the Tammuz-an Royal Scepter and fled his home world in the hopes of one day returning it to the prince. This greatly angered Zatec-Cha, for without the scepter, he could not legally assume the power of the throne. Zatec-Cha hired a bounty hunter named IG-88 and instructed him to recover Mon Julpa and the scepter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, Mon Julpa found himself at the auction block in a mining colony on Tyne's Horky. There, he met the miner, Jann Tosh and the droids, C-3PO and R2-D2. Together they helped reunite Mon Julpa with Sollag. Sollag used the magic of the royal scepter to disperse Zatec-Cha's magic giving the prince command of his faculties once again. Joining with a freighter pilot named Jessica Meade, they returned to Tammuz-an to retake the throne."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "IG-88 eventually tracked them back to the royal city and managed to acquire the royal scepter. With it, he was able to successfully capture Mon Julpa and bring him before Zatec-Cha. Zatec-Cha cast the prince into a dungeon pit in the hopes that he would be consumed by a monstrous Durkii. The only thing left to do was to assume the mantle of King of Tammuz-an."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to properly obtain the title, Zatec-Cha had to present the royal scepter to the Keeper of the Tower and place it inside of a special housing at the first sun of the equinox. However, Mon Julpa managed to escape from the Durkii pit and intercepted Zatec-Cha at the tower. He took the scepter from him and placed it inside of the tower, securing his rightful position as king. Zatec-Cha was then imprisoned for his treason, his chances of becoming king forever lost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zatec-Cha was a male member of the Tammuz-an species with purple skin, a long black mustache, and a goatee.
