Circa 1 ABY, CorSec agents led by Captain Vitala Baize assaulted the base and killed the Grey Shroud leader Ebela Puckett. The assault was part of a larger operation which aim was to infiltrate an agent among the criminal organization known as the Chirq Council. The true objective of the assault against the Grey Shroud was to demonstrate the loyalty of the agent to the Chirq Council. The CorSec agent pretended that Ebela Puckett was an informant tasked by the CorSec to spy the Council. With the support of manufactured evidences, the agent managed to convince the Chirq Council underboss Jzoro Quanera that this story was real and successfully infiltrated the organization."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Grey Shroud terrorists appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
