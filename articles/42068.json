After exiting a room of Imperial stormtroopers, it was greeted by a fellow 3PO unit known as C-3PO but responded with a Huttese insult and continued down the hallway. After calling the protocol droid rude, C-3PO heard an R2 series astromech droid inside the room that E-3PO had exited and, believing that it was his friend R2-D2, entered to investigate the sound. However, instead of finding R2, he was blasted to pieces by stormtroopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "E-3PO was portrayed by Chris Parsons in Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, who also portrayed 4-LOM and K-3PO in the same film."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
