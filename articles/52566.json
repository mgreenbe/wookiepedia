Gamorr's technological level was equivalent to the low-tech periods which Human civilizations had experienced circa 25,000 BBY. The Gamorreans colonized the planet Pzob in the K749 system, and were the majority sentient species on Lanthrym in the Elrood sector. Their vessels provided only essential amenities, in addition to shields and weaponry. Gamorreans were typically green-skinned, with a large and powerful physique; they had a well-deserved reputation as fierce warriors, prized much more for their strength and personal combat prowess than for their wits. They were organized into clans headed by a Council of Matrons. In Gamorrean society, sows (females) performed all the productive work...while the boars (males) concentrated on martial training and waging war. They spoke Gamorrese (also called Gamorrean). One of their favorite weapons was a traditional war axe called an arg'garok, which was designed specifically for beings with extraordinary strength as well as a low center of gravity.

Most Gamorreans had a dark greenish coloration over a large portion of their bodies; however skin coloration did vary, particularly among females, with light skinned and two-toned pigmentation not uncommon. Black, brown, pinkish yellow, and even a rare white pigmentation were possible. Boars tended to have less skin variation and had a greater tendency towards dark green skin perhaps because of their higher exposure to the radiation of the Gamorr Star. Eye coloration varied evenly between gold-yellow, blue, black and brown. The Gamorreans generally put no importance on skin or eye coloration although there were some superstitions linked to certain markings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not all Gamorreans were heavy and squat.

The young were mostly born in the spring (\"slushtime\") and the litters typically ranged between three and nine.

They typically hosted about half a dozen morrts but a successful tusker could amass a much larger trove. They would often give a clan matron their morrts as tribute.

They all tended to follow the basic design. The simplest fortresses consisted of a stockade surrounded by a small village of huts and long houses. The clan-guard controlled the boundary of the fortress and kept unwanted visitors away. They domesticated dangerous predators called Watch-beasts to help protect these strongholds. Access to the settlement was through a gate and at the center of the village was typically the clan-house. This was a well constructed, heavily fortified building where the matrons and warlords resided. A small fortress would be inhabited by about 10 sows and 20 boars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An average fortress consisted of a village with a stockade that could be surrounded by a moat or other boundary defense. An internal sub-fortress was usually built around the village on a built-up or naturally occurring mount."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sub-fortress was a well-built construction that was sometimes built of stone and it was well guarded. In its function, the sub-fortress was a large version of the clan-house. An average Gamorrean village of this size would typically be inhabited by between 30 and 50 sow and as many as 100 boars. Immediately inside the main gate of the village was located a common area. This was a place where markets were held and it represented a safe area for other clan members. It was a serious crime to violate the strict no fighting rules in this area."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some of the most powerful and prestigious Gamorrean clans had larger fortresses that were effectively townships. The town was surrounded by an outer wall fortifications and a broad moat. It was often also divided internally by walls to reduce the impact of an enemy that advanced passed the main gate. There were several clan-houses in the internal structure and a sub-fortress that acted as a final refuge against an advancing army. Only about a dozen townships of this size existed on Gamorr and was populated by as many as 100 sows and 300 boars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several of these larger fortresses have constructed a foreigners' quarter within their boundaries where other clans could deal with each other in safety. Like the common area of smaller settlements there was a strict prohibition of combat in this area. Non-Gamorreans were often found trading in these areas. Most towns maintained a large landing field outside of their boundaries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some of the larger clan-towns formed sub-clans that still considered themselves part of the parent clan although local rivalries between sub-clans did develop. It was debated among Xenosociologists whether the development of these large clan-towns marked a societal change within the Gamorrean clan structure or whether these clan-towns would eventually collapse under population and social pressure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some clans formed small professional mercenary bands that move around selling their combat services to the higher bidder. Although it was not exceptional for fashionable clans to occasionally fight for another clan for pay, these mercenary clans did it professionally. They were, however, not totally driven by greed and the warlords of these clans still adhered to the tradition of fighting a blood-battle to complete a deal. Since these clans would go somewhere to carry out a contract they constituted a significant quantification of Gamorrean mercenaries in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The warring clans of Gamorr never united under the banner of one planetary government and therefore the Gamorreans did not have representation in the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Gamorreans were not known for their sensitive nature they were especially demonstrative when it came to their morrts and were particularly loving toward their children and mates. Signs of affection included a tackling hug and a punch on the snout.

Spring was called slushtime because of the melting of the winter snow and the abundance of rain and resultant perpetual mud. The wet conditions of early slushtime resulted in plentiful harvests of short-term fungi and provided a start for the longer growing moulds. During this period the veteran boars trained the younglings in combat and the unattached tusker boars roamed the land looking for adventure and opportunities. Early slushtime on Gamorr was a depressing time, the constant rain and dark gray skies often resulted in many Gamorreans feeling grumpy and miserable. Since Gamorreans idealized emotions of strength and ferocity it was not a polite subject to discuss their emotional degeneration in this regard. Most sows gave birth at this time which was about a gestation period from the return of the boars from campaigning in autumn. Mid-slushtime was also traditionally the time for marriage and for negotiating and finalizing Clan alliances and mercenary contracts. It was also the time when young boars were exchanged for fostering and the clan matrons readied their warriors for war in the summer. Toward the end of this season, clans tuskers tended to initiate raids against rival clans in order to prove their boarness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The summer season was called Wartime and initiated a period of military campaigning, often in retaliation for the raids in late-slushtime. The boars, unmarried sows (sometimes derogatorily called \"v'lch\") and young boars in training marched off to war. They left behind the matrons, married sows, elders and a small guard of boars to defend the settlements and fortresses. The military strategy of Gamorrean warfare was quite basic and involved attacking, plundering and the occupation of land. In early-wartime the clans participated in a number of small scale battles during which time each side probed the strength of the opposition for weaknesses. By the middle of the campaigning season the Gamorrean warriors had settled into the business of besieging opponents fortresses and as the temperature increase toward late-summer grand battles were fought as forces attempted to break from a besieged position."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the end of the summer period, the clans had spent the majority of their strength. There were a few late skirmishes in autumn (Croptime) as the clans made their way back to their homes in triumph or otherwise and by mid-croptime they had settled in for the winter. During this period, the sows and drafted tuskers harvested the crops and autumn fairs occurred as newly wealthy clans traded plundered goods and crops. The fairs also operated as a forum for the forming of new clan alliances. Also during this season, widowed sows advertised their availability and married, tales of heroic battles were told, wounded boars ceremoniously join the ranks of the veterans and the clans feasted for the last time before the coming of winter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Winter was called Coldtime and was a period of freezing temperatures and fierce storms on Gamorr. Clans that were too depleted during the summer campaigning season would often find themselves starving and this sometimes resulted in sporadic winter raids. In the more successful and affluent clans, life was more comfortable. Boars became docile and romantic, courting their wives as young tusker males did. This behavior by the boars continued into early spring when the first seasons flowers were picked and presented as gifts to the sows. The unmarried tuskers spent the winter worshiping a matron from a distance, planning for the next seasons combat and playing table games. During the winter and early slushtime, some skilled Gamorreans would ride sleds pulled by semi-domesticated Dwoobs as a method for transporting goods. They were generally only used by skilled sled drivers and most used simple wheel-barrows to transport goods."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Beliefs"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gamorreans were Animistic and believed that everything such as natural features, animals, sites of past battles and people had an enduring spirit that could affect the physical worlds. The superstitious beliefs of the Gamorreans, however, decreased over the last hundred years or so before the Battle of Yavin. Although they believed that everything had a lingering spirit, they were generally only concerned with powerful spirits that could pose a threat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Famous long-dead heroes, giant trees, large fungi, the spirits of murdered individuals and ancient fortresses are an example of things that Gamorreans believed could help or hinder the living. The association with how these spirits affected the physical world was based on the nature of the source in Gamorreans lives. For example, tree and mountain spirits were generally considered good because the source, with which they reside, provides wood and stone for building. This, however, did not mean that they believed that they were totally benign since trees would drop branches on individual and mountains would shed landslides onto unsuspecting Gamorreans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The spirits of the sea and forest were considered incomprehensible. Sometimes, they would let a traveler past and other times, they would hinder their progress. Forests were viewed as mischievous, they would change the path and, on occasion, swallow an entire fellowship whole. Gamorreans didn't like the oceans as they saw them as incredibly unpredictable. If treated correctly, they thought that the spirits would send favorable wind, and if angered, they would unleash a ferocious storm. Even if the spirits sent favorable wind and current they believed that the spirit, on occasion, decided to sweep the traveler far out to sea or draw the vessel into a watery grave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They believed that ancient fortresses had powerful and good spirits that could fortify the strength of defenders during an attack. Famous warriors who fell during an attack on a fortress were also invoked to increase the defenders strength. Such spirits were thought to protect a certain clan and they also included a powerful warlord who fell in combat, who was invoked to ensure victory in battle, and most importantly the spirit of the clan founder. The clan founder was a matron and it was believed that she sent dreams to the incumbent clan matron to advice in time of strife."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An ancient clan fortress and giant fungi were thought to house fertility spirits. In the case of the fortress spirit, it was believed to increase the fertility of sows during slushtime and croptime.

As such, the Gamorreans respected these spirits from afar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The spirit of a murdered individual was greatly feared by most Gamorreans. They were thought to be angry at being killed by underhand means and intent on seeking revenge against the murderer. These spirits were believed to walk the land of the living during the night, seeking retribution and killing all that they came across. According to the Gamorrean beliefs, they were exceptionally strong and dangerous but did not possess supernatural abilities such as invulnerability or the ability to fly and could therefore be physically fought by a warrior. Since the surest way to prevent the spirit from entering the physical plane was to kill the murderer, justice was often swift on Gamorr and Pzob."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fallen in great battles were thought to reside at the site of their demise and were believed to return during stormy winter weather to re-fight the battles.

Clans in regular contact with offworlders did not consider vibro-blades as magical objects as they did for a long time, and their increase in cutting power was considered a sign that they were a superior weapon. Vibro-axes were popular weapons among the Gamorreans and two examples were the Arg'garok and the Clan Groogrun vibro-ax. The latter was built on Gamorr by members of the Groogrun clan, such as the master weapon-maker Snogrutt. Another commonly used weapon was the Thogk, a traditional Gamorrean club that literally translated as \"log with a spike in it\". They were crafted with pride by pounding a metal spike through a long chunk of gorgt wood. Gamorreans also frequently wore armor called M'uhk'gfa. Traditionally, each suit of battle-plate was constructed from fragments of metals collected as trophies on a battlefield and bound by leather-straps. A segmented collar protected the neck while plates surrounded the torso and shoulders. Thinner plates were often attached to the arms that allowed a weapon to be freely swung. A helmet was also worn that took into account the Gamorreans horns. Since their introduction to the Republic, and later the Empire, the traditional skill of constructing M'uhk'gfa battle plates diminished and many Gamorreans started to acquire pre-fabricated armor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gamorreans had little interest in ranged weapons, such as blasters. When Republic scouts introduced them to weapons, they rejected them completely. The only way for a Gamorrean male to demonstrate his \"boarness\" was through close combat.

It was, however, acceptable to use blasters and other ranged weapons against other species and dishonored Gamorreans. Gamorrean honor was governed by a set of simple rules, mainly concerning the code of conduct for combat and warfare.

Although Gamorrese did not have a sophisticated written language, it did have a very basic runic alphabet which was used for record keeping, accounting, recording epic stories, and genealogy. Gamorrean genealogy was an extremely complex subject and was studied by a small class of scholar-lawyer sows who were known to memorize genealogical listings, heroic deeds and property transactions. The runic alphabet was only typically used by educated sows, although a fair number of boars could read them slowly. There were known to be several variations of the runic alphabet.

A draw-back for some employers in hiring Gamorreans was their contractual requirements. They generally did not consider a contract binding if it was not sealed in blood by way of combat.

They were forcibly indoctrinated through a cerebral feed and turned into stormtroopers. They wore pieces of stormtrooper armor by cutting out the sleeves or had fastened chunks onto their arms and chests with engine tape. Some of them had stormtrooper helmets perched on the top of their heads like hats."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The music band Deeply Religious had a track on their self-titled album called \"Gamorrean Hard Case\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the most notable Gamorreans was Voort saBinring, nicknamed \"Piggy\", a member of Wraith Squadron.

The design was later developed by Joe Johnston into creatures that resembled wild boars with snouts and tusks. In the original sketches these porcine creatures were wearing no clothing over their torsos. However, due to the limitations of technology in the early 1980s, this was impractical, and the creatures were dressed with the familiar leather and cloth uniform. Metal epaulets were added to the costume to conceal the shoulder seams.
