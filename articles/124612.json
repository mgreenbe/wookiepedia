They fired a slicing beam which was capable of going through a warship's armor. When the wing of a Venator-class Star Destroyer was cut away, it was suspended by other craft while a ship cutter spliced all the way through. The cutters were also used by the New Republic at the Nadiri Dockyards to disassemble captured Imperial Star Destroyers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship cutter first appeared in the 2019 video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
