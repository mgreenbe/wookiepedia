However, the trip was delayed as the rebels' stolen Imperial cruiser-carrier did not have enough fuel to make the journey. Thus, the Spectres traveled to Horizon Base to steal the fuel. There, one of the rebels, astromech droid Chopper, was separated and stowed away aboard an Imperial cargo ship. He soon befriended a protocol droid designated AP-5 and together they managed to steal the vessel. Upon hearing the rebels planned on stationing their base in the Yost system, the Galactic Empire set a trap there intending to stop them. When AP-5 heard where the rebels intended to retreat, aware of the Imperial trap, he instead recommended the planet Atollon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
