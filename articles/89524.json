Meysor owned a pet sarlacc, which escaped from captivity, causing a number of deaths across Level 1313, and Macran hired the bounty hunter Asajj Ventress to solve the disappearances. Meysor betrayed Ventress and rescued his sarlacc after she led him to the creature, but Ventress survived to track Meysor down.

Macran, unaware of Meysor's sarlacc, hired the bounty hunter Asajj Ventress to investigate the disappearances.
