While The Keeper was tasked by her makers with restoring their war-ravaged planet, the Keeper herself was confined to the caverns beneath her temple. She sent out her probes to do much of the actual work. After the Battle of The Keeper's World she used her probes to repair a scout craft belonging to the Alliance to Restore the Republic so that Princess Leia Organa, Luke Skywalker, C-3PO, and R2-D2 could continue their Mission to Akuria II."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
