One of these advance agents was Yomin Carr, who joined the research team at the ExGal-4 station on Belkadan. Keeping his goals a secret from others, he waited for a Yuuzhan Vong worldship that he knew would enter the galaxy at the point known as Vector Prime at a predetermined time. After it was spotted entering from the Intergalactic Void, Carr convinced the others that it was likely no more than an asteroid. However, some scientists went to investigate the occurrence from a position on Helska IV. During their investigation, they were abducted by the Yuuzhan Vong. Meanwhile, on Belkadan, Carr utilized life-forms to convert the atmosphere to toxic gases and disabled communications. While the gases killed those who ventured outside, Carr, revealing himself as an alien enemy, slaughtered the others."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Duel"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After receiving a report from Kyp Durron that Belkadan's communications were down Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker arrived at ExGal-4 and decided to investigate. Hiding in the shadows, Carr who was responsible for sabotaging the facility and killing its personnel, observed the visitors, but jumped into action after seeing the droid R2-D2, which he saw as a perversion of life. Carr chased the astromech until he ran into Mara Jade Skywalker. Carr mocked her, and then attacked, throwing a thud bug at her. Jade dodged it, and shot him with her blaster. However, his vonduun crab armor easily stopped the shot, stunning the woman. Jade then drew her lightsaber. Carr responded by throwing a dozen thud bugs, all of which she blocked. Though he attempted to stop her with adhesive blorash jelly, hoping to stick her feet to the ground and prevent her from moving. Jade was able to cut through it, freeing her feet. She charged towards Carr, lightsaber ready. The warrior countered with his amphistaff, a Yuuzhan Vong melee weapon. After a brief duel, during which Carr found her to be his equal, she killed him, stabbing the warrior in the heart."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After downloading all data from the main computer Luke and Mara set off to Helska system to find out more about the extragalactic invaders. Carr's death helped show the Yuuzhan Vong the skill of the Jedi, who were able to best even elite warriors in combat. Belkadan remained under the Yuuzhan Vong control for eventual use as a shipbuilding world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
