However, Darth Plagueis reveals that Palpatine killed his entire family, including his at least four siblings (and as he was the eldest of his brothers, they died without marrying or having children), aboard the Palpatine family starship in 65 BBY, and that he inherited all the assets of House Palpatine. Cosinga Palpatine's extramarital affair leaves open the possibility that the Pallopides' claim is valid, though in this way, she would be Palpatine's half-grand-niece."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
