In 25,793 BBY, the exiled Human Je'daii Daegen Lok planned to supply the Human Force Hound Xesh with the crystalline material of Krev Coeur in order for Xesh to construct a Forcesaber weapon for Lok.

The planet was depicted in a schematic of the Tython system. Since its establishment in 2008, The Old Republic's website has gone through a number of changes, resulting in the removal of some of the features and images that were originally located there, including the aforementioned schematic. Krev Coeur's name and additional information on it were provided in Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi 0, a preview issue of the Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi series of comic books. The issue was published on February 1, 2012, and was written by John Ostrander and penciled by Jan Duursema. The planet was also mentioned in the first and the sixth issue of the series, and made its first in-universe appearance in the seventh issue\u2014published on February 15, November 28 and December 19 of year 2012, respectively. The name Krev Coeur seems to be a modification of the french word \"cr\u00e8ve-c\u0153ur\", that translates into \"heartbreak\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
