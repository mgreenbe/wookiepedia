However, he along with Jet Nebula were captured by a Mandalorian bounty hunter named Dao Stryver. Stryver kidnapped Vii and Nebula and threatened to kill them if they did not tell him where the remains of the vessel, called the Cinzia, were inside the palace of Tassaa Bareesh. Vii told him and soon after former Republic trooper Larin Moxla and Vii's escorts broke in to where Vii and Nebula were being held.

However, it was Dao Strvyer who got the navigation computer, which is why they did not have coordinates.
