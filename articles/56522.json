Also, there could be up to hundreds of mines spread across the area to create an overlapping larger mass shadow. Some more expensive mines could even magnetically attach itself to enemy starships, making them unable to be destroyed without outside assistance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Hyperspace Security Net which was based in the Deep Core, used gravity mines and jammers as a preemptive against illegal spacers.
