When the plans for them fell through, they were then shipped to battlefield medical units on the front lines of the Clone Wars. It was there, due to its purpose of installing implants and organ transplants, where soldiers gave it its nickname of \"Galactic Chopper droid\". Soldiers also drew black humor from the fact that Ubrikkian was known for producing heavy machinery as opposed to delicate medical tools."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After early Ubrikkian medical units were used to create the cyborg Grievous, at least one DD-13 was used in the Emperor Palpatine Surgical Reconstruction Center. Darth Vader hated the DD-13s that attended him, and personally blocked the renewal of Ubrikkian's Imperial medical droid contract.
