Other legends claimed that visitors had encountered the spirit of Kaox Krul, dripping with lake water and bearing a lightsaber wound through his gut. These legends suggested that Krul's padded Sith armor might be found at the bottom of the lake."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
