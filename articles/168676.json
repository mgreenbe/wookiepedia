Long before the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Jedi Padawans traveled to Zoph in search of those crystals to complete the construction of their lightsabers. The crystals produced a devastating but unstable blade due to the crystal's resonance. As a result, the lightsabers were able to carve through durasteel, but were vulnerable to power fluctuations in the weapon's core."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later visits to Zoph for its crystals began to wane as the planet Ilum and its kyber crystals grew in prominence for the Jedi Order.
