The devices were powered by energy siphoned off from the Precursors trapped in the Lifewell, and expended after use. The use of DarkStryder technology essentially killed the Precursors. The technology only worked reliably in proximity to Kathol. The further away from the planet the technology was, the less reliable it was."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known modules"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were three common modules of DarkStryder technology, but it was theorized that many more, with other properties, existed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
