Having collected left over station parts from the abandoned depot at the planet Argoon, Vice Admiral Thrawn assigned Commander Buckeye and Nebulon-B2 frigate Ludwick the task of destroying a local pirate installation. The Pakuuni Pirates had massed a sizable armada of supplies, Corvettes, BTL Y-wing starfighters, and Z-95 Headhunters. Imperial Intelligence suspected that local pirate groups had been receiving aid from Rebel starships; members of the Secret Order of the Emperor also suggested that searching the containers may reveal contraband, consequentially requiring capture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Frigate Ludwick began the assault by launching three groups of TIE Bombers. The Bombers began attacking Corvettes Leach, Clavier, and Grapler as pirate Z-95s and Y-wings moved to intercept. TIE/LN starfighter group Theta Squadron was launched in response to TIE bomber loses, more apt to dogfight with the enemies' shielded fighters. Maarek Stele, flight leader of TIE bomber group Alpha Squadron, swung by the pirate containers during the battle. Stele discovered Rebels hiding among one of the containers; Assault Transport Tiger was launched from the Ludwick to capture the Rebel fugitives. As predicted Rebel starfighters arrived just as the last of the container that was carrying the Rebel Advisors was boarded and the Rebels captured, the container was destroyed. Having completed their primary mission Imperial Bombers returned to the hangar, leaving Rebel fighters to deal with interceptor craft and the Ludwick's turbolasers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Pirate base destroyed the way was clear to establish a new space installation and allow commerce to flourish.
