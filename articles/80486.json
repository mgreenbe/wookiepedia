The First Law of Motion stated that a body in motion would stay in the same in motion unless a force acted upon it. The Third Law said that for every force, there was an equal and opposite force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Three Laws of Motions were explained in the two volumes of the Star Wars Science Adventures series. In real-life, these laws are known as Newton's laws of motion. They were named after the English scientist Isaac Newton, who compiled them for the first time in 1687. The Second Law of Motion, which was not spelled out in Star Wars Science Adventures, states that when a force acts on an object, it will cause the object to accelerate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
