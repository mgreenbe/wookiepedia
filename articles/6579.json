It then was used to slaughter the leaders of the Confederacy of Independent Systems on Mustafar. Upon being confronted by his former master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Vader used the lightsaber to duel Kenobi, but was defeated. Kenobi took the lightsaber and brought it with him to Tatooine, where he kept it for nearly two decades until he handed it down to Anakin's son, Luke Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke carried his father's lightsaber during the Galactic Civil War, before losing the saber during a duel with Vader on Bespin. After the duel, Vader recovered the saber and brought it to Sidious, who placed it in his private storehouse, Mount Tantiss on Wayland. The lightsaber remained there until the Thrawn campaign, when the insane clone and Dark Jedi Joruus C'baoth, who had become the Guardian of Mount Tantiss, gave it to a clone of Luke he had created, Luuke Skywalker. During the Assault on Mount Tantiss, Luke and former Emperor's Hand Mara Jade faced off against C'baoth and Luuke, defeating them and recovering the lightsaber, which Luke subsequently gave to Mara."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Specifications"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Incorporating many of the elements from his first weapon, Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber was specifically designed to facilitate Skywalker's practice of Form V lightsaber combat. As per Form V weapon specifications, the lightsaber had a solid casing (either as a whole or in multiple sections for maximum protection against power surge deterioration) and a heavily shrouded blade emitter. The beveled emitter was designed to designate separate facets of the blade for either offensive or defensive purposes. The lightsaber hilt included a ridged hand grip, as Djem So required its users to maintain a solid grip on the hilt. It was also later modified to allow it to operate underwater."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before being passed to Luke Skywalker, the weapon's hilt had been slightly altered so that the original belt fastener was changed into a ring."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Carried by Anakin Skywalker (22\u201319 BBY)"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "First blood"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After losing his first lightsaber on Geonosis, Anakin Skywalker set about building a new lightsaber. He carried the weapon during the Battle of Rendili, but it didn't taste first blood until he engaged in a lightsaber duel. The weapon was also used by Skywalker in other early battles such as the battle with Asajj Ventress. After the duel, in which Anakin was victorious, the weapon was wielded by Skywalker for the rest of the Clone Wars. Anakin used this lightsaber for many battles to come."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Handed over"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin Skywalker wielded his lightsaber during the Battle of Teth, using it in a rematch with Asajj Ventress during the Republic's attempt to rescue the kidnapped Hutt child, Rotta, in order to curry favor with the child's parent, Jabba Desilijic Tiure. Escaping Teth alongside his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, with Rotta in tow, they managed to make it to Tatooine, his home planet, where they were shot down by Count Dooku's MagnaGuard piloted starfighters. Once landed, Skywalker sent Ahsoka to take an alternate route to Jabba's palace while he would serve as a decoy for Dooku personally overseeing the operation. Confronting Dooku in the Dune Sea, Skywalker wielded the saber against the Count in a rematch, before breaking off from battle when he learned that Ahsoka with the Huttlet had been ambushed by Dooku's guards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stealing Dooku's speeder bike, he raced across the desert to Jabba's palace and was met by Jabba's interpreter at the entrance. Demanding to know Ahsoka's location, the droid led Anakin into the palace to meet with Jabba, on the condition that Anakin hand over his weapon. Skywalker did so, but when he met with the Hutt crime lord, he learned that Jabba believed Dooku's deception that the Republic had kidnapped his son. In desperation, Anakin reclaimed his lightsaber and held it to Jabba's throat. Thankfully, before negotiations collapsed completely, Ahsoka Tano arrived with a still living Rotta. Despite his joy at having his son back, Jabba ordered the Jedi to be executed for perceived slights, only for him to be contacted by Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala who revealed that Dooku had schemed with Jabba's uncle, Ziro Desilijic Tiure, to kidnap Rotta. Jabba spared the Jedi, and made a treaty with the Republic."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Stolen"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the war, the Republic managed to discover Dooku's location aboard a Munificent-class space freighter. Anakin devised a plan to get aboard by getting himself caught, leaving his lightsaber with Obi-Wan Kenobi while wielding a replacement, allowing it to be destroyed to make his capture more convincing. Obi-Wan then infiltrated the frigate by entering one of the exterior hatches in a spacesuit. Rescuing Anakin and returning the lightsaber, the two went after Dooku. However, Dooku managed to flee through an escape hatch built into the floor of his meditation chamber, with Anakin in swift pursuit. Dooku managed to make to the hangar and take off in his ship just before Anakin could catch him, forcing Kenobi and Skywalker to give chase."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the ships flown by both parties were damaged and they crash landed on Vanqor. As the Jedi hunted for Dooku, the Count ambushed them in a cave, telekinetically causing a cave-in. With the Jedi trapped, Dooku stole Anakin's lightsaber and returned to his ship. There he encountered a group of space pirates led by Hondo Ohnaka. The pirates agreed to give Dooku passage to the nearest planet, Florrum. However, en route, Anakin's lightsaber was quietly pick-pocketed from the Count, along with Dooku's own weapon. The Count was taken hostage, and the two lightsabers were kept by Ohnaka as trophies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ohnaka proceeded to ransom Dooku to the Republic, and Kenobi and Skywalker were sent to confirm whether it was actually Dooku. However, Ohnaka then double-crossed the two and captured them as well, planning to squeeze more money out of the Republic. However, after several attempts, the Jedi and Dooku managed to escape, reclaiming their respective weapons. Kenobi and Skywalker initially used Ohnaka as a living-shield, but when Dooku fled, they let him go, wanting no unnecessary hostilities from the pirates. However, they also warned Ohnaka that Dooku wouldn't be so forgiving."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Compassionate mistake"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Ryloth, Anakin Skywalker was sent on leave for a \"meditative retreat\". Instead, he went to the Senate Office Building and tried convincing his wife Padm\u00e9 Amidala to come with him so they could spend time together. Amidala refused, as she was too tied up with her work. As a last ditch effort to sway her, Anakin entrusted the lightsaber to her. However, they were interrupted by Bail Organa calling Padm\u00e9 off for a Senate meeting. Amidala was forced to leave before she could return the lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unfortunately, a group of bounty hunters, led by the fearsome and bloodthirsty Cad Bane, attacked the Senate Office Building and took the Senators at the meeting hostage. While Bane commenced with negotiations with Palpatine, Anakin attempted to rescue the hostages, but being unarmed, he was brought down. Bound and thrown in with the Senators, he was able to retrieve his lightsaber from Padm\u00e9.

When Kenobi reminded Skywalker that they were on a rescue mission, and that rescuing the chancellor was more important than blowing up the ship by hand, Skywalker gripped the lightsaber with his mechanical arm so hard that its handgrip creaked in protest. Eventually, he wielded the weapon during his final battle against Count Dooku aboard the Invisible Hand. Giving into his rage, Skywalker viciously used the weapon to beat back Dooku and slice off both the Count's hands. Holding his lightsaber alongside Dooku's weapon at the Sith Lord's neck, Anakin executed the Count at Palpatine's behest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon afterwards, Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi were caught in a ray shield trap and were brought before General Grievous. The lightsaber briefly became part of Grievous' collection, with the General planning to execute him with it.

The weapon again saw use when Vader brought it with him to Mustafar and viciously executed the Separatist council. Its last usage in Vader's hands was in the Sith Lord's battle with his former Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. Vader wielded the saber aggressively, but was ultimately cut down by Kenobi's blade due to his own recklessness.

Without Kenobi present to train him, Luke was forced to improvise and self-teach, resulting in an instinctive though highly skilled practice of Form V lightsaber combat. On Mimban, Luke was forced to demonstrate this skill against Vader, though not before Leia Organa took up the weapon and stood against Vader while Luke was incapacitated. Despite her valiant efforts, Leia was only briefly able to hold her own against Vader, being brought down by several light though brutal slashes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that moment, Skywalker was able to free himself, and he stood against Vader. However, despite his own skill with the weapon, it was nowhere near enough to stand against the lightsaber's former owner, and Luke was forced to rely on the spiritual assistance of Kenobi to take Vader.
