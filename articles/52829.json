At some point, he acquired the nickname \"Crazy Man,\" which he acknowledged and allowed recruits to call him during their training periods. Trained in all forms of guerrilla warfare, Berra was assigned to Oracle Base on Tel III in the Brak sector, which operated as the headquarters of the Brak Sector Force, the local Rebel force in the region. He was the head training officer on the base, holding the rank of major, with a staff of four other officers under him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Berra worked from the Training Cavern, a large natural cave occupying the lowest level of Oracle Base. Berra and his team of training officers used the space to instruct recruits in combat tactics and weapons skills amongst a variety of terrain types. Berra maintained an office at the back of the cavern, and saw the entire level as his own domain. His job was to turn raw recruits into effective soldiers, and to give experienced troopers refresher courses or specialized training."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Running intensive training courses that lasted one or two weeks, Berra confined his charges to the Training Cavern. The recruits ate and slept in a barracks at the rear of the cavern, while Berra put them rapidly through their paces, honing their existing skills and making them learn new ones quickly.

He took comfort in the fact that his training would keep them alive, a fact that his recruits generally acknowledged and were grateful for when it saved them on the battlefield. Berra was trained in a variety of weapons, including blasters, grenades, missile weapons, and thrown weapons. He was also proficient in both unarmed and melee combat.
