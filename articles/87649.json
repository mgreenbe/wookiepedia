The title belonged to Kylo Ren, the heir to the Skywalker bloodline, while he was apprenticed to Supreme Leader Snoke of the First Order. In spite of this title, Ren was not their true master, as they were loyal to the resurrected Sith Lord Darth Sidious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After usurping control of the First Order from Snoke, Supreme Leader Kylo Ren deployed the Knights of Ren to hunt the Jedi apprentice Rey during the final days of the First Order/Resistance War. They also served as Ren's bodyguards, accepting orders only from their master to the consternation of the Supreme Council. During the Battle of Exegol, the Knights revealed their allegiance to Sidious, turning against Ren who returned to the light side of the Force as Ben Solo. Their combined effort to defeat their former master failed, however, and resulted in the deaths of all six Knights on Exegol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An enclave of masked warriors, the Knights of Ren served the will of a leader, referred to as master, boss or commander, who had sole authority over them. As such, only the master could command the six elite warriors known as Ap'lek, Cardo, Kuruk, Trudgen, Ushar, and Vicrul. Still, the Knights' true loyalty did not belong to this master, as their true leader was the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the reign of the New Republic, a gang of marauders strong with the dark side of the Force emerged from the Unknown Regions, calling themselves the Knights of Ren. Though they followed a warrior known as \"Ren,\" he did not see them as his followers. As with Ren, the Knights were devotees of the Ren\u2014a way of life epitomized by the lightsaber. The Knights were also followers of Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord who was killed during the Battle of Endor and returned by transferring his soul into a cloned body."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ren's Knights were ultimately inherited by the Jedi Ben Solo after he killed Ren and fell to the dark side. Though heir to the powerful Skywalker bloodline, Solo renounced his family and the Jedi Order, and desired to find his own path under the chosen name of Kylo Ren. The Force was exceptionally strong with Kylo, who inherited his connection to the spiritual energy from his mother, Princess Leia Organa\u2014daughter of the Sith Lord Darth Vader. After a grueling trial, Kylo was gifted command over the Knights of Ren by his dark master, Supreme Leader Snoke, who promised the fallen Jedi apprentice powerful followers if he proved worthy. With his new role, Kylo adopted the title \"master of the Knights of Ren.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Knights were absent while Kylo established himself as a warlord and champion of the First Order. As Kylo oversaw the First Order's hunt for his exiled uncle, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, the Supreme Leader sensed that a reunion would ensue between Kylo and his father, Captain Han Solo. Though Kylo had forsaken all he once loved, at the time he did not know that a Sith trial of ascendancy required the sacrifice of a loved one. Snoke warned his apprentice to prepare himself, for even the master of Knights of Ren had never faced such a challenge. Through the Supreme Leader's training, Kylo believed that he would succeed where his grandfather failed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately Kylo did not succeed in his trial; despite the death of his father, who was slain at the hands of his own son, Kylo remained at war with himself and was lost more than ever before. The experience, however, strengthened Kylo's resolve to carry on the tradition embodied by his fallen grandfather\u2014by becoming the absolute ruler of the galaxy. After killing Snoke, Kylo seized control of the First Order as the new Supreme Leader. It was not Ren's favored title, however, preferring to be known as a \"master of the dark side\" or \"commander of the Knights of Ren.\" Nonetheless, he grew accustomed to the authority of his new role while consolidating his reign over the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With his new title, Kylo gained the power and independence that he long coveted after a lifetime of serving powerful masters. By freeing himself from Snoke's rule, Kylo embraced his role as a Knight of Ren once more, but this time on his own terms. He did so not only by reforging his shattered helmet, but also by summoning the Knights of Ren to act as his personal bodyguards. In this the Knights functioned in the same capacity as the Elite Praetorian Guards who served Snoke."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Knights of Ren and the First Order remained distinctly separate from each other, with Kylo serving as the only link between them. The Knights followed commands given by their master and no one else, much to the displeasure of General Armitage Hux and other members of the Supreme Council. In 35 ABY the Knights were tasked to hunt Rey, a Resistance fighter and Jedi apprentice who vexed their master. In the end, the Knights lost their master when Ben Solo returned to the light side of the Force, destroying the dark persona of Kylo Ren in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Knights of Ren regrouped on the Sith Eternal planet Exegol, where Sidious planned to launch the Final Order fleet against the galaxy. When Solo arrived on Exegol, the Knights confronted their former leader in the waning hours of the First Order/Resistance War. At first, Solo thought that they would help him; he considered them his brothers, having trained with the Knights. Sensing their hatred for him, he realized that their true loyalties were with Sidious. While he took this revelation as the final betrayal in his life, Solo resolved to give his former comrades the mercy of a quick death, unlike Kylo Ren who reveled in the suffering of his enemies. Despite the Knights's initial success against their former master, Solo was connected to Rey through the Force, allowing the scavenger to pass the Skywalker lightsaber to the grandson of its maker by way of their bond. Claiming his grandfather's weapon as his own, Solo succeeded in killing all six of his former followers, destroying the Knights of Ren."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The title \"master of the Knights of Ren\" first appeared through Kylo Ren in the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, the first installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
