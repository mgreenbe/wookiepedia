Risha Drayen obtained the male shanjaru and wished to traded him to Drooga in exchange for a prototype engine. However, Momi Andrell and a group of animal rights activists working to save the shanjaru and repopulate the species stole the female from Drooga's pleasure barge and took genetic samples, sending them to Coruscant.
