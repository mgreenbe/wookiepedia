Finally, the Drall government could take it no longer. They secretly started to train troops and send them to Corellia and Talus to fight CorSec and its ally, the Fed-Dub. The patriot troops were no match for CorSec. It was not until the Selonian Separatists provided aid that they had a chance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Drall Patriots were present on Corellia after the Battle of Yavin. They were based in a cave in the Agrilat Swamp.

The agent assaulted the bunker and killed several Drall Patriot tacticians. Although it was discovered that the Patriots were hatching some future terrorist activities, no evidence of connections with the Chirq Council was found. In the meantime, the Selonian peacekeeper Dayana was also investigating the warehouse. The Selonian tasked a spacer to infiltrate the bunker in order to discover what the Drall Patriots were planning. The spacer downloaded information from their data terminals and Dayana was then able to prevent the Drall Patriots future attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
