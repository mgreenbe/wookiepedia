She knew how to handle a blaster, and had been in firefights before. She thought nothing of dodging blaster fire to rescue wounded comrades and drag them to safety. Inside, however, Genna was genuinely terrified. After tending to the wounded following a battle, Genna would go off on her own to cry. She also suffered from tremors in her hands, and needed an hour or two to calm down before she could perform any other actions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Genna was shy around the crew of the FarStar, but maintained her brave and selfless manner during ground combat.
