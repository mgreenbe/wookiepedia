This made a form of ice. This type of grenade was not commonly used and was only used by trackers/bounty hunters that intended on capturing their victims alive. It is believed that this type of grenade stopped being produced at the end of the Jedi Civil War, though some variants of this were still in use during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Revan once acquired a special cold grenade on Korriban.
