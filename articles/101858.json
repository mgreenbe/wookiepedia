When he left the cantina, he was attacked by Meatlumps. The technology-hating Meatlumps had picked him, because he transported electronics into and out of the Corellian system. Grissom however didn't know why they had attacked him and offered them some credits, which they ignored. The starship captain was lucky, as a large group of people left the cantina at this moment and scared the Meatlumps off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grissom reported the incident to the Corellian Security Force and Major Walden tasked an independent agent with the investigations of the Meatlump attack. After questioning Grissom about the incident, the agent sought out camps of the Meatlumps outside of the city that led the agent to the Meatlump Cave. There the agent found the Meatlump lieutenant Ubbal Fenn who revealed the reason for the attack on Grissom.
