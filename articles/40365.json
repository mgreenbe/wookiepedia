It also contained a mineral-rich asteroid belt, which was fist mined by Bothan interests after their scouts charted the system circa 200 BBY. Around 10 BBY, both Dressel and the asteroid belt came under Imperial control. The occupation of Dressel was particularly costly for the Empire, thanks to the Rebel-supported Dressellian resistance movement."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
