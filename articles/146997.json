He received an associate's degree from Broome Community College in Binghamton, New York. While attending, Todd worked part time for a local game company that was hoping to get the rights to Car Wars 3D. Because of his experience with playing Car Wars, he was asked to run a set of games at a weekend gaming convention held at the State University of New York in Binghamton (now Binghamton University). At this convention Todd found that there were open gaming sessions available for anyone to run the game of their choice. At this time, Todd's favorite game was Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game so he signed up to run a marathon 8 hour gaming session. Much to his surprise Bill Smith was in attendance to Todd's gaming session. Bill was impressed with Todd's intimate knowledge of the Star Wars universe; he was reciting information from memory, and if not remembering it, he was able to recall the page numbers of the associated material. After the game, Bill invited Todd to West End Games and offered him a position as a play-tester and advisor for the upcoming 2nd Edition of Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Todd offered a great deal of advice to Bill Smith regarding various gameplay components and technical knowledge of the Star Wars Universe. Upon his urging, the original design for droid creation was scrapped, putting in place a simplistic one of his design. This was due to a rather late idea for a complete module on droid creation. Unfortunately, Todd's time at West End Games ended before he was able to complete the module. Todd also contributed a short adventure, Scavenger Hunt for the collection of adventures in Twin Stars of Kira. He felt this wasn't his best work as he had a short timetable and was under some pressure due to schoolwork to get it out on time. He was offered the chance to write a sourcebook covering the Lando Calrissian novels by L. Neil Smith; Lando Calrissian and the Mindharp of Sharu, Lando Calrissian and the Flamewind of Oseon, and Lando Calrissian and the Starcave of ThonBoka. However, again due to time constraints to schoolwork, Todd had to turn down the offer. He has regretted it ever since."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Todd lives with his wife Heather and three daughters; Sabrina, Talia, and Mikayla. Three cats also share their living space in the Village of Endicott, NY. Currently Todd writes for The Upright Motorcycle Brigade, a blog on motorcycle safety that he runs. Though it has been some time, Todd greatly misses writing for West End Games and especially Star Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars contributions"}]}
