The facility also contained three shielded relay dishes for the laser's targeting system. However, even without the relay dishes, the superlaser's aim was accurate enough to attack its targets. The superlaser itself was powered by a turbine made of three turbines, the destruction of which would also result the facility's destruction. It was guarded by various TIE fighters, missile droids, and Imperial submarines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The superlaser facility featured three landing platforms arrayed around the center, where the superlaser bowl was. The platforms were guarded by All Terrain Scout Transports and stormtrooper squads with E-Web heavy repeating blasters. Each landing platform featured an elevator to the lower level, which was circular and had featured transport tracks and overhead conveyors. Walkways from the lower level reached into the turbine area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the installation was part of a plot to destroy a Rebel Alliance convoy in 3 ABY.
