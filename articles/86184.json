During that time the Empire also plundered vast amounts of Beskar from the Mandalorians. The Mandalorians took orphans in as foundlings. One Mandalorian tribe hid in an enclave under Nevarro city on the planet Nevarro. However, after they fought the Bounty Hunters' Guild in the city, an Imperial remnant cracked down on them, killing many. Their armor was piled up in the enclave to be salvaged by the Armorer, one of the only survivors from the tribe.

Kryze revealed that her true objective was to fully capture the ship and storm the bridge even to the distraught and shock of Djarin.

Fett would then demand his armor be returned to him, having tracked it and the Mandalorian to the inner core planet. Djarin refused, stating the armor was looted in the Great Purge and belonged to the Mandalorian people. Fett would argue, however, that the armor had in fact been passed down to him from his father, who had been gifted it by one of Djarin's forebearers. The arrival of Imperial remnants would cut the conversation short, with Fett offering to trade the return of his armor in exchange for guaranteeing both Grogu and Djarin's safety. During the ensuing conflict, Fett would take his armor from Djarin's Razor Crest, while Shand and Djarin continued to fight the reinforced Imperial remnants. Late into the skirmish, Djarin and Shand would find themselves surrounded, outmanned, and outgunned. Djarin would use his beskar-clad body to prevent Shand from being hit by Imperial blaster fire while the two returned fire. Fett would drop two explosives on the battlefield from above, then display its capabilities by singlehandedly eliminating an entire platoon of stormtroopers, as well as two Imperial troop dropships. Fett utilized an array of offensive weapons including a wrist blaster, micro rockets, kneepad rocket darts, and a jetpack-launched missile. Afterward, Fett would show Djarin his chain code, which proved that the ownership of the armor had indeed been that of a Mandalorian foundling; Boba's father, Jango Fett.
