By the time of the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic the family was extensive and had roots in numerous locations including Coruscant, the galactic capital. There the family set up their eldest daughter at the time, Jovel Nial, as a Senatorial aide to the senator Trellev Aquem of the Imperial Senate.
