Namir took command in Evon's place, and Chalis forged a new plan for them, named Operation Ringbreaker. Namir led the 61st through this campaign on multiple planets until the Thunderstrike was shot down on Sullust, leaving them stranded.

During his time there, he frequently recited the religious text Tome of the Hieroprince. Namir also befriended a girl called Pira Ten, who became family to him.

Stumbling from his own fatigue, Namir strode over a hill and fell over a three meter escarpment into a ditch, injuring his legs.

Sairgon led Namir to Howl, and he gave him the report. Howl then told Namir to walk with him, and as they walked, he acknowledged Namir's heroic acts within the company. He then asked Namir what Twilight Company could do in their final day or two on Vir Aphshire.

Twilight Company fought in many battles against the Empire during the advancement into the Mid Rim, on planets such as Phorsa Gedd and Bamayar. When the alliance's forces were overstretched, the advancement was halted and the Mid Rim Retreat began. He and Twilight Company helped evacuate bases and rescue rebel heroes and generals.

After stopping to receive further orders over their comlink, they were ambushed by four stormtroopers, one of which fired a rocket at the trio. Namir gave orders to the other two and fired at the stormtroopers, one of them dropping to the ground from his and Charmer's shots.

Namir, Charmer and Brand entered the mansion, leaving Gadren on standby as the grappling line could not take his weight. They roamed around the place, finding a line of statues of Imperial officials. When they got to the stairs, Charmer spotted two lightly armored local guards. Brand engaged first, quickly killing a guard with her knife.

She shot the colonel, whom Namir had been pointing his gun at, and Namir and the other two began killing the rest of the officers.

She called herself Roach, despite Namir telling her she could pick a better name. Namir asked her about the White Book, the Alliance's training manual. She answered him with enough evidence that she had read it, which Namir had not, and he then contradicted the book, assuring the recruits that they did not need to take it seriously.

But he did not stay there long, as Sergeant Fektrin called him over to him. As the two discussed the situation, the Thunderstrike took another hit, and Fektrin received word of a hull breach around where Chalis was being held. Namir rushed to the brig and found the area burning from the damage. At the airlock, the guard, Maediyu, was unconscious, and Chalis was sitting cross-legged inside. Namir used his codes to open the door. Chalis, unfortunately, was not dressed to go back through the fire, so Namir took Maediyu in.

Namir and Zab's squads were deployed together to take out an Imperial scout post. The two teams attacked from opposite sides and Gadren charged through with his blaster cannon. A grenadier almost killed the Besalisk but, luckily for him, the grenade did not detonate. Namir led Roach, who had replaced Charmer in his squad, to cover the others and two of Zab's men supported Gadren at the center of the camp to keep the Imperials from grouping up.

At first, their efforts were a disaster, with the group enduring a series of unique but unsuccessful efforts to take the walker out. In the afternoon, they attacked it with a series of hit-and-run engagements. Roach lobbed a grenade close enough to visibly damage the walker, and by the evening, Namir devised a new tactic.

Once the barrel exploded, the compound began evacuating, and Namir's squad entered the compound through one of the back entrances.

After decimating the forces and moving on again, the two ships were attacked in the Chonsetta system, nineteen hours later, by a dozen TIE Interceptors. Twilight Company escaped with minor damages, but more Imperial groups were reportedly disengaging from Rebel engagements to hunt them.

She proposed finding an Imperial cargo transport and boarding it. Sairgon was skeptical of this, but Howl interrupted the ensuing debate and asked Namir if it could be done.

Namir got onto the freighter with Chalis and two other soldiers. While the other two guarded the pod, he led her towards one of the command stations. Once there, they met with Sergeant Fektrin, who was leading a trio of engineers with his own squad. Chalis checked the ships systems for locations on the vessel where they could salvage parts from.

Soon enough, an Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser came out of hyperspace to reinforce the freighter. Thus Howl gave the squads five minutes to get to the boarding pods. Namir had to break off from Chalis in order to assist Ajax's squad. He managed to free them from the stormtroopers attacking them, but Ajax died in the process. As he continued towards the pods, he also found the body of Fektrin, which had gone cold.

Kryndal and his friends tried to explain the Alliance's plan, but Namir ignored them and compared their compassion for their leaders to the blind loyalty of Darth Vader's stormtroopers. Namir's comment offended Kryndal to the point where he swung at Namir. Namir caught his hand and threw him across the table.

Due to his experiences on Crucival, Namir assumed that the Alliance to Restore the Republic was a power grab from senators who had missed their chance at the end of the Clone Wars. His belief got him into a fight with a very passionate Alliance Special Forces soldier named Kryndal. During his time at Echo Base Namir met Han Solo, who somewhat agreed with his views. However, even Solo thought Namir was quite cynical about some aspects of the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Empire brought about the destruction of Namir's band, he felt he was not worthy of returning to Crucival's capital as he had essentially failed his friends and himself. When he came across the 61st Mobile Infantry\u2014more commonly known as Twilight Company\u2014Namir saw it as a ticket off Crucival and a chance to have his revenge against the Empire. Having been a soldier for over six years, Namir had a lot of experience over many of the members of Twilight Company. Within the first two months of him joining them, he managed to save the lives of other recruits and even more experienced soldiers. When Captain Micha Evon\u2014nicknamed Howl\u2014asked him how he would gather supplies for Twilight Company, Namir suggested looting the nearby village. Howl therefore taught Namir that it was about winning the people's hearts and not robbing them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Namir thought to himself many times that if he didn't believe in the rebel cause, then he should leave. He would have left if he didn't care for his friends in Twilight Company so much. Becoming a leader to Twilight Company meant the Twilight Soldiers respected Namir and looked up to him. Namir became very close to his peers during his time as Captain of Twilight Company. When stranded on Sullust Namir refused to leave the Sullustans after seeing the state they were in when going around Pinyumb. Namir had to overthrow Everi Chalis's temporary leadership of Twilight Company in order for his soldiers to stay with him and fight for Sullust."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hazram Namir was a human male with dark hair and bronze skin. His figure was lean but had a compact impression on Brand.

In an interview with the Daily Dot, Freed explained that he used Namir's backstory to show a more cynical point of view on the Rebel Alliance, without making the Alliance cynical itself, to make the setting more relatable in the same way Han Solo showed skepticism in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. Freed expressed that Namir was an arguably not good man fighting among passionate believers in a righteous revolution."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
