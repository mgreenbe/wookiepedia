They piloted the TIE line series of starfighters, a line that included the TIE/ln space superiority starfighter, which was one of the Empire's most recognizable symbols of power, the TIE/sa bomber and TIE/IN interceptor. There were two nicknames for TIE pilots: the vac-heads, who operated in space for the Empire's Imperial Navy, and the ground-hogs, who operated in planetary atmosphere for the Imperial Army. Because the vac-heads had better public recognition through propaganda posters and the HoloNet News reports, the ground-hogs were often resentful of them. The rivalry between ground-hogs and vac-heads was so intense that most Imperial flight bases had separate bars for the two groups, with the notable exception of the Bright Jewel Oversector Flight Base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The precision and streamlined design of the TIE fighter was a source of pride for those pilots, who prided themselves for usually not needing deflector shields or hyperdrives, which they viewed as tools for the cowardly. Since TIE fighters were identical and interchangeable, TIE pilots might never fly the same ship twice and, as a result, rarely developed emotional ties to their craft. Nonetheless, they tended to be very protective of their vessel of the day, and loved to push around lower-ranked stormtroopers. Very dedicated, TIE pilots were willing to surrender their lives for the greater glory of the Empire's New Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TIE fighter pilots could also engage in surface combat, with Squad Five participating in a skirmish on Nar Shaddaa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Training"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Graduates from prestigious flight academies across the galaxy underwent rigorous testing to become TIE pilots. There was an Imperial flight training academy called Skystrike Academy on Montross. Of all the cadets who underwent the Imperial pilot training program, ninety percent never graduated. As a consequence, those who did tended to be both proud and arrogant. The final phase of testing often occurred onboard a larger battleship, such as a Star Destroyer. This was to expose cadets to realistic and relevant surroundings. During the Galactic Civil War, TIE cadets often underwent literal trials by fire, plunged into combat situations where to excel was to survive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pilots were trained that aiding their fellow pilots was their lowest priority unless there was nothing else to do, with emphasis placed on completing the mission at hand and bringing their full force against enemy fighters. All pilots were also expected to be able to repair and maintain all single- and dual-pilot craft. Members of other organizations within the Empire were also trained in the same roles and skills, often serving alongside standard pilots. Commander Iden Versio and her compatriots[source?] in Inferno Squad were equipped with enhanced TIE fighters; Versio herself engaged Rebel fighters following the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TIE fighter pilots wore a black jumpsuit with pockets and zip-front, a reinforced helmet reminiscent of the stormtrooper design, and chest armor featuring an emergency atmospheric unit and a life support pack. control box attached to two flexible gas transfer tubes plugged into their helmet. On TIE pilot belts, to their right of their belt-buckle was a comlink/transponder in a shockproof case. TIE pilots also wore positive-gravity pressure boots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some helmets had white stripes below the eyes, and some elite pilots such as Baron Valen Rudor and Captain Vult Skerris had red or yellow stripes going down the middle of their helmets and sides."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TIE pilots could be equipped with an E-11 blaster rifle or a blaster pistol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimate Star Wars first identified TIE fighter pilots as \"human\" in 2015.
