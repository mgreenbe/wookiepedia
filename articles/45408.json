In about 31 BBY, the White Nova traveled to the Cularin system in preparation for a voyage to the planet Coruscant. Esker and three battle droids that he commanded operated a security checkpoint aboard the starship, to search all passengers that came aboard the vessel, and he personally searched a group of freelance agents that boarded the vessel, to check whether they were carrying any hidden weapons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
