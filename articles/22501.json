The spaceport was shut down by the 501st Legion, and all starships docked there were grounded. Later, in 19 BBY, Bomo Greenbark and Dass Jennir entered Cadgel Meadows and infiltrated the spaceport, stowing away on the freighter Uhumele prior to the mass lift-off of all starships fleeing Imperial aggression. The region, along with all of New Plympto, was destroyed when a Yuuzhan Vong bioweapon razed the planet in 27 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
