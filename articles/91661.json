Unfortunately, both droids had been captured. R2-D2 was able to free himself but faced resistance by the other droids. R2-D2 destroyed them all and freed C-3PO. Together they opened the door for the Jedi. A Bith saw the Jedi and found an IG-100 Magnaguard, which was not able to understand the Bith. The guard found C-3PO and forced him to translate the Bith's words. The droid purposely mistranslated and the guard lost his temper, killing the Bith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi entered a Hangar and encountered many Magnaguards, but they destroyed all of them and exited the hangar. With help from the droids, they were able to re-enter the palace and locate Ziro, but they were interrupted by Asajj Ventress and many battle droids. The Jedi cut down the droids and threw their remains at Ventress, slowing her down. Eventually the Jedi beat her and she retreated. After Ventress left and the Jedi freed Ziro, Ros Lai entered the room, coming to collect an old debt with Ziro. The Jedi agreed they would give her an unmarked ship if she could help them stop Dooku and her fellow Nightsisters, especially Ventress. She agreed, and that she would trade her data chip for a fast ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
