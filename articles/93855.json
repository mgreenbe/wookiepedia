During the Battle of Kashyyyk, Trandoshans used these weapons against Wookiees and clone troopers. It shot small rockets at foes at a high velocity and with a delayed explosion. They were effective against Katarn-class commando armor and Wookiees. It was manned by one Trandoshan. It was armored with a blast shield in the front so the only way to infiltrate it was with detonators, anti-armor rounds, or LJ-50 concussion rifle rounds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It first appeared on the Star Wars: Republic Commando website, where it was only described as a \"Trandoshan MMLT\", though the meaning of the acronym was not given.
