She eventually became a Lady of the Sith and acquired the title of Darth, as well as two red Sith lightsabers. During her time, she heard tales of Momin, a Force-sensitive individual who was imprisoned for his creations. Shaa freed Momin, killing the guards and cutting through to his cell, taking him as her Sith apprentice. Over time, she trained Momin, who was able to learn much from her and also gained the title of Darth, constructing his own lightsabers. During Darth Momin's apprenticeship, he created the Mask of Lord Momin and mutilated his own face."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although under Darth Shaa's tutelage, Darth Momin was never able to understand why Lady Shaa called herself Momin's master while he was her apprentice. Momin knew that he would never be bold enough to call himself a master, but believed that being called an apprentice was reprehensible. Shaa disagreed, and during a lightsaber duel, Momin proved to Shaa that she was wrong, impaling her mid-air in the abdomen with one of his lightsabers and killing her."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Shaa's death, Darth Momin studied the lore of the dark side of the Force by visiting its many great sites. Through his studies, Momin realized that his audience was not the people of the galaxy, but rather the Force itself. Although Momin swore never to take an apprentice, he maintained a group of acolytes who helped him in his goals. Eventually, using resources he had inherited from Shaa, Momin created a superweapon to destroy a city, but was stopped by the Jedi Order. Momin's physical body was destroyed during the events, but his spirit remained in the mask."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Shaa was a female humanoid who eventually rose to become a lady.
