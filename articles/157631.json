It was four-meter tall and lived on a planet with a highly acidic atmosphere."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point in the times of the New Republic, the scout Deeve climbed to the top of a cliff of this being's planet to perform a survey in search of useful natural resources. The being, noticing Deeve's presence, approached from behind a rock. Once Deeve identified the being's presence, and understanding he could not retreat without falling the cliff down, Deeve shot the soil near this being with his blaster pistol. The being stopped his approaching tentacle at the blast point. Unable to identify the being by himself, Deeve tried to analyze it with his technology and, through a comlink, asked the droid Effcee for reinforcements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
