The original model of the FVT were jury-rigged by removing the verbobrain from protocol droids, a voice-synth box, and a datapad and combining them with a number of readily available components. The speaker could either type in the words to be conveyed with the FVT or use a microphone instead. Due to their usefulness, production in small numbers of FVTs began under the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As long as an appropriate voice sample was available, an FVT could replace nearly any organic voice. When used to transmit messages via a comlink or other comms device, the voice being replicated was nearly unrecognizable from the original. Despite the benefits provided by an FVT, it was only made good as the voice sample used and the turns of phrase the user adopted during the vocal charade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
