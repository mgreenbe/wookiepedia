While thousands of clone troopers served on the front lines under the leadership of the Jedi Order, Fox was stationed on Coruscant where he served as commander of the Coruscant Guard.

Although the clone initially praised Tano for bringing Turmond to justice, he was compelled to arrest her after Turmond was strangled to death by way of the Force. Unbeknownst to Fox, Turmond was murdered by the fallen Jedi Barriss Offee, whose distorted views led her to commit acts of betrayal and terrorism. Offee further tainted her incarcerated comrade's reputation by killing three clone officers with her lightsaber, leading Fox to believe that Tano was the culprit.

Later, he unhesitatingly ordered his guards to kill Tano, whom he believed responsible for the deaths of several clones during her escape, but grudgingly complied with Anakin Skywalker's orders to capture the Padawan alive.

Believing the Jedi Order responsible for instigating a rebellion on the capital, Fox viewed the Jedi as \"agitators\" and enemies of the state.
