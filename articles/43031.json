Ejal led his kinsmen in an uprising against the Hutt species, who had stolen the Evocii's homeworld of Nal Hutta and used the Evocii as cheap labor. The revolt gained significant support and momentum, but it ended when one of Ejal's kinsmen betrayed him to the Hutts, who killed Ejal in a gruesome fashion as a lesson to other Evocii. Even during the Cold War, Hutts were still fond of Ejal's story, and used it to remind Evocii of the price of defiance and the rewards that came with obedience."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ejal was first mentioned in the \"Evocii History\" Codex entry in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
