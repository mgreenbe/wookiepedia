Model J1 \"Happy Surprise\" Palm Blaster was a hold-out blaster that looked similar to the Stealth-2VX palm shooter. The J1 resembled a grip with a tiny barrel sticking out from the front, protruding from between the user's fingers. It was activated by a thumb trigger on the top of the weapon. The J1's biggest strength was its ease of concealment, as its construction allowed it to be hidden in nothing more than the user's clenched fist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The weapon's name was actually the weapon's name in Rodese\u2014Kheth-saw\u2014translated to Basic.
