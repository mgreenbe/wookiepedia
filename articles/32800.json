A trio of Grysk that were part of the crew of a freighter that was captured by the Galactic Empire over the planet Batuu were armed with a mix of DC-18s and DL-18 blaster pistols, but set them aside to wipe the starship's electronics as it was being captured. The Grysk were then stunned by stormtroopers of the First Legion before they could reach their weapons. Commander Kimmund of the First Legion later informed his superiors of the weapons after the battle was over and speculated that they had been purchased locally."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "DC-18s were first mentioned in the 2018 novel Thrawn: Alliances, which was written by Timothy Zahn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
