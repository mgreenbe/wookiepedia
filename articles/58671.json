Most HT-2200 owners added new drive systems, the most popular being the 1L10 drive by Incom or drives from SoroSuub."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their main advantage over the YT series was in the design of the cargo bay. The cargo area of the HT-2200 was divided into four independent sections, each of which had its own environmental controls. Without significant modifications, the cargo area in a YT series freighter had to share the same environmental conditions as the rest of the ship. The crew of an HT-2200 could set the gravity, temperature, and atmosphere in each cargo bay differently from each other or the crew area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though CEC expected the HT-2200 to be a very successful product, poor reviews and insufficient manufacturer support caused it to flop. Its slow speed and low maneuverability earned the HT-2200 a reputation for being \"pirate bait.\" In its baseline configuration, the HT-2200's advantages were offset by inadequate maneuvering thrusters, a low lift-to-mass ratio, and an overtaxed main power generator. Fortunately, these craft were as easy to modify as with their smaller cousins."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known ships"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The HT-2200 bears a strong resemblance to the freighter flown by Luke and Leia in Star Wars 38, but differs in some significant details.
