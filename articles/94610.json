NGW stood for \"Near Gravity Well\". The program was an attempt to allow starships to jump in and out of hyperspace in close proximity to stars and planets. The program was extremely experimental, and what tests were performed only succeeded half the time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The project data was stolen by Tumleh employee Zoam Urshant on orders of the G'uotr Network, but her loyalty led her to turn the data over to the D'larah City Patrol. Captain Lucius Flint of the DCP was a secret agent of the Network, however, and he ensured that they received a copy of the data. The destruction of Demophon in a supernova brought an end to the program."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
