Rejecting the war with the Imperials and adopting a pacifistic way of life, Sunn-Childe created the sprawling City of Dreams inside a pocket dimension of his own manifest, living there in peace with his closest comrades. However, after Rebels Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca stumbled upon the City of Dreams in 3 ABY, Sunn-Childe's realm was attacked by an Imperial fleet that destroyed it utterly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A sprawling utopian paradise existing within its own pocket dimension, the City of Dreams and everything within was created out of pure psychic energy, a projection of the mind of Jashwik revolutionary Cody Sunn-Childe. The City of Dreams sat on top of what could only be described as an island floating through space, and was characterized by gleaming spires, verdant gardens and and cathedral-like buildings, all framed with a sculpted symmetry. Although the City of Dreams was mostly cut off from the outside world, a sub-basement contained communications equipment that received random Imperial transmissions, keeping Sunn-Childe updated on galactic events. These power emanations were untraceable by the wider galaxy, since they were comprised solely of psychic energy and not actual matter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The city itself was surrounded by a large jungle expanse surrounding it on all sides, populated by fearsome, humanoid beasts Sunn-Childe called \"monster-brothers.\" The monster-brothers were also reflections of Sunn-Childe's psyche, representing the repressed traumas and darkness in his soul. Sunn-Childe took it upon himself to keep the violent apparitions at bay, drawing them into himself so they did not threaten the city."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the early years of the Galactic Civil War, Jashwik freedom-fighter Cody Sunn-Childe became one of the faces of anti-Imperial resistance, leading a well-known Rebel band that included his right-hand man Ansible Beelyard. However, after a particularly violent battle in 3 BBY, Sunn-Childe had a religious experience that awoke latent mystic abilities. Rededicating himself to a peaceful way of life and renouncing the war, Sunn-Childe created the City of Dreams as an extension of his own psyche, materializing a perfect utopia in which to live with his battle comrades."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sunn-Childe and his companions lived an isolated, peaceful existence until 3 ABY, when a hyperdrive malfunction resulted in Rebel heroes Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca stumbling upon the City of Dreams. Recognizing Sunn-Childe from his days as a famed Rebel warrior, Calrissian challenged the Jashwik's pacifistic philosophy and inadvertently attracted the attention of a passing Imperial fleet that noticed the odd dimensional rift. The fleet, led by Captain Plikk, bombarded the City of Dreams, prompting Sunn-Childe to retaliate by manifesting his monster-brothers to attack the ships. However, with the support of his companions, Sunn-Childe recommitted to his philosophy of nonviolence at the moment of truth, allowing the Imperials to destroy the city and kill them all."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The City of Dreams first appeared in Star Wars 46, written by John Marc DeMatteis and released in 1981.
