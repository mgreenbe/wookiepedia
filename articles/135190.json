On one of the main boulevards of Wroona spaceport, it was packed full of supplies to cater to the needs of spacers. While some tough-looking guards watched the front, Tulagn would work the back counter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tulagn's Starship Outfitters was also a front for the Rodian's fencing business. It was run from a back room accessible only from an entrance at the end of a long winding alley. The back room was stacked with unmarked crates. There, Tulagn negotiated with suppliers, such as Platt Okeefe, often attempting to rip them off."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
