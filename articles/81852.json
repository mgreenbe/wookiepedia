With an abundance low-profile rectennae and packed with signal augmented sensor jammers, blind-band hypercomm transmitters, crystal gravfield traps, and a power core more suitable to a ship of the line, the LSR could all but see the universe to its own aft and could outrun nearly anything that could locate it. It has a class 1 hyper drive. It also had a forward mounted laser cannon for defense."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the LightStealth-18 Reconnaissance ship was designed by Raith Sienar, it was oddly produced, for the most part, by Kuat Drive Yards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
