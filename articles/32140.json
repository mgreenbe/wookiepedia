Following the death of the Eternal Empire Empress Vaylin and the formation of the Eternal Alliance, Adelade received precise coordinates to a location on Makeb from an anonymous source. The mysterious intel claimed that one of the Force's greatest mysteries was buried there and Adelade took a team to investigate. What they found, however, was Gethul, a creature of an unknown origin and immense power that hibernated beneath the planet's surface for millenia. Hearing Gethul's \"song\", Adelade and her followers fell under Gethul's sway, forming Cult of Gethul and attempting to fully awaken the creature. Learning of this and fearing that in its full power Gethul could destabilize Makeb's core and obliterate the planet, Alliance military Admiral Bey'wan Aygo sent a strike team to stop Adelade's plan. The team was engaged by members of the cult, as well as local wildlife, which Adelade and Gethul were also able to control. Eventually they reached Adelade herself and after defeating her in combat, detonated the D-5X probe droid loaded with explosives inside Gethul's maw, killing the abomination and stopping its threat along with the cult."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cult of Gethul appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne during the \"Destroyer Of Worlds\" Uprising."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
