Khash was employed as a supervisor, in charge of a crew of VMMC personnel who operated a landing bay within a spaceport on Tilnes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 21 BBY, while Khash was on duty an electromagnetic pulse emanated from the core of Tilnes and temporarily shut down all electrical systems at Khash's landing bay. Though the EMP blast initially caused Khash little concern as such blackouts were a common occurrence on Tilnes, beneath the surface of the moon the blast triggered the release of an experimental virus from a base of the Metatheran Cartel trade alliance. The contagion quickly entered the ventilation system of the Khash's landing bay and the supervisor soon detected some unusual sensor readings indicating the presence of the viral contagion. He also detected a distress signal originating from the Cartel facility. The Cartel had publicly claimed to withdrawn from Tilnes following outcry in the Cularin system about their presence on the moon, but Khash had previously heard rumors that the Cartel had secretly remained on Tilnes and paid bribes to the VMMC to conceal the Cartel's operation. He therefore viewed the distress signal as substantive proof that the rumors were true."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Petrified by the spread of the unknown virus and the potential connection of the contagion to the Metatheran Cartel, Khash had his crew hand out respirators to everyone present in the landing bay. He also placed the bay under an unofficial state of quarantine, preventing anyone from leaving until the nature of the virus and the origin of the suspicious distress signal could be determined. However, he found that his staff were unwilling to investigate the cause of the occurrences."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents renowned in the Cularin system, were among those passing through Khash's landing bay and made enquiries to him about why the hangar had been locked down. Khash was initially dismissive of their request and instructed the operatives to return to their starship, insisting that everything was being handled. Nonetheless, he was familiar with the agents' past exploits and soon recognised them. Seizing the opportunity to resolve his troubled situation, Khash pleaded with the operatives to investigate the viral contaminant and distress signal on his behalf. While he conversed with them he carried a scrambler upon his person so as to prevent and recordings from being taken of his entreaty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The freelancers agreed to assist and Khash provided them with a datachip that contained the co-ordinates of the distress signal. The agents subsequently identified the source of the distress signal and procured a sample of the virus for analysis. Upon their return to the landing bay, Khash was no longer on duty and nowhere to be found."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nevan Khash was a small and slope-shouldered individual. A weak-minded, paranoid and nervous man, he did not cope with stressful situations or being put under pressure, becoming anxious and evasive. He had little skill at bluffing or concealing the truth and so required little coercion to be persuaded to disclose details of his concerns."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Khash did not manage well when faced with the dilemma of how to respond to the distress signal from the Cartel base and the indications of an unidentified virus in the landing bay that he oversaw, becoming distraught and fearing that his life was at risk. He was concerned that he could loose his job if he did not resolve the situation and if he caused alarm by alerting the travelers passing through his landing bay of his findings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nevan Khash featured in Caaried Away, a roleplaying adventure by Morrie Mullins that was released in March 2003 and served as the opening instalment of the Metatheran Caution trilogy of the Living Force campaign. The adventure does not confirm Khashs' species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Caaried Away, the players roleplay as the heroes of Cularin; it is suggested that if the players initially fail to deduce that something unusual is leaking into the landing bay on Tilnes then Khash can take a more proactive role in alerting them to the situation. It is then possible for the players to accept or dismiss Khash's plea for help. If the player do not initially agree to assist him, Khash reluctantly proffers the freelance agents payment of 500 out of his personal funds to investigate the mystery. The players can also coerce Khash to disclose his suspicions that the Cartel had never closed down its facility on Tilnes, in which case Khash begs them not to tell anyone that they learned of the Cartel's secret presence on Tilnes from him. After arriving at the Cartel base, it is possible for the player characters to contact Khash to communicate their findings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
