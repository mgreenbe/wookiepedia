The supercomputer was installed by the station's first administrator, the Qiraash visionary Doffen Gaitag, who realized that to run the casino that he envisioned, he needed a partner that both never slept and was completely trustworthy. Once it came online, the droid intelligence instantly became the omnipresent eyes and ears of the Wheel with complete control of all of the station's systems.

The Wheel had long enjoyed a special status from the Empire, residing in a so-called \"immunity sphere\": in exchange for taxes and Administrator Greyshade enforcing an anti-alien bias, Imperial ships were barred from the facility. Wanting access to the Wheel's steady stream of massive profit, Imperial Sector Commander Zertik Strom\u2014who governed the region that contained the Wheel\u2014schemed to justify a takeover of Wheel space, staging a Rebel attack on a House of Tagge merchant ship not far from the station.

At Greyshade's order, Master-Com put the administrator in contact with Strom, who fed the Senator a bogus story that the Rebels had plundered a merchant ship transporting Wheel profits. Greyshade bought Strom's lie, and gave the Imperial officer permission to search for the fugitives on the Wheel, on the condition they be brought to him for questioning. Master-Com's omnipresent cameras soon ascertained the position of the three Rebels: while Greyshade ordered Master-Com to leave an unconscious Skywalker and his two droids to the stormtroopers closing in on them, he quickly recognized Organa, whom he had served with in the Imperial Senate and had long held an infatuation with."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Chaos on the Wheel"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Greyshade ordered Master-Com to bring Organa to him, and the walking supercomputer acted quickly, mobilizing Wheel Security to interrupt a roiling firefight between Organa, Solo and a stormtrooper squad.

At the same time, Greyshade also schemed to get rid of Solo and Skywalker, forcing the Corellian to join the Wheel's \"Big Game\" gladiatorial competition and planning to rig the fight to ensure his death. But while Greyshade was utterly focused on winning Organa and killing her companions, Master-Com soon found itself more interested in Skywalker's droids: specifically, the depths of devotion they displayed in protecting their master at all costs from repeated Imperial attacks. Master-Com asked Greyshade his persmission to study the droids, and while he did not approve, he didn't deny the request either, which Master-Com took as license to go ahead. Through watching the droids, Master-Com began to explore and understand the idea of a machine feeling friendship for an organic, realizing that it felt that way toward Greyshade, the man who gave him humanoid form. However, Master-Com's observation of the droids was soon interrupted by the sudden disappearance of Skywalker from his medical bay, and Organa's daring escape from Greyshade's suite.

Greyshade managed to capture Organa and Skywalker while the pair gathered evidence on the Empire's secret plot, while Solo met an apparent death at the hands of his Wookiee first mate Chewbacca in the Big Game. Grief-stricken, Organa accepted a deal with Greyshade where he would allow her friends to go free, and even let her expose the Empire's dealings, in exchange for her remaining with him. Meanwhile, Strom, realizing that Greyshade had betrayed him, announced that the Empire had taken command of the Wheel, bringing his stormtroopers and Wheel Security into open conflict. The stormtroopers soon seized the Wheel's administrative deck, presenting themselves to Master-Com as the new authority over the Wheel.

Master-Com found Greyshade in the Wheel's docking bay after a heated firefight with some stormtroopers. It wasn't long before they were accosted by Commander Strom, who had come to end his feud with Greyshade.

Its dealings with Zertik Strom had left Master-Com with a healthy distrust of the Empire, and despondent at Greyshade's death, Master-Com refused to take another droid body and retreated inward, only keeping basic systems online. Master-Com's lack of input was incredibly hard on Wermis, who soon found that properly running the station without Master-Com's assistance was impossible. In a sense, this knowledge ultimately brought Master-Com back to life: the supercomputer found a new purpose in sabotaging Wermis' rule over the Wheel. Wermis eventually died of a heart attack during the newly-inaugurated New Republic's conquest of the Besh Gorgon system.

Old Silver Eyes passed away three years later, and the Wheel's systems immediately shut down as they had when Master-Com disappeared.

Acquaintances noted that after becoming administrator, Master-Com gradually adopted more and more Human-like mannerisms, including a rabid fandom for podracing and a love of music, sometimes being found whistling while walking the halls of the Wheel. Master-Com was also a strong proponent of the violent \"Big Game,\" a controversial gladiatorial contest that was one of the Wheel's hallmarks.
