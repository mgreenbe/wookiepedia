One spring afternoon, three Duloks come to Teebo's home, Bright Tree Village. Led by the self-proclaimed King Vulgarr, the Duloks announce that a giant monster has kidnapped Teebo's sister, the wokling Malani. Giant footprints lend credibility to the tale, and Vulgarr convinces Chief Chirpa to send every warrior he can spare. Chirpa orders the woklings cloistered and sets off in hang gliders with all able-bodied Ewoks to the spot described by Vulgarr; the Duloks also depart. Logray, the village shaman, surmises that the beast in question may be the Grudakk, although kidnapping woklings is unusual behavior for the creature. In the bustle of hiding the young ones, Teebo slips out in a hang glider to follow the older warriors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the village undefended, Vulgarr and 30 members of his band attack. The remaining Ewoks are unable to hold back the assault, and the Duloks tie them all up. The invaders find the hidden woklings and throw them in a wagon to be skinned and eaten. The Duloks reveal that the \"large creature\" was simply a foot-shaped slab of stone. Logray curses them, but they ignore him and depart with their booty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Chirpa and his band follow Vulgarr's directions to the Canyons of Mist. There in a cave the find not a monster but an old, grizzled Dulok who calls himself King Ulgo the Magnificent. Ulgo's Ewok-fur vest and taste for sacred lantern birds angers the warriors, and with tempers flaring, Ulgo attacks. The Ewok Warok accidentally strikes the Dulok with his glider and sends him tumbling to his death on the rocks below. Realizing they have been tricked by Vulgarr, the Ewoks head back to Bright Tree Village. There, Logray says a prayer to the Father Tree to save the tribe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On his own adventure, Teebo cannot find the warriors when he realizes he is being chased through the skies by a fearsome mantigrue. Teebo panics and loses altitude, and the monster attacks and forces him to crash land. On the ground, Teebo is attacked by a band of Yuzzums on rakazzak beasts. He darts for a tree only to find that it is actually the leg of a massive creature. The Yuzzums scatter in fear, but Teebo soon finds himself in the huge hands of Logray's Grudakk. The behemoth carries Teebo to its lair, where it tries to feed him rather than eat him. Still, Teebo suspects the creature may merely want him as a plaything, so he escapes the next morning."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His relief is short-lived, as he soon stumbles upon Vulgarr and his Duloks. He witnesses a tussle in which Vulgarr's bodyguards kill a usurper Teebo nicknames Crooked Tail. Vulgarr declares a wokling picnic, and Teebo throws a stone at him from in hiding. A cold wind convinces Vulgarr that the meadow is haunted, and he orders the band to move on."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly, the Bright Tree Ewoks are upon them.
