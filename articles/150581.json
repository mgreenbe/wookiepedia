Though this had the same general story, it differed in that it starred Tantrellius' daughter, Plum Tantrellius, who appeared in the role of Leia. It also featured other members of Tantrellius' troupe, including Yoh Podd as Mouchus, and the great dame Annah Dublavviane as Leia's mother. It was claimed to be unmissable, although it contained some violence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
