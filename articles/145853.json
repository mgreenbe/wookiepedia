Though Lord Vader is still skeptical that the Grysks pose a threat to the Empire, Thrawn shows him a Grysk gravity projector whose meshwork is made of cortosis. Based on the presence of cortosis in Grysk technology, Thrawn suggests the Grysk led the Separatists to Mokivj in the first place all those years ago as they observed the Clone Wars from a distance and studied first the Republic and then the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn deduces that the Grysks practice a policy of stealing things of value from other species in order to force them into submission. On Batuu, the Grysks subjugated the Darshi by stealing their ceremonial daggers. Thrawn explains that the Grysks tried to do the same with the Chiss by kidnapping their children. Thrawn also realizes that Dooku surprised the Grysks by producing both cortosis battle droids and clone armor. In secret, Vader knows that Darth Sidious was Dooku's true master and orchestrated the construction of the cortosis factory as part of his preparations for Order 66."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn fears the Grysk will become a major threat to the Empire. He also acknowledges that the Chiss are on the verge of a civil war as some had already aligned themselves with the Grysk. Vader realizes that Thrawn's loyalty is first and foremost with the Chiss, but the Emperor obviously knows and will allow Thrawn to work under Imperial command as long as he is useful. Despite their differences, Vader sees potential in Thrawn's TIE Defender program and makes recommendations. Thrawn accepts these recommendations and promises to convey them to the Lothal Imperial factory upon their return to Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The novel was announced at New York Comic Con 2017 during the Lucasfilm Publishing Presents: Tales from a Galaxy, Far, Far Away! panel, where Timothy Zahn was one of the featured authors.
