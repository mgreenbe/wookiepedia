However, his servant droid LEP-86C8 later managed to detonate a virus bomb, and the virus immediately started to spread through the lab. Ahsoka, Rex, and the clone troopers were infected with the virus, and later Padm\u00e9 Amidala would be infected as well.

Landing on Cliffhold, Anakin and Obi-Wan were welcomed by strangely disfigured Separatist battle droids. Anakin hacked his way through a number of them before Obi-Wan brought to his attention that they weren't defending themselves. A boy appeared, introducing himself as Jaybo Hood, upset that months of work reprogramming the droids had gone to waste. Despite such, he led the two Jedi to the location of a nearby Reeksa, at the bottom of a cliff. As the Jedi descended the cliff, a Xandu swooped by, and Anakin grabbed it by the leg, with Obi-Wan hitching a ride as well. The two dropped down, accidentally touching the vines on the ground and disturbing the Reeksa. Anakin proceeded to dig up the root and escaped alive with Obi-Wan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In their attempt to leave the planet, they were attacked by \"Drol\", the phantom god of Iego, which turned out to be a Separatist laser web installed to prevent Iego's inhabitants from leaving the planet.
