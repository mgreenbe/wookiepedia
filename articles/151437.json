This machine was later abandoned on the planet Taris where it remained undiscovered for years. The machine worked by sending out a signal that was capable of influencing the native rakghoul populations. It was for this reason that the Dark Jedi Ki Sazen traveled to Taris with her Nikto followers where she intended to claim the transmitter and turn the rakghouls into her own personal army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result, the Republic Strategic Information Service under Ardun Kothe dispatched agents that included Cipher Nine and Chance to the planet in order to prevent Sazen from achieving her objective. As Kothe revealed later, the Ultrawave Transmitter contained the activation codes for the Shadow Arsenal on Quesh, another one of Godera's inventions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
