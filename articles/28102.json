Shortly after the skirmish aboard Accresker Jail, the criminals Chelli Aphra and 0-0-0 traveled to the planet to have the proximity bombs inside them removed. To reach South District Seven, Aphra bribed the train driver to let them on without I.D.s. The driver referred Aphra to Coach Epsilon while telling 0-0-0 to stay in the rear-most wagon with the other droids. When 0-0-0 threatened him, he reported them to the Informahub and the two were forced into the undercity of Milvayne by the Milvayne Authority."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Coach Epsilon was first mentioned in the canon comic Doctor Aphra 27, written by Simon Spurrier, penciled by Emilio Laiso and released on December 12 2018."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
