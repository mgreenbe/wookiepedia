It was traditional for Shin'yah trees to be planted so that their branches overhung a small stone pool. According to Vardosian folklore, the first Shin'yah tree was a young woman who had slashed her wrists after she was forbidden to marry the suitor she loved. To the people of Vardos, the trees were a symbol of their devotion to the Galactic Empire. Displaying the trees was popular among the people of Vardos as a result."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
