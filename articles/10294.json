The attack took place between the years 26 ABY and 27 ABY and the Vong reached the system by traveling down the Hollastin Run hyperlane from a previous battle in the Circumtore system. After the attack the Vong continued down the same hyperlane and attacked the Tsyk system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack on the Hollastin system was first shown in The Essential Atlas, a reference book released in 2009 and written by Jason Fry and Daniel Wallace.
