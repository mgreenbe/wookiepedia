The odd little droid came on-line in Mora's early teens, after a half dozen botched attempts to initialize his cognitive processor. Since then, he has faithfully fulfilled his role of making his master a better mechanic, both intentionally and accidentally\u2014his tools are an asset, but it his frequent system glitches that have given Mora monthly crash courses in droid re-construction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even in a galaxy choked with automatons, Widget's appearance is peculiar. His stumpy legs and wide, heavy base give him a wobbling, splayed gait and a low center of gravity. A flexible waist supports an armored torso with an inset button panel, used to input commands and run diagnostic when the droid is off-line or inactive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid's arms are true marvels, each containing dozens of small machinist's tools that can be extended through the digits and palms of both square, blunt-fingered hands. The right forearm holds a magnifier, a spotlight luma and a full range of wire cutters. The left, covered by ribbed sheathing, holds a laser welder, gripper clamps and a computer access link. This is just a fraction of Widget's total accoutrement and he can add or remove items with little effort."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the battle of Yavin, Princess Leia came to M'haeli to support the local insurgency in their fight against Governor Grigor.
