Representation within the body was determined by popular vote with membership comprising of individuals from the prominent political factions; namely the Democratic Alliance, the Corellian Liberal Front and the Centerpoint Party. There were also additional independent representatives that gained seats through the various elections."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ten years after the Yuuzhan Vong vasion of the galaxy, the Assembly became a location of an intense power struggle where the representatives of the various factions sought to block the extremist views of Thrackan Sal-Solo. Sal-Solo had threatened to go to war with the Galactic Alliance unless they were given independence which was an action that many believed would bring about huge losses to Corellia. This in turn led to the start of the Second Corellian Insurrection where the Galactic Alliance set up a bloackade around the Corellian system. Many of the members of the Assembly feared that Sal-Solo's efforts had resulted in further hardship for all Corellians but after his assassination, the various parties worked together to create a coalition government."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
