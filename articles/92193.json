Without the circuit, the network was unable to function. The Imperial technician in charge disabled the system and removed the command module. The technician was picked up by a New Republic frigate disguised as an Imperial frigate and he subsequently surrendered it into their custody believing he was reporting in to his superiors. Around 6 ABY, the New Republic arranged for the return of the command circuit in exchange for notes on cloaking device countermeasures that the Kalindan Royal Research Facility was developing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
