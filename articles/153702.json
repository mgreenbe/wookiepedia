The Kupohan took Skywalker's food order of Corellian buckwheat noodles served with rancor sauce and the same noodles with nerf nuggets and onions for Kelen. At that point, she gave a small twitch of both the primary and basal ears, which Skywalker interpreted as an outward sign of an unusual order. She then handed Skywalker his receipt, which had the number 89 circled. Below the number were instructions to return at 0900 the next day. When Skywalker and Kelen returned, they went on a delivery run with Sakhet in order to gather information about their target, Drusil Bephorin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kupohan appeared in the 2015 novel Heir to the Jedi, written by Kevin Hearne."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
