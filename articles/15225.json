The revered Jedi Master Ngani Zho participated in the conflict and fought on the front lines against the Sith's Imperial soldiers. Although he survived the engagement, Zho afterwards recognized that he was too old to continue fighting on the front lines, and so retired from direct combat and began raising Theron Shan, the son of his former apprentice, Satele Shan, as a pupil."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle first appeared as a brief flashback in one panel of The Old Republic\u2014The Lost Suns 4.
