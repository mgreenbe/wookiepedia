Tagge was enlisted, along with the foremost technical minds in the Galactic Republic, to chair a specialized technology-based committee within the Analysis Bureau. The Techno Union was giving the Separatist Confederacy of Independent Systems the technological edge in the Clone Wars, and Isard sought to bridge the gap by assembling the Republic's own technological geniuses.
