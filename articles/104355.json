A major source of low-grade engine fuel, Peragus II was originally a terrestrial world, but it was nearly destroyed hundreds of years before 3959 BBY by the early attempts of miners to siphon off fuel from the planet. A mining accident caused an explosion beneath the crust, blowing a massive hole in the planet and forming an asteroid field around the world. By 3951 BBY, mercenaries and tradesmen constructed the Peragus Mining Facility in the Peragus asteroid field, but both the asteroid field and the station were destroyed when a stray blast during a firefight between the light freighter Ebon Hawk and the Hammerhead-class cruiser Harbinger ignited the fuel in the asteroid field. After the destruction of the asteroid field, no further mining projects were attempted in the ruins of Peragus II."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Peragus II was a planet that orbited a star in the Peragus system, within the Xappyh sector of the Outer Rim Territories. Lacking any moons, Peragus II had standard gravity, a rotational period of fourteen standard hours, and an orbital period of 417 local days. Originally a terrestrial world, Peragus II's planetary crust contained a number of volatile chemicals as well as significant quantities of starship fuel, though Peragus lacked any life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hundreds of years before the Jedi Civil War, a mining accident resulted in an explosion that tore apart almost a quarter of the planet. An enormous hole was blown in the surface of Peragus II that exposed the world's molten core, and the pieces of the planet that were cast away from Peragus II formed the Peragus asteroid field."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The region of the galaxy in which Peragus II was located was widely explored between 5000 BBY and 3000 BBY. Hundreds of years before 3959 BBY, Peragus II was the site of a mining colony that extracted fuel from the planet's crust, but the colony proved to be short-lived when an accidental blaster shot triggered an explosion in Peragus's crust. The explosion ripped apart Peragus's crust and mantle, exposing the world's core and forming the Peragus asteroid field. Peragus II itself was left alone in the centuries that followed, though a group of tradesmen and mercenaries eventually established the Peragus Mining Facility in the asteroid field. The facility's workers banned blaster technology of any kind in an attempt to forestall any further explosions, so mining droids used underpowered lasers, and miners relied on sonic detonators and ion charges for self-defense. To allow freighters to safely dock with the facility, astrogation charts were constantly updated to reflect asteroid drifts and transmitted to navicomputers on inbound ships, though Peragus II itself was avoided."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 3951 BBY, Peragus was the only exporter of fuel in the Xappyh sector and the surrounding region, and the planet Telos IV in the nearby Kwymar sector relied on this resource to keep the space station known as Citadel Station in orbit. Citadel Station served as the main base of operations for the Telosian Restoration Project, a Galactic Republic-sponsored initiative to restore the surface of Telos after its bombing during the Jedi Civil War several years prior."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The badly damaged light freighter Ebon Hawk arrived in the Peragus system in 3951 BBY, carrying several passengers: the former Jedi Meetra Surik, the former Sith Lord Kreia, the utility droid T3-M4, and an HK-50 series assassin droid. The Ebon Hawk had been damaged in a firefight with the Hammerhead-class cruiser Harbinger, which had been ferrying Surik to Telos IV before Sith, who were seeking to kill all remaining Jedi, overtook the warship. Kreia rescued Surik from the Harbinger before feeling the hostile vessel. The Ebon Hawk landed at the Peragus Mining Facility, but the HK-50 droid wreaked havoc on the facility by posing as Surik's protocol droid while reprogramming the facility's mining droids to kill the miners. Surik and Kreia destroyed HK-50 with the help of the criminal Atton Rand, but before they could escape the facility on the Ebon Hawk, the Harbinger arrived in the system in pursuit of Surik."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kreia, Surik, and Rand escaped the forces of the Dark Lord Darth Sion, who controlled the Harbinger, and boarded the Ebon Hawk, but the Harbinger pursued and fired at the fleeing freighter. A shot from one of the two ships eventually struck an asteroid, igniting the fuel within and setting off a chain reaction that destroyed most of the Peragus asteroid field. By the time of the Cold War between the Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire, Peragus II and the Peragus system had become abandoned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Peragus II did not host any native life, though a group of miners settled there briefly to mine fuel. After the initial mining accident, no further attempts were made to mine fuel on Peragus's barren surface, though prospectors eventually established the Peragus Mining Facility in the Peragus asteroid field to extract the fuel contained in the asteroids. Major imports to the planet before its destruction included foodstuffs and technology for the miners, while Peragus II's sole export before and after its destruction was starship fuel. On account of its lack of population, Peragus also lacked a planetary government."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Peragus II first appeared in the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, published by LucasArts and released on December 6, 2004. Peragus II and the Peragus Mining Facility were featured in the first non-training level of the game. Although the player has the ability to explore the mining facility in the game, the player was unable to further explore the planet itself. In Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, the player has the ability to change the plot in relation to Peragus II. The character has the option to have the Ebon Hawk fire upon the asteroids themselves when chased by Darth Sion; choosing this action destroys the asteroids and Peragus II by the player's hand rather than allowing the Harbinger to destroy the asteroids and the planet, as the Harbinger will inevitably destroy the asteroids if the player chooses not to fire on the asteroids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
