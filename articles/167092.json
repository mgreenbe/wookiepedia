Upon arriving at the Opee sea killer aquarium, the animal keeper released some living food into the tank. When the Opee's tongue shot out for the food and touched the hydrostatic bubble that surrounded the aquarium, Binks panicked and pressed the emergency button on a main control panel. This led to the deactivation of almost half of the zoo's hydrostatic fields. The Opee devoured some of the most expensive animals and escaped into the ocean."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
