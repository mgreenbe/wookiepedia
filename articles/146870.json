He kidnapped Han Solo and Chewbacca, stealing their ship, the Millennium Falcon, which he intended to break down for parts. Hondo Ohnaka made a deal with the Hackjackers, unaware that the Falcon was the ship they were selling. When Maz Kanata made Ohnaka help her rescue the smugglers, Ohnaka learned that Juibop had the Falcon, and instead freed Solo, Chewbacca and Kanata. Solo shot a rack of concussion bombs that were behind Juibop, and they exploded, killing him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
