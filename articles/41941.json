Founded as Mercy General, it was the galaxy's foremost center for research on rare neurological diseases such as Cathington's Disorder, and was renamed after the Dynamet Corporation around around 4050 BBY when the company donated a large sum of credits for the construction of a research wing devoted to curing the rakghoul plague.

The rakghouls that lived in the region established a breeding ground in the hospital, and reacted violently to any intrusion. Doctor Synoda sent a Republic aligned individual to access medical records of the Tarisian people before Taris's destruction in order to collect research on Colu's syndrome, a devastating cancer that effected only the descendants of the survivors of the Destruction of Taris."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the invasion of Taris in 3642 BBY, the Republic had cleared out the rakghoul nest in the hospital and planned to renovate it.
