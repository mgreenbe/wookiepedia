When the Republic's new bomb, the Electro-proton bomb came down, it destroyed all of the droid forces but made a large sinkhole. There, he was dispatched on a gunship with Mace Windu to investigate the sinkhole because it sucked up many of their troops. Soon Trapper found survivors with other troopers who took care of the troopers. Then Windu took Trapper, Clone Commander Ponds, and fellow trooper Hawkeye to search for the cause of the sinkhole. Mace and the troopers unknowingly walked onto Zillo Beast and disturbed it. It woke up and crushed Hawkeye, but Windu, Ponds, and Trapper escaped."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Geonosis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Jedi found out that there was a factory on Geonosis making an army of battle droids, the Jedi took an invasion force to attack the planet and destroy the factory. Trapper was ferried to Geonosis alongside Kenobi in the LAAT/i gunship Bad Kitty, but they were shot down and crashed in the midst of battle. Kenobi and Trapper were the only survivors. Commander Cody found Kenobi's gunship and sent Waxer and Boil to aid them. Waxer and Boil carried Kenobi and Trapper to the safety of an AT-TE where Trapper required medical attention.
