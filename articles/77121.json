They mined for spice which they sold to various Hutt organizations. They controlled a spice mine on Rori which they used as a bunker. The Kobola were on the CorSec's Most Wanted list of criminals, as they used slavery as a means of extracting spice. They would abduct travelers to Naboo and Rori and force them into doing the mining work. By the time of the Battle of Yavin, the Kobola Miners were frequently at war with the Rorgungans and the law-abiding miners of the Rori Spice Mining Collective."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
