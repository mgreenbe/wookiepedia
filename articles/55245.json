His history was unknown, with some speculating that he got his start working in the swoop racing pits of Caprioril and others thinking he was a chief technician for Ne'Chak's mercenary group. Golben oversaw the work done in the repair bays, but would occasionally do jobs himself if the client was important enough."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
