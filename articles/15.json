Imcrix was involved in spice smuggling activities, and towards the beginning of the Yuuzhan Vong War he discovered a potentially lucrative source of Rokna blue, a once-popular narcotic extracted from a fungus found on Endor. Imcrix learned that a potent strain of Rokna blue had grown in an abandoned drug lab in Rokna Station in the Endor system. However, the New Republic also learned of the existence of the Rokna, and sent a demolition team to destroy the station and destroy Imcrix's source. Needing a diversion to help him retrieve the drugs before the station was destroyed, Imcrix reactivated Rokna Station's defense systems, which began firing at random passersby. This attracted a separate group of New Republic agents\u2014Imcrix and his crew then hijacked their ship and tried to use them as shields as he tried to extract the drugs. However, Imcrix's plot was unsuccessful, and the agents captured the crime lord and turned him over to the New Republic for trial."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An infamous crime lord by the time of the New Republic, \"Blue\" Imcrix was an active participant in spice smuggling and other illegal activities, and was willing to go to lengths such as hijacking and kidnapping in order to protect his profits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Blue\" Imcrix first appeared in \"Wired to Kill\", a Star Wars Roleplaying Game adventure scenario that was published in Star Wars Gamer 9 in 2002.
