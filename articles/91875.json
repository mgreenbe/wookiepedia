It had numerous hidden smuggling compartments above and below the desks of the ship. This required rearrangement of most of the interior life support systems. It was equipped with two quad laser cannons that could be retracted under the external hull plating to discourage custom inspectors. Due to the increased power requirements for the weaponry, the Nepton power core had to be reworked and six Koensayr TLB power converters had to be installed to handle the excess power. These modification meant that the ship produced much more energy than was legal. In order to hide this from inspectors, Tembon would shunt 30% of the power to the convertors when necessary but this often caused multiple units to blow and require maintenance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
