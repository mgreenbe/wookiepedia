She and her husband had a son, Lux sometime before that. By 28 BBY, Mina Bonteri had secretly started taking orders from Count Dooku, who was putting the pieces in place for the forthcoming Separatist Crisis and recruiting worlds that preferred a populist approach to governing, where planets placed their own wellbeing above that of the greater Republic. She often took calls from him in her office, a fact that came to the attention of senators of the opposing faction including Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, and Onaconda Farr. She met Padm\u00e9 Amidala at a party being hosted by Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, being introduced to her by Senator Rush Clovis of Scipio. The two of them instantly hit it off as friends, and since she was the first politican to be nice to Padm\u00e9 since Padm\u00e9 joined the Senate six weeks earlier, Mina became something of a mentor to the younger senator. Their relationship soon began conflicting with Mina's loyalty to Dooku once Padm\u00e9 began introducing legislation and motions counter to Dooku's goals, and after the Bromlarch Crisis, when Mina failed to help the Trade Federation take over the Mid Rim planet, she was forced to cut off her mentorship with Padm\u00e9, though they remained friends up until the true beginning of the Separatist Crisis in 24 BBY, this being the last time Padm\u00e9 would see Lux until the midpoint of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time the Clone Wars broke out, Bonteri had joined Count Dooku's Confederacy of Independent Systems as a member of the Separatist Senate.

Some time into the war, Bonteri's husband had been killed by Republic clone troopers during a battle on Aargonar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Almost a year later, Bonteri was later contacted by Amidala, who wished to discuss a peace initiative between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy. Amidala and her friend, the Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, secretly visited her on Raxus to discuss the proposed initiative. Bonteri was initially skeptical that the plan would work, but decided to do her best to convince the Separatist Senate to act on it. During a session of the Confederate Senate, Bonteri called for a vote to open the peace talks with Republic. However, Bonteri's efforts were thwarted by General Grievous's terrorist attack on Coruscant on the orders of Dooku."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bonteri was killed in an apparent Republic attack that followed the failed peace initiative, but Republic spies confirmed that it was Dooku's agents who killed her. Her son tried to avenge his mother's death by briefly joining the Death Watch. He then returned to Onderon and joined the rebels in freeing the planet and return Ramsis Dendup to the throne. Impressed by the Jedi Order's efforts to liberate Onderon, Lux vowed to guide the people of Onderon back to the Republic as their new senator in the Galactic Senate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The name and photo of Bonteri was featured in Star Wars Insider 121, released on October 26, 2010.
