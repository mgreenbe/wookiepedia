Balkar met Havoc's commanding officer in a cantina and told the lieutenant that Forex was being used to rob a bank. Havoc's commander set out and tried to stop Forex, and Balkar tapped into the bank's security holos, though he could not receive audio. After Havoc's commander defeated a team of soldiers, Balkar contacted the lieutenant and asked who the soldiers had been. Though Garza had ordered the lieutenant not to tell anyone, the lieutenant told Balkar that they were Special Forces soldiers who had defected. After Balkar helped the lieutenant defeat Forex, he had his technicians reprogram Forex to serve as a new member of Havoc Squad. He then called General Garza, angry at not having been told about the defections. Garza reprimanded the lieutenant and told Balkar that he hadn't needed to know."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Helping Jorgan"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Havoc's lieutenant, along with sergeant Aric Jorgan, met Balkar in the same cantina on Nar Shaddaa and asked for his help finding the Deadeyes, Jorgan's old squad. Balkar was told he was not allowed to assist, though he covertly told the lieutenant that he could look in the Imperial prison on Nar Shaddaa. When the lieutenant and Jorgan returned, Senior Agent Zane of the SIS was in the middle of reprimanding Balkar. When Havoc claimed responsibility for the prison break, Zane advised them from further interference in getting the Deadeyes back by peaceful means. When Zane left, Balkar asked Havoc why they have to get him in trouble. Havoc's CO explained that they have coordinates to where the Deadeyes were shipped to decrypt. Balkar decline to aid them again with Zane breathing over his neck, but he did refer Jorgan to a contact in Signal Intelligence, but Zane later interfered."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Later Activities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterward, Balkar was stationed on Tatooine when a Republic agent crashed there, and he directed Havoc's commander, now promoted to captain, to the crash site. When the captain and his team rescued the agent, they were informed of a secret Imperial weapon called the Gauntlet, and Garza ordered Havoc to destroy it. When that had been done, Balkar sent the captain\u2014now promoted to major\u2014a letter congratulating him on the Gauntlet's destruction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time after General Arkos Rakton declared war against the Republic and Havoc Squad performed missions across the galaxy to reinforce the Republic offensive, was the latter recalled to Coruscant for a Senate hearing regarding the squad's activities. Balkar and Garza met with the major at the spaceport, explaining that the hearing is in fact a sham, held by Senator Grom Zian, an Imperial agent bought off by Imperial Intelligence. Under Rakton's direction, Zian intends to make out Havoc Squad as a loose cannon, thereby getting the squad suspended so he can turn the war in his favor. Balkar produces evidence gathered by the SIS proving Zian's Imperial ties. The evidence is indisputable, including holorecordings of Zian's meetings with Imperial agents and bank records of the bribes he received. Garza instructed the major to present the evidence at the hearing. The Senate will have to investigate and arrest Zian for high treason, allowing SpecForce to resume operations. Before parting company, Balkar encouraged the major to have fun."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 3627 BBY, Balkar brokered an alliance between the Galactic Republic and the Eternal Alliance, meeting with the Alliance Commander on Nar Shaddaa.
