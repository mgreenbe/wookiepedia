During the conflict with the Resistance, the sergeant\u2014whose legion deployed to the planet Batuu\u2014accompanied Lieutenant Agnon and several troopers aboard a TIE echelon to Black Spire Outpost. His most notable feature was a long scar around his left eye, with a blue prosthetic in place of where his eye should be."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He later paid a visit to Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities, and found a lightsaber purported to have belonged to the late Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi. During this time, he removed his helmet. He then attempted to strong-arm the proprietor, Dok-Ondar, into supplying him with the weapon so that he could ensure the Resistance did not gain any advantages due to its ties to the Jedi Order. Unbeknownst to him, however, he had been secretly monitored by a video droid that Remex Io of the Kendoh Gang secretly placed among the store's wares, with everything he said having been monitored by them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sergeant later left Batuu to brief Lieutenant Agnon regarding their mission on the planet, although he was forced to depart earlier than expected when his squad requested his assistance in dispatching two enemies suspected to be Resistance agents, especially after they killed one of their squad. He was unimpressed when he learned that only two agents gave his men trouble before nonetheless eliminating them with a 125-Z treadspeeder bike, making clear in response to their statement that they'd rather kill the other Stormtroopers than be sent to a First Order prison that the 709th had no intention of taking them alive anyway."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After killing them, he then deduced they were not actually affiliated with the Resistance and considered it a waste, also making clear to his forces when asked that he knew this because they barely even put up a fight against him, which a resistance member would have been much more aggressive when cornered. However, he then got an urgent message citing three individuals with death marks issued by the First Order being spotted near the spaceport, with the sergeant likewise telling him to have their informant tail them in case they leave before having the squad depart from the immediate area, citing there's nothing there requiring their presence. Unbeknownst to the sergeant, however, a Resistance agent had overheard his statement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sergeant eventually tracked down Kendoh Voss's gang and cornered them at Dok-Odnar's shop, and promptly had RS-2112 smack Wooro with his baton as a form of intimidation towards Voss. However, he was ultimately forced to let them escape after Voss proceeded to destroy the containment field of a baby sarlacc, which resulted in ZJ-7199's demise. He and the other stormtroopers chased Voss outside but ultimately lost sight of her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Over Black Spire Outpost"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 34 ABY at Black Spire Outpost on the Outer Rim planet Batuu, a First Order assault shuttle roared above the outpost. Both the Clawdite criminal, Remex Io and Ronto Roasters droid worker, 8D-J8 were not happy to see the arrival of the First Order.  In the assault shuttle, the First Order sergeant looked down at all the individuals at Black Spire Outpost below  him and referred to them as \"Batuuan Rats.\" He believed that there were members of the private military force, the Resistance hiding on the planet and it was the task of the elite stormtrooper legion, Red Fury to snuff them out. The sergeant was willing to burn all of Batuu in order to locate the Resistance members. Standing next to him, Lieutenant Agnon accepted nothing less from the sergeant, stating that Batuu will never be the same when the First Order is done with it."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Paying Dok-Ondar a visit"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the antiquite store of Ithorian collector Dok-Ondar, the stormtrooper sergeant held the lightsaber, used by the late Cerean Jedi Master, Ki-Adi-Mundi. During their encounter he removed his helmet, revealing his scared face. The sergeant tried to remember who Mundi was, asking if he was the Jedi with the pointed head. The sergeant had never paid much attention to history, as he was more concerned with the future. He activated the blue bladed lightsaber and asked Ondar if he believed  in the future. When Ondar replied in Ithorese, the sergeant lashed out at him, not knowing how to speak the language. Ondar's translator, Tohago translated the Ithorese for the sergeant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tohago told him that Ondar says that he does not have to threaten him because the Ithorian was just a humble store owner with only respect for the First Order. The sergeant did not believe what Ondar had said, replying that his store is known across the galaxy for its ancient relics. he deactivated the lightsaber and placed the weapon down, telling Ondar that he's store was the perfect location for Resistance spies. As the sergeant continued lecturing Ondar about a the future, a video droid secretly placed there by Io was being monitored and watched by Io, Wooro, and Kendoh Voss from their starship. Io changed his form into the sergeant to move the gang's plan forward."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Placing his helmet back on, the sergeant warned Ondar that it was his duty to report any Resistance activity to the First Order, or else the Order would confiscate and destroy all his relics. Ondar understood that the sergeant had no appreciation for the past but told him the story of how the Ithorian came in possession of Ki-Adi-Mundi's lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After finishing the story, the sergeant was angry that Ondar wasted his time. Ondar told him to take a deeper look into the lightsaber. He explained that the lightsaber had survived the falls of the Galactic Republic, Galactic Empire, and it will survive the First Order. He continued, telling the sergeant that his grip on Black Spire Outpost was weak and to never come into his store and threaten him. Before the sergeant could lash back at Ondar, one of his stormtroopers reported a disturbance in the market that could be tied to the Resistance. The sergeant sarcastically wished Ondar a good day and promised to see him again soon."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "To the rescue"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Above Batuu, the stormtrooper sergeant was attending a briefing from Lieutenant Agnon but was called back to the planet when two suspected Resistance operatives attacked a group of stormtroopers. The sergeant took a assault shuttle to the surface of the planet. He joined the firefight on a 125-Z treadspeeder bike and was not impressed that the stormtroopers could not handle the two operatives. The sergeant drove at the operatives on his speeder bike and quickly took both of them out. He realized that this incursion was useless as the operatives were not members of the Resistance. But then we received a message that they had received a tip that three fugitives with death marks from General Armitage Hux were located near the spaceport. He ordered his troopers to move out as a Resistance operative flees unnoticed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after, the bounty hunter Kendoh Voss and her gang had confronted Dok Ondar at his antique store to begin their heist. But before they could begin, her partner Remex Io reported into her that there was an emergency. He told her that the sergeant and the Red Fury had tracked them down and were just outside the store, getting ready to confront them."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Final confrontation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sergeant reminded Ondar of the punishments that would take place for associating himself with individuals like Voss. He then turned to Voss and went over her past missions, flattering her. Ondar warned her not to antagonize the sergeant but the sergeant instead lashed out at Ondar for speaking in Ithorian. To show Voss the situation she was in, he ordered on of his stormtroopers, RS-2112 to strike Wooro with a Z6 riot control baton. The Aqualish was knocked back by the blow and Voss began to threaten the sergeant. But the sergeant interrupted her and noted her loyalty to her crew. He told her to stand down because he is only keeping the two alive for answers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sergeant told them about the First Order's goal of conquering the galaxy and destroying the Resistance. He warned them that the Order will do whatever it takes to find the operatives.

Voss threw another sarcastic comment at the sergeant which caused him smack Voss with the end of his blaster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Ondar finished telling Voss about the ending to his mission to Moraband, the sergeant asked Voss why she was on Batuu. She told him about the heist and admitted that the heist had gone wrong but she would improvise. She then leaped across and grabbed the box containing the hilt of the Sword of Khashyun as the sergeant ordered his soldiers to shot them down. Voss grabbed Ki-Adi-Mundi's lightsaber as the sergeant and the stormtroopers surrounded her. The sergeant believed that Voss didn't stand a chance against them. She then activated the lightsaber and freed Ondar's young sarlacc Simpi. The sarlacc attacked the stormtroopers, killing ZJ-7199 and causing the sergeant to order his troopers to retreat and chase Voss out the store. The sergeant and another trooper lost Voss in the crowd of people and he ordered a perimeter to be set up."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The stormtrooper sergeant was a male human like the rest of the  First Order stormtrooper corps. He had blonde hair and a pale skin tone. He also had a brown right eye with a blue cybernetic left eye. The sergeant was fiercely loyal to the First Order and was willing to do whatever it took to remove the Resistance presence on Batuu. He had a strong confidence in himself and was angry when the stormtroopers under his command failed to complete their tasks.
