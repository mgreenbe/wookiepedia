A writing system was a set of visible signs used to represent units of a given language in a systematic way. Notable examples included the Aurebesh, High Galactic, Outer Rim Basic, and Umbaran alphabet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In ancient times, writing was done by applying pigmented substance to a surface with a utensil held in the hand. For example, the Sith of old wrote on scrolls. Over time, technological evolution made it possible to produce virtual written characters without having to make complex physical motions with the hand. In the aftermath of the Battle of Endor, Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan still wrote some of her letters by hand when she deemed they required a personal touch. Some people, including Ezra Bridger, Sabine Wren, and Rey, kept a personal handwritten journal. Emperor Palpatine himself was known to occasionally send handwritten letters. At the height of the New Republic, however, almost nobody wrote by hand any longer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The art of fancy handwriting was called \"calligraphy.\" Ben Solo practiced it when he was still studying under his uncle Luke Skywalker to become a Jedi. In his sleeping quarters at Skywalker's temple, Solo kept a calligraphy set that included several pens, parchments, and an inkwell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
