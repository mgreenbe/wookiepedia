But Jango Fett beat them to the prize, handing the criminals over to Darth Tyranus, who, unlike Tambor, wanted them alive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Separatist Crisis, Cradossk had become the guildmaster of the Bounty Hunters' Guild. When a Jedi named Reeft accidentally killed a guild hunter named Tosinqas as they both followed the same quarry, Cradossk issued a stern rebuke to the Jedi Order following the incident, saying that better communication was needed, and that the death of a licensed hunter was unacceptable. Jango Fett stoically resisted Cradossk's tenacious attempts to get him to join the Bounty Hunters Guild. Fett explained his refusal to join the Guild to his clone son Boba, telling him that he didn't like social groups or \"self-congratulating braggarts.\" And he spurned any kind of supervision."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the time of the Clone Wars, Cradossk appeared alongside Bossk in the holovid collection The Bounty Hunters' Guild's Greatest Hits: Volume VII, which recorded a number of disputes between the pair."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cradossk built up a fearsome reputation during his time as a hunter, and it was said that even Boba Fett held some respect for him: Fett would include Cradossk's short memoir, Making a Killing, in his copy of The Bounty Hunter Code. However, with age, even Cradossk started to decline in strength. His son, Bossk, grew resentful of the elderly hunter as he saw more and more weakness within him. Cradossk noticed Bossk's rebellious ways, and attempted to kill him through his partner Zuckuss during one of their missions. Zuckuss returned to Cradossk following their hunt and lied about Bossk being dead. To Cradossk's surprise, Bossk then entered the room. Cradossk was ultimately killed and devoured in his son's rage, helping to begin the Bounty Hunter Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
