The New Star carried twelve TIE/LN starfighters and had a full complement of shuttles and escape pods.

The Far Orbit claimed that it had orders to accompany the convoy as well, a set of orders that Conar did not bother checking with Bormea Imperial Command.

In actuality, the Far Orbit was an Alliance privateer vessel in disguise and had funneled the convoy into a trap.

O'Brien. The book was a supplement to West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game and was a sequel of sorts to the previous publication, Pirates & Privateers, carrying on that book's theme by following the Far Orbit's adventures. In the adventure scenario, it is possible for the Alliance to not send any help for the Far Orbit in its attack on the convoy and the New Star, leaving the Far Orbit to try to take the convoy alone. If that is the case, the Far Orbit might attempt to capture the New Star. It is also possible for the New Star to be destroyed in the battle instead of being captured, in which case the privateers receive no money from the Alliance. If the New Star is captured but seriously damaged, the Far Orbit's crew is awarded a million credits. However, this article assumes that the course of events that this article presents is correct because they represent the best course of actions for the privateers, who are controlled by the players."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
