The Pho Ph'eahians had developed this by the time of their first encounter with the Galactic Republic. Reactor cores could sometimes be powered by nuclear fission, and 2a fission engines were powered by this as well. Fission bombs may also have utilized this reaction in their detonation. Nom Anor used nuclear fission explosives to destroy the battle cruiser Mediator, in a scheme to fake his own death. Sublight drives in general used a fusion-reaction process, breaking fuel into charged particles and hurling it into space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
