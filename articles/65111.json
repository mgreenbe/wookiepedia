As the ultimate evolution of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Imperial Army swiftly asserted dominance throughout the galaxy, making use of highly trained soldiers, mechanized walkers, and overwhelming numbers. The Imperial Army operated in tandem with the forces of the Imperial Navy, relying on the numerous fleets to transport legions of troopers across the far reaches of the galaxy. The most common soldiers of the Empire's ground forces were known as Imperial Army troopers, the core infantry of the army tasked with establishing Imperial regimes and pacifying troublesome worlds. As the Imperials reinforced their grip on the galaxy, these units were gradually phased out in those areas and were replaced by stormtrooper garrisons, elite shock troops fanatically loyal to the Emperor himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Structure"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the branch of the Imperial Military that dealt with surface operations, the army of the Galactic Empire was composed of many sub-units and organizations, and utilized a vast array of vehicles to achieve its objectives. The purpose of the army was to enforce the oppressive Imperial government headed by Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine, who created the armed force to be one that held unwavering and appalling strength.

As stormtroopers were part of the Stormtrooper Corps, which was placed under the Army, they received their orders from the Stormtrooper Command subdivision of High Command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Army Engineering Corps served to construct Imperial installations and demolish enemy fortifications. The Imperial Army also maintained its own law enforcement agency, the Imperial Army Military Police, although they were overshadowed by the Stormtrooper Corps.

The Empire's armored cavalry consisted of many different types of walkers, such as the All Terrain Armored Transport, and tanks, such as the 2-M hover tank, Imperial-class 1-H repulsortank, and the TX-225 GAVw \"Occupier\" combat assault tank. These were organized under the Imperial Armor Corps and Imperial Artillery Corps, a sub-unit of the Armor Corps."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Army also maintained numerous TIE fighters for combat use in planetary atmospheres as part of the Army Air Corps. As a result, TIE fighter pilots in the Imperial Army were nicknamed ground-hogs unlike their Imperial Navy counterpart, the vac-heads. Since vac-heads maintained better public recognition through the HoloNet News, a bitter rivalry existed between the two branches, with each having their own anthem and bars at Imperial flight bases in order to avoid conflict. However the Bright Jewel Oversector Flight Base did not separate its bar between the branches, in one instance resulting in members of Nashtah Squadron to provoke other members of the Imperial Navy by singing the Ground-hog anthem."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Formation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Army originated from the Grand Army of the Republic, and served as the Galactic Empire's ground forces for maintaining control of the countless worlds under the New Order.

As a result, the clone troopers who fought for the Galactic Republic became the first generation of Imperial stormtroopers. Although clone soldiers were considered the \"future of galactic warfare,\" Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin questioned their usefulness in the wake of the Clone Wars. Despite the Kaminoan Prime Minister Lama Su's belief that the Empire needed more clone troopers to maintain order in the galaxy, Tarkin felt that the cloning operation on Kamino was a \"cost prohibitive relic of a bygone era.\" Nevertheless, he reserved his final decision while assessing the clone units in order to determine if they were still needed by the Imperial Army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The results of Project War-Mantle\u2014a program created to replace clone troopers with enlisted soldiers\u2014impressed Admiral Tarkin. The admiral continued to regard the clone trooper program as an unnecessary financial burden, whereas he viewed a service conscription force as a cost-effective solution to the Empire's need for more soldiers. However, Tarkin decided that the clones would continue to serve their purpose until the Empire was prepared to decommission them. Vice Admiral Rampart, the head of the Empire's conscription program, envisioned the Imperial Army's future as a force comprising willing recruits instead of programmed clones. The goals of Tarkin and Rampart concerned Lama Su, who feared that natural-born soldiers would make his clones obsolete. Therefore, he urged his Chief Medical Scientist, Doctor Nala Se, to create a superior clone in hopes of securing Kamino's relationship with the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In time the clones were replaced by recruits, who were trained for obedience and absolute loyalty to the Emperor. These recruited stormtroopers were already active a year into the Empire's reign, although Clone Wars-era vehicles still saw use in the Imperial Army; while facing tanks during the Raada Uprising, former Padawan Ahsoka Tano suspected the older vehicles had been deployed to the moon because of how insignificant Raada was in the grand scheme of the Empire's plans. Many soldiers in the Imperial Army were members of local planetary defense forces who took up arms during the Clone Wars and were subsequently conscripted into Imperial service. Classified as infantry, Imperial Army troopers were gradually upgraded and replaced with Stormtrooper forces, but would continue to serve side-by-side with stormtroopers to bolster their effectiveness for several years after the formation of the Empire."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial consolidation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY, Imperial Army forces were garrisoned on the Imperial protectorate of Ryloth, which was in reality under Imperial occupation. Colonel Belkor Dray served as Governor Moff Delian Mors' second-in-command and commanded the Imperial Army forces on Ryloth. The stormtroopers on Ryloth operated outside the Imperial Army command structure and answered directly to the Empire. He used his senior position within the Imperial government and military on Ryloth to spy for Cham Syndulla, the leader of the Free Ryloth Movement. Other elements of the Imperial Army were stationed at the Equatorial Communications Hub, which was commanded by Major Steen Borkas. Though their base was attacked, Borkas' forces including stormtroopers assisted Moff Mors in rescuing Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader and foiling Dray and Syndulla's plot to assassinate the Empire's leadership. Following the failed assassination attempt, the Imperial authorities embarked on a crackdown on Ryloth and strengthened the stormtrooper presence on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During 10 BBY, the mighty Imperial Army focused its sights on the swampy world of Mimban, a planet known for its abundance of natural resources. At the behest of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, all regional governors were required to immediately increase production of materials benefiting the Imperial cause. Bin Essada, governor of the Circarpous sector within the Expansion Region, ordered all necessary resources to be stripped from Mimban at once, disregarding the indigenous population. The combined forces of the Imperial Army and Imperial Navy thus invaded the planet, launching the Mimban campaign and initiating a bloody conflict between the entrenched Mimbanese and Imperials. The Imperial Army utilized its army troopers in tandem with the more elite Stormtroopers, along with All Terrain Defense Turrets, AT-haulers and air support provided by naval TIE fighters to pacify the stubborn Mimbanese guerillas. Among the battered army soldiers was a young Han Solo, serving as a corporal within the 224th Imperial Armored Division. Solo initially attended the Carida Academy in the hopes of one day becoming an Imperial pilot and returning to his homeworld of Corellia. However the maverick prospect was eventually transferred to infantry duty on Mimban following multiple instances of insubordination and recklessness. Though the seizure of resources was the military's primary goal during the campaign, they also sought to establish a regime that fell under the direct jurisdiction of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 5 BBY, Lothal's Academy for Young Imperials was training Imperial cadets for both the Imperial Army and Stormtrooper Corps.
