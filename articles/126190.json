Though the Jedi prophecy of the Chosen One was fulfilled at the Battle of Endor by a redeemed Darth Vader, the Sith Eternal cult preserved the Sith religion on the ancient Sith world of Exegol. Led by the revived Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, the Sith Eternal labored for a generation to build the Final Order, a large fleet of Sith Star Destroyers, which was ready for deployment by the last days of the First Order/Resistance War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Early Sith cultists attempted to excavate the enormous fissures found on the Sith world of Exegol in order to reach the vergence beneath the planet's surface."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Imperial Era, the Sith cult known as the Sith Eternal existed on Exegol, where they had settled in the Sith Citadel and served the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, the Emperor of the Galactic Empire. Among his loyalists was the Sith assassin Ochi of Bestoon. Around 3 ABY, after the Duel on Cloud City, Sidious' Sith apprentice Darth Vader discovered his master's hidden world when he acquired a Sith wayfinder from the Eye of Webbish Bog. Vader intended to kill his master and uncover his secrets, but he was beaten back into submission after witnessing the tremendous power he had built up with the help of the Sith cultists, including the creation of a number of strandcasts, the development of a number of Star Destroyers with planet-destroying cannons, and the tortuous harvesting of a mountain of kyber crystals. During his time on Exegol, Vader was attacked by a group of Sith cultists armed with daggers, but he killed them by hurling their blades into the air and piercing the cultists with them by means of the Force."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "New Republic Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the New Republic Era, Sith cults such as the Acolytes of the Beyond venerated the last two Dark Lords of the Sith, Darth Sidious and Darth Vader. The Acolytes were not Force-sensitive, yet claimed to have received dreams from deceased Sith and even to have communed with their shades. They were led by individuals, such as Yupe Tashu, who were members of the Emperor's inner circle during his reign.
