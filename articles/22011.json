Given the rank of clone marshal commander, Neyo became the commanding officer of the 91st Reconnaissance Corps, and in 19 BBY served in the five-month-long siege of the Separatist planet Saleucami.

In this training camp, 8826 and the other clone commander cadets began to develop their own personalities, encouraged by Alpha's unorthodox training methods, which allowed for more free thought and expression. CC-8826 himself took the nickname \"Neyo\" and became one of the coldest, most morbid members of his class. Neyo eventually graduated among the first hundred alumni of Alpha's program, being given the rank of clone marshal commander and command over the GAR's 91st Reconnaissance Corps.

A Separatist plot to sabotage the conference by ramming a Venator-class Star Destroyer which was ridden with rhydonium into the space station was foiled by Gascon and the D-Squad.

After receiving his orders, Neyo motioned for CT-3423 and himself to fall behind Allie's 74-Z speeder bike. With their commanding officer directly in front of them, Neyo and CT-3423 opened fire on Allie with their BARC speeders' laser cannons; with Neyo's final shot, the reactor ignited and sent the Jedi crashing into the ground, killing Allie in the resulting explosion. Following the declaration of Order 66, the Republic was reorganized into the first Galactic Empire by Palpatine, who crowned himself Galactic Emperor.

In the program, Neyo became one of the coldest and most unfeeling clones in his training class, adopting a laconic, almost morbid personality. He became an iconic member of the 91st Reconnaissance Corps, making a considerable reputation for himself. He was a loyal clone trooper, and when Chancellor Palpatine declared Order 66, he adhered to his master's wishes, killing General Stass Allie without a second's hesitation.

Neyo's background was expanded upon in the articles Guide to the Grand Army of the Republic and Order 66: Destroy All Jedi, which appeared in the eighty-fourth and eighty-seventh issues of Star Wars Insider, respectively. Neyo also appeared in the comic Republic 79, which briefly recollected his execution of Stass Allie. In the comic, he was drawn by Douglas Wheatley.

Initially, Neyo's digital model was to be a commander of an HAVw A6 Juggernaut, and during the Order 66 scene, he was to order his tank to open fire on the tree-top command center above the battlefield that housed Yoda. This scene was cut, and the digital model was reassigned to a biker clone commander who carried out the execution of Stass Allie on Saleucami. Originally, the Saleucami clone was to be named \"Faie\"\u2014after Art Department Supervisor Fay David\u2014but the use of the Neyo model changed that commander's name. The Faie model was never used in the film, but did later appear in the comic story arc, Star Wars: Republic: Hidden Enemy. Dave Filoni, the Series Supervising Director for the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series, based Clone Commander CC-3636's new helmet visor on Neyo's helmet from Episode III, for the episode \"Mercy Mission,\" the fifth episode of the series' fourth season. Although not used in the episode \"Secret Weapons,\" Neyo's face was given a design, which featured him sporting a tattoo of his clone designation in Aurebesh, on his left cheek. That facial design was incorporated into Neyo's action figure as part of a December 2013 wave of Hasbro's Star Wars: The Black Series collection."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
