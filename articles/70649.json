The Dark Lord also had a sleek alien starship built, complete with a falsified log stating that it had been built by the Jerni and had come from the planet Jerne, then sent it into the nearby void of space for the Rebels to find. Sure enough, Vader's ruse attracted Organa and her Rebel ally Luke Skywalker to Jerne, believing that they could find the Eternity Crystal and use it to save Alderaan from its fate or even prevent the Empire from existing at all.
