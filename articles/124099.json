More daringly, she used her position to attend and arrange dinners and glamorous balls with Imperial Moffs and admirals, discreetly probing for sensitive information. Her method for sharing this information was to store it on a datadot hidden in her firegem ring, then hand it to a Rebel contact. She often met her contacts at the Coruscant Opera House, for which she had a private box."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
