Like the S3, the S3B was a shielded two seater assault starfighter manned by a pilot and gunner. The S3B had twin blasters in place of the ion cannon the S3 used for its turret, and was more successful than the BTL-A4 Y-wing variant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The BTL-S3B was first mentioned in The Essential Guide to Warfare, an extensive guide dedicated to the conflicts in the galaxy, written by Jason Fry and Paul R. Urquhart and released in 2012. Urquhart confirmed in 2015 on the TheForce.net that the S3B was both a nod to the two-seater Y-wings that appeared in Splinter of the Mind's Eye and The Star Wars Holiday Special, and to the sources such as the Star Wars: Battlefront series that had Y-wings with blasters in their turrets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
