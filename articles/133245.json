He revealed the fact that the book will have rotating creative teams and that each issue will feature a lead story about popular characters from the films and back-up stories with lesser known or fan-favorite characters, including the ones from the TV series, hosted by Maz Kanata as the narrator, though other characters, such as C-3PO, were considered too. Ryall also said that some of the back-up stories will not be entirely canon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On June 6, 2017, Ryall conducted an interview with the podcast Comics with Kenobi, where he spoke about the series. He said that a lot of people messaged him soon after the announcement about them wanting to do this their entire life. This allowed Ryall to make a large creative pool, from which he could pull from in the future. It was explained that while Marvel Comics still has the Star Wars comics license, they don't have any books aimed at beginner readers, which is where Star Wars Adventures would come in. Ryall also suggested that the usage of Maz Kanata as the back-up-story storyteller might have been dropped by this point."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On June 14, 2017, IDW released their upcoming comics catalogue, which included the release information on the first and second issue of the series, excluding the SDCC Ashcan.
