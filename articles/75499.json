Powerfully built, they had purple skin and black, red, or violet eyes. They were typically found to be very attractive by Human standard, although the two species were different enough to be biologically incapable of reproduction. The Keshiri had long traditions of crafting and the arts, with glassblowing being a particular specialty and pantomime a favorite art form. They were a very religious species, worshiping gods known as the Skyborn, whom they believed had formed all of the land on Kesh, from which the Keshiri were born. They acknowledged the Skyborn as the Protectors who kept another group, the Destructors, at bay. After a group of Jedi crash-landed on Kesh and fought a ruinous Great Battle against a band of Dark Jedi and Sith, the events took on the status of legend, remembered as the Great Cataclysm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 5000 BBY, a group of Sith crashed onto the continent of Keshtah in their starship, the Omen, after being knocked off-course during a hyperspace jump. The Keshiri there believed the newcomers to be the Skyborn and gave themselves over to lives of service to the Sith. The Keshiri religion and government of Keshtah were led by the Neshtovar, who believed in the importance of tradition and religion above science and technological progress. Nevertheless, one Keshiri, a female named Adari Vaal, realized the dangers the Sith presented and led a resistance movement. She was eventually forced to flee Keshtah for Alanciar, a larger continent with its own Keshiri population. There, she became revered as the Herald for warning the Alanciari to prepare for an inevitable invasion by the Sith. The people heeded her warnings and rebuilt their civilization along martial lines. When the invasion finally occurred millennia later, the Sith High Lord Varner Hilts duped the Alanciari into joining their Keshtah kin in service to the Sith. Nevertheless, he had a newfound respect for the Keshiri species and thought them potentially worthy to join the Sith Tribe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Keshiri eventually found that the Sith were not their gods, but they continued serving them for thousands of years. By 41 ABY, the Keshiri had come to be seen almost as equals to the Sith, and several were accepted into the Sith Tribe, with at least one serving on the Circle of Lords, the Tribe's ruling council. Around the time of the Second Galactic Civil War, members of the Keshiri species were able to travel off-world for the first time in the newly formed Sith armada. Several Keshiri served as leaders in the fleet, such as High Lord Sarasu Taalon. However, the Tribe's attempted invasion of the galaxy resulted in the elimination of numerous Sith, including many Keshiri, on the planet Coruscant by the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Keshiri were a species of sentient near-Humans from the remote Wild Space world of Kesh. Although some specimens were rather portly, Keshiri typically were powerfully built, with a humanoid body of two arms, two legs, a torso, and a head. Each hand sported five fingers capped by nails. Their skin was typically a shade of purple\u2014whether pale, burgundy, or mauve\u2014although it could fluctuate from darker to lighter hues and even into tones of blue as their emotions shifted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Keshiri face was characterized by two eyes, a central nose, and a mouth. The eyes were proportionally large and came in the colors red, violet, and black. Eyebrows grew above each eye, and the eyelids featured lashes. Their hair, waxy in some, ranged in color from brown through violet to silver and white. Regardless of its original color, the hair whitened with age and thinned or receded in some male members of the species. The mouth, lined by lips of a shade darker than the rest of the skin, contained a dark-purple tongue and rows of white dentition; some Keshiri exhibited noticeable gaps between teeth. Their throat was sometimes subject to buildups of fluid that required clearing. Separate populations of Keshiri exhibited slight phenotypic differences. For instance, the Keshiri of the continent Keshtah had lower foreheads, narrower faces, and smaller and more narrowly set eyes in comparison to the Keshiri of the Alanciar landmass."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Keshiri had two sexes, male and female. Physical characteristics distinguished the two sexes, such as facial hair on men. Because they were extremely similar to Humans in their appearance, they were found by members of the Human species to be particularly attractive. As such, they often intermarried with the Human population on Kesh, despite the fact that the two species were fundamentally different enough on a biological level to preclude reproduction. Keshiri were still considered young at age fifteen, and their lifespan exceeded sixty years. Keshiri required sleep each night, a period during which they sometimes experienced vivid dreams. They had the capacity to use the Force; indeed, many Force-sensitive Keshiri hailed from the continent Alanciar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before contact with outsiders from beyond Kesh, the Keshiri had a simple society, which included small settlements of circular homes with tall, conical, thatched roofs. These early Keshiri dressed in simple tunics, trousers, and fur-lined boots. They carried personal effects in pouches attached to belts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Keshiri life was centered around their religion. They worshiped a group of gods called the Skyborn, also known as the Protectors, a sandy-blooded race who were believed to have lived in the stars. According to Keshiri legend, the Skyborn's enemies were the Otherside\u2014beings of fire, rebellion, sickness, and death, about whom very little was known other than that they had \"come from below.\" The Keshiri believed that the Skyborn, riding gigantic crystal uvak\u2014membranous-winged reptilian creatures native to Kesh\u2014fought with the Otherside among the stars in what the Keshiri religious leaders called the Great Battle. According to the legend, the battle lasted for eons, until the Otherside were finally defeated. The Skyborn, however, had been injured, and their blood fell into the oceans, forming the land that gave birth to the Keshiri. As such, it was commonly believed that the land of Kesh was a part of the Skyborn and that the Skyborn had the power to control such phenomena as groundquakes, volcanic eruptions, and storms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another important point of Keshiri religion was the Destructors, a mysterious group who were said to return to the galaxy every few eons to destroy all civilization, returning all beings to their primitive origins. The Destructors' enemies, the Skyborn, were said to be destined to defend Kesh from the Destructors. According to Keshiri legend, the Skyborn had already defended Kesh from the Destructors in the distant past, a conflict that resulted in a Great Calamity that altered the very geography of the world. Research conducted in the time leading up to 41 ABY seemed to indicate that a catastrophe much like that which the Destructors were believed to cause had indeed occurred on Kesh at least once previously. Another Keshiri divinity was the Bright Tuash, a creature with avian characteristics. In addition to their religious nature, the Keshiri were a scientific people; they had determined that their world was round well before the first outsiders arrived from beyond its atmosphere. They ventilated their structures with passages through the roof, creating de facto crawlspaces through which a Keshiri could move about."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Keshiri kissed when sexually attracted to one another. They mated for life, and practiced marriage, although extramarital affairs were not unknown. They raised their children until adulthood.

On the former, the leaders of Keshiri government and religion were a group of males known as the Neshtovar, the self-proclaimed \"Sons of the Skyborn.\" They were known for breeding and riding uvak, which they kept in liveries. Traditionally, when a member of the Neshtovar died, the rest of his family was killed by the Keshiri community; however, this practice was discontinued by 5000 BBY. The Neshtovar were expected to be experts at riding uvak\u2014to fall off one of the creatures was equivalent to being \"claimed by the Otherside.\" The Neshtovar governed the Keshiri from the Circle Eternal, a plaza located in their capital city of Tahv, where its position above the Keshiri Burial Cairns made it their holiest shrine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although they had very little tolerance for beings who went against their religion, the Keshiri of Keshtah were typically a peaceful civilization. More interested in tradition and religion than learning, they were less developed technologically than much of the outside galaxy and did not even have a number high enough to count their entire population. However, they created a complex aqueduct system for Tahv. Rather isolated from the rest of the galaxy, the Keshiri made their first contact with other beings in 5000 BBY, when a group of Sith crash-landed on the planet in their starship, the Omen. After witnessing the newcomers' powers, Keshtah's Keshiri came to believe that the newcomers were their Protectors, the Skyborn, and committed themselves to lives of servitude to the Sith. In this capacity, some Keshiri took to performing menial tasks for their Sith masters, such as carrying them about on palanquins. Other Keshiri became constables, patrolling the streets of cities such as Tahv wearing red body armor and armed with glass-bladed swords and halberds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Sith arrival, the Neshtovar of Keshtah were replaced by the Tribe's ruling council, the Circle of Lords, as the governing body of Kesh. The Sith instituted several other changes to the Keshiri way of life on the continent, and even more than a thousand years after their arrival, the Keshiri lived as servants to the Sith. They were forbidden to ride the uvaks that were native to the world, and the Sith Saber Orielle Kitai did not approve of a Keshiri calling her by her first name. They instituted a new annual holiday that commemorated the arrival and founding of their new civilization with the Sith with a parade, which featured costumed jesters. During the tenure of the Sith, the Keshiri became respected for their exceptional glassmaking and sculpting skills. They and the Sith decorated Tahv with myriad ornate sculptures and buildings. The Keshiri embraced all forms of art and were familiar with the palimpsest concept\u2014in which one artwork was created on top of another. They had a lively tradition of pantomime, with troupes performing for Sith patrons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Keshiri clothing on the continent included simple, sleeveless tunics, wrist bands, and trousers for men; long dresses were for women. Males kept their hair relatively short, often binding a tuft into a short ponytail. Meanwhile, females kept their hair longer. Some men grew and sculpted their facial hair into mustaches, goatees, and other formations. They carried belongings in simple satchels and pouches that hung from their bodies."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Alanciar"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In contrast, life for the Keshiri of Alanciar\u2014also known as the Alanciari\u2014was vastly different. They traced their civilization back to the arrival of the Rock of Kesh, Adari Vaal, on uvak circa 4975 BBY. Upon her insistence, they militarized society, with every aspect of life geared toward detecting and repelling an invasion by the Sith\u2014whom they considered the Destructors of legend. The Keshtah Chronicles, a book recorded by Vaal, detailed the culture, war strategies, and dark-side Force use of the enemy; the book was required reading for children on Alanciar. Years after her death, a tapestry of Vaal adorned a wall of Vaal Hall, the capital building."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alanciari practiced conscription, whereby Keshiri were called into military service as need demanded. Members of Alanciar's military had the opportunity to progress through ranks, such as supply clerk, materials supervisor, wardmaster, chief military administrator, and mayor. The Training Directorate taught crafts, such as glassblowing, to veterans, a practice that allowed even these older Keshiri to contribute to the defense of Alanciar. Meanwhile, an air force of uvak riders defended the skies. Although Alanciari knowledge of the Force was imperfect, their Force-sensitive citizens served as thoughtcriers, tasked with sending important messages and warnings through the Force. The Induction Board was a body that endeavored to identify such Force-sensitives to train them. Alanciari wore clothing conducive to their militarized lifestyle. For instance, front-line soldiers wore hard, leather armor. Meanwhile, a female officer might wear a waistcoat and keep her hair in a tight bun. Raised insignia signified the wearer's rank, and soldiers stayed in barracks when serving on active duty. Nevertheless, when under attack, the entire population participated in the war effort; for instance, civilians boiled water to run steam-driven sirens that warned of war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alanciari sculpted their landmass to maximize their ability to defend it, cutting terraces into hillsides and planting forests alongside raised-stone roadways to allow hidden watchers to see anyone traveling by, and separating highways from woodlands with deep trenches. Way stations dotted the road network, where guards could see far down the roads in all directions. Only a few mountain passes escaped such surveillance. Inland canals permitted riverine traffic of small boats and barges pulled by teams of muntoks, six-limbed creatures used for transport and carrying loads."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alanciari considered their home continent to resemble the leg of the muntok. The bulk of the population inhabited the uplands of the muntok's \"hip\" to the east, where most of their industrial centers were located, such as factories that produced glass projectiles. Keshiri workers fabricated battle armor in factories along the continent's northern slopes. Next came the Shank, which rose to mountainous isthmuses known as the Six Claws in the west. Due to that region's proximity to Keshtah, it had a reputation as highly regimented, as the Alanciari military kept the area heavily fortified and sequestered. Each of the Six Claws sported a signal station, where Keshiri members of the Signal Corps kept watch for invaders and sent messages in semaphore via bright, colorful lights generated by grids of fireglobes. Teams of uvak-riders who were equipped with diamond-flak ballista were used to patrol the skies above Alanciar. Meanwhile, a coast guard known as the Shore Guard, whom were equipped with armed sailing ships, added an extra layer of security by patrolling far out to sea. Alanciari guards used whistles to stop strangers. Their land was divided into districts, with the capital at Sus'mintri, a city that also served as a headquarters for their War Cabinet and housed Vaal's personal library, repurposed as a top-secret archives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alanciari had a tradition of seafaring using large, wooden sailing vessels with tall, triangular sails. The harvester fleet of fishers was permitted to roam the Western Sea in ships and rowboats gathering crustaceans; there, they relied on detailed maps and immense kedges made of stone to keep from being swept away in the fast currents. In the chilly waters south of the continent, sailors wore heavy vests, fur-lined gloves, and boots. Alanciari sailors often sported earrings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alanciari construction was done in materials such as wood, alabaster, brick, and concrete, sometimes coated with paint. Their architecture featured courtyards, balconies, and stairs. They installed warning sirens in virtually every settlement; the sirens worked by funneling steam through enormous pipes made of glass. They used wood, leather, duffel, and glass to construct tools and goods. Some implements included hay carts, coatracks, desks, folders, personal bags, books, earshells for the deaf, pots, and spoons. Stew was an Alanciari dish. They also drank alcoholic beverages. The Alanciari developed weapons not found on Keshtah. One of these was the hand-ballista, a handheld device that allowed a ballisteer to fire projectiles such as glass rods\u2014which shattered into splinters upon impact\u2014and fragmenting bolts made of silver. When well trained, ballisteers fired in tandem following signals given via signal towers. A repeating version of the hand-ballista was issued to all front-line Alanciari soldiers. Other weapons, used by uvak-borne riders, fired diamonds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For much of their history, the Alanciar Keshiri were a patriotic civilization, singing songs that honored their nation. Especially important was Observance Day, a masquerade during which certain Keshiri painted their faces pale in a manner found frightening and dressed as Sith. As these costumers roamed the streets, other Keshiri danced around them and mocked them. The holiday festivities culminated in a theatrical recreation of Adari Vaal's first visit to Alanciar on uvak-back and her warnings about the Sith to the west. Observance Day was celebrated once per decade, a timeframe that honored the length of Vaal's resistance movement against the Sith."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Keshiri united"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Keshtah and Alanciar Keshiri came into regular contact in 2975 BBY, the Alanciari nominally accepted the Sith as the Protectors and, thus, their gods. Nevertheless, their enmity toward the Sith did not disappear immediately; rather, some Alanciari refused to see the Sith as anything but equals. The Sith began a program of importing the most useful aspects of Alanciari technology to Keshtah, such as the construction of sailing ships; the Keshiri spinners and weavers of the town of Eorm were forced to construct vast quantities of sailcloth as the Sith embarked on further maritime explorations of their planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over time, the Keshiri more broadly came to realize that the Sith were not their gods. Nevertheless, many aspects of the Keshiri religion were not lost, as, even thousands of years after their initial meeting, the Tribe of Sith that formed from the survivors of the crash believed in the race of Destructors, and also believed that they were the Protectors destined to save the galaxy. Over time the social status differential between the Sith and the Keshiri narrowed significantly, although the Keshiri were still considered to be inferior to the Humans. By 37 ABY, however, several Force-sensitive Keshiri were training with the Sith, and a way for them to gain admission to the Tribe took place in a festival known as Presentation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Keshiri spoke the same language as the Sith who landed on their world. For the Alanciari, this was because Adari Vaal thought it imperative that the Alanciari be able to understand the speech of their enemies, the better to identify them. Over time, distinctive Keshtah and Alanciar accents developed, although the two versions of the language remained mutually intelligible. Keshiri were able to learn to read and write, using implements such as chalk to do so. The semaphore used by the Alanciari was a sophisticated communication system that required four people: the spotters, the signalers, and the transcriptionist. Non-verbal communication included winking at someone to indicate a joke or a lie, chuckling to indicate amusement, a sign for exasperation, and smiling to indicate contentment.

The former enemies retreated to the arctic lands of Kesh's south pole, Eshkrene, where they formed a single society neutral to the light and dark sides of the Force, and where they atoned for their actions as guardians against the extinction of the Keshiri species. Coming to see their Force-sensitivity as a curse, they called themselves the Doomed.

Vaal, the wife of the deceased Neshtovar member Zhari Vaal, was branded a heretic for her teachings, especially by High Councilor of the Neshtovar, Izri Dazh, and forced to flee from Tahv. Meanwhile, the Omen, a Sith warship under the command of Captain Yaru Korsin and tasked with delivering a shipment of Lignan crystals to the Sith's Dark Lord Naga Sadow, was ambushed and knocked off-course while attempting to flee into hyperspace, causing it to crash-land on Kesh."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The survivors of the accident first made contact with Vaal, who had fled to the Takara Mountains, where the Omen had crashed.

After witnessing the Sith's great powers, Dazh and the Neshtovar decided that the newcomers were actually their gods, the Skyborn, and that they had come down from the stars to visit their home. As such, the Keshiri of Keshtah willingly decided to submit themselves to lives of service to the Sith. They helped the newcomers to build a new Temple at the crash site of the Omen and assisted in the further construction and expansion of Tahv.

Another was a memoir about her relationship to Yaru Korsin; in it, she described her strange attraction to the Human but ultimately dismissed him as an animal.

As word spread of the friendly arrivals, the Alanciari accepted Halder's tale and welcomed him as their new Herald\u2014and Hilts as the man who would unite them with their kin on Keshtah. Vrai became the de facto governor of the continent. He embarked on a program of bringing Keshtah up to the same technological standards as Alanciar and set his sights on further exploration of the planet. He also disarmed the Alanciari Keshiri as a sign of friendship to their new Sith \"allies.\" Thayn, after abandoning her fruitless attempts to convince the Alanciari that the Sith were duping them, remained close to Vrai, serving as a confidant so as to ensure that the integration of Alanciari and Sith cultures was done equitably\u2014and to learn the Sith's secrets. Meanwhile, Hilts considered bringing the Keshiri into the Lost Tribe as equals rather than slaves now that the Sith knew that the Keshiri species had Force-users among it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next year, Hilts embarked on a project to make use of the raw materials and technologies developed by the Alanciari for the Sith of Keshtah. Key among his desires was the use of Alanciari sailing vessels and crews to explore the rest of the planet. Over the next year, the Sith built a fleet of sailing ships and staffed them largely with Alanciari sailors. Hilts suspected another force of offworlders might have encountered the Keshiri before his Tribe arrived. Accordingly, circa 2974 BBY, he sent a ship, commanded by the Keshiri Captain Chegg, on a mission to survey the planet's south pole. Among the crew were the Humans Parlan Spinner and Takara Hilts, a criminal and Varner Hilts's daughter, respectively. After making landfall, the Humans attempted to mutiny and sail the ship to Alanciar, which had become fabled as a land of opportunity in the minds of Keshtah's Human population.

Spinner escaped Doomed custody and located the weapon: an oubliette containing the Human Sith Lord Remulus Dreypa, whose imprisonment thousands of years before had allowed the catastrophic war to end. With Spinner's aid, the Sith Lord escaped his imprisonment and fled to Keshtah by sailboat.

There they faced not just Dreypa but the resuscitated Leviathan larvae he had long ago hidden there. During the battle, Hilts convinced Spinner to break his alliance to the rampaging Sith Lord. When Kaliska revealed that the Doomed's ancient starship, the Last Hope, lay under the Keshiri's burial cairns, Spinner took an uvak to Tahv, stole into the holy site, and activated the vessel. To the Keshiri who witnessed it, the starship was a metallic monster with a person in its eye, headed for the stars.

Still, several Keshiri remained as servants or slaves of the Sith, and the race as a whole was generally seen as inferior to the Humans. By the time of the Second Galactic Civil War, however, the social status differential had narrowed somewhat between the two societies. Although interbreeding was impossible, many of the Human Sith took Keshiri as lovers, considering them to be very attractive. The two cultures intermingled and several Keshiri eventually rose to positions of power within the Tribe; by 37 ABY, several Keshiri had been allowed into the Sith Tribe, and by 41 ABY, at least one Keshiri was serving on the Circle of Lords, the ruling council of the Tribe and governing body of the planet. In that year, Ship, a Sith Meditation Sphere, arrived on Kesh to help train the Tribe's apprentices and form a Sith armada.

The species has since been featured in each of Miller's successive Lost Tribe of the Sith eBooks, including Skyborn, Paragon, Savior, Purgatory, and Sentinel, as well as the final installment, Pandemonium, published in July 2012 to cap off the series' paperback compilation. The species was first identified as the Keshiri in the second novel of the Fate of the Jedi series, Fate of the Jedi: Omen, written by Christie Golden and published in May 2010. Members of the Keshiri have since appeared in each successive Fate of the Jedi novel, including Fate of the Jedi: Abyss, Fate of the Jedi: Backlash, Fate of the Jedi: Allies, Fate of the Jedi: Vortex, Fate of the Jedi: Conviction, Fate of the Jedi: Ascension, and Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse. Miller included the Keshiri in each issue of the comic book series Star Wars: Lost Tribe of the Sith\u2014Spiral from Dark Horse Comics. Artist Andrea Mutti offered the first visual depiction of the species in the comic's inaugural issue, published in August 2012."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Miller has been the author to most fully explore the Keshiri, their culture, and their society; he has noted that he enjoys writing stories from the alien point of view since such stories present the temptation to overemphasize the aliens' differences from Humans rather than to make them sympathetic to readers. Miller decided to make the Keshiri a stone-age society for the first short story to detail their culture, Skyborn, wherein he was able to weave bits of the species' mythology. The story tells of the Keshiri meeting the crash-landed offworlders who would later become the Lost Tribe of the Sith, a dramatic hook that Jackson modeled after various first-encounter narratives in literature and history. For instance, he wanted to make the situation analogous to the arrival of the Mayflower Pilgrims in North America, neither friendly nor hostile to the area's inhabitants, yet desperate for help from them. Thus, the Keshiri woman Adari Vaal serves as his central character to bring the two sides together. Later stories in the Lost Tribe of the Sith series allowed Miller to flesh out Keshiri culture, especially after they entered servitude to the Sith. For instance, the stories show that the Keshiri bear their Sith masters about on palanquins due to a lack of terrestrial beasts of burden, and their access to high-quality lenses is due to their skilled glassblowers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While writing the earlier stories in the Lost Tribe series, Miller maintained the idea that other Keshiri existed beyond the continent of Keshtah, isolated from their kin due to quirks of their homeworld's geography and weather. With the novella Pandemonium, Miller used this idea to present a more speculative first-contact narrative: one in which the indigenous people\u2014in this case, the Alanciari\u2014were aware of, hostile toward, and prepared for outsiders. The idea that the Keshiri of Alanciar had lived for two millennia under the belief that they could be invaded at any time prompted Miller to make the Alanciari a martial people, while also setting a stark backdrop within which to stage a love affair between Pandemonium's two primary Keshiri characters, Quarra Thayn and Jogan Halder. The contact narrative structure also allowed the author to set up Thayn as a mirror to Adari Vaal, a more wary collaborator to the invading Sith. Miller took the idea of the Alanciari's semaphore system from a society he envisioned for an ultimately canceled Star Trek e-book project, tentatively titled Starfleet Corps of Engineers. He chose to have the Alanciari speak Basic to avoid a retread of the linguistic problems described in Skyborn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Miller's Spiral comic book series allowed the author to delve deeper into Keshiri mythology, to an encounter with outsiders that predated even the Lost Tribe's arrival on Kesh. By introducing the light siders and dark siders who would become the Doomed, Miller elaborated on the origins of the Keshiri's myths about the Protectors and the Destructors, thus explaining their credulity in their later dealings with the Lost Tribe. In an August 2013 interview, Miller explained that the Keshiri were unable to mate with their Human Sith overlords since the latter lacked access to Sith alchemy. While the Dark Jedi who were exiled to the planet Korriban were able to use Sith alchemy to reduce the genetic differences between Humans and the original Sith species, the first Keshiri Sith were low-level miners who were not powerful enough within the Sith Empire to have access to that technology."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
