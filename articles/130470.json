A Star Cab's Class 10 hyperdrive was much slower than those employed by most New Republic scouts; indeed, by that era a Class 10 would have been a more common speed for a backup hyperdrive, which the Star Cab lacked entirely. Star Cabs included a complement of droids that handled the day-to-day operation of the vessel; the standard navigation droid equipped on Star Cabs may have been an ancient predecessor to the R2-series astromech droid. Star Cabs were usually heavily armed, considering the wilder state of the galaxy in their heyday. Their standard armament consisted of four blaster cannons, two firing forward and two aft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Star Cab was employed primarily as a scout vessel, usually by veteran scouts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Scouts who served aboard Star Cabs for extended periods were said to develop disagreeable attitudes toward the ships' droid crews.
