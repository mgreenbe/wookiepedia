The camnzin was said to be a mountain dweller responsible for wiping out several herbivorous species. In reality, it was a hoax perpetrated by Wilek Nereus. Nereus collected animal teeth, including a set from a herbivore from Usean II, the lrashtash. the teeth were often mistaken as those of a predator, so it amused Nereus to invent a species for his own entertainment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
