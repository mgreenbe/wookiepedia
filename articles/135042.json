Like all the ships constructed at the Nadiri Dockyards, they were constructed from disassembled captured Imperial spacecraft. It was notable for being one of the first class of ships built by the New Republic, through military contract, after the Battle of Endor. By 5 ABY, at least three Starhawks had been constructed: the Amity, the Concord, and the Unity. The Amity and Concord were destroyed during the Battle of Jakku."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Starhawk-class battleship was built from disassembled Imperial starships that the New Republic had captured following the Battle of Endor. The front of the Starhawk was shaped liked a front hatchet. As a warship, the Starhawk was equipped with laser cannons, ion torpedoes, concussion missiles, and turbolaser banks. The interior of the Starhawk had bright clean curves. The warship's docking bay's ceiling was sculpted in white scalloped edges and was fitted with warm, glow lighting. The docking bay's floors were also equipped with lighting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Starhawk was classed as a battleship and was capable of taking on a Star Destroyer. It was more heavily armed than a MC80A Home One Type Heavy Star Cruiser. The tractor beam of the Starhawk was equipped with magnite crystals which gave it ten times the strength of a Star Destroyer's. The Starhawk's tractor beam enabled it to trap and move a ship many times its size. Despite its firepower, it was outclassed by an Executor-class Star Dreadnought."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mark One Starhawk was one of the first capital ships commissioned by the New Republic, the successor to the Alliance to Restore the Republic. They were constructed at the Nadiri Dockyards deep inside the Bormea sector for the New Republic Defense Fleet following the Battle of Endor. Following a difficult debate in the Galactic Senate, Chancellor Mon Mothma mustered enough votes to approve the scrapping of Imperial vessels in order to build new starships, droids, and weapons for the war effort against the Imperial remnants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first Starhawk was the Concord, which served as the command ship of Commodore Kyrsta Agate, who had been promoted following her role in the liberation of Akiva. During a skirmish near Wild Space in 5 ABY, Commodore Agate's Starhawk Concord and the Alderaanian escort frigate Sunspire destroyed Commander Valent's Star Destroyer Scythe. The Concord later took part during the capture of Kuat Drive Yards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Jakku, the Concord and her sisters ships Amity and Unity served as the fulcrum of the New Republic Starfleet's attack on the massed Imperial ships above Jakku. The Amity was destroyed when the Star Destroyer Punishment rammed into the Starhawk. However, this created a gap in the Imperial formation which allowed Commodore Agate to position her Starhawk and attack the Super Star Destroyer Ravager. Despite being crippled by the Ravager, Agate managed to use the Concord's powerful tractor beam to drag the Imperial command ship down into Jakku's surface. Though Agate and her ship were destroyed, her actions helped turn the tide of the battle in the New Republic's favor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mark One Starhawk first appeared in Chuck Wendig's 2016 novel Aftermath: Life Debt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battleship was later visualized in the Nadiri Starhawk Expansion Pack of Star Wars: Armada, released on January 31, 2020, by Fantasy Flight Games."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
