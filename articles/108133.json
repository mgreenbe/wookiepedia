The Bureau was charged with presenting the Alliance's face to the galaxy, which they achieved by countering Imperial propaganda which depicted the Alliance as little more than lawless outlaws and madmen. The Declaration of Rebellion helped to dissuade that notion, forcing the Empire to shift their focus and expound upon the notion that the Empire's military was too formidable for the Alliance to overcome. The Propaganda Bureau countered this by distributing over 20,000 holo-tapes of the destruction of the Death Star over Yavin 4."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
