The planet originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where it first appeared in the 2003 comic book Empire 14, which was written by David Land. The comic establishes that Darth Vader crashes on Vaal in his TIE Advanced x1 following the Battle of Yavin. Star Wars: Build the Millennium Falcon 17 also states that this is the case in canon, but the 2015 canon novel Lost Stars by Claudia Gray establishes instead that Vader was picked up by a Gozanti-class cruiser in the Yavin system.
