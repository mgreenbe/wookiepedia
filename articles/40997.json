On Kashyyyk, Drrlirm and his friends tried to investigate the Trandoshan's slaving operations in one of their camps near Kachirho, but were ambushed and overpowered. Drrlirm was the only one that escaped, severely wounded. He stayed in the jungles for days, trying to regain his strength to get back to Kachirho. He was found by an adventurer sent by queen Kylantha, as the queen had been worried after she hadn't received any news from the Wookiees. The adventurer escorted Drrlirm back to Kachircho, fending off several Trandoshan slavers on their way.
