Ramil organized an invasion of the planet by Abyssin mercenaries, leading a number of Serennian refugees, including his sister Jenza, to fight against the invaders with the assistance of their brother, the Jedi Master Dooku. The droid army was sent to put an end to the fight, with Ramil claiming the refugees were attempting an insurrection. Dooku allowed the droid army to capture him and bring him aboard the airship Windrunner, deducing that the army was controlled by a central processor. Aboard the Windrunner, Dooku used Force lightning to destroy the processor and disable Ramil's exosuit, killing the Count while he was unable to move."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
