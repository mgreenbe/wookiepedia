Though Pava noted Sixer was less than thrilled about it, due to Pava being known as the \"Great Destroyer\" by the astromechs at the Resistance base on D'Qar, she added there was no way she would fly the mission without an onboard astromech as it was too important."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
