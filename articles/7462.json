A concert suite and film track, \"Anthem of Evil\" begins with a choir before drastically increasing in tempo and volume with brass instruments, and is largely developed from The Last Jedi's desperation motif, which was in turn developed from The Force Awakens's tension motif. The tension motif itself shares similarities with the Grand Army of the Republic's motif featured in the Attack of the Clones track \"The Arena.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The piece also uses the prequel trilogy's mystery and Palpatine's machinations motif, the original trilogy's \"The Emperor's Theme\" and Siegfried's motif in \"The Force Theme,\" as well as the sequel trilogy's Rey's Theme and Kylo Ren's theme."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The melody of the suite is used as a leitmotif for the Sith Eternal in the film The Rise of Skywalker. In the official commercial release soundtrack of the film, the motif is played in multiple tracks, including \"Journey to Exegol,\" \"Destiny of a Jedi,\" \"Join Me,\" \"Approaching the Throne,\" and \"Anthem of Evil,\" as well as the \"Finale\" track that occupies the film's end credits."}]}
