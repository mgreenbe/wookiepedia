The mayor had dropped his fork and bent over to retrieve it just as the first shot was fired. By the time the second shot rang out, the mayor was already safely under cover. CorSec immediately began investigating the incident. Lieutenant Lon Cope enlisted the services of an independent agent that had already helped CorSec solve several cases to find the assassin. The mayor told the agent about the threatening messages he had received at his office, but didn't mention the bribe money. The adventurer tracked the messages to an abandoned bunker where evidence was found that seemed to prove that his opponent Hershel Sheridan had been behind the assassination attempt. Sheridan's body was found soon after, he had apparently killed himself. The case seemed to be solved."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short time later, however, someone tried to kill the mayor again.

He could be found in the mayor's office in Kor Vella on Corellia, but his room was only accessible during this quest. The player was asked by Lon Cope to investigate the murder attempt, starting with a short conversation with Draav. A few short quests later, the player received a message from Cope that Draav has been murdered and to investigate the murder. This eventually leads to the discovery of the Chirq Council and CorSec operations to eliminate the organization. These quests were part of the Legacy quest, the longest quest line of the game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
