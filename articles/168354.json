She had recently been infected so Ziakas' feedings and the blackouts from being controlled were attributed to fatigue and too much partying rather than something more sinister."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Highly intelligent despite being a ball of energy, Ziakas was more reserved and emotional than others of its kind. It was easily angered but also cautious and wary of Jedi. It preferred targeting females and humanoids over men and aliens.
