During the space battle, this battle droid informed Grievous that the Separatist warships had been outflanked by Republic AT-TE walkers. The B1-Series battle droids was then destroyed along with the rest of the Separatist fleet when the AT-TEs opened fire on the exposed sterns of the ships. However, Grievous managed to escape in his starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This droid being a B1 battle droid may be an animation error. This is because of where it is placed in the battle at the right of Grievous. As seen in Downfall of a Droid OOM pilot battle droids can be distinguished from regular B1 battle droids by, in addition to some blue coloring, darker lines on their head and several small marks on their head. A battle droid that appears to possess these darker lines is to the right of Grievous during the Battle of Bothawui, and so this would seem to be a pilot droid, but later in the scene the animation has changed it to this B1."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
