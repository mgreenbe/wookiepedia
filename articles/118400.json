Following the end of the Clone Wars, Ryst\u00e1ll and her adoptive parents were enslaved by the Black Sun crime lord Xizor who had apparently become infatuated with the young dancer, though since he later put up the Sant family for a wager in a heated sabacc game, he seemed to care little for his slaves. Fortunately for Ryst\u00e1ll and her parents, a young Lando Calrissian won them in that very sabacc game.[source?] Lando despised slavery and set the trio free. The Ortolans then contacted their friend Max Rebo, who agreed to hire Ryst\u00e1ll as a dancer and backup singer for his band."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ryst\u00e1ll performed in Jabba's Palace on Tatooine during Luke Skywalker's attempt to rescue his friend Han Solo.

Her tenure with The Palpatones eventually brought her to Nar Shaddaa, where she met fellow Theelin Shug Ninx. While on Nar Shaddaa, Ryst\u00e1ll discovered that her father was among the last of the Theelin species.
