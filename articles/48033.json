A skilled Luka Sene could detect the presence and general direction of energy fields, or the field's direction of origin if the generator was too far away to perceive. Likewise, Field Detection allowed a Luka Sene to detect communications devices, sensors, or other electronic equipment. When shield generators came under fire, Luka Sene could detect minute fluctuations in the shields and find temporary weak points."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
