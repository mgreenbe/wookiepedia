In 34 ABY, RS-2112 was one of several stormtroopers deployed to the Outer Rim planet Batuu. The trooper, who was wearing standard First Order stormtrooper armor, accompanied a stormtrooper sergeant to confront the criminal Kendoh Voss and her gang in Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities. When the antiquity store owner, Dok-Ondar, and Voss did not take the threats from the sergeant seriously, the latter ordered RS-2112 to intimidate the criminal. The stormtrooper happily accepted the order, striking her associate Wooro with a Z6 riot control baton."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "RS-2112 appeared in the fifth issue of the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge comic-book series, which was written by Ethan Sacks, illustrated by Will Sliney, and published by Marvel Comics on August 28, 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
