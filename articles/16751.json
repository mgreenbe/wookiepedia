When Zero died sometime before the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, Bezar One took over the New Men and turned the peaceful group into a pro-cyborg terrorist organization and orchestrated a series of violent raids to steal equipment across the planet Metellos. The New Men murdered anyone who interfered, and One planned for an \"electric ascension\" that would have empowered cyborgs and killed thousands of organics. The plan was ultimately foiled and One was imprisoned with his lieutenants on the prison world of Belsavis, where they continued to recruit members."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bezar One was first mentioned in the Codex entry for the New Men in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, though his species was never specified."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
