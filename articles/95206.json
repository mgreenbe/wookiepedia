The cause of the illness that befell Mon Mothma seven years after the Battle of Endor were nano-destroyers that had been developed on Carida and delivered by Ambassador Furgan, who had poisoned a drink with the virus prior to splashing it in the Chief of State's face. The virus was capable of bonding with the cells of the victim, which led the victim to have immense powers like strength, speed and accelerated healing. But once it bonded with the living tissue, it would cause the victim to mutate and turn into mindless monsters whose only intent was to feed upon other beings. There was a cure to this virus, which was unknown but known to have been developed in Carida as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
