After the destruction of the Hosnian system, the base was used to plan the assault on Starkiller Base, the First Order's planet-embedded superweapon. However, it was soon destroyed by First Order forces during the Evacuation of D'Qar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Resistance base was located mostly underneath the surface of D'Qar, with only the facility's landing areas and antenna arrays exposed. Inside the base was a command center, as well as as multiple hangars, both above and underground, used to store T-70 X-wing starfighters. Underneath the hangars was an area known as the maintenance level, where damaged vehicles could go to be repaired. Surrounding the base was thick jungle foliage, which helped hide the facility from air and ground sensors and conceal potential power leaks. Most of the equipment used at the base was portable, a feature insisted by General Leia Organa due to her experience of the Rebel Alliance's near-extinction on Hoth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Sith Lord Darth Vader was revealed to be Senator Leia Organa's biological father twenty-four years after the formation of the New Republic, Organa's reputation was impacted dramatically. Believing there to be a new threat facing the galaxy, Organa pleaded with the Republic to investigate, however, her protests about the Military Disarmament Act were dismissed as paranoia, while her warnings of the growing First Order were misconstrued as warmongering. Having no other option, she formed the Resistance to combat the threat of full-scale war once again engulfing the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In need of a base of operations, Organa remembered D'Qar's abandoned Rebel Alliance outpost and sent engineers to expand the facility. Over the next six years, the base was the launch point of several missions and offensives against the First Order. In the thirtieth year after the Battle of Endor, the Resistance received word that the astromech droid, BB-8, who was in possession of a map leading to Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, was on the Mid Rim planet, Takodana."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within minutes, the First Order, having also received the same information, arrived at the planet and attacked the castle BB-8 was located at. Shortly after, however, Resistance pilots also arrived, and engaged the First Order's air and ground forces. During the battle, the First Order captured the scavenger, Rey and retreated, believing they had got what they came for. After arriving back at the Resistance base, Finn, a deserter First Order stormtrooper, gave the Resistance intel on how to destroy Starkiller Base, the First Order's planet-embedded superweapon, which had recently destroyed the Rebublic's capital, Hosnian Prime, and was now targeting D'Qar. After identifying Starkiller Base's weak point as its thermal oscillator, the Resistance starfighter pilots began preparing their ships for battle, while Finn, Han Solo and Chewbacca readied Solo's ship, the Millennium Falcon. Arriving at Starkiller Base, Finn, Solo and Chewbacca managed to lower Starkiller's shields, rescue Rey and blow an opening in its thermal oscillator, allowing Poe Dameron, leader of the Resistance starfighter corps, to enter and destroy it. With the superweapon destroyed, D'Qar and the Resistance base was safe from destruction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arriving back at base, R2-D2, who had been in low-power mode since Skywalker's disappearance, overheard Rey stating that the First Order had recovered the majority of the starchart that was recovered from the Imperial archives, but they were still lacking the final piece to match with the fragment BB-8 had acquired. The droid promptly reactivated after years of hibernation, and searched his records and found that he had previously downloaded this map while upon the first Death Star. Projecting the map into the room, R2-D2 matched his map with the piece that BB-8 held, revealing the location of the first Jedi Temple, and in turn, Luke Skywalker. With this revelation, R2-D2, Rey and Chewbacca left the base in the Millennium Falcon in search of the Jedi Master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after, anticipating an attack by the First Order, the Resistance personnel scrambled frantically to transfer personnel and equipment to the flagship Raddus in orbit.
