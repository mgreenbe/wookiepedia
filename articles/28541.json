After the platform was launched back into space to escape Castilon and the forces of the First Order, Doza re-opened the command deck to direct the navigation of the platform. The deck was staffed by Doza, Jarek Yeager and 4D-M1N, as well as multiple other droids. The droids were the same model as 4D, although more stripped down, and programmed to answer to her. They had been shut down with the bridge during its period of disuse."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
