During an impromptu skirmish with several TIEs, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker argue over Han's plan, and how it had gotten them into this situation. Han remarks that it wasn't even much of a plan, as Leia and Mon Mothma try to find new coordinates for the small fleet to jump to. Han, Luke and several other X-wings defend two EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigates as Mothma and Organa decide to jump to 'Rendezvouz Point C', or Baraan-Fa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Baraan-Fa, several Alliance vessels are landing and setting up camp, as Mothma and Organa brainstorm a new location for a Rebel base. Leia suggests Sabanash and the Moon of Ooloponi before asking to take a squadron to Crait. Mothma says that the planet is dead, which Leia surmises is strategically beneficial.

Privately, Han once again conveys his distrust for the Q'Itane to Leia. Meanwhile, Luke and Wedge Antilles work on creating trenches in the salt flats. Suddenly, a green worm emerges from the ground. Wedge prepares to fire his blaster, but Luke relates the worm to sand worms he encountered on Tatooine as a child. Han and Chewbacca are dealing with the worms as well.  This prompts Luke to run an environmental assessment of the land, and determine that there are water deposits under the surface, in which the worms live. Suddenly, Luke decides to go out on ski speeder with Wedge, and finds several flash-dried bodies piled up on the salt flats.

Just then, Luke returns and Leia gives him a kiss on the cheek while expressing how she doesn't want him to change.  Luke tells her that they need to leave as soon as possible, but for a different reason. Luke realized that there are salt storms on Crait that are deadly once he'd found the dried bodies with Wedge.

In a moment of vengeful force, Wedge slams a piece of metal through Zuke's armor, feeling every bit of what he struck a payment for the Empire's evil. At the Falcon, Trusk holds Leia up with his blaster, and blasts Han in the shoulder as he attempts to pull his DL-44 out. Leia runs to Han, and quickly spins around, shooting Trusk in the hand.
