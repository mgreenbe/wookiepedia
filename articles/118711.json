His men often used an old droideka for search an destroy missions on the members of the Rebel Alliance on Dantooine. But then the droideka ran rampant, escaped the garrison and neither SG-567 nor his scout troopers were available to search and recover it. When an Imperial agent volunteered to hunt and destroy the escaped droideka, SG-567 gladly supplied him with a tactical map of the area and rewarded him with credits when he returned successfully. As the agent seemed to be interested in the activities at the outpost and its surroundings, SG-567 offered him to join one of his scouts, SG-619, on a scouting mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
