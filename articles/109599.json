The world had liquid surface water, as exemplified by the River of Light. A type of stone sensitive to the Force was found in the River of Light.

Not long after, the Jedi Order discovered Jinn's Force-sensitivity, and he was taken to the Galactic Republic capital of Coruscant to receive Jedi training. Though most Jedi of the era left their old lives completely behind once they were accepted into the Order, Jinn kept some ties with his planet of birth. During a visit there around 79 BBY at age thirteen, he obtained a Force-sensitive stone from the River of Light. Keeping it for over thirty years as a reminder of his homeworld, Jinn, by then a Jedi Master, eventually handed the stone to his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, when he turned thirteen in 44 BBY. Kenobi in turn gave the stone to his apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, on his thirteenth birthday in 29 BBY. Knowledge of the existence of Force-sensitive river stones survived into the days of the New Jedi Order; following the end of the Yuuzhan Vong War in 29 ABY, Jedi Knight Tam Azur-Jamin mentioned them in his essay Droids, Technology and the Force: A Clash of Phenomena, which discussed the emergence of the Force in inanimate objects and technological devices."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Qui-Gon Jinn's homeworld was first mentioned in The Hidden Past, the third installment in the Jedi Apprentice series.
