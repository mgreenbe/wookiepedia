Around that time, Laakteen Depot played host to an incident in which the Bando Gora, a criminal cult of Force-worshipers, planned to kill the humanoid Iram Radique. One of the cultists, Artagan Truax, betrayed the Bando Gora and rescued Radique from them. Radique later established himself as a clandestine weapons dealer within the Cog Hive Seven prison, where he protected Truax from the Bando Gora's wrath."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the beginnings of the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance, Laakteen Depot served as a pirate base. At some point before the Battle of Yavin, the Rebellion captured Laakteen Depot after nearly a year of fighting.

Vader intended to demonstrate to the Rebels and the galaxy that the Alliance's victory over the Empire's Death Star battlestation at the Battle of Yavin was pure chance and that the Executor was unstoppable. In their final moments, as the Executor's attack shattered the base's defense shield, the Rebels of Laakteen Depot sent a frantic warning to the main Rebel base on the moon Yavin 4 that Vader's new warship was closing in, forcing the Rebellion to scramble to evacuate its Yavin headquarters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Laakteen Depot first appeared in the Revenge of the Jedi comic strip, written by Archie Goodwin and illustrated by Al Williamson. Revenge of the Jedi was originally published by the Los Angeles Times Syndicate as a newspaper serial comic from November 1982 to January 1983. Its stories told the events that took place between the films Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope and Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. In the comic, Laakteen Depot serves to introduce the operational status and might of the Executor, Darth Vader's newly completed Super Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several continuity errors regarding Laakteen Depot arose in subsequent source material. The 2000 A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded mistakenly states that Laakteen Depot was a Rebel Alliance outpost around the time of the Battle of Endor, while the 2005 first issue of the Star Wars: The Official Figurine Collection magazine states that Darth Vader destroyed Laakteen Depot prior to the Battle of Yavin. Additionally, The Official Star Wars Fact File 47 credits the Executor's maiden voyage and destruction of Laakteen Depot to Admiral Amise Griff, an Imperial character who figures prominently in the storyline but who does not command the Executor during its maiden voyage in the Revenge of the Jedi comic strip. Finally, both the 2009 reference book The Essential Atlas and the 2014 novel Maul: Lockdown misspell the subject as \"Lakteen.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
