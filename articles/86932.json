Capable of interfacing with a central command area, the Surveillance pod can either operate manually or in auto-mode - with the auto mode setting automatically, raising an alarm if it detects unauthorized signatures; with an scanning range of a hundred meters. The Surveillance pod also had its own battery, making it independent from larger power grids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
