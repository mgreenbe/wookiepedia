In 27 ABY, Jedi ally and former New Republic leader, Leia Organa Solo, and her husband Han traveled to the Bilbringi Shipyards to request that its commander, General Muun, provide them with ships to form an escort to protect the evacuation convoy of the Vray. There were at least a hundred thousand Vray who had been being evacuated for weeks before the Solos arrived in the Bilbringi system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Muun refused at first, unwilling to leave the shipyards vulnerable to a Yuuzhan Vong attack. However, when Yuuzhang Vong Warmaster Tsavong Lah sent Nom Anor to Bilbringi to tell the Solos that he would have many refugees killed if the Jedi did not surrender to the Yuuzhan Vong, Muun saw protecting the Vray refugees as an opportunity to boost his career. He therefore led a convoy of ten vessels to escort the Vray to safety."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vray was mentioned in Troy Denning's Star by Star, a 2001 installment of the Star Wars: The New Jedi Order book series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
