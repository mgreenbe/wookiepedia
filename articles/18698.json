When he was captured by Saw Gerrera's Partisans, Rook recalled that his mother told him that he always talked but said so little and that he should learn to listen. After Rook was taken to Gerrera's base in the Catacombs of Cadera, he was put into a cave with a creature called Bor Gullet. When the Bor Gullet put its tendrils on his face, he closed his eyes and saw his mother showing him how to cut a vegetable stalk with a knife."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
