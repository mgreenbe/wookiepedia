As the rain pours down, Phasma touches the water and finds it less salty than expected. When TN-3465 asks what that means, Phasma replies that it means a lot of things. Dar'en says they should depart because it is dangerous to be close to the water's edge. From Dar'en, Phasma learns that low tide comes at dawn and that the Tsw'ells dwelling in the lake only sleep in the early hours of the morning."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When TK-3465 wishes that their TIE/sf space superiority fighter's weapons were still functional, Phasma says they have to find another way. Back at the Lupr'or Village, Phasma asks a young Lupr'or girl where she got her necklace from. The girl leads the offworlders to the home of her great grand mother Ali'ane, the oldest living Lupr'or who was born in the stars. Ali'ane tells the First Order travelers that her necklace came from the \"old world\". When Phasma asks where she can find more, Ali'ane says that is forbidden."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Phasma convinces the girl to tell Ali'ane that Phasma has been sent from the gods to fight the R'ora and Tsw'ells and that they must help her. Ali'ane claims they were destroyed by the ancestors because they were the \"soul killer.\" Later, the girl observes that Phasma is better at climbing rocks than her companion. Phasma tells the girls that she grew up on a World with rocks and that it was a hard life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the next several hours, Phasma, TN-3465, the Lupr'or girl, and Dar'en travel over the rocks to the site of an old Lupr'or starship. While Phasma and the Lupr'or child are comfortable with rock climbing, TN-3465 is unused to the physical rigors and grumbles.

They have come for a different life but it is not sustainable. She warns that they are on the verge of being exterminated by a stronger indigenous species intent on wiping them out. She tells them to use all the resources At their disposal and to become something else including that which they have deliberately left behind. She urges them to take up arms together. Phasma claims that she has been sent to lead them to victory. The Lupr'or chant Phasma's name."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Viewing a holomap generated by BB-K8, Phasma devises a plan which involves attacking the Tsw'ell guarding the R'ora stronghold with electric currents using generators recovered from the abandoned Lupr'or ships. When TN-3465 asks what they will do once they are inside, Phasma says they will deal with the situation when the time comes. She explains that her plan is to limit their casualties so that they will have the best possible numbers to face whatever is beyond the wall.
