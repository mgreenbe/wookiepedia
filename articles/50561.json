She along with fellow Jedi Gorlan Palladane and his supporters hijacked several Daimanate cargo ships to escape Chelloa prior to its destruction. The Sith Lord Daiman had used kinetic corruptors to destroy Chelloa by igniting the volatile baradium shales beneath its surface as part of an attempt to trap and destroy his rival Lord Odion, ruler of the Odionate Sith princedom. They succeeded in evacuating around 60,000 Chelloan civilians and slaves and fled to Republic space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
