Under the command of the Duros Kip Famas, the 94th was based out of Polis Massa Research Base while the Galactic Empire was conducting tests of the experimental TIE/ph phantom starfighter in the surrounding region. Along with the BTL Y-wing starfighters of the 88th Attack Squadron, the 94th was tasked with eliminating the Imperial threat. The squadron lost at least four X-wings, but the Imperials were eventually forced to abandon the tests and withdraw from the area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
