Furthermore, the Sith who prevailed in the Kaggath also had the right to destroy his opponent's name and wipe their records from recorded history, theoretically eliminating any chance for the loser to leave some form of legacy to the rest of the galaxy, resulting in a complete damnatio memoriae of the defeated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Games"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Darth Thanaton, Marka Ragnos participated in a Kaggath during his rise.
