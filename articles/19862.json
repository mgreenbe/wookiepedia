However, Barada was cut from the final product, and Barada's design was handed over to the Podracer Dud Bolt. However, Barada still appeared in the film's novelization, which was written by Terry Brooks, during the Podrace scene. It should be noted that the video game Star Wars Episode I: Racer features a character named Bozzie Baranta, who is also a Podracer pilot. The characters have the same first name, and a very similar last name. In addition, the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi featured a character named Barada."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since the character did not appear in the film, or was said to have participated in the race by any other source, this article only assumes that Barada was a Podracer pilot who once raced in a Boonta race."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
