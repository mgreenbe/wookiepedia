In 8 ABY it was commanded by Shada D'ukal, with her young partner Dunc T'racen acting as co-pilot/gunner, when it was contracted by Fenig Nabon and Ghitsa Dogder to transport a troupe of Twi'lek dancing-girls from Ryloth to Nal Hutta."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Fury was a mid-sized transport, fitted out for combat with turbolasers, concussion missiles and a laser battery, plus full deflector shields.

While this may sometimes be a quirk of West End Games material, for instance with the Star Destroyer named as The Chariot, the contrast in the story with the name of Fen Nabon's ship, Star Lady, shows that the correct name of the ship is indeed The Fury, rather than simply Fury."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
