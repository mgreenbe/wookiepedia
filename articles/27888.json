The innermost chambers housed command centers for Kaminoan supervisors, officials, and scientists.

The floor of the upper training levels could be lowered and raised to create various combat (primarily hand-to-hand) training areas and certain areas could even be made into stadiums for the demonstration of combat skills. The large battlefield simulation rooms could replicate a variety of environments and terrains through the use of repulsor floor plates, wind generators, and atmosphere generators. Academies for advanced clone units, sleeping and recreational quarters, automated kitchens, assembly areas, dining halls, and even a secret ARC Trooper training center also existed. An egress out to the hangars contained transports ready to carry the clones off into the wider galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
