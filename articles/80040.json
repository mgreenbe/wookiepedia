Few records existed about Lara Notsil or any of the other slain New Oldtown residents. For this reason, Gara Petothel, an Imperial Intelligence agent, modified Notsil's records and stole her identity, which she used to escape the destruction of Trigit's Implacable and later as a Wraith Squadron pilot. Lara Notsil had a brother named Tavin Notsil."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
