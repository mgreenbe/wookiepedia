He defiantly colored his hair scarlet with a single black streak, yet was committed to his men and to the Republic. Before the battle of Kothlis against the Separatist Alliance, Skywalker briefed the pilots about the upcoming conflict. Upon hearing the news that communications were jammed, he spoke to his men, inspiring them. During the battle he flew next to Skywalker for a moment, pausing to give a quick smile in response to Skywalker's thumbs-up, and flew off to engage more droid starfighters. He was one of the pilots to survive the engagement, and hunted down the last of the enemy fighters while his General landed on the surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few weeks later, he and his squadron were standing down at a Republic Service Organization lounge on Coruscant.

Fireball was assigned to \"attack\" the ship as a ruse, fooling Grievous into letting the ship through the blockade. Fireball was almost hit by a droid starfighter, but avoided the blast. Even though Gold Squadron lost almost a quarter of its pilots, the battle was won after a corporate fleet arrived to reinforce the Republic and forced Grievous to flee."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He dyed his hair scarlet with a black streak.
