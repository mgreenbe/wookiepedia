In 4 ABY, after the Battle of Var-Shaa, he and four other cadets, including Werrens, had been sent to their posting prior to passing their final examination and were posted at the station with an Imperial officer. The station had previously been captured by New Republic forces two months before the Incident in the Nuvar system, in which the station destroyed the Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier Exigent because Nicobar and the other cadets failed to erase the New Republic targeting protocols from the station's targeting computer. After the Exigent was destroyed, TIE fighter pilots Shen and Havina Vonreg aggressively landed a TIE Reaper in the station's hangar, slightly damaging it, where they subsequently went to chastize the cadets for their mistake. Shen hoisted Nicobar into the air and demanded answers to questions that Nicobar had no answer to. After Vonreg demanded them executed for their mistake, Shen convinced her that the fact that they had to live with their guild would be punishment enough."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nicobar first appeared in the short story Count to Three, written by Joanna Berry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
