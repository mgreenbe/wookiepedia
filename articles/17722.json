Imperial forces set up a blockade in order to trap any transport vessels traversing the cluster. The Interdictor cruiser Compellor used its gravity well generators to create a mass shadow that forced ships to drop out of hyperspace, and also prevented ships from escaping. The Imperial-class Star Destroyer Rage launched the modified TIE/IN interceptors of Avenger Squadron to harry the targeted transports and shuttles into surrendering."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
