At some point between 4 and 5 ABY, the Nikto was drinking in the castle of the pirate Maz Kanata on the planet Takodana when he once again encountered Solo. The smuggler asked if he knew anything about Ralsius Paldora, an Imperial turncoat who had agreed to meet Solo in the castle. Remembering how Solo had treated him previously, Rody refused to reveal any information on Paldora, but accidentally let slip that the Imperial had a beard while insulting both Solo and Paldora's appearance. Rody had green skin and black eyes. He wore a red jacket over a blue shirt and pants with a black belt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rody appeared in the 2017 DICE video game Star Wars Battlefront II, released in 2017."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
