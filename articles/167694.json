During the Galactic Civil War, between 0 ABY and 3 ABY, the Alliance to Restore the Republic built a base there and Minister Transe Decar planned on seceding from the Galactic Empire. Zaloriis stopped sending its monthly tribute to Coruscant, and Darth Vader visited to see why. He was attacked by Zalorian Separatists led by Minister Decar, but overwhelmed them and rescued Colonel Maximilian Veers. Veers led him to Camp Culroon, a research base where he outfitted Blizzard 1, a prototype AT-AT. Veers then assaulted Zaloriis City and destroyed the base there. At the time of its destruction, Zaloriis City featured two Fortresses and a number of other military buildings, including a Command center. The city was surrounded by a wall and was protected by laser turrets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the battle had been won, Veers tapped found out the approximate new location of the Rebel Alliance in the Elrood sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zaloriis City appears in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds during the Darth Vader campaign.
