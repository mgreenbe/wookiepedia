During the Battle of Uroro Station, Luke Skywalker used the station as a decoy to lure Darth Caedus' fleet and the fleet of the Imperial Remnant into a trap being led by Tenel Ka Djo and the Hapan Home Fleet. Luke, along with most of the New Jedi Order were there along with a select group of younglings and academy staff to play the part of decoy. The ploy worked though Uroro station was destroyed by the long range Turbolasers of the Megador after the Jedi evacuated the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
