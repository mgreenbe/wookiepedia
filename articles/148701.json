The Colossus platform on Castilon had one by 34 ABY, which was activated every third day. When Torra Doza, daughter of the platform's owner, Captain Imanuel Doza, needed to sneak her friend Kazuda Xiono and astromech droid BB-8 out of Doza Tower covertly, she chose to use the incinerator as an exit, assuming it to be inactive that day. However, due to a miscalculation, the humans and droid were forced to dodge bolts from the active incinerator before BB-8 was able to open the door so they could exit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trash incinerators first appeared in the 2018 Star Wars Resistance episode \"Secrets and Holograms.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
