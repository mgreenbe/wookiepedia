It contained the only source of the GEMINI frequency, which handled all communications between the Eternal Throne and the Eternal Fleet. In 3630 BBY the Anti-Zakuul Alliance obtained the detailed schematics from the Spire through the Overwatch and identifed the Hyperwave relay station as a major target. Havoc Squad and Kaliyo Djannis were sent to clear out the path for The Alliance Commander, but were forced to complete the mission on their own after the Commander went missing in Odessen wilderness. The combatants were cornered by Knights of Zakuul and Skytroopers and in the resulting firefight four of six Havoc members were killed, while Aric Jorgan and Djannis were able to exfiltrate and return to Odessen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hyperwave relay station appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire Chapter 12: Visions in the Dark."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
