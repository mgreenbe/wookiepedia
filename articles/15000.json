New Republic starfighters hidden in the hollow inside of the ersatz Corellian Queen ambushed the TIE Defender pilots who attempted to pirate the ship. Using the newly developed flechette torpedoes to attack the pilots, the New Republic forces were able to drive off and track the Imperial forces back to Mindor. Derek Klivian of Rogue Squadron had his craft and assigned astromech severely damaged in this engagement, and his fellow Rogues Avan and Feylis also had to eject."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
