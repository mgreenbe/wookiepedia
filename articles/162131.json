Two-thirds of his body was destroyed beyond repair, but instead of replacing it with simple prostheses, Vaxx's wealthy family\u2014a mining clan\u2014acquired a black market YVH 1 droid and reassembled it into a cybernetic body for Vaxx."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 43.5 ABY, Vaxx and two other bounty hunters\u2014a blond female Human and the Quarren inventor Dhidal Nyz\u2014in a cargo hauler piloted by another being, were hired by Chief of State Natasi Daala as a part of her special-missions force. They were ordered to capture the fugitive Jedi Knight Valin Horn, who was suffering from a psychological breakdown. During the chase through the galactic capital of Coruscant, Horn ejected from the antique T-65 X-wing starfighter he had been flying and landed his ejector seat on the cargo hauler's bed. Before the bounty hunters could attack him, however, they were distracted by Jedi Knight Jaina Solo as she jumped down from her airspeeder onto the bed in hopes of catching Horn. Horn quickly escaped on his ejector seat, and Solo landed where Horn had been standing a moment before. Vaxx reassured Solo that they weren't there to hurt her, but Nyz fired his electric net gun at the Jedi. The net caught Solo and knocked her over the edge of the cargo bed. The female bounty hunter began to criticize Nyz for his rash action, but a racing speeder shot by the hauler, causing the vehicle to tip over sideways. Nyz was thrown off the hauler and their female colleague lost her balance, but Vaxx held his footing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they began to accelerate back up to speed, Vaxx opened fire on Solo and her companion, Jedi Master Kyle Katarn, in their speeder. However, the hunters were quickly fired upon by former smuggler Han Solo and his wife, Leia Organa Solo, in their starship, the Millennium Falcon. Vaxx was hit, and the cyborg was launched into the control cab of the cargo hauler. Smoke began pouring from the cab and the hauler slowed down. The bounty hunters were forced to give up the chase, but Vaxx survived the accident and was quickly repaired. Soon after, Horn was captured by Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker and eventually placed in the Jedi Temple. Before long, Vaxx was hired by the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, alongside fellow bounty hunter Zilaash Kuh, to accompany Galactic Alliance Security forces led by Captain Oric Harfard to the Jedi Temple to arrest Valin Horn. Horn was then put on trial, convicted, encased in carbonite, and placed in the Armand Isard Correctional Facility, a prison on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vrannin Vaxx was terribly injured in a shuttle crash near the end of the Yuuzhan Vong War and had his irreparably damaged body replaced with that of a YVH 1 droid.
