When they arrived, the Alliance officer Bini thought they were recruits and led them to the control core to meet Syndulla. Syndulla shot Aphra's Tooka when it ran into the control room and Tam Posla revealed that they weren't recruits, leading her to realize they were mercenaries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Syndulla had the group locked up in the brig and Magna Tolvan, who was disguised as the mercenary Glahst Ombra, entered Aphra's cell. She revealed her true identity and Dek-Nil stunned her, making her shoot the shield generator and freeing the mercenaries. However, the rebels found them still in the cells and Syndulla offered to let them leave.
