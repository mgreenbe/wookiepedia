They were led by the Dug Balder. At some point, they attempted to kidnap a child, from a smaller rival clan the Scyre, called Frey. They unfortunately failed losing a dozen warriors to Phasma and her warriors. A short while later a First Order ship carrying Brendol Hux was shot down by Parnassos' automated defense system and Brendol's escape pod landed in the Claw territory. Balder and his men rescued Brendol and his three stormtroopers. But as he attempted to negotiate with Brendol, Phasma and her warriors snuck into the village and intervened. Phasma then killed Balder and a dozen of his warriors before escaping with Brendol and his men and only took two loses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Phasma unfortunately couldn't convince her tribe to join her and Brendol to find the ship so she and four of her warriors took Brendol and his men and abandoned the Scyre. The Scyre leader Keldo (Phasma's brother) then united the Scyre and the Claw to pursue Phasma and the group. They caught up with them at a fence where Phasma and the others had stopped to talk to the Gand Churkk. Phasma's group had lost one warrior Carr and a stormtrooper and when the two clans ambushed them they killed another warrior Gosta. Phasma and the rest managed to get away and the two clans had to cut through the fence to continue. They engaged them again at the site of Brendols ship where they battled until it was just Keldo, Frey against Phasma, Siv and Brendol. Phasma killed Keldo and took Frey with her when Brendol's superiors arrived. They left Siv behind with the bodies of the Claw and Scyre."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Delilah S.
