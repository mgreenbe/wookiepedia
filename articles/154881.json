In 3956 BBY, the Sith sent a large fleet to capture Taris, an Outer Rim member world of the Republic. The fleet intercepted and ambushed the Republic cruiser Endar Spire upon its arrival in the system, and, although the ship was destroyed, several troops were able to survive by fleeing to the surface in escape pods; two such men were Republic war hero Carth Onasi and fellow soldier Revan, who was actually an amnesiac former Dark Lord of the Sith. After the battle, the Sith instituted an orbital blockade of Taris to prevent any of the surviving Republic forces from escaping. The Sith soldier was part of an occupation force that was stationed planet-side to restore local order and hunt down any remaining Republic personnel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few days after the battle, the soldier, accompanied by two sentinel droids, raided the South Apartments of the Upper City, the highest levels of the Taris ecumenopolis. Onasi and Revan, who were hiding in the apartments, were leaving their room when they found the soldier arguing with two Duros residents. When one of the Duros, Ixgil, complained about the Sith's frequent raids on the building, the soldier shot him in the chest with a blaster rifle, killing him. The soldier then noticed Onasi and Revan and, recognizing them as Republic fugitives, ordered his battle droids to attack while he engaged the remaining Duros. The soldier and his droids were unable to defeat their enemies and were killed as a result. The second Duros thanked Revan for saving his life and expressed his hope that no more Sith would come to cause trouble.

The character is featured in one of the early scenes on the planet Taris, the first planet the player visits after escaping the Endar Spire. The player encounters the Sith soldier after leaving the player's apartment hideout for the first time. The player does not have an opportunity to interact with the scene between the soldier and the two Duros until the Sith soldier identifies Onasi and the player as Republic fugitives and orders his droids to attack. There is no possibility of avoiding the fight, which occurs regardless of the player-character's gender or alignment in the Force. After the soldier has been defeated, the player can loot the soldier's remains to obtain his blaster rifle and the equipment contained in his backpack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the cutscene, a number of quotes are said differently from the dialogue subtitles.
