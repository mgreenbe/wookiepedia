Letting nothing stand in his way\u2014including his own brother's life\u2014Omen commander-turned-Grand Lord Yaru Korsin has ruled unopposed ever since. But now his days, and those of the ruthless Sith order on Kesh, may be numbered."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Revolt\u2014and revenge\u2014have been brewing in the hearts of the two women closest to Korsin. One is Adari Vaal, the once-outcast Keshiri who rescued the stranded Sith, aided their domination of Kesh, and now leads the secret resistance against them. The other is Seelah, wife of Korsin, widow of his murdered brother, and mastermind of the plot to assassinate the Grand Lord and seize power. But have the comforts of a king and his own arrogance blunted Korsin's cunning Sith instincts? Or is he ready to deal swiftly and mercilessly with treachery from any quarter?"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Enemies themselves, Adari and Seelah are unaware of each other's destiny-altering gambits.

This short story is told from the points of view of three main characters: Grand Lord Yaru Korsin, the leader of the stranded Sith Tribe on Kesh; Adari Vaal, the leader of the Keshiri resistance against the Sith; and Seelah Korsin, the wife of Yaru who is plotting revenge against the Grand Lord for the murder of her husband Devore Korsin almost a quarter of a century earlier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yaru Korsin has adopted the title of Grand Lord and has made the former village of Tahv his new capital. Under his leadership, the Lost Tribe had moved from their mountain retreat at the crash-site of the Omen to Tahv permanently. Korsin had also been able to exploit the \"plague\" which occurred ten years earlier by claiming that the residents of the Ragnos Lakes towns had lacked faith in the Lost Tribe of Sith, who claimed to be the divine Skyborn, gods in Keshiri mythology. To commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the arrival of the Lost Tribe on Kesh, Korsin had commissioned a celebration in Tahv. Among those present were his wife Seelah and the Keshiri ambassador Adari Vaal, who had first discovered the Tribe's arrival."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Adari pretended to be friendly towards the Sith, she harbored a strong dislike towards them for enslaving her people and exploiting as slave labor. She was embittered by the death of her son Finn Vaal who had died during a construction accident. In secret, she had prepared the Keshiri resistance for an attack on the Tribe. Meanwhile, Seelah Korsin harbored homicidal feelings towards her husband Yaru Korsin, who she had only married to seal an alliance between the miners and ship crew of the Tribe. She favored her elder son Jariad Korsin, whom she had produced with Devore, over her younger daughter, Nida Korsin, who she had produced with Yaru. Seelah had already learnt from Adari that Yaru had murdered her husband Devore shortly after their arrival on Kesh. Like Adari, she planned to lead a revolt against Yaru Korsin with her son Jariad, whom she hoped to use as a weapon against the Grand Lord."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Jariad obtained permission from his father Yaru Korsin to lead a detachment of Sith Sabers on a training mission in the Northern Reaches. Meanwhile, Adari and her younger son Tona Vaal left for a meeting with other members of the Keshiri resistance which included the descendants of Izri Dazh, the late leader of the Neshtovar and Adari's former tormentor. The Neshtovar resented the loss of their privileged status which included the loss of the right to ride uvaks, which was now exclusively reserved for the Sith. Tona was a key member of the Keshiri resistance's plans to steal the Tribe's uvaks and launch an assault on the Tribe due to his position as the stable master for Nida Korsin's Skyborn Rangers, an elite club of uvak-riding enthusiasts. Meanwhile, Seelah met Korsin and his entourage at the plaza of the Kesh Sith Temple which was near the shrine which covered the wrecked starship Omen. Privately, Seelah gloated over her plans to ensure that future generations of the Tribe remained \"pure-blooded\" and her impending plot to assassinate Yaru."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yaru Korsin along with his Houk friend Gloyd and their bodyguards were quickly surrounded by Jariad and his Sith Sabers. Jariad announced his intentions to overthrow his father and to install himself as the new leader of the Tribe. Seelah soon appeared and joined the standoff, and confronted Lord Korsin about the murder of her husband and their son's father. However, the two parties were interrupted when the Keshiri resistance raided the Temple's stables and stole the Tribe's uvaks. The rise of the uvak provided just enough of a diversion to allow Yaru to break the circle and flee to better ground. Meanwhile, Adari Vaal and the other Keshiri riders had assembled their uvaks nearby for a planned strike against the Sith. They now awaited the arrival of other Keshiri and their uvak steeds from Tahv. These reinforcements never came because her son Tona had revealed the plot to steal the uvaks to one of Nida's acquaintances."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back at the Sith Temple, Yaru's forces took on Jariad and Seelah's rebels in a vicious lightsaber duel. Yaru and Gloyd were separated during the fighting with Gloyd being cornered by Seelah's aides. However, Jariad's Sith Sabers proved ineffective against Yaru's bodyguards. Although Yaru battled back valiantly, his force was dwindling, and he began to lose strength due to wounds inflicted on his chest. Jariad finally cornered his step-father near a high precipice and released all his anger, furiously slashing at him again and again. However, as Jariad moved in for the kill, his sister Nida suddenly appeared with members of her Skyborn Rangers riding club. The arrival of Nida and the Skyborn Rangers effectively turned the tide of the battle in Yaru's favor. Shortly later, Gloyd detonated his proton detonator, killing Seelah's aides and crippling Seelah herself. In the end, Jariad was killed when his sister Nida threw him over the cliff; effectively ending the rebellion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Adari and the Keshiri rebels learnt that Tona had revealed their plot to overthrow the Tribe to Nida Korsin, who had used her position as aerial ambassador for the Tribe to develop a network of Keshiri spies and informants. Nida had also been secretly trained by Yaru's most loyal supporters in the arts of the dark side. With nothing to lose, Adari and her supporters fled across the ocean and eventually came to rest on a remote island. Out of one thousand riders, only three hundred survived that journey due to the turbulent atmospheric conditions and long distances. Adari's beloved uvak Nink also died from exhaustion. However, Adari had succeeded in escaping the thrall of the Sith and pondered whether there were true Protectors out there hunting for the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back at the Sith Temple, Seelah survived the explosion but was unable to walk again. She conversed with her daughter Nida who revealed that she had thwarted the Keshiri rebellion with the assistance of Tona, one of her Keshiri informants. Yaru Korsin had also succumbed to his injuries and died. Prior to his death, he designated his loyal daughter Nida as his successor. Nida also revealed that she had single-handed thrown her brother Jariad off the cliff after his step-father failed to do so. With the disappearance of the rebels, she assumed that they had plunged themselves into the lava pit or fled across the ocean. Finally to add insult to injury, Nida confined her mother to the Sith Temple and ordered the Sith to remove themselves from the mountain permanently. To ensure that no one attempted to reach the Temple again, Nida ordered that all paths and entrances to the Sith Temple be blocked or sealed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cover of the book features a real building.
