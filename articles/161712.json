They were nearly the size of small humans but not as large as targons, another feline species, and they had green and blue rosette markings. The spiraled horns on their heads produced electricity that could be unleashed in bolts of energy. By 331 BBY, they were nearly extinct due to scientists hunting them in hopes of testing and replicating their rumored ability to fade into invisibility while hunting. A counter claim held that the cats merely moved so fast that they seemed to disappear."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The San Tekka clan discovered and adopted a female vollka named Remy over a century prior to the attack on Tiikae.
