Seeing the Jedi as a threat, the Vong decide to unleash Priestess Elan and her aide/pet, Vergere, to pretend to be defectors from the Vong so she can get close to the Jedi and unleash a spore that will not only kill her but everyone around her, and she is ordered to do it against the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Han Solo, with the loss of Chewbacca, separates himself from his family and friends and becomes a loner.

After the feint attack at Ord Mantell, the refugee and New Republic survivors from the battle, including Han and Droma, board the Queen of Empire, a large pleasure yacht whose next stop is at Bilbringi.

A certain team in the Brigade, lead by Reck Desh, invade the Queen of Empire to capture Elan and Vergere and bring them back to their masters, but when the Vong are quickly informed of it, a battle for the ship takes place between the New Republic and the Yuuzhan Vong. After Elan and Vergere are taken by Desh and his troops, the members of the Brigade strike team are killed by some of Elan's spores and when Han and Droma show up to save the two \"defectors,\" Han figures out Elan and Vergere are still on the Vong's side. Elan decides to use more of the spores to kill Han. Fortunately, Han is saved by a device on a survival tool that his youngest son, Anakin, gave him which was made by Chewbacca years earlier, which provides Han breathable air, thus saving him from the spores. Elan, therefore, dies by herself, having failed her mission to destroy the Jedi. As for Vergere, she gives Han and Droma some tears of hers that she states is able to heal Mara Jade Skywalker's disease that is slowly killing her from the inside, which of course was thanks to the Yuuzhan Vong, and Vergere escapes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the battle at the Queen of Empire, Han vows that he will help Droma reunite with his family, who are one of the many refugees of the New Republic fleeing from the Yuuzhan Vong."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
