Reaching their destination, the team signaled the Bravado but then discovered that the Imperial Floating Fortress, accompanied by storm commandos and CompForce Assault troopers, was approaching their location.

Subsequently, the Galactic Empire forces established a staging area fifteen kilometers to the south of Target Dewback.
