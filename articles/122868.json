In an attempt to diffuse the war, three different Jedi missions were dispatched to negotiate a peace. The final mission was staffed by Jedi Knights Empatojayos Brand, Bultar Swan, and Chellemi Chuovvick. Unable to mediate the dispute, questions surrounding a potential Sepan secession from the Republic became common."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sepan Civil War raged on through the Clone Wars and the establishment of the Galactic Empire.

The Imperial presence was welcomed by the Ripoblus, who saw it as an opportunity to achieve victory over the their Dimok enemies. Harkov, however, was determined to bring both sides to heel. With the help of young Maarek Stele, Harkov's forces drove the two sides together. Representatives from both sides met on Sepan 8 to discuss cooperating to repel the Imperial forces. Their efforts, however, were in vain. Harkov's forces defeated the Sepan forces and their Alliance allies, and ended the Sepan Civil War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Late in 40 ABY, during the Second Galactic Civil War, old tensions flared up again all across the galaxy.
