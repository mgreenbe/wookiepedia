A design that dated from before the Clone Wars, the R-88 was a bulky rifle that had two underslung cylinders used to store Brix-C stun fluid, a Merr-Sonn nerve agent that aerosolized as it traveled through atmosphere. The weapon fired a concentrated stream of Brix-C, which caused nausea, impaired vision, breathing difficulties, burning pains, and rendered individuals unconsciousness when ingested or inhaled."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
