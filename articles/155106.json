During the Great Hyperspace Disaster, the lieutenant was asked by Jedi Master Avar Kriss about a piece of hyperspace debris deep in the Hetzal system that the Force had drawn her attention to, and he informed her that it was going to hit the largest of the system's three suns and be vaporized. The lieutenant assumed the debris was harmless, but after Kriss asked him for more information, he discovered and alerted Kriss and Admiral Pevel Kronara that the debris was actually a tank of liquid Tibanna."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
