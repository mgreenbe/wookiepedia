The ship had been modified to allow it to service as a theater. The bow had been rebuilt to act as a stage and many of the original cabins had been converted into dressing rooms and prop storage. The upper level served as living space for the performers. When landed a large section of the performance area of the ship could be separated from the rest of the ship and moved around to use as a stage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "DeMain also added secret compartments to smuggle for the Rebel Alliance. One of these compartments was placed in a dummy engine between the two other engines. The compartment was fitted with false energy signature projectors and illuminators to fool sensors. It could also be ejected in times of trouble."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the ship's escape pods was actually a disguised mini-shuttle for Leger's private use."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
