It was a particularly well known work, and copies of it were available in the galaxy at some point after the Battle of Yavin during the Galactic Civil War. The painting depicted a brown-furred Bothan female gazing from the left side of the work to the right. Behind her was a background of brown that faded into blue as it moved from the left to the right. A lighter-hued watermark in the shape of a rounded-off sunburst was superimposed over the image. Overall, the work's style was similar to that of Bothan Buff, another painting created by Bahzel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bothan Beauty is a painting that appears in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies developed by Sony Online Entertainment.
