Before the Galactic Civil War, the ship was sent by Senator Bail Organa to reinforce Commander Jun Sato's unit of the rebellion along with two other Hammerheads, the Amity's Arrow and the Duchess Senna. The three ships were stolen by one of Sato's sub-units, the Spectres, during a raid on the planet Lothal.

After being flanked by two Imperial Star Destroyers (ISDs) and badly damaged, the Lightmaker withdrew from the field of fire to guard the line of retreat. Admiral Raddus later ordered Oquon\u00e9 to ram his corvette into the side of the disabled Star Destroyer Persecutor, causing it to crash into the ISD Intimidator before sending the latter crashing into the Shield Gate protecting Scarif, disabling the planetary force field and thus allowing crucial transmissions between Scarif and the rebel fleet. Though the plan was successful, the corvette was destroyed in combat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Commanders and crew"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the battle of Scarif, the Lightmaker's cockpit was crewed by several humans and droids.

Knoll speculated that, given the Death Star fires on the position where the pods would land, it was still unlikely any of the Lightmaker's crew survived. The novelization of the film clarified that the ship was evacuated of nonessential personnel before performing the maneuver as well as including a scene where Raddus notices several escape pods floating by afterwards, mentioning that Raddus did not dare hope of them originating from the Lightmaker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
