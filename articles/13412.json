Using the dark side of the Force and the technology that the Kwa gave them, the Rakata forged an Infinite Empire based on conquest and enslavement of Force-rich worlds, and they sought to use Infinity Gate technology to travel instantaneously between worlds. The Kwa fought back against the Rakata on the Rakata homeworld of Lehon, holding the Rakata off until several of their number could destroy the Infinity Gate on Lehon, though many Kwa died in the process. Following the battle, the Kwa destroyed or disabled most of the remaining gates across the galaxy and retreated to their homeworld of Dathomir, though some Kwa like A'nang remained behind on worlds such as Tython."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle between the Kwa and Rakata was first shown through a flashback in the comic book Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 4, which was released on March 27, 2013.
