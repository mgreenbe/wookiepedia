Following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, the GeneTech Syndicate conducted an highly illegal and dangerous bioengineering project in the GeneTech Syndicate Lab dubbed Parasophic Arachne program. The objective was to create an intelligent and powerful form of arachnes for the use of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Agent Taarna of the Corellian Security Force dispatched a spacer to investigate the GeneTech Lab near Dearic. During the course of the investigation, it became apparent to Taarna that illicit genetic testing on animals was taking place. This included the hatching of numerous, monstrously large arachne creatures that breached containment and overran the entire facility. Deeming the lab a threat to the entire world of Talus, Taarna ordered the spacer to carry out a number of objectives in an effort to sabotage it. One of these objectives included the deletion of all information about the Parasophic Arachne project from multiple computer terminals. However, a very sophisticated encryption system prevented the spacer from successfully slicing into one of the terminals belonging to the laboratory's project manager."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As it turned out however, the project manager's protocol droid, 6-POC, knew the password. However, 6-POC was at first reluctant to divulge it. It was not until the spacer explained to 6-POC that his master was killed by the ferocious beasts, that 6-POC began to consider otherwise. Fearing loneliness in a world eradicated by the beasts of the GeneTech Lab, 6-POC finally revealed to the spacer that the entry code to his master's terminal was \"zerek species.\" The spacer commended the droid for serving his master well, and then proceeded to delete the sensitive information off the project manager's computer, in addition to five other terminals spread throughout the facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "6-POC had silver colored plating and black and silver eye sensors.

Ever hesitant to divulge his master's private terminal password, 6-POC nevertheless relented when it became apparent that his master was dead, and that the entire population of Talus could be eradicated by violent beasts. Capable of independent thought, and fears of loneliness, 6-POC understood that giving the spacer his password was what his master would have wanted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "6-POC was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. He was added to the game as part of the expansive Legacy Quest series with the release of \"Chapter 2: The Talus Incident\" on August 1, 2006. In the game, players who accepted the \"Genocide\" quest from CorSec agent Taarna were tasked with investigating the GeneTech Syndicate Lab on Talus. One of the sub-quests titled a \"A Better Life Through Genetics\", required players to delete information off of six terminals, one of which required the player to converse with 6-POC to obtain a password. Although the player could choose not to do these quests, this article assumes 100% game completion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
