A small team led by Han Solo and Chewbacca successfully rescued a number of Sernpidalians during the destruction of the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Background"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a prelude to their main invasion of the galaxy, agents of the Praetorite Vong had stirred up chaos in the far edges of the Outer Rim Territories. The Praetorite Vong expeditionary force had established a bio-engineered yammosk on icy Helska IV to coordinate their warships. Meanwhile, one of their agents, Nom Anor, had stirred up a war between the twin-planets Osarian and Rhommamool in the Expansion Region to spread the New Republic and the Jedi thin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another agent, Yomin Carr, had secured the remote ExGal-4 outpost on the planet Belkadan due to its proximity to Vector Prime\u2014a small hole where the Yuuzhan Vong fleet could penetrate the energy field surrounding the galaxy. This site was also chosen due to its proximity to the New Republic/Imperial Remnant border; allowing for a weaker military response from the Republic. Due to Sernpidal's close proximity to Belkadan and its status as the most heavily populated enemy world in the Dalonbian sector, there was a chance that the Republic would quickly discover the Praetorite Vong's presence on Belkadan and destroy the yammosk; setting back the Yuuzhan Vong invasion plans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The expeditionary force's commander, Prefect Da'Gara, and his charge Nom Anor, who had returned from Rhommamool, discussed strategies including destroying Sernpidal's environment. However, Nom Anor suggested destroying Sernpidal and killing as many enemies as they could. This disaster would lure some of the New Republic warships into the region where they would be ambushed and destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the end, Da'Gara agreed and suggested deploying Yo'gand's Core tactic to destroy Sernpidal. This involved planting a gravity-focusing dovin basal on the planet and using it to drag down an orbiting planetoid; in this case Sernpidal's smaller moon Dobido. The resulting collision would destroy Sernpidal's atmosphere, killing its people and rendering the world uninhabitable."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A Fateful Run"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being sent on a cargo run to the planet by Lando Calrissian, the Millennium Falcon arrived at Sernpidal City's docking bay. Being rudely ignored by several Sernpidalians, Han, Anakin Solo, and Chewie were unable to obtain any help unloading the cargo that Lando had requested be dropped off. Han was eventually greeted by an elderly man who, seemingly calmer than the rest, informed Han that he would have no trouble unloading his cargo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Venturing into the city, the three found that its citizens were in complete disarray. The old man, who had introduced himself as the Mayor of Sernpidal City, informed them that the cause of the pandemonium was the locals' belief that the goddess Tosi-karu was arriving. The Mayor realized Han's confusion and pointed toward the sky at the approaching moon. Upon seeing that the moon was headed on a direct collision course with the planet, Han decided to investigate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After having circumnavigated the moon several times, Han concluded that Sernpidal had, at the most, seven hours before the collision. Anakin was also able to deduce that something was pulling the moon down each time it revolved around Sernpidal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving back on planet, Anakin was able to sense that whatever was pulling Dobido down was located east of Sernpidal City. Han, knowing that Anakin would be the only one able to find it, reluctantly allowed his son to go search for the cause along with the Mayor, who had offered to accompany him. Meanwhile Han and Chewbacca began loading as many people as they could onto the Falcon."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Destruction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving, they discovered that the cause of Dobido's descent was a Dovin basal\u2014a bioengineered Yuuzhan Vong creature. Anakin, in an attempt to destroy the basal, fired upon it with a blaster, though this proved ineffective. The Falcon then arrived to assist Anakin and the Mayor. However, the Mayor was reluctant to leave and stated that he would not allow the basal to escape the planet's destruction. Jumping into the basal's hole, the mayor used a thermal detonator to destroy it, sacrificing himself in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving back in Sernpidal City, Han Solo was able to organize a refugee convoy through the use of the Falcon and several other freighters. As the winds picked up, Anakin was knocked into the distance, forcing Chewbacca to rescue him. Chewbacca, although able to bring Anakin to the safety of the Falcon, was himself knocked away by another burst of wind, placing him directly into the path of the fast-approaching moon. Anakin, who had piloted the Falcon while his father stood on the entrance ramp in an attempt to rescue the stranded Chewbacca, flew away from Sernpidal City when he realized it was too late to save Chewbacca. The Wookiee stood in the moon's trajectory, bellowed his last heroic roar, and was crushed along with the countless number of Sernpidal citizens who could not, or refused to, escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unknown to the refugee convoy, the Yuuzhan Vong had arranged for a swarm of grutchin to ambush the convoy. During this time Kyp Durron, having lost his Dozen and Two Avengers to a similar grutchin attack, was rescued by Han Solo. The refugee convoy was able to fight off the grutchin only to find coralskippers chasing them. The convoy eventually arrived at Dubrillion, but only to find that they would be forced back into battle when the Yuuzhan Vong attempted to invade that planet."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The death of Chewbacca had a severe impact on the entire Solo family, as well as many others. Han blamed Anakin for leaving Chewbacca behind, and it would be many months before the two were able to reconcile. Anakin, however, also blamed himself, and delved further into his own beliefs, despite his brother Jacen's protests. Because of his losses, Anakin would begin pushing himself harder and harder against the invading enemy forces, trying to live up to Chewbacca's sacrifice while keeping other loved ones from slipping away, only to be killed himself over Myrkr two years later."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke Skywalker had sensed Chewbacca die and Sernpidal suffer, a catastrophe he classified as a disturbance in the Force. In an interview with C-3PO and R2-D2 shortly afterwards, he recounted how his one-time mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi, felt the fate of Alderaan, comparing it with this recent tragedy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later on, Sernpidal was used to grow worldships, and Rogue Squadron led a successful assault on it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
