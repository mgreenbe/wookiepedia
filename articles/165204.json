This was an experiment by Commander Rezi Soresh to create the perfect assassin, who would then go on to serve the Galactic Empire. Soresh wiped their identities from a computer database system and had their faces surgically altered. He then started a brutal reconditioning program that was designed to turn them into mindless servants by removing their past emotions and memories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At first, X-2 became friends with X-1, X-3, X-4, X-5, X-6, and X-7, the other participants in the training program. However, after Soresh started torturing them with electrocution, X-2, like the other members of the group, had his personality and mind changed completely until he felt no emotions. About ten years prior to the Battle of Yavin, the assassins were pitted against each other until only one remained. X-2 malfunctioned and tried to escape, only to be killed by X-7, who then earned the right to become Soresh's personal assassin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "X-2's only appearance in Star Wars canon is in a flashback in Rebel Force: Target, the first book of the young readers series Star Wars: Rebel Force, published on December 2, 2008 and written by Alex Wheeler."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
