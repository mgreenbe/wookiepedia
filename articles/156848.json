However, the gamble of the settlers who lived there failed to produce and they evacuated the moisture farm long before their two-story home became the site of a skirmish between Niima Outpost law enforcement and a band of droids. The farm was heavily damaged by a suicidal EG-6 gonk droid that was laden with grenades when it self-destructed in an attempt to kill Constable Zuvio. Despite its sacrifice, Zuvio survived."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
