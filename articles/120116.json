During Agorn's life he trained Padawan Cope Shykrill, a Selonian prodigy strong in telekinesis. During Shykrill's training, the boy fell to the dark side of the Force; though Agorn was unaware of this until the murder of three other Padawans. While Shykrill made it appear that he was one of the victims, Agorn and his contemporary Nuck Lyu realized the truth and released Shykrill from the dark side's grip by killing him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of Agorn's lasting contributions to the Jedi Order was his keeping of a personal holocron which would later be recovered long after his death. As his personality served as gatekeeper, many assumed that his image was that of a degraded image, but scans proved that the confusion stemmed from viewers' unfamiliarity with Agorn's rare species. Agorn's personality was also preserved as a Gatekeeper for the Great Holocron to teach about the early Order's history and interactions with the dark side."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
