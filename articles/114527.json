As such, he was among the highest-ranking bureaucrats of the Empire. At one point early in the Imperial Era, Emperor Palpatine grew displeased with his Sith apprentice, the cyborg known as Darth Vader. He put Rersey aboard a Theta-class shuttle, sending him as his emissary to Vader's fortress, on the volcanic planet of Mustafar. As the advisor attempted to obtain answers from Vader, he quarreled with the Dark Lord of the Sith's personal servant, Vane\u00e9, who thought the envoy was being disrespectful to his host."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their dispute was cut short when Vader felt a disturbance in the Force, which was soon followed by a startling scream. As it turned out, the fortress was being invaded by a horde of Mustafarians led by Mother Sssl of Clan Rrrt, who sought to infect everyone inside the castle with a mind-controlling plague. All seemed lost when Vader himself was bitten in the arm by an infected Imperial Lava Trooper, and both Rersey and Vane\u00e9 contemplated their imminent demise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, since Vader's limbs were all mechanical, he had only pretended to have been infected for a moment; he soon turned against Mother Sssl, manipulating her thoughts through the Force so she would order her slaves to drag her into the nearby lava river.
