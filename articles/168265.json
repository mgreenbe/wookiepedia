The Senescas were known for dealing in goods of just about any kind of nature. In their later years, in the early days of the Galactic Civil War, prior to the Battle of Yavin, they began dealing in arms for the fledgling Rebel Alliance. Kestic Station would soon become a vital link in the Alliance's supply chain. Even though running arms for the Rebellion was illegal and punishable by death, they felt they were doing the right thing. They also encouraged their son, Zev, to leave Kestic and join the Rebellion, which he did."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Rebel supply lines were soon traced back to Kestic Station.
