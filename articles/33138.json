He spent the majority of his early life on Tatooine being taught his initial training by his father, the Jedi Master Sidrona Diath. Upon completion of the training, he traveled to Ossus and became an apprentice to Master Vodo. He would eventually be one of the Jedi sent as reinforcements to help Ulic Qel-Droma during the Freedon Nadd Uprising on Onderon. He later participated in the Convocation at Mount Meru on Deneba and fought against the Krath during the Great Sith War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He was an experienced and talented pilot, and while on Onderon learned to fly one of the Beast Rider's war beasts.

The remoteness of Tatooine permitted Sidrona to begin training his son in the ways of the Jedi, eventually leading Dace to the place where he could achieve a deep understanding of the Force. His father's training, coupled with the isolated environment he found himself in, allowed Dace to touch the Force and let it flow through him unhindered. However, even though he was able to open himself up to the Force, and pushed himself to be the best student he could, Dace found that he was still learning slowly. That led Dace to consider abandoning his Jedi training, not because he disliked the rigid lifestyle he was forced to live, but mainly because he did not want to disappoint his father. If he did not try, he reasoned, then he could not fail."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His father recognized these times of self-doubt in his son and did all he could to strengthen Dace's confidence in himself and his faith in the Jedi way. During one of these times, Sidrona realized that it was usually those Jedi who had worked the hardest and most diligently in their studies of the Force, that became the most capable and gifted teachers; they could better understand the hardships their students faced, and therefore help guide them to a resolution. Sidrona constantly reminded his son of that, and therefore convinced Dace that he was not alone in his difficulties, and that he might one day be able to assume the mantle of a Jedi Master."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Self-doubt and discovery"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sidrona Diath routinely trained Dace in the Jundland Wastes, on both the physical and mental sides of the Force. After one especially frustrating day of training in the Wastes, Dace lost all faith in his abilities. As in previous times, Dace went to his father for support, but that time Sidrona did not offer any words of comfort. Instead, he told Dace that he needed now to learn to rely on the Force unconditionally and to look inward to discover his destiny rather than rely on outside support. Dace, fairly surprised and rather upset at his father's words, wandered away from his home and into the dying light of dusk\u2014trying to focus his thoughts on the Force and his problem."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He wandered aimlessly throughout the surrounding landscape, the long minutes spanning into even longer hours, fighting with the confusion and inner turmoil that had taken over his mind. He drifted until he was half-frozen, and found himself on the edge of the Dune Sea. Then, he saw through the swirling mists of confusion in his mind, and began to recall things from the depths of his memories. The one memory that rushed to the forefront was when his father had taken him as a young child to Ossus to visit the Great Jedi Library. While there, he had inspected a Jedi holocron, and the gatekeeper had spoken to the young Dace Diath. Dace recalled that the gatekeeper had spoken to him of how a Jedi who tries and does not give up, will never fail\u2014and that a Jedi who does give up not only fails himself, but also the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pondering on what the gatekeeper had told him, Diath finally realized that it was his own way of thinking that had resulted in all his difficulties. He concluded that if he could just practice, train, and learn under his father without all these negative personal feelings about his progress, then he would not be hampered any longer, and he would therefore succeed. On his way back to his father's home, he likewise came to the understanding that his father had declined him help, because he would never accept these revelations if someone else had presented him with them; he had to illuminate and discover his own path, and believe in it without question. Otherwise, if he never accepted his own destiny fully, then he would never overcome his own self-doubt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dace eventually returned to his father, and continued training under Sidrona's tutelage for a further two years. At the end of that time, Dace felt that he was ready to leave his father to travel to Ossus and continue his training at the Jedi training center there.

All through the new training regimes on Ossus under Master Vodo, Diath adhered to the lessons he learned in the Dune Sea on Tatooine, mastering his self-doubt and consequently excelling in his Jedi training. He impressed Master Vodo so much that when Vodo departed Ossus for Dantooine, he asked Diath to accompany him and continue to train under him. On Dantooine, Diath continued his Jedi training under Master Vodo, and was later joined by fellow apprentices Exar Kun, and the Cathars Sylvar and Crado."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following his training, Diath joined Nomi Sunrider, Shoaneb Culu, Qrrrl Toq, and Kith Kark in answering Ulic Qel-Droma's call for reinforcements against the Naddists during the Freedon Nadd Uprising."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Freedon Nadd Uprising"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the events which took place on Onderon that saw the capture of Jedi Master Arca Jeth, Ulic Qel-Droma sent a request to Ossus for additional Jedi support in the Freedon Nadd Uprising.

Sensing Qel-Droma in a fortress not far from Iziz, the five Jedi reinforcements rushed to his aid\u2014Diath and the other Jedi used Force battle-techniques which had been perfected over many centuries, and together they charged the ranks of their numerous enemy. During the attack, Nomi Sunrider commented that an energy field was blocking her Jedi Battle meditation; likewise, Diath also noticed that something strange was happening. Diath found himself fighting an ancient Sith War Droid that he could feel dark side energy radiating off of. Eventually Diath and the other Jedi reinforcements linked up with Qel-Droma and the remaining Jedi of Cay Qel-Droma, Tott Doneeta, and Oss Wilum; together they discovered that it was King Ommin of Onderon who was creating the dark side energies that they could all sense. With the help of Diath and the other Jedi, Ulic Qel-Droma managed to defeat Ommin and break the dark side influence over Onderon.

The Jedi were surprised that these two young Tetans, whom they had discovered were on Onderon during the height of the Naddist Revolt, were now deeply immersed in Sith teachings.

However, through the use of ancient Sith magic, the Krath forces\u2014under the leadership of Satal and Aleema Keto\u2014used suicide tactics to utterly destroy the Jedi and Republic fleet.

The Jedi realized that something was drastically wrong, and together they retreated back to Ossus. Once back on Ossus, Diath and Cay Qel-Droma were asked to test the new, but still experimental, Star Saber Starfighters.

When the Krath forces retreated from Coruscant, Ulic was left facing the gathered might of a group of Jedi, including Diath, led by Nomi Sunrider and Vodo-Siosk Baas. Together, Sunrider and Master Vodo used the 'Blocking' technique taught by Jedi Master Odan-Urr and temporarily cut Ulic off from the Force.
