During the attack, a city and its entire population were destroyed within moments. Former Imperial sharpshooter Migs Mayfeld was present on Burnin Konn during the attack as part of a division which was lost, an event that seemed to mark his split from the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time after the event, while undercover with Din Djarin, Mayfeld was confronted by his old commanding officer during the battle, General Valin Hess. During a tense drink that followed, Mayfeld pointedly reminded Hess of the slaughter of the battle, to which Hess responded with derision and indifference. Overwhelmed with the traumatizing memories of the battle, and Hess' callousness, Mayfeld shot him dead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
