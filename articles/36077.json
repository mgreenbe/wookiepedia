Referred to as the Trickster goddess, she was an important deity within the pantheon of the True Way. Members of the deception sect were trained from birth in all manner of deception, not for evil deeds, but for the good of the Yuuzhan Vong. They were trained to deceive the \"infidels\" (those who did not follow the True Way), and were essential as they formed a sort of religious intelligence program. They often worked with the Intendant caste, who were also devoted to Yun-Harla, in spreading disinformation and interpreting intelligence reports."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Harrar, the spiritual advisor to Warmaster Tsavong Lah, was a member of the deception sect, as were the Priestesses Elan and Ngaaluh.
