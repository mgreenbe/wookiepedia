Having been denied representation in the Galactic Senate and having their main export article banned, the Nosaurians turned to the Confederacy, who were more than willing to support them financially, as well as include New Plympto in the movement. Not surprisingly, the Republic invaded New Plympto, engaging both Nosaurians and battle droids in mortal combat. The battle would last until the end of the Clone Wars, when Dass Jennir, the Jedi General in charge of the clone army, was betrayed by his own troops and almost killed. However, despite deactivation of their droid army, the Nosaurian Separatists managed to escape the battle and regroup."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
