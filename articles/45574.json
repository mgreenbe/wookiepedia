Known in its early days as the Alliance Against Zakuul, the Alliance was initially a resistance movement to the formerly dominant Eternal Empire and sought to overthrow the tyrannical Emperor Arcann, and later Empress Vaylin, his sister. Eventually defeating both Arcann and Vaylin, the Alliance would seize the throne after defeating the last forces of the Empire in the Battle of Zakuul. The Alliance was then reorganized by the Outlander, and transformed into the Eternal Alliance. All military assets of the Eternal Empire, including its enormous fleet, were absorbed into the Alliance. With control of the Eternal Fleet, the Alliance was considered the most powerful faction in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Order of Zildrog's campaign against the Alliance and the destruction of the Eternal Fleet at the hands of the superweapon Zildrog, many personnel returned to their original factions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Founding"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle of Asylum, elements from both the Galactic Republic and reconstituted Sith Empire realized that the Eternal Empire was not invincible. The movement was initially organized by the individual known as the Outlander on the planet Odessen, a force-neutral planet making it a perfect place for an alliance between the light side-aligned Republic and dark-side aligned Empire, whereupon a fortress was constructed on the base of a cliff which would serve as the Alliance's base of operations during the coming war. Although the resistance movement started small, it gradually grew into a larger force, consisting of individuals from both the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, such as Theron Shan, Lana Beniko, Major Pierce, Bey'wan Aygo, Hutt doctor Juvard Illip Oggurobb, and Hylo Visz, among many other specialists. Once the Alliance established itself as a force to be reckoned with, the Outlander was named the commander of the organization, and ultimately helped it grow in strength as well as lead a series of tactical strikes against the Eternal Empire's Star Fortresses."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Initial strikes"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The GEMINI Deception"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first objective the Alliance targeted was the Eternal Fleet.

When the Alliance Commander arrived, the Eternal Alliance was choked in a newly spawned war on the planet between the age-old enemies of the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire. Trying to focus on the objective at hand, the Commander gathered allies to a throne where the secrets of Iokath laid. However, the throne was reached by the opposing power's leader first, who then attempted to release the superweapon, but they were overtaken by Iokath's hidden power and were killed in the process of learning such power.
