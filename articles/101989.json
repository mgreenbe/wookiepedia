Lord Blank's regime was tied down with an internal conflict on Quarzite between the Belugan populace and the planet's other native species, the Kage. Blank lusted over the Kage female Pluma Sodi, and in a bid to make her his unwilling bride, Belugan troopers kidnapped Sodi. The young Kage was stored in a box and was set to be delivered to Blank's stronghold via subtram under the supervision of Major Rigosso. Fearing a Kage rescue mission, Blank and Rigosso sought out a team of six bounty hunters to thwart it. The bid failed, however, and Blank was deprived of his bride."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the year 20 BBY, the planet Quarzite was ruled by the Belugan dictator Lord Otua Blank.

Upon arriving to Blank's stronghold, Ventress, under the guise of still having Sodi locked in a crate, accepted Blank's payment of 600,000 unmarked credits and left.
