For transportation, they used hang gliders, battle wagons, and bordoks. Although extremely skilled in forest survival and the construction of primitive technology like gliders and catapults, the Ewoks had yet to progress past stone-level technology when discovered by the Empire. They were quick learners, however, when exposed to advanced technology with simple mechanical processes and concepts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some Ewoks were removed from their planet and taken as pets or slaves.

They were covered in fur from head to toe, with brown and black the most common colors. Other Ewoks had near-white or reddish fur, but red fur is supposedly the rarest shade an Ewok can get. Most Ewoks had solid-colored fur, though a few sported stripes. Ewoks had large, bright eyes, small humanoid noses, and hands that possessed two fingers and an opposable thumb. Despite their small size, Ewoks were physically strong enough to overpower combat-trained Humans. The Human Mace Towani likened their appearance to \"little bears,\" though they were sometimes referred to as \"mini Wookiees.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ewok meat was additionally used as a food.

As early as 3639 BBY, an Ewok mercenary named Treek became involved in the events of the Galactic War. Centuries later, during the Clone Wars, \"Ewok Jerky\" was sold at Power Sliders, a diner on the planet Abafar. The phrase \"a Rodian in Ewok's clothing\" was used by Mon Mothma in a speech she gave on Agamar before the Battle of Yavin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ewoks of Bright Tree Village, led by Chief Chirpa and the medicine man Logray, had extensive contact with offworlders. These Ewoks helped the shipwrecked Humans Mace and Cindel Towani rescue their parents from a Gorax. Later, a group of Sanyassan Marauders who had crashed on the Forest Moon several decades earlier attacked the Ewoks, killing all of the Towani family except for Cindel, and taking several Ewoks prisoner. A young Ewok named Wicket Wystri Warrick helped Cindel and another shipwrecked Human (Noa Briqualon) defeat the Sanyassans, rescue the prisoners, and find the parts needed to repair Briqualon's ship. Finally, they helped stop an Imperial scientist named Dr. Raygar, who attempted to steal the sacred Sunstar and use it to take control of the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ewoks also had contact with the many other sentient species on the Forest Moon, such as the Yuzzums, Gupins, Lizard Warriors, and Teeks. Their cousins, the swamp-dwelling Duloks, were rivals of the Ewoks, and often made trouble for them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ewoks were known even to the natives of the remote Tatooine, such as Roan Novachez, who created a series of comics called Ewok Pilot about a pilot who was an Ewok.

However, a botched attempt at first contact with Ewoks by some Imperial soldiers resulted in Ewoks terrorizing Imperial positions. Many Ewoks were taken as slaves. Imperial operations were situated around the area near Bright Tree Village. Princess Leia Organa, part of a Rebel strike team, met and befriended Wicket W. Warrick, who took her back to his village as an honored guest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, another group of Ewoks had captured Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, Han Solo, R2-D2, and C-3PO. When the Ewoks saw the protocol droid C-3PO, they identified him as a long-prophesied god called \"The Golden One.\" Despite Wicket and Leia's protests, Logray would have sacrificed them as a feast in C-3PO's honor. Skywalker's use of the Force combined with C-3PO's warnings soon changed Chief Chirpa's mind, however."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That night, C-3PO told the Council of Elders the adventures of the Rebel heroes. The Ewoks accepted the Rebels into their tribe, and allied themselves to their cause. The Ewoks helped in the ground battle to destroy the Imperial shield generator on the forest floor, and their primitive weapons felled the stormtroopers and the scout walkers of the Empire, although they took many losses to Imperial blaster fire. This assistance paved the way for the destruction of the second Death Star and the Rebel victory at the Battle of Endor. Later that night, the Ewoks held a huge celebration that could be heard throughout the forest. The Ewoks were determined to save their forest by several means."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Endor, some Imperial propaganda stated that the Ewoks were driven into extinction due to the after effects of the battle.

He later shared his experiences to Cindel Towani, voicing his opinion on the Ewoks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Rebellion reorganized into the Alliance of Free Planets, the Alliance used Bright Tree Village as their headquarters for a brief period of time. Even with the Imperial forces gone from Endor, it was a turbulent time for the Ewoks. The Hiromi instigated a conflict between the Lahsbee and the Ewoks, which was resolved through the Alliance's efforts. Soon afterwards, a second battle was fought in the skies above Endor when the Alliance was attacked by Nagai and Maccabree forces led by the self-proclaimed Dark Lady of the Sith Lumiya."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the Alliance forces left Endor soon after fighting off Lumiya's forces, the Ewoks had become part of the Galactic community. In the next few years, several Ewoks even found their way off Endor. The New Republic established trading posts on the Forest Moon. Most Ewoks who traveled off-world were adventurous individuals, such as the smuggler Tarfang, or the Ewok soldiers who joined the New Republic forces at the Second Battle of Coruscant in 10 ABY. By 9 ABY, there was also a significant Ewok colony on the planet Svivren, although it is not known when or how they first settled there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Endor itself, the New Republic later set up semi-permanent outposts (such as Salfur's Trading Post) near Ewok villages.

A medicine man also lived in the Ewok village, a keeper of mystical lore, and a healer to the injured. The warriors of the different tribes wore ragged garments on the head to signify their tribe. The warriors also wore wooden chest shields, the jawbones of tiny animals, and sharp teeth. Some decorated themselves with ornaments such as feathers, necklaces, and pendants, making their body look like a clutter of trinkets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prominent members of Ewok tribes carried totems to symbolize their rank.

The construction of a new hut signaled that the male had decided to take a mate, at which point all of the unmarried females would try to woo him. Until his home was finished, the male did not decide whom he was taking. The chosen female had the right to refuse the male or the hut he had built."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Children"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ewoks were very closely attached to their fuzzy children called woklings. An entire Ewok village fawned over newborn babies. They always gave the children much attention, and they considered the care of their children a shared responsibility. Woklings had few rights, and the children had to learn many rituals and legends that would serve as moral guides throughout their lives. When the Ewok came of age, he or she attended the Festival of Hoods. This festival marked the transition from wokling to Ewok."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Villages"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Tree village"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most Ewoks lived high among the trees of the forest moon, in villages built between the closely spaced trees. The basic design of a tree village had a \"Central Village\" of thatched-roof huts on the primary limbs. These huts were high enough above the ground to be out of reach of predators. Suspended bridges connected the gaps between trees, adjoining distant huts. Knotted rope ladders allowed access up or down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In most tree cities, the village Elders ordered the largest huts built directly on the trunk of the tree. These central buildings belonged to the chief of the tribe. The chief used the largest open areas for village gatherings, meetings, council fires, and storytelling ceremonies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Family groups kept their own dwellings in clusters on the outlying trees. Separate huts were built for unmarried females, elders, and visitors. A sealed building higher than the rest of the tree city was used as the communities' food storage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some Ewoks eschewed village life for a nomadic existence. More traditional Ewoks came to refer to them as Jindas, after the nomadic tribe of Jindas that lived on Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bright Tree Village, where the tribe ruled by Chief Chirpa lived, was a typical example of an Ewok tree village."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ground village"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some Ewoks of the Bright Tree Village tribe at one time lived in isolated huts on the forest floor.

The lake Ewoks built their villages on stilts out in the water. The surrounding water protected the Ewoks from large predators. These Ewoks got most of their food by setting wicker traps to catch fish in the lake. The older Ewoks spent their time harvesting marsh grasses and drying them in the sun. They then took these dry grasses and made them into mats, clothing, baskets, and decorative tapestries. The young Ewoks loved to splash in the water and dig in the mud for buried shellfish."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These Ewoks also built wooden sailboats and oars."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cliff village"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some tribes of Ewoks made their homes on a rock face beside a spraying waterfall. Ewok engineers created an intricate set of waterwheels, driven by the force of the waterfall.

Ewoks also believed that music enhanced their work. Ewoks were resourceful and tended to make use of everything they could get their hands on, so they used a variety of drums, horns, flutes, and other simple instruments in their music. During the Ewok and Rebel celebration after the destruction of the second Death Star, one Ewok used a series of Imperial stormtrooper and naval trooper helmets as drums, producing a variety of tones. Ewok music also used primitive harmony."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Language"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ewok language was known as Ewokese. It was related to many others on Endor, including the Yuzzum language, which was recorded from off-world Yuzzum colonies and programmed into certain models of protocol droids. These relationships allowed Ewoks to communicate relatively easily with many other beings on Endor. Ewok physiology allowed them to learn and speak most other languages as well, including Galactic Basic Standard."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Hunting and trapping"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ewoks ventured to the forest floor to hunt, using stone-tipped arrows and spears as well as elaborate traps to catch their prey. Ewoks considered themselves to be great hunters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A single hunter could snare small animals but an entire Ewok hunting party could catch animals as large as a boar-wolf. The Ewoks had created effective ways to hunt these monstrous animals using spears and poison darts. The Ewoks first set up a trap with scraps of bloody meat from a previous hunt and then they would set a vine net on the forest floor. When the wolf ran towards the meat, it would get caught in the net. Then, from the underbrush, the Ewok warriors charged at the trapped wolf. One of these boar-wolves would provide enough meat to feed an Ewok village for days."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Smaller game was killed with small sling nets. When a creature stepped into a loop it set off a pressure trap. A pinned sapling would break free and fling the animal into the nearest tree."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tek swee was a trap whose name translated into Basic as \"head hitter.\" This trap was a common defense against the Gorax. When a Gorax attempted to raid a Ewok village, the Ewok warriors would let loose a massive log roped onto trees. The log would swing into the Gorax like a giant battering ram. Many of the various traps set for Goraxes were used against the Empire in the battle of Endor with great success."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another food source for the Ewoks were mattberries that they squeezed for juice. These juices were mixed with water and fermented into a bitter brew."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Recreation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The \"Tribal Games\" were a series of games that Ewoks from scattered tribes came to play. There was much dancing and storytelling, but there were also far more dangerous events. Tree-jumping was a popular game among young Ewoks. The Ewok would climb the highest lifetree and leap off the highest limb. They had to catch themselves on the lower limbs until they descended all the way to the ground. An Ewok who missed could be seriously injured."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ewoks were sometimes known to smoke combustible substances in pipes, for recreational or spiritual purposes."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Festivals"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout the year, Ewoks hold extravagant festivals of the rain, the sun, springtime flowers, fruits, and love. These involved tribe and family groups coming together to feast, sing, dance, and generally have a good time. They also had certain \"Dark Rituals\" involving bloody sacrifices. These were held at night under the light of smoky bonfires, into which the Ewok shamans tossed the leaves of hallucinogenic herbs, to cause the Ewoks to have vivid dreams. Ewoks generally considered Hallowe'en, where they would dress up as ghosts, the best celebration of the year."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Weapons and equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ewoks used a variety of weapons that included knives, stone spears, slingshots, and bows and arrows.

These hunter-gatherers were a deeply spiritual people. They believed themselves to be descendants of the Great Tree, a sacred tree in the forests. The Ewok religion was based on nature worship. Many religious ceremonies were arranged to please various gods of weather, trees, the hunt, engineering prowess, and fertility. Darker spirits symbolized the dangers of the forest. The Ewoks held magnificent festivals of rain, sun, spring flowers, and fruits. There were also \"Dark Rituals\" involving bloody sacrifices.
