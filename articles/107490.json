Although the Trade Federation was more than capable of building and using prefab centers, they did not use prefab shelters a large percentage of the time because of their extensive use of droids. The Gungans, Naboo's indigenous sentient species, built prefab shelters underwater. The Grand Army of the Republic's prefab shelters allowed for a significant increase in its numbers compared to the prefab shelters of other factions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prefab shelters appear in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its 2003 expansion pack.
