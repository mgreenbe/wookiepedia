It was home to a spaceport and massive smuggling facility, as well as the typical locales associated with smugglers, including cantinas and casinos. Navigating the asteroid field was very treacherous, thus making Smuggler's Run a very secure hideout. Skip 1 was the largest of several asteroids named \"Skip\". The asteroid almost exploded once due to a mysterious slime."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boba Fett and some of his bounty hunter associates had quarters there, and by 17 ABY, these had been abandoned and converted into an eating area. Later that year, Skip 1 was damaged after droids containing bombs, which were meant to be smuggled to Coruscant as part of Dark Jedi Kueller's New Rebellion, exploded, resulting in the deaths of a number of smugglers. Han Solo and Lando Calrissian managed to save some of the injured, by flying them to the nearby Wrea system for treatment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
