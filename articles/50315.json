At some point, when the Sith dominated the galaxy, a number of statues representing the Four Sages were made. Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine kept bronzium statues of the Four Sages in his office and chambers on the planet Coruscant. Vice Chair Mas Amedda had a statue of Sistros on the top of his Speaker's staff. When Palpatine became Galactic Emperor during the aftermath of the Clone Wars, he moved his base of operations to the former Jedi Temple, which he refashioned as the Imperial Palace, and took his statue of Sistros with him. By 34 ABY, statuettes of the Four Sages of Dwartii could be found in Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities, one of the many stores in Black Spire Outpost on Batuu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
