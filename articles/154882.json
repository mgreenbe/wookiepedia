In her time, she established a domain on Ambria, a planet located in the galaxy's Inner Rim. Under the influence of the dark side of the Force, she enslaved Ambria's sentient inhabitants and exploited the native fauna as beasts of burden. Through her efforts, the sorceress depleted much of Ambria's natural resources, endeavoring to create a large obelisk in the north central regions of the planet. Determined to finish her creation, she oversaw the construction of the black-colored spike-shaped obelisk for hundreds of years, infusing it with the power of the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After finally completing her obelisk, the sorceress conducted a complicated Sith ritual, attempting to bind the entire world of Ambria to her will. In the process, she invoked a level of dark side power that ultimately overshadowed her own abilities. As a result, she lost control of the wave of Force energy that was subsequently unleashed upon Ambria. The failed machinations of the sorceress not only devastated Ambria's surface, but also killed every living being on the planet, including herself."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the botched ritual of the fallen Sith sorceress, the power of the dark side continued to plague the planet of Ambria for centuries. Following the end of the Great Hyperspace War in 5000 BBY, survivors from the defeated Sith Empire would eventually take refuge on Ambria, hiding among the dark side energies caused by the sorceress. By the time of the Great Sith War, the name of the sorceress had been forgotten, though her deeds were nonetheless recorded among Jedi lore. The remnants of her existence were encountered by Thon, a Jedi Master who trapped Ambria's dark side energies inside the large body of water known as Lake Natth. The exploits of the sorceress were not completely undone, however, as the planet remained a barren wasteland for several further millennia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith sorceress was a female follower of the dark side-worshipping Sith Order.

By conducting this ritual, she called upon a magnitude of dark side power surpassing the efforts of any individual before her time.
