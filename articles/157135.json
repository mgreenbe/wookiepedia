The police probe assumed the Duchess had killed Golect and issued an alert to other CSF and Coruscant Guard units. Several police droids and Riot clone troopers took up the chase. However, the Duchess shot the probe, disabling it and causing it to fall and trip up the pursuing police and shock troopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
