After Gar's death on Krownest, his brother Tiber Saxon took up his position of Governor and headed their conflict with Clan Wren and the Nite Owls."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tiber, who had completely eschewed any vestiges of loyalty towards his heritage, deployed a superweapon know as \"the Duchess\" against Clan Wren when they plotted with the Rebels to reclaim Mandalore, which worked by targeting and superheating the beskar alloy in Mandalorian armor, incinerating the wearer. The weapon was regarded as an abomination, for beskar armor was an inalienable part of Mandalorian culture. In response, Sabine, who had been unwittingly tricked into designing the weapon during her Academy days, led a joint force of Mandalorians and rebels to infiltrate Saxon's Star Destroyer at Sundari and destroy the \"Duchess\" before it could be used again. This, however, was also a trap orchestrated by Tiber, who wanted to capture Sabine and force her to perfect the weapon's range and capabilities. He confronted her on the ship, torturing her, Bo-Katan, and even his loyal subordinate Captain Hark with it in order to get her to comply. Sabine, however, used the opportunity to recalibrate it so that it targeted the Imperial's plastoid armor instead of beskar. Hark took the opportunity to escape before Wren breached the Duchess' power core. This caused the weapon to overload and blow up, taking the Star Destroyer and all hands aboard, including Tiber, with it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
