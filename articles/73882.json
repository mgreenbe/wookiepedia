Hera asks Kanan if he is alright, noticing his jumpiness. Kanan reassures himself that nobody will recognize him after all these years. Kanan convinces the Spectres to split up in order to cover more ground but does not allow Hera to accompany him. He tells Hera to accompany Ezra since he was a thief.

Seeing the missing crates in a warehouse, he tells T\u00e1pusk and his henchmen that the supplies they took belonged to his operation. Taking them was bad enough but tipping Gamut Key to cover their tracks was worse.
