Females attained the position of Head Girl while males attained the position of Head Boy. After the position became available following the mysterious disappearance of the previous Head, Jabbat, Lady Proxima offered the position to both Han and Qi'ra individually on the condition that they complete a task for her. Eventually after the task was completed, the choices for the new Head came down to Han, Qi'ra, and Rebolt. Before Proxima could make her decision, Han revealed that Qi'ra had rejected the chance to take on a job that would allow her to travel around the galaxy out of loyalty to Proxima, which ultimately won her the position."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
