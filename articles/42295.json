It was designed to be carried and operated by two soldiers, and had a set-up time of fifteen minutes. It was possible to carry the weapon with the tripod attached, but it was not a recommended maneuver. Power for the weapon came from an Eksoan Class-4T3 power generator with a Gk3 Cryocooler, while targeting fire control was provided by Starvision and IR for operation at night and in adverse environmental conditions. Built in communications allowed the crew of the E-Web to communicate with other E-Web units in case central communications was disrupted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
