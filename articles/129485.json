The fish had and gray, pink, and white scales covering their bodies and four tendril like appendages protruding from each corner of its mouth. The species possessed a pair of fins extending from below their two gill slits, one large dorsal fin and one small one, one rear ventral fin, and a tail fin. The Jedi Master Luke Skywalker caught spetan channelfish for food, and in the year 34 ABY, he captured a channelfish while the scavenger Rey watched, using spearfishing techniques he had learned on the planet Lew'el and striking it on its left side between its eye and its gills.
