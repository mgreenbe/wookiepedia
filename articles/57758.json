They were consumable by Twi'leks and Artiodacs and were considered savory. For some time, Gruuvan Shaal Kebabs were banned from Takodana Castle on the planet Takodana because of the kebab sticks' usability as a weapon. However, Maz Kanata, owner of the castle, eventually decided to allow her chef, Strono Tuggs, to serve them once again. Once he was so permitted, he brought out his skewers and began grilling them once more."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point after the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY, Tuggs published a recipe for the kebabs in his cookbook The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook. In the book, he noted that they were a classic Twi'lek dish and shared the story of their temporary ban at Takodana Castle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gruuvan Shaal Kebabs were first mentioned in the 2019 recipe book Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, which was authored by Chelsea Monroe-Cassel and Marc Sumerak.
