The survivors of the attack, known as the G'rho Underground had twice tried to infiltrate the dome and destroy it; however, on both these occasions, the weapons carried by the infiltrators were detected by the Ssi-ruuk equipment and the infiltrators were subsequently captured. On a third attempt, Trig Kilwallen successfully infiltrated the dome carrying no weapons.
