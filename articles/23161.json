A simple Fence built in the shape of a large oblong tube, swoopchasers raced through a dimly lit recreation of a cantina with tables, stools, and bar fixtures fixed to the walls. The tube rotated, and the effect threw off the rider's spatial awareness or made them suffer from vertigo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
