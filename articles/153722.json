The card's text did not mention the specific Lamproid, instead describing and giving card game statistics for all members of the Lamproid species. A picture on the card did depict the Lamproid as being present aboard the Khetanna at some point, however, establishing the Lamproid as a unique canonical character. The Khetanna's voyage was depicted in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, but the Lamproid was not in the film. Its image on the card was based on a production shot of the Lamproid Dice Ibegon from the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
