In a vain effort to help the esteemed Senator, Anakin Skywalker launched an assault on the Christophsis blockade with two other Venator-class ships and three supply ships. However, the Republic forces were severely outnumbered, and a direct order from the newly arrived General Obi-Wan Kenobi resulted in the retreat of the Resolute and its battle group to a safe position behind the moon of the planet. Anakin then flew over to Kenobi's flagship, the Negotiator, where he was given orders to sneak past the blockade in a prototype stealth ship and deliver supplies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after, Skywalker successfully destroyed Admiral Trench, commander of the blockade, and Kenobi resumed the assault on the disorganized blockade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Christophsis, the Resolute was tasked with delivering Ahsoka Tano in a Republic attack shuttle safely to General Anakin Skywalker.

They departed the Resolute and took the Twilight in search for any survivors of Plo Koon's fleet. After rescuing Plo Koon, Commander Wolffe, Sergeant Sinker and Boost, the only survivors of the battle, they discovered the enormous Malevolence, under the command of General Grievous, and narrowly escaped a wave from its ion cannons and returned to the Resolute."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin then planned to use a strike force of BTL-B Y-wing starfighters on a counterattack on the massive vessel, which was planning to attack an Outer Rim medical center tending over 50,000 wounded clones. Anakin, Ahsoka and Plo Koon, along with Shadow Squadron, departed the Resolute and took a shortcut through the Kaliida Nebula, where they encountered Neebray mantas. The Malevolence then arrived, and after losing almost half their squadron, Ahsoka managed to convince Anakin to change the plan, and he finally changed the target from the bridge of the Malevolence to its ion cannons. When the ship attempted to use its damaged ion cannons on the medical center, they exploded and caused further damage to the ship. The Resolute, the Negotiator and another Venator-class Star Destroyer then arrived in the system and started to attack the Malevolence.\nAfter Grievous captured Padm\u00e9 Amidala aboard the ship, Anakin and Obi-Wan went to rescue her.

When Cody and Rex arrived for a scheduled inspection, they were attacked by the droids, but managed to destroy the station and alert the Republic with the help of Fives, Echo and Hevy, the survivors of the first attack that took most of the clones' lives.

The two Jedi were unsuccessful in locating a hidden Artoo aboard a scavenger ship, unaware that Artoo had already been promised to Grievous by Gha Nachkt. Ahsoka and Rex then left to rescue Anakin, who had been scouting ahead when his tracking beacon was accidentally activated and alerted several Munificent-class frigates to his position.

The Resolute, under command of Ahsoka, then arrived to reinforce them. However, Dooku escaped and the two Jedi followed him, but both the Jedi and Dooku crash-landed on Vanqor. Dooku was taken captive by pirates and taken to Florrum, while Ahsoka arrived to rescue Obi-Wan and Anakin. From the Resolute, Anakin and Obi-Wan were dispatched by the Jedi Council to confirm that the pirates were holding Dooku captive so a deal could be struck between the Republic and the pirates.

The Resolute arrived in time to launch three LAAT/i gunships to board Secura's flagship, the Liberty, and extract all Republic personnel. Rocket droids took notice of the new arrivals and were distracted enough to break off and intercept them. However, the tactical droid commander, already impatient, commanded the ships to destroy the cruiser. A Consular-class frigate arrived for the evacuation, but a raging inferno rushed through the ship, and Anakin sacrificed himself, using The Force to hold back the fire, but was still severely injured. Ahsoka and Aayla managed to get him aboard the frigate, but as it started to dock to the Resolute, its hyperdrive was accidentally activated from an assault by Vulture droids. Fortunately, the Resolute managed to maneuver out of the way and avoided being taken into hyperspace with the frigate. Yularen ordered his men to finish the battle before plotting a course to search for the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ahsoka, Aayla and Anakin later avoided hitting a star, but crash-landed on Maridun. They were able to find medical help for Anakin from the planet's inhabitants, and were also able to thwart the development of a new Separatist weapon.

Ahsoka led a squadron for the first time, leading Blue Squadron (Galactic Republic) as Blue Leader. After she cut a path to the lead ship, Separatist reinforcements arrived, but Ahsoka disobeyed a direct order from both Admiral Yularen and Anakin to retreat. The Resolute was then pummeled by suicidal Vulture droids, which were too numerous for the gunners to shoot down, and one droid rammed itself into the bridge, severely injuring Admiral Yularen. Ahsoka then retreated, but lost half her battle group along the way. The Resolute and Defender retreated to hyperspace, but the Redeemer was destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After consoling his Padawan, Anakin then devised a plan to ram the Defender into the lead ship, leaving only outmaneuver-able droids in charge of the blockade. All of the Defender's supplies, starfighters, and shuttles were transferred to the Resolute, and Anakin proceeded to take the Defender back to Ryloth with R2-D2 aboard. Ahsoka, made more confident from the support of Admiral Yularen, planned to angle the Resolute so that its hull would face toward the blockade and act as a screen for the fighters to launch and destroy the blockade. After Anakin succeeded in crashing the Defender into the lead control ship, the Resolute emerged from hyperspace and maneuvered according to the plan. Ahsoka then led a squadron of Y-wing fighters and V-19 Torrents, and she was able to successfully eliminate the Separatist blockade.

While Bane attempted to escape, the Resolute attacked Bane's frigate. In an attempt to save Ropal and reclaim the holocron, Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano and Captain Rex led a number of clones and three AT-TEs in an assault on the ship.\nAt the conclusion of the battle, Cad Bane killed clone trooper Denal and hid on the Resolute after the Jedi's escape.

The Resolute provided supporting fire until the enemy ships were eliminated. Admiral Yularen was forced to wait in orbit while General Kenobi led a hunt for Grievous on the planet's surface.

After a diplomatic error by Padawan Ahsoka Tano forced the Bothans to declare their neutrality, this ship escorted several Jedi and a fleet of smaller ships to the world of Taloraan. The planet's tibanna mines were of the utmost importance to the war effort. Once in orbit, Admiral Yularen detected strong magnetic fields, which prevented communication. General Kenobi ordered the ship to maintain a safe distance while the Jedi were negotiating down on Taloraan City."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the negotiations were a ruse propagated by Magister Orlin Denache, who was working with Count Dooku and the Separatist Alliance. In fact, droid forces had landed in Taloraan City, and a Munificent-class frigate was hiding in the clouds. The Jedi discovered the treachery when their shuttle was destroyed and they were captured. Having subsequently been freed by Sech Govlinder, the Jedi warned the Resolute moments before it was drawn into the trap. The ship descended into the atmosphere and fired on the hidden Munificent, taking down the frigate's rear shields and destroying its engines, dooming the ship to descend to the planet's core. With their situation untenable, the remaining Separatists were routed and the treaty was signed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Destruction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Sullust the Resolute was attacked by tri-fighters led by Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress. Ventress ordered half of her fighters to disable the port side shield generators of the already weakened cruiser, while she went for the bridge. She maneuvered through the hail of defensive blaster fire and, once the port side shield generators were destroyed, she flew in between the cruiser's two bridges and poured laser fire into them. The entire cruiser was engulfed in flames, though Admiral Yularen and the majority of the crew managed to escape. With the loss of the Resolute, Anakin transferred his command to another cruiser."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There has been much confusion to the Resolute's first appearance in the 2008 Star Wars: The Clone Wars film novelization, which stated that it was present for the Battle of Christophsis under Admiral Yularen's command.
