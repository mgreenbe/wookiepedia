As Wraith Squadron had a limited number of pilots qualified in TIE fighters, Atril's experience in that regard meant that she was used as a pilot as well as a bridge officer. When Captain Choday Hrakness was killed in the Battle of Talasea, Tabanne took command of the Night Caller and was promoted to Captain. She temporarily relinquished command to Wedge Antilles during the Battle of Ession, in which she led Wraith Squadron's TIE fighter contingent in his place, but resumed command afterward."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
