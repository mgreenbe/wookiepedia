Additionally, splox had appendages located below their eyes, and their orange bodies were covered in blue shells with pointed ends. When attacked, splox could contort their shape to quickly stagger their enemies, providing time for other splox to strike."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An omnivorous species, splox usually lived in packs, and although non-sentient, they were known to coordinate attacks to overwhelm their prey.
