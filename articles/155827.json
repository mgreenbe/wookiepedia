They were three-engined starfighters with a laser cannon and the capacity to carry space mines. The craft's single pilot had access to life support and communication systems, as well as hyperdrives. Duum utilized them to lay hundreds of thousands of mines in the prelude to his downfall. The Jedi Knight Aayla Secura stole a bomber on two different occasions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These bombers were armed with a single laser cannon and could carry space mines. The bows sloped downwards from the cockpits. The laser cannon was on top in a turret. One large engine was in the center of the craft with two smaller ones at the side, with the wings extending outward from the smaller engines. Two vertical stabilizers were at the stern of the ships. The cockpits were pressurized and included communication systems, and the bombers included hyperdrive engines."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars in 21 BBY, Attuma Duum's chief of security, Sabat, used at least two to travel with an armed gang to the surface of the moon Cavamina Minor after the Jedi Knight Aayla Secura was shot down. With the help of the rogue Jedi Shon-Ju, Secura fought off the mercenaries and stole a bomber to board Attuma Duum's headquarters and confront the war profiteer himself while a battle raged around them. Four of these bombers were used to lay 600,000 space mines prior to the battle. After confronting Duum, Secura stole another bomber to escape the exploding base, utilizing the craft's hyperdrive to return to Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These bombers appeared in 2010's The Clone Wars: Deadly Hands of Shon-Ju but were not given a designation.
