It depicted a regular stormtrooper, a scout trooper, and a cold assault stormtrooper adopting idealized, hieratic poses against a white background with the Imperial crest in the background, as well as the words \"Your Emperor commands you: Expose - Pursue - Destroy - Those who would resist us\" in red colored font (and in the case of the final words, black-colored font on a red banner) belonging to the High Galactic Alphabet. The poster was fittingly included within the section dedicated to the Stormtrooper Corps in the Imperial Handbook: A Commander's Guide, encompassing an entire page with the footnote stating that the members of the Stormtrooper Corps that were under the Imperial commander's command lived by the words stated on the poster and demands that the commander do the same."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The propaganda poster would later appear in the canon sourcebook Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy.
