Led by Alliance operative Nien Nunb, the cell became an increasing threat to the Galactic Empire on Sullust. When Nunb rallied them and the Cobalt Laborers' Reformation Front during the Siege of Inyusu Tor, they managed to take over Sullust's Capital City, Pinyumb."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Led by Nien Nunb, the Sullustan resistance formed when operatives from the Alliance to Restore the Republic, including Corjentain Malaqua, came to Sullust. They intended to support the Cobalt Laborers' Reformation Front, who were becoming increasingly anti-Imperial. However, the cell soon found out that its militant members had been imprisoned and the rest were too afraid to fight. The Sullustan resistance therefore got by through helping the citizens of Sullust's capital, Pinyumb, to win their support."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 3 ABY, Imperial Intelligence had tied Nunb, Malaqua and the Alliance operative Sian Tevv to Sullust itself. Shortly after, a Sullustan resistance operative sabotaged machinery in the Inyusu Tor mineral processing facility. An Imperial crackdown ensued in Pinyumb to find the culprit, which was ultimately unsuccessful. Soon after, the Imperial Security Bureau sent a squad of Imperial stormtroopers to board the VCX-150 freighter Keepsake in the Pinyumb spaceport. They apprehended a Chadra-Fan operative from the Sullustan resistance, who set off a detonator as his last resort. The explosion resulted in the deaths of the Chadra-Fan and a few stormtroopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that year, the Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry became stranded on Sullust after capturing the Inyusu Tor facility. Captain Hazram Namir, the man in charge of the company, went to Pinyumb to find them for help. However he and his men were ambushed by stormtroopers at a Sullustan resistance safe house, resulting in his capture. Luckily for Namir, Nunb ambushed them rescued him. He took Namir to a mining hangar where they met Malaqua and the other two members of the Sullustan resistance. Although they were not able to help Namir save his troops at facility, being only four fighters strong, the man devised a plan that involved the Sullustan resistance to rally the Cobalt Laborers' and take Pinyumb while the 61st faced the majority of the Imperial garrison at the top of Inyusu Tor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the 61st fought the Imperial forces, they used the facility's magma extractors and tunneling equipment to channel a flow of lava down the mountain. At the same time, the Sullustan resistance had been using their tunneling equipment to channel that lava towards the Imperial garrison headquarters at Pinyumb. With most of the Imperial forces at Pinyumb now burning in lava, an uprising kick-started in Pinyumb. The 61st were able to defeat the rest of the garrison and hold the facility. By that time, Pinyumb had been liberated from the Empire, inspiring more uprisings around the planet. The Sullustan resistance and Cobalt Laborers' established an interim government to govern Pinyumb and make a plan for when the Empire would inevitably return."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sullustan resistance first appeared in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
