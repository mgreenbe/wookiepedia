It then cuts to a Republic Gunship carrying General Kenobi, Commander Cody and other clones with two V-19 Torrent starfighters approaching a planet. Obi-Wan explains that he had received orders from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to guard this planet friendly to the Republic.\nOnce the LAAT/i enters the atmosphere, they find Separatist forces waiting for them on the ground, and are attacked by two Droid Gunships. The LAAT/i manages to shoot one down, while Kenobi jumps from the Republic Gunship and destroys the other with his lightsaber. Once the LAAt/i has landed, all of the clones except Cody are in the air, due to Ventress' Force Grip. Ventress then flees the area with Kenobi following her on a speeder. The two then have a lightsaber duel, until Kenobi falls and Ventress comes forward to attack, then \"To Be Continued!\" flashes up, and cuts to a scene where two clones (one of them Cody) and two battle droids are playing cards discussing how the duel might be going. A droid says that \"someone will probably lose a hand\", with a clone replying, \"that does seem to happen a lot\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
