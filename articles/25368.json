Several crane walkers tower over the field while prisoners work on disassembling starships. A New Republic security droid walks up to Migs Mayfeld (designated as inmate 34667) who is working on dismantling a TIE line starfighter. The droid tells him he has been given new instructions, at which point Marshal of the New Republic Carasynthia Dune rounds the corner, remanding the prisoner into her custody.

The inmate complies after the security droid threatens him with its stun baton."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A confused Mayfeld follows Dune, asking where she is taking him. She leads him to the parked Slave I where he is greeted by Boba Fett and Fennec Shand. Mayfeld is relieved, having initially mistaken Fett for the Mandalorian Din Djarin. However, his elation is short-lived as Djarin descends down the ramp shortly after Fett. Mayfeld asks Djarin if he has come to kill him. Dune replies for him, stating that all he needs to know is that she bent a lot of rules to bring him along. When Mayfeld asks why he is so lucky, Dune says that it is because he is ex-Imperial. Mayfeld becomes defensive, assuming they are angry with him for having served the enemy. Djarin ignores his remarks and asks to confirm he still knows his Imperial clearances and protocols. Djarin and his crew turn around and reboard Fett's ship. Seeing Dune and her companions as his only ticket offworld, the prisoner decides to accompany them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once seated in the passenger compartment of the Slave I, Djarin tells Mayfeld that they need coordinates for Moff Gideon's light cruiser. Mayfeld thinks that is too difficult and asks to be taken back to the scrapyard. Dune explains that the Moff has his \"kid.\" Mayfeld asks if she means the \"little green guy\" and Dune confirms this. Mayfeld asks if helping them will get him released. Dune, unamused, shoots the idea down and says he only gets a better view. Mayfeld reluctantly agrees to help but says he cannot get the coordinates without access to an internal Imperial terminal, saying he thinks there is one on the planet Morak.  Djarin does not believe anything is on the planet; Mayfeld explains there is a secret Imperial mining hub. Mayfeld promises to get the coordinates if they can get him inside.

Going off this, Fett postulates they are refining rhydonium, which he describes as highly volatile and explosive. He continues his debrief, revealing the facility is armed with anti-aircraft cannons, to which Shand adds it is protected by a platoon of security forces as well.

Mayfeld says it should be a quick job once inside, adding we will need to escape the base as soon as he gets the coordinates. Fett tells Mayfeld he can perform an aerial extraction from the roof. Dune assumes she and Mayfeld can easily infiltrate the refinery by hijacking a transport and swapping places with the drivers in a nearby tunnel. Mayfeld points out a major flaw in her plan: Remnant bases like this are set up and run by ex-Imperial Security Bureau agents, meaning whoever goes in might get scanned. The system flags anyone who shows up on a New Republic register. If that were to happen the mission would instantly be compromised, the remnant would learn of their presence, and they would be killed. Mayfeld's extensive knowledge about Imperial remnants makes raises Dune suspicions, leading her to openly question him, hinting he might still be loyal to the fallen Empire. Mayfeld insists he is hiding nothing. Djarin reminds them they do not have time for arguments and proposes Shand goes in Dune's place. Shand reveals she cannot as she is wanted by the ISB.

Mayfeld dismisses the idea, saying it would be too hard to explain away a guy in Mandalorian armor to the Imperial guards. He goes on, telling Djarin his only options are to take off his helmet, trust him to complete the mission alone, or say good bye to his \"little green friend.\" Djarin responds that he will be joining Mayfeld, but his face will still remain hidden."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Hijacking a juggernaut"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the road, the first pilot of Juggernaut Five tells the Morak refinery that they are entering tunnel T-12.
