The carving was an important part of the Ewoks' Fishing Festival. In 3 ABY, the Ewok Wicket Wystri Warrick accidentally lost the prow carving in a river. The Duloks of a rival tribe found it and mounted it on their battleship to give them luck as they attempted to pillage the Ewok celebration and plunder all their fish. Warrick and three friends\u2014Latara, Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka, and Teebo\u2014recovered the prow carving from the Duloks only to lose it again. However, Chief Chirpa, leader of their tribe, revealed that another had been made to replace it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
