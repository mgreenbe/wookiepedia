In 22 BBY, Emir Wat Tambor of the Techno Union invaded the planet Ryloth, and Ponds assisted Windu in invading the planet to secure its liberation.

After bringing down the Endurance on Vanqor, Fett and his crew of mercenaries\u2014Aurra Sing, Bossk, and Castas\u2014took Ponds, Admiral Shoan Kilian, and a clone naval officer hostage to bait Windu into a confrontation.

In 22 BBY, Ponds was part of the 200,000 clone troopers whom Jedi Grand Master Yoda gathered from Kamino for a strike force bound for Geonosis, where the Republic was launching a campaign to rescue several captives\u2014Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala\u2014who had been marked for execution by the newly formed Confederacy of Independent Systems.

After Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano eliminated the Confederate blockade surrounding the planet, Ponds accompanied General Windu aboard an Acclamator-class assault ship. Windu's invasion force, consisting of three Acclamator transports, prepared to land in the city of Nabat, but they were attacked by Confederate proton cannons stationed below in the city. Ponds informed Mace Windu that the cannons had penetrated the transports' shields, and as he spoke, one of the transports was destroyed. Windu instructed High Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi to destroy the cannons and allow their transports to land in Nabat. Kenobi was able to eliminate the cannons, and the two remaining transports were able to land. The ground forces were deployed, and soon headed to Ryloth's capital of Lessu to retake it and free the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "En route to Lessu, Ponds accompanied Windu and led the GAR unit Lightning Squadron, as well as, several AT-TE walkers. Along a cliff-side path, the forces were attacked by several Confederate Armored Assault Tanks, which sought to trap the Republic forces on the cliff, and incapacitated the front walkers before targeting those at the rear. Windu and Ponds led an attack with Lightning Squadron and several AT-RT walkers on the tanks. Although the tanks were defeated, the ambush had taken the lives of thirty-two of their men, along with three AT-TE command crews.

Suddenly, several Confederate Hyena-class bombers appeared and swooped down on the village, dropping bombs and destroying the village in a matter of seconds. A shocked Ponds reported this to Windu, and the increasing losses of lives convinced Syndulla to reopen negotiations with his political rival, Senator Taa. Syndulla resolved his issues with Taa, and decided to join Windu and his forces. The group devised a plan to enter Lessu; however, the only solution would be to activate the city's plasma bridge, as it was the only access to Lessu, and the bridge's controls were inside the city itself. To infiltrate the city, Windu decided to sneak onto one of two Confederate Multi-Troop Transports carrying stolen treasure for Emir Tambor. However, they would only have a short amount of time before being discovered, and Ponds and Syndulla needed to give Windu as much time as possible to get across."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Accompanied by Razor and Stak, Windu sneaked onto one of the MTTs.

Razor and Stak managed to activate the bridge, and, after the Republic forces crossed and entered the city, Windu cornered Tambor. Four Hyena bombers prepared to destroy the city under orders from Confederate Head of State and Sith Lord Count Dooku, but the timely intervention of General Skywalker and Commander Tano in their fighters thwarted the attempt.
