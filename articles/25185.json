He transmitted an ultimatum to Ambassador Furgan, threatening to destroy the solar system if they didn't provide information about Zeth. Desiring the Sun Crusher himself, Furgan ordered a group of TIE/LN starfighters to attack Kyp, who had been distracted by a falsified story about the death of his brother. He destroyed most of them and responded by firing a resonance torpedo into Carida's sun, Caridan. Furgan ordered the evacuation of Carida with the limited transports available, giving priority on the basis of rank. He escaped aboard the Vendetta, bound for Anoth. Dauren, a lowly lieutenant, knew he had little chance of escaping and located Zeth. He told Kyp, who swooped down to save them, but Dauren stabbed Zeth with a plastisteel fragment. Before Kyp could save his brother, the sun went supernova, destroying the planet. Kyp was driven further to the dark side by his despair at having killed his brother."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The disturbance in the Force caused by the destruction was felt by Leia Organa Solo and the Jedi students at the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4.

However, he was distracted by the Sun Crusher and pursued after it, but both craft were sucked into a black hole. Kyp had been piloting the Sun Crusher and escaped in a message pod, which Han saved using the Falcon's tractor beam, just before it was sucked down as well.
