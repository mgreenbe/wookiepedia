Teller and his rebel cell were secretly aided by Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit, who shared Teller's antipathy towards Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, who was in charge of the Empire's secret Death Star project. Teller and his cell stole Tarkin's personal starship Carrion Spike which they used to attack several Imperial facilities across the galaxy. Tarkin teamed up with Darth Vader to stop the insurgents, exposing Vice Admiral Rancit's collusion with Teller's cell. After exposing and executing Teller, Tarkin defeated the insurgents during the a battle near the Gulf of Tatooine. With the defeat of Teller's insurgents, Tarkin was promoted to Grand Moff and Governor of the Outer Rim Territories.

He helped train and organize Gotal and Koorivar loyalist partisans who mounted an insurgency against the Separatist forces stationed on Antar 4. Following the establishment of the Galactic Empire, Imperial forces under Wilhuff Tarkin launched a violent purge known as the Antar Atrocity which saw the arrest and killings of many Koorivar and Gotal loyalists. Media coverage of the Antar Atrocity triggered widespread public outrage throughout the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In response to public outrage, Emperor Palpatine reassigned Tarkin to overseeing pacification operations in the Western Reaches. Rising to the position of Moff, Tarkin later became the commander of Desolation Station and Sentinel Base, the bases servicing the top-secret Death Star project. Tarkin replaced Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit, who was reassigned as Deputy Director to the Naval Intelligence Agency, a subdivision of Imperial Intelligence. Teller perceived his reassignment as a demotion and resented Tarkin's position in the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tarkin's central role in the Antar Atrocity sparked some of the earliest resistance against the Empire. Outraged by the brutality of the Antar Atrocity, Berch Teller formed a rebel cell.

Sharing a resentment for Tarkin, the two men decided to work together."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY, Teller and his group embarked in an insurgent campaign against Tarkin. Their plan involved stealing the Moff's personal starship Carrion Spike, which was fitted with an advanced hyperdrive and stealth technology that allowed it to travel throughout the galaxy undetected. Teller's cell intended to use the Carrion Spike, a symbol of Imperial power, against the Empire by targeting Imperial facilities along the Perlemian Trade Route and disrupting convoys transporting material to the Death Star project. Seeking to advance his own position in the Imperial hierarchy at Tarkin's expense, Rancit used his intelligence and underworld connections to supply the dissidents with proscribed armaments, communications jammers, and confiscated Separatist materiel including droid starfighters and a modified Providence-class Dreadnought; which was assembled by the Tenloss and Crymorah syndicates at shipyards in the Bajic sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Baiting Tarkin"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Equipped with Separatist weaponry and communications equipment, the dissidents tried to use a fake holotransmission claiming that Rampart Station was under attack in an attempt to lure Moff Tarkin and his forces away from Sentinel Base on the desolate Sentinel moon.

The communications cache had purportedly been found by the Koorivar ISB asset Bracchia and his ISB case officer Stellan. In truth, Vice Admiral Rancit had deliberately leaked intelligence about the communications cache to Military Intelligence, who passed them on to the ISB.

As a result, Tarkin realized that the dissidents had intended to draw them into a trap.

To throw the Imperials off-scent, Teller got the broker Knotts to sell a shipping job to the crew of the YT-1000 freighter Reticent. In response, Tarkin assembled various Imperial warships including the Star Destroyer Executrix and three Interdictor vessels\u2014a Detainer CC-2200, a CC-7700 frigate, and a prototype Immobilizer 418 cruiser\u2014to interdict the stolen ship. Instead, the Immobilizer's gravity well projectors malfunctioned, yanking out the Reticent and several civilian transports including the MC80 Star Cruiser Stellar Vista. The Stellar Vista collided with the Detainer CC-2200, killing 1,100 civilians.

Despite failing to capture the Carrion Spike, the Imperials managed to destroy the Lux-400 yacht Truant, which was wanted for smuggling. In addition, Imperial forces also seized the Reticent and interrogated its crew including its Koorivar captain. Under interrogation, the captain admitted buying the freighter from Knotts, who also instructed him to travel to the Obroa-skai system. After questioning the captain's Sy Myrthian navigator, Vader learnt that the Sugi smuggler Faazah had obtained a supply of custom fuel cells prior to Tarkin and Vader's visit to Murkhana. Tarkin also investigated the dissidents and learnt that several members including Teller, Anora, Hask, and Knotts had been present on Antar 4 during the Antar Atrocity.
