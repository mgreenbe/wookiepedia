It was a smoothbore weapon that uses an electromagnetic mass-driver system to launch large-caliber shells over long distances. The Model 201 was the weapon of choice for foes behind heavy cover as it fired in an arc rather than a direct line."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The weapon was made up of three parts, the launcher, the ammunition magazine and a heavy bipod. The Model 201 was used by the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, where it was carried by specialized teams of three clone artillery troopers, each of whom carried one part of the weapon. An efficient mortar team could keep up a rapid rate of fire in the field."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Model 201 mortar system was mentioned in Rise of the Separatists, a roleplaying supplementary sourcebook for the Star Wars Roleplaying series that was published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
