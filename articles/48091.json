Jedi Master Oppo Rancisis was on the bridge of the command ship where his use of battle meditation would be most effective, while Saesee Tiin prepared to command the two Jedi fighter groups, Red and Blue Squadrons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mace Windu, Adi Gallia, and Eeth Koth also accompanied the force.

The password was soon supplied by Stark himself, who arrived with two of his co-directors\u2014both of whom (Boor-Daa and Tam Gozon) he killed in front of the Jedi. Having telepathically received from Jedi Knight Plo Koon a promise of amnesty with his cooperation, Stark (having already realized his cause was a lost one) supplied the password and then helped the two Jedi pacify the command center."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Overhead, Tholme and Vos transmitted the patch to the Trade Federation fleet, with Vos additionally reversing the controls of the shield generators of the Raptor, setting them instead to lower when ordered to raise. The Jedi then fought their way off the ship on one of its fighters as the Jedi force arrived en masse in the Qotile system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At Mount Avos, the Republic force retreated out a back entrance of the mine while the Combine forces swarmed in from the front. Koon planned to seal both entrances once the Republic soldiers had evacuated, thus trapping the Combine soldiers harmlessly inside the mine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The plan failed however when, determined to kill off both the Jedi who had stolen his glory and the enemy he had been unable to vanquish, General Ranulph Tarkin stole the last detonator charge and used it to open the challat eater cave to a devouring of all forces within the caves, killing himself in the blast while securing for himself a self-styled immortality as the \"Hero of Troiken\"\u2014the man who indeed destroyed the Stark Combine and won the war in one fell swoop of self-sacrifice. Koon managed to escape just in time, using the Force to seal the mine, unfortunately trapping the majority of the Combine soldiers inside the insect-infested mine, where they were eaten alive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Raptor was destroyed overhead, the few surviving ground forces of the Combine surrendered, ending both the battle and the Stark Hyperspace War.
