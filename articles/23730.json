He joined the Republic's Judicial Forces at the age of seventeen before serving in the Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. With the advent of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's ascension to Emperor and the installment of the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, Rieekan immediately rejected the new regime. Instead, he chose to serve the Royal House of Alderaan as a civilian tactician, before becoming one of the founding members of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, a rebellion against the rule of the Emperor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Imperial Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin brought the Death Star superweapon to bear on Alderaan, Rieekan was at nearby Delaya. He received a massive influx of distress calls and requests for evacuation, but hesitated to aid Alderaan, as he felt that his involvement would have implicated Alderaan at large as having ties to the illegal rebellion movement. Within minutes, Tarkin's battlestation fired its superlaser, destroying Alderaan in flash. Rieekan was shattered, and blamed himself for the disaster, as he felt his hesitation had cost many Alderaanians their lives. The incident took its toll on Rieekan, as he became an overly morose and paranoid man."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He was later tasked with command of the Alliance's Echo Base on Hoth, and also worked closely with the pilot Luke Skywalker's Rogue Squadron unit. Over the years, Rieekan collaborated with the Alderaanian princess, Leia Organa, and his insistence on thorough security and evacuation measures after the destruction of his homeworld proved instrumental to the Alliance when Lord Darth Vader's Death Squadron moved against Echo Base. Rieekan later oversaw Haven Base on Arbra, and would go on to serve as Minister of State and Director of Intelligence for the New Republic, the Alliance's successor state. The general eventually retired, only to be brought back into service during the Yuuzhan Vong War, during which he aided in the failed defense of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early career"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Carlist Rieekan grew up on the peaceful world of Alderaan and left at the age of seventeen to join the Galactic Republic's Judicial Forces, which was an unusual choice for an Alderaanian. Demonstrating strong leadership skills, Rieekan quickly rose through the ranks and joined the Officer Candidate School. There, he befriended other idealists such as Jan Dodonna, Adar Tallon, and Crix Madine. He later came to serve in the Army of the Republic, where his keen grasp of tactics and, once again, his leadership skills impressed his superiors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Supreme Chancellor Palpatine declared himself Emperor in 19 BBY and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire, Rieekan chose to stick to his beliefs and refused to serve the new regime. He instead served the Royal House of Alderaan as a civilian tactician, and then helped found the Alliance to Restore the Republic, an organization dedicated to throwing off Palpatine's hold on the galaxy. In his new role, Rieekan found himself once again amongst like-minded individuals, many of them hailing from Alderaan."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The destruction of Alderaan"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rieekan found himself surprised that the Royal House of Organa, rulers of his home planet and vocal pacifists, were themselves allied with the Alliance. He was pleased to find out that Viceroy Bail Organa and his daughter, Princess Leia Organa, were actually members of the Rebellion. Rieekan felt the need to keep his connection to the Alliance secret, but was subsequently placed in charge of covert operations in the Alderaan system. In 0 BBY, he found himself personally inspecting a new satellite transmission station that was in orbit over Delaya, a sister planet of Alderaan. During his inspection tour, the Empire's new superweapon, the Death Star, entered the system, causing mass panic on Rieekan's homeworld. He was hard-pressed to keep up with the flood of incoming calls, requesting evacuation and aid, but there was no weapon capable of disabling or halting the superweapon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Furthermore, Rieekan felt that a mass evacuation would show the Empire that the people of Alderaan were aware of the Death Star's ability to destroy entire planets. With that in mind, Rieekan decided to sit tight and hope that the Death Star's presence was just a bluff. Within minutes, however, the Death Star's superlaser was activated and fired at Alderaan, completely obliterating the planet. Thrown into a state of despair and guilt, Rieekan resolved to never underestimate just how far the Galactic Empire would go again. Since there was little he physically could do, Rieekan blamed himself for the catastrophe. Some time after the incident, Rieekan was promoted to the rank of General."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "General"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the destruction of the Death Star at the Battle of Yavin, Rieekan began assisting various refugee movements across the Alderaan sector, bringing them to Delaya. The general specifically operated in the capital city of Leilani, and was assisted by a young man named Kiro Chen, who hoped to join the Alliance. The planet itself had began to suffer\u2014as the Alderaanians had decided to move all of their industry off their home planet and onto Delaya itself, the planet's income stemmed primarily from exports to Alderaan itself. Compounding the problem was the fact that new factories had been built recently, which worried the General. Prime Minister Gresh Manaa and his deputy, Var Lyonn had sworn to aid Rieekan's refugee efforts, but there were groups amongst the planet's inhabitants that believed in keeping Delaya's resources for the Delayans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rieekan later requested that Princess Leia Organa join him to help sway the refugees towards the cause of the Alliance. He himself had been called for an operation in the Orus sector. When the princess did arrive, she did so with an entourage that included her friends Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. The general personally picked Organa up from the spaceport, and later talked with her privately in his landspeeder, while her retinue traveled in another vehicle. Rieekan aired his suspicions to his fellow Alderaanian\u2014Manaa's men had been continually following him, closely observing his interactions with the refugees. They then arrived at the Delayan Whisperpines Hotel\u2014opulent accommodation imposed on Organa by the government, and Rieekan opened up to the Princess over his regret that he was unable to act when their homeworld was destroyed. Organa assured him that he was not to blame in any way, shape or form, and reminded him that had he indeed been able to act, he would have likely revealed ties between Alderaan and the Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Outside the hotel, Rieekan and Organa were met by Chen, who enthusiastically welcomed and applauded the princess. As Rieekan informed them that he was to depart for the Oren sector, he spoke privately with Organa once again as she offered him more words of encouragement. He advised her to be wary of Manaa, but also to watch out for Lyonn, who was the real power-broker on Delaya. Rieekan then returned to the spaceport, and departed. His suspicions were later proved to be well founded, when Lyonn had Organa kidnapped. The princess was rescued by Skywalker, Solo, and Solo's first mate Chewbacca, as well as the ex-Jedi Padawan Ferus Olin, and Alliance operative Tobin Elad. It was later discovered that Elad was in fact X-7\u2014an Imperial agent tasked with assassinating Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, a prisoner of the Alliance, Div, was kidnapped from his Yavin 4. Skywalker attempted to rescue him, but was apparently spirited away by the kidnappers as well. Organa approached Rieekan, insisting that they rescue Skywalker, but the general could not advocate a fool's errand. The princess took umbrage at this, but Rieekan claimed that he meant no insult. Skywalker and Div were later recovered by Olin. Rieekan later met with Olin and several other members of the Alliance, among them Yavin base commander Jan Dodonna, to discuss what the ex-Jedi knew. Olin had been observing the movements of Palpatine's enforcer, the Lord Darth Vader, and had determined that X-7, whose memories had been erased, was trying to determine his former identity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ex-Jedi proposed that the Alliance slice into computers that would be accessed by X-7, and plant false clues for the agent, hoping to convince him that he was in fact one of Olin's and Div's late friends, Trever Flume. Rieekan was skeptical that the Alliance would be able to field such an operation, but Olin ventured to do it himself, as he deemed that he was more than capable of the task. The operation was a success, and X-7 participated in an Alliance mission to Belazura. Rieekan assured Div that X-7's participation in the mission would go ahead as planned, and the operation was a success, resulting in the destruction of an Imperial garrison. During the mission, however, X-7 betrayed the Alliance and had to be killed by Olin."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Trouble in Shelsha"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 0 ABY, Rieekan had a variety of secret bases set up throughout the Empire, one of which served as a key Alliance military base following the evacuation of the Yavin 4 base. The general commanded the base, which eventually played host to Mon Mothma, leader of the Rebellion, herself. At the time, the Alliance was having trouble gaining a foothold in the Shelsha sector due to infighting amongst its member groups and other cultural issues. As a result, they had been forced to evacuate a listening post on Teardrop. Meanwhile, Mothma and Rieekan had been contacted by Yeeru Chivkyrie, leader of the Shelsha-based Alliance member group Republic Redux. Chivkyrie had a proposal that he believed would serve as a great benefit to the Alliance, although he would not clarify what it, not through the HoloNet or encrypted transmissions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "What Mothma and Rieekan did know was that Ydor Vokkoli, leader of Freedonna Kaisu and Thillis Slanni, leader of Shining Hope, both centralized in the Shelsha sector, were strongly opposed to Chivkyrie's idea. So strong was their dissatisfaction that they threatened to pull out of the Alliance, should Mothma agree to Chivkyrie's mystery plan. In addition, Republic Redux was the smallest of the three groups, preventing the Alliance from effectively complying with the Adarian Chivkyrie. He himself would not be allowed to convince the other leaders of his plan, as he was from the second-tier of Adarian society. The only way the other leaders could be convinced, Rieekan deduced, was if someone from a higher tier was sent to negotiate with them. The selected location was Chivkyrie's home, Makrin City, Shelkonwa, but the diplomats sent would meet with him in an uninhabited system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leia Organa was chosen to meet with the Adarian leaders, and Rieekan requested that Han Solo and Luke Skywalker join her\u2014since the mission was to be low-profile, the general ruled out the use of Alliance ships and what he deemed \"obvious Alliance personnel.\" While Skywalker was eager, Solo bristled at what he perceived to be Rieekan labeling him as someone not totally committed to the Alliance's cause. Nevertheless, he agreed to accompany the princess, after Mothma and Rieekan had sorted out the final details with the Adarian leaders. In spite of the fact that Solo was not completely respectful towards the general, Rieekan held him in high regard as a natural leader and a skilled fighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some stage afterwards, Rieekan was met with odd news: a shipment of Alliance weapons that was traveling, disguised, along a supply line through Drunost had been attacked by the BloodScar swoop gang, who were in turn fought off by a group of stormtroopers. In the aftermath, the stormtroopers had not searched the shipment, which had been disguised as farming equipment, nor had they questioned Porter, the Alliance agent supervising the shipment. Organa suspected that the Imperials might have tracked Porter afterwards to find out where his destination was, but Rieekan had received a report from Casement, another agent working on Drunost, stating that no one had tracked the supplies. Alliance agent Targeter also confirmed that no one had been tracking Porter. Nevertheless, Organa suggested shutting down the supply line, but due to the increased amounts of piratical activity in the Shelsha sector, Rieekan thought that opening a new line would be impossible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since the BloodScar group alone could not be responsible for the widespread criminal activity in Shelsha, Rieekan sought to investigate just what was going on amongst the fringe groups in the sector. Pulling Captain Solo from the Shelkonwa mission, he chose the Corellian to do the reconnaissance, and Organa suggested that Skywalker accompany him. While the Tatooinian balked at the prospect of not going with the princess of the Shelkonwa mission, he agreed to the plan. With that, the general set about retrieving names and places for the pair to investigate, before sending them to meet with Porter on Drunost. As it turned out, the two missions were interconnected: the pirates had been working for Governor Barshnis Choard, who had been planning, for two years, to have the Shelsha sector secede from the Empire. The pirates were to take over key Imperial installations across the sector when the opportunity arose."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, through his chief administrator, Vilim Disra, Choard had contacted Chivkyrie, claiming that Shelsha would join the Alliance if the Alliance would defend the sector against the inevitable Imperial reprisal after the secession. The plan did not come to fruition, though, as Disra reported Choard's treachery to Lord Darth Vader. As a result, Rieekan no longer had to deal with Chivkyrie's \"proposal,\" although the Alliance's position in Shelsha had not improved. Organa was briefly captured by the Empire, but was saved thanks to the efforts of Solo, Skywalker, and Chewbacca, as well as the Hand of Judgment\u2014a group of rogue stormtroopers who had been the ones defending Porter's shipment from the BloodScars."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Working with the Rogues"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "General Rieekan began to collaborate with Rogue Squadron, commanded by Luke Skywalker, shortly after the unit's foundation. One such early mission involved dispatching the squadron to Barkhesh, where an Alliance shuttle was to pick up supplies from the local resistance movement. The resistance's convoy, however, had to pass through Imperial forces, and so Rieekan had Rogue Squadron clear the way for them. The mission was a success, and the general was pleased, as the new supplies would help the Alliance recuperate after the loss of their base on Yavin. For their next mission, Rieekan dispatched Rogue Squadron to Chorax, where the Alliance transport Nonnah had crashed, carrying soldiers and stolen Imperial equipment. The general tasked the squadron with locating the downed ship. When they did, the general dispatched a shuttle to pick up the stranded crew\u2014however, the Rogues were met by Imperial resistance, and Rieekan soon received reports that the Nonnah itself was under attack. Nevertheless, the mission was a success, and those aboard the Nonnah were safely extracted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the rescue of the Nonnah crew, Rieekan was contacted by Crix Madine, who was now an officer within the Imperial Army. Madine wished to defect to the Alliance, and planned to meet with Rieekan in Coronet City, Corellia. Rieekan, along with Rogue Squadron, traveled to Coronet, where Rieekan met with city officials in the Coronet Capitol Tower. During the meeting, Coronet City fell under Imperial attack. The Rogues engaged the Imperial forces, and during the battle, they were contacted by Madine, who was hiding in the Tech Center. As Rogue Squadron defended the Tech Center, Han Solo and the Wookiee Chewbacca, friends of Skywalker, arrived in the freighter Millennium Falcon to aid in the defense of Coronet. Rieekan had a shuttle brought in to evacuate Madine, while another shuttle and the Falcon evacuated the Capital Tower. As soon as the two ships were away, Imperial bombers destroyed the capital building."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Madine offered his services to the Alliance, the general vouched for his old ally's credibility. It was Rieekan's input that convinced Mon Mothma that Madine was not a security risk. Shortly after his defection, Madine and Skywalker led Gold and Rogue Squadron respectively during the Liberation of Gerrard V. The Imperial governor was looting the planet, and its inhabitants yearned for independence. Rieekan tasked Rogue Squadron with escorting Madine's Y-wings as they attacked the yachts that were looting the cities. Although the mission succeeded as planned, the Alliance also gained defector Kasan Moor during the engagement, an elite TIE pilot who had served in the 128th TIE Interceptor Squadron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moor was able to provide the Alliance with the location of several key Imperial installments, including a small Imperial construction yard on Balmorra, responsible for the construction of TIE starcraft and Imperial walkers. Rieekan dispatched Rogue Squadron, which now included Moor in its ranks, to strike against the facility, crippling it without actually destroying it. The general monitored his pilots' approach the facility, advising them to eliminate several of the scanners the Imperial forces had installed along the canyon leading to the factory. Once they were destroyed, Rieekan gave Rogue Squadron the go-ahead to attack the base. Skywalker and his men were able to adequately cripple the Imperial construction yards, and return home."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The intelligence provided by Moor continued to serve Rieekan well, as it also allowed Rogue Squadron to strike against an Imperial Enclave on Kile II, which was serving as a base for all of the Imperial Navy's movements in that sector. Once Skywalker and his men had been able to successfully bomb the enclave, Rieekan contacted them directly, congratulating them for a job well done. Following that, Rieekan and Rogue Squadron began to wage a campaign against the forces of Moff Kohl Seerdon. It was the general's belief that Seerdon was consolidating his forces as preparation for a strike against the Alliance's bacta supply, and so Rieekan had his forces try and impede Seerdon's advance before his plans could come to fruition. One operation involved sending a group of commandos to Fest, where they were to steal several AT-PTs from the Imperial Weapons Research Facility there. The commandos met resistance while trying to escape however, and the general was forced to call in Rogue Squadron, who had recently been sabotaging Seerdon's operations on Taloraan. Skywalker and his pilots helped the commandos get to safety in their stolen AT-PTs, and destroyed the Weapons Research Facility while doing so."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seerdon responded with an assault and blockade of one of Chandrila's cities. The general sent both Rogue Squadron and a supply train of supplies to the planet, in the hopes of aiding the beleaguered city. The train was attacked while en route, but Skywalker and his men were able to fend off Seerdon's aggressors until it reached the city. Subsequently, the city was evacuated by the Alliance in shuttles, which were in turn escorted by Rogue Squadron. Soon after, Rieekan received reports that Thyferra, home to bacta production, had fallen under attack by Seerdon's forces. At the time, Rogue Squadron was busy destroying an Imperial installation on Sullust. The general hurriedly recalled the pilots, and immediately dispatched them to Thyferra. In the ensuing battle, Skywalker and his pilots were able to thwart Seerdon's efforts to halt the flow of bacta, and were also able to kill the moff himself during the operation."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Continued conflicts"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When an Alliance refugee stopover point on Nentan was discovered by the Empire, Rieekan was called in to oversee the evacuation. By this time, the Nentan bunkers were at full capacity, and there were not enough transports to evacuate both the military personnel and the refugees. Several soldiers volunteered to stay behind as the Imperials closed on the base, but Rieekan found that solution to be unacceptable. Bren Derlin, a Human who had been serving with the general for some time, offered Rieekan an alternative solution. Derlin, along with a group of \"expendable\" soldiers, hid amongst some of Nentan's ruins as the Imperials landed and advanced towards the now-abandoned Alliance bunkers. As they did so, they left their landing craft relatively undefended, leaving them free to be hijacked by Derlin and his men. As a result, Nentan was successfully evacuated, and Rieekan, pleased, promoted Derlin to the rank of major. Afterwards, Rieekan saw action on a variety of disparate worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of Nentan, Rieekan became the theater commander of the Alliance High Command base. When the Alliance administrative base at Dankayo was discovered by the Empire, Rieekan's people there were fortunate enough to learn of the impending Imperial attack in time to mount an evacuation, which Rieekan oversaw. The evacuation was, for the most part, a success, and no casualties were sustained. However, several vital datapacks remained intact, and they were retrieved by the Imperial transport Elusive. Rieekan realized that if the datapacks were to reach Imperial Intelligence, Alliance activities in three sectors would be jeopardized. With that in mind, he had his men destroy the Elusive. In addition to the destruction of the Elusive, Rieekan oversaw many operations that crippled Imperial Intelligence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One such operation saw Rieekan dispatched to the city Tiems, where the general's forces destroyed a power station and liberated several thousand Alliance personnel who were being held captive there. However, as Rieekan and his men prepared to be evacuated, his transports were delayed by Imperial starfighter action, and so the general was forced to defend the landing zone from a heavy Imperial counter-attack. Rieekan's knowledge of Imperial tactical doctrine, however, inspired him to lay a trap for his enemies. Since the doctrine suggested that the weakest part of an enemy line should be attacked with full force, and that upon breaking through the Imperials should move quickly to secure the rear positions of their enemies to obstruct retreat, the general had two of his regiments hide behind the main line\u2014one in a nearby forest, one over the other side of a river. As such, when the Imperial forces attacked the weakest part of Rieekan's line, which he knew to be the center, his troops fell back, and the Imperials gave chase. They were then ambushed by Rieekan's hidden regiments, causing the Imperial general to delay any further attacks until his air support arrived. By that time, however, Rieekan's forces had been able to evacuate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rieekan later filed an After Action Report on the engagement, and his command of strategy was later used as an instructional tool in surface combat tactics by General Madine. At some stage, Rieekan also took on the role of a mentor, briefly instructing Lieutenant Risiev Credal in the art of tactics. This instruction was augmented by prior teachings from other Alliance officers such as Beryl Chiffonage, Pashna Starkiller, and Vanden Willard. Together with Chiffonage, Credal had developed Attack Pattern Delta, which the general believed would be effective against Imperial walkers. Following the Evacuation of Yavin, General Jan Dodonna was believed dead. As a result, Rieekan was appointed as his successor in the role of Alliance operations commander. The choice was deemed a natural one, as the Alderaanian had consistently shown skill in keeping his men alive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When an Alliance Intelligence cell on Brosi came under threat of detection due to the blatant actions of the Brosin Underground against the Corporate Sector Authority, Rieekan voiced his concerns. The Alliance agents, who were working in Brosi's zinsian processing facilities, had attempted to make contact with the Underground, to little or no avail. Since there was still the risk of CSA discovering the Alliance cell, Rieekan requested that agent Abil Vilorin make more attempts to contact the Brosan Underground. Further concerns came in the form of Risiev Credal, who had apparently turned traitor. Rieekan worried that Credal, if he had indeed defected to the Empire, would reveal the location of the High Command base, as well as any planned tactics to be used in the event of an attack."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Echo Base"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Alliance relocated its main base to Hoth, Rieekan served as theater commander in charge of all land and naval forces in the Hoth system. At the time, a considerable bounty had been placed on the general's head; enough to buy a moon in the Core Worlds, or even an entire planet in the Outer Rim Territories. As soon as he was given command, the general devised an evacuation plan that could be put into effect as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the general put his men to work, ensuring that Echo Base was as safe as possible. Rieekan's concerns were numerous, ranging from the planet's freezing temperature, to the fact that the planet hosted no other sentient life\u2014an Imperial scan of the world would quickly enough reveal that the Alliance was hiding there. The constant meteorites emanating from the Hoth asteroid field pelted the planet, preventing the general from knowing if a scout ship or a probe droid were approaching the planet or not. Kem Monnon, chief of the Alliance Corps of Engineers, had been instrumental in establishing Echo Base, and approached Rieekan, asking for permission to explore Hoth further\u2014the general acquiesced, as it was possible the venture would grant the Alliance strategic advantages."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While overseeing construction Rieekan assigned historian Voren Na'al menial tasks. Na'al was there chiefly to chronicle events as they happened, but he was more than willing to oblige Rieekan and aid in the building of the Alliance's new home. The general placed Major Derlin in charge of the base's security and operations; the major's assignment proved to be a wise choice for Rieekan, and the decision was a popular one. Rieekan began amassing a comprehensive collection of data on the area that the Rebels were using for refuge. Recovered by Alliance Survey Team Theta was a personal recording by smuggler Jonox Forb, who had initially scouted the location and had intended to call it \"Snowflake Base.\" Forb's recording was one of the many items that Rieekan kept in his personal collection. He also collected a report by Corporal Vyn Rolado on the taming of the tauntauns. When problems arose when as the tauntauns became agitated while around droids, Rieekan sought to work with the instincts of the animals, rather than against them. To eliminate any agitation and competition amongst the captive mounts, Rieekan made sure that only female tauntauns were kept for service. When properly tamed, the tauntauns served Rieekan's men well, allowing them to go out on patrols as the T-47 airspeeders were still being adapted for the cold."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Princess Organa arrived at the base, and acted as a morale-boosting figurehead to the personnel. Rieekan also found her useful, as she was a skilled tactician. Upon arrival, despite complimenting the general's work on the base, she expressed concern for her friends, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and C-3PO, who were aboard the waylaid Millennium Falcon. Some time later, controller Toryn Farr reported that the Millennium Falcon was making its approach to Hoth, although it was being followed by an unidentified ship. Solo explained his tardiness, mentioning that they had been forced to stop on an uncharted world to make repairs. However, the unidentified ship remained in the system, and approached Hoth itself. Organa, furious at Solo's complacency, sent the Corellian back out to engage the unidentified craft. The ship later proved to be owned by the pirate captain Raskar, who was later driven away from the planet without discovering Echo Base. Shortly after welcoming a fleet of refugees from Habassa II, Rieekan announced to Organa that Echo Base was fully operational."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Discovered"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hoping to prevent another incident like Alderaan, the general made sure that Echo Base's defenses were as good as they possibly could be. He culled traffic to and from the system down to just long-range fighter patrols and necessary shipments, and in doing so made sure that the existence of the base remained a closely-guarded secret. To allay his earlier concerns, he had a planetary-class shield generator installed at the base, which could repel any orbital bombardment. To prevent anyone from giving away Echo Base's location, the general denied permission for any ship to leave the base until the shield was fully operational. As yet another precaution, Rieekan had tauntaun and snowspeeder patrols sent out frequently, to check the general vicinity of the base. Trenches were dug around Echo Base, and heavy laser turrets installed. The general also ordered the installation of heavy blast doors at the base's northern and southern entrances. As a final measure, a v-150 anti-orbital ion cannon was brought in\u2014the cannon was powerful enough to disable a Star Destroyer in orbit. Despite the abundance of defensive measures in place, Rieekan knew full well that he would not be able to stop a full-scale Imperial assault. Instead, they were there to delay the Empire, and allow the Echo Base personnel to escape with minimum casualties. The general accepted the fact that the Empire were more than likely going to discover Echo Base, and so he was always prepared to order an evacuation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To take stock of the situation, Rieekan held a staff meeting, attended by Organa and Lieutenant Commander Skywalker, amongst others. Echo Base was nearing its ultimate completion, but the Alliance was still having trouble adapting to the climate. The general, however, was sure that their situation would improve once Commander Arhul Narra's vital supply convoy arrived. During the meeting, Rieekan was taken aside and informed that Narra's fleet had been destroyed near Derra IV. The commander had also perished in the conflict. Returning to Skywalker and Organa, who had been joined by Captain Solo and his co-pilot Chewbacca, Rieekan informed them of Narra's death and the loss of the convoy. The general then promptly promoted Skywalker to commander, and informed him that no resupply meant no snubfighter reinforcements\u2014Rogue Squadron was to be Echo Base's only aerial defense."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When a storm raged around Echo Base, Rieekan issued an order that no one was to leave its confines, lest they succumb to the bitter cold outside. The general's men then detected an energy source on the sensors, although it disappeared soon after due to the storm. Rieekan consulted Organa, and then decided to wait until Skywalker and Solo, who were out placing sensors, to return, before closing the base's shield doors. The general supposed that whatever was out there might show up on the sensors once again. Captain Solo then returned, and approached Rieekan, stating that he had to leave Hoth. This was due to the fact that he had a bounty on his head, and needed to pay off the crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure in order to remove it. Rieekan understood Solo's position, but regretted his need to depart nonetheless, and he had even considered giving the Corellian an honorary officer's commission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker failed to report back to base, however, and Solo disobeyed Rieekan's command that no one was to leave the base when he set out into the storm on his tauntaun. Solo did not return that night, and so the next morning, the modifications to the airspeeders had been completed, and Rieekan authorized Rogue Squadron to set out and find their lost comrades. The pair were rescued, Skywalker having been savaged by a wampa ice creature. By that time, Rieekan felt that it was unsafe for any ship to depart the system until the base's energy field was online, and so Solo's departure from Echo Base was delayed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after Skywalker's rescue, Rieekan received reports that Echo Base was under attack by one of the ice creatures. Although the attack was subdued by the Echo Base staff, the general deduced that the creatures had evolved to register at sub-life heat levels, and so his men adjusted their equipment accordingly. Rieekan then received a report that an unidentified object was detected near Echo Base. The discovery demanded the general's personal attention. One of Rieekan's staff, Wyron Serper, was monitoring the object, and was able to pick up its communications. The protocol droid C-3PO overheard the transmission, and stated that it was not an Alliance code. The droid even went so far as to suggest that the transmission was an Imperial one. Solo, who was present by this time, decided to go out and investigate with the help of the Wookiee Chewbacca. As they departed, Rieekan dispatched Rogues Ten and Eleven to Echo Station 3-8, where they were to attack the unidentified energy source. Solo assured the general that he could handle the situation, however."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Rieekan did not hear from Solo for some time, Organa urged him to dispatch snowspeeders, but at that moment the captain called in. Solo discovered that the unidentified object was an Imperial Viper probe droid. Rieekan immediately realized that they had been discovered, and he immediately ordered an evacuation of Echo Base. Knowing that the Imperials would act quickly and send an attack force as soon as possible, he put his evacuation plan into motion, and began implementing the strategies he had devised with Organa. Sure enough, Lieutenant Romas Navander reported that Lord Vader's Death Squadron had entered the system, and blockaded the planet.

In the wake of the Black Fleet Crisis, Rieekan retired."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Yuuzhan Vong War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the advent of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Rieekan returned to service, and headed the Coruscant Planetary Defense Force. Once again, the Alderaanian held the rank of general. In 27 ABY, a disturbance in Coruscant's passenger lanes attracted Rieekan's attention. A flight from Rogue Squadron, headed by Colonel Gavin Darklighter, was moving to inspect the freighter Sweet Surprise, and had ordered them to stand down, but the ship continued its approach. Rieekan contacted Han Solo, who was following the Sweet Surprise in the Millennium Falcon. Solo proceeded to expound upon his past dealings with one of the crewmembers, Plaan, a Weequay, and his generally suspicious dealings, including refugee-selling. Rieekan then contacted Darklighter, and ordered him to not allow the Sweet Surprise within the mine shell that had been deployed around Coruscant. The ship was later boarded, and revealed to have been carrying Jedi-hunting Yuuzhan Vong-engineered voxyn, intended for deployment on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time afterward, Rieekan was contacted by Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya, and they discussed the involvement of the New Jedi Order in the ongoing war. Fey'lya had been decidedly hostile to the Jedi over the course of the war, but as the tide had turned against the New Republic, the Bothan had no choice but to reverse his stance. In addition to discussing the matter with Rieekan, Fey'lya also contacted Generals Wedge Antilles, Garm Bel Iblis, Admiral Traest Kre'fey, and others. They all attended via hologram as the Yuuzhan Vong Nom Anor addressed the New Republic Senate, and called for the blood of the Jedi. Fey'lya, in response, announced his change of heart. The Yuuzhan Vong responded with an all-out attack against the galactic capital."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the enemy approached Coruscant, the enemy Warmaster, Tsavong Lah, began utilizing ships filled with captive refugees from conquered worlds to shield his own craft. Admiral Sien Sovv, who was charged with leading the defense of Coruscant, was unwilling to destroy such craft, while General Bel Iblis was more willing to make such sacrifices. As such, Sovv was forced to attend a senate meeting via hologram, in which Fey'lya declared that he would be replaced by Bel Iblis as overall commander of the defense. Rieekan disagreed with the move, and had his hologram stand by Sovv's in the senate chamber, as did those of several other senior officers in the military, such as Admiral Kre'fey and Commodore Brand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yuuzhan Vong continued their approach, however, and began to approach Coruscant's surface. Rieekan commanded ground forces, and issued orders to surface artillery. Although they were able to inflict damage on the incoming forces, the battle, and Coruscant itself, was lost. The New Republic retreated, leaving the planet to be overrun by the invaders, and Chief of State Fey'lya committed suicide by blowing up half of the Imperial Palace, killing many of the Yuuzhan Vong by doing so. As the Republic retreated, Rieekan, working alongside General Bel Iblis and Lando Calrissian, was able to delay the invasion long enough to allow many evacuation transports to depart the capital in safety."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the New Republic smashed at Coruscant, it was forced to reform itself into the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, which was centralized at Mon Calamari. From there, the war against the Yuuzhan Vong continued to be waged. In 29 BBY, Rieekan attended a meeting aboard the cruiser Ralroost, along with Supreme Commander Sovv, Admiral Kre'frey, Grand Admiral Pellaeon, Generals Antilles, Bel Iblis, Farlander, and Cracken, amongst others, including Han and Leia Solo, and their daughter Jaina. During the meeting, intelligence from spies on occupied Coruscant, or Yuuzhan'tar as it was now called, was discussed, as well as the newly-discovered Yuuzhan Vong plans to strike at Mon Calamari. The Alliance was able to rally to the defense of their new capital, however, and defeat the enemy at the Defense of Mon Calamari."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The new victory spurned the Alliance on towards a dramatic strike against Coruscant itself. The Galactic Alliance and numerous other factions from across the galaxy were able to liberate the galactic capital, and in the ensuing conflict, brought about the death of Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane. Rieekan was still aboard the Ralroost, and along with many of the military personnel present for the earlier meeting, in addition to Chief of State Cal Omas, was present for the Yuuzhan Vong surrender, presented by Warmaster Nas Choka. As a result, the Yuuzhan Vong War was brought to a close."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rieekan was perceived by his men to be a grim and stern man, who was in a constant state of worry and concern. The general was in fact, quiet and unassuming. Initially, he had been an optimist, but after blaming himself for the destruction of Alderaan, he became morose and grim. Even in the ensuing months, memories of the event haunted him. He fought because he felt it was his duty to avert and potential disasters or tragedies that might occur in the future, even though he did not particularly want to. Rieekan tried to make sure that he never risked the lives of those under his command, and decided to act with aggressive caution following the Alderaan incident, when he once would have acted with confident subtlety. He never put his emotions on display, and instead constantly retained his determined demeanor. While commanding at Echo Base, Rieekan's grim and downbeat mood was misunderstood by most, but engineer Ken Monnon possessed a complete understanding of the general's past, and would not tolerate any complaints about Rieekan's demeanor from his men. After the evacuation of Hoth, Rieekan would continued to be haunted further, by the deaths of the Alliance soldiers who had made the ultimate sacrifice as Echo Base was evacuated. Following the liberation of Coruscant, Rieekan grew more optimistic, and a visual change in his demeanor was noted by his colleagues."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He stuck by his ideals, and lived by them, which led him to gravitate towards fellow soldiers with similar mindsets. Rieekan possessed natural leadership skills, which allowed him to rapidly rise through the ranks of the Judicial Forces. He disagreed with Palpatine's policies to such an extent that he felt a need to do significant damage to the New Order. Rieekan also admired Viceroy Bail Organa, hailing him as a trustworthy man. The general felt grief for Organa's loss during the destruction of Alderaan. Later, when Rieekan was in the Coronet Capital Tower as it was being attacked by Imperial forces, he was genuinely more concerned about the lives of the innocent people within, rather than his own."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rieekan was a strong and able tactician, and had been so from an early age. His vast knowledge in that area made him a highly effective base commander. He was not amused by flippancy, but while he did not always agree with men like Captain Han Solo, he could still acknowledge that they were genuinely good people. In return, he was perceived as a good soldier. Rieekan cared for his men\u2014so much so that he once privately admitted that he \"bleeds when they bleed, and dies when they die.\" Even though he was able to make sacrifices, he never found the task of sending men to their deaths easy. As such, Rieekan would personally wish his troops good luck as they ventured into combat. Later in his career, faced with an expensive recovery mission when the Teljkon Vagabond entered hyperspace with Lando Calrissian aboard, Rieekan was loathe to abandon an ally of the New Republic purely because the operation would be expensive. Later, Rieekan was taken aback by Colonel Pakkpekatt's adamant insistence that he find and assist Calrissian when he was stranded on the Vagabond. Although Rieekan usually was strict with his orders and mandates, he relaxed the rules slightly for Pakkpekatt, and warned the colonel not to try his patience."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rieekan was noted as a man who spoke infrequently, but whenever he chose to offer his opinion on a given matter, it was usually an opinion worth hearing. The general once commented on the modus operandi of the Katarn Commandos, who were answerable to the New Republic Chief of State, but were allowed to determine specifically how their missions were conducted internally. Rieekan's summation was that the process was like \"tossing a nest of fire wasps into a bursa's lair and seeing what happens next.\" He was also incisive\u2014during the Black Fleet Crisis, he was able to divine Viceroy Spaar's intentions based on his actions quicker than Chief of State Organa Solo could. The general was respected amongst the command hierarchy, with people such as Admiral Ackbar holding the belief that they could rely on him for support in testing times. Rieekan would demonstrate his support for his fellow officers in such cases as Supreme Commander Sovv's disciplinary hearing at the hands of Chief of State Fey'lya during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to his military skills, Rieekan could also understand Basic, Huttese, Ithorese, Mon Calamarian, Shyriiwook, and Sullustese."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "General Rieekan first appeared in Donald F. Glut's novelization of Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan's script for Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. In the film itself, Rieekan was portrayed by Bruce Boa. The role was later taken by Merwin Goldsmith for Brian Daley's radio drama adaptation of the film, and the character was then voiced by Neil Ross in the video game Star Wars: Rogue Squadron. For that game's sequels, Rogue Leader and Rebel Strike, the role was taken by Dan Barton. If the player shoots down far too many allies, escorts, or convoys during a mission, the mission will end with Rieekan calling Luke Skywalker back to the Rebel Base so he can discuss with Luke privately on the nature of Luke's tactics on the battlefield."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rieekan has made several appearances in the Expanded Universe, where the character was given his first name of \"Carlist,\" in the sourcebook Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back, first published in 1989. Rieekan also served as a player character in the games Assault on Hoth and The Battle of Hoth. The character makes a brief appearance in the non-canon comic issue Star Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back 1, where an alternate set of events to those depicted in the film of The Empire Strikes Back are shown. Rieekan's role is greatly reduced, with the most significant changes affecting his character directly being the death of Luke Skywalker from the wampa attack, and the subsequent funeral, which distracts the Alliance from the Imperial approach. In the issue, Rieekan and Echo Base are caught off-guard by the Imperial assault."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Inconsistencies"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several inconsistencies have cropped up in regards to Rieekan's appearances in various adaptations and Expanded Universe works. A plot summary of The Empire Strikes Back included in a promotional magazine for the film states that Rieekan is killed during the Battle of Hoth. In Star Wars 39, Rieekan's lines during his initial interaction with Han Solo are given instead to Major Derlin. Later in that same comic line, for issue 77, an aging man identified only as the \"General\" briefs Organa and Skywalker on a mission to Kabray Station. Although no other generals had briefed the characters in post The Empire Strikes Back issues before other than Rieekan, the character's lack of identification makes Rieekan's appearance in the issue only possible, not certain. For the Dark Empire audio drama, Rieekan's lines from the comic are instead given to Mon Mothma, and in the comic adaptation of The Last Command, Rieekan's lines are given to Admiral Drayson. For the Rebellion Era Campaign Guide, Rieekan's entry is erroneously illustrated with a picture of Crix Madine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon and cut appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
