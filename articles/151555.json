Nevertheless, files pertaining to this updated questline can be found in the game's directory tree files. Among these files is an updated version of Gitori, simply designated as \"tatooine_una.\" An emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals that the updated character would have been a tattooed Human female, instead of an Ualaq Aqualish as in the original Valarian Theme Park."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
