The creatures had thin tails, long necks, and elongated heads, with dark eyes and pointed ears. Steelees' metal hooves would generate sparks whenever they struck against metallic rock on Elphrona's surface, additionally producing loud and sharp noises. Their hooves also generated an organomagnetic field that could allow them to lock into the ground and remain still, an ability that the steelees used to climb steep mountains on Elphrona."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Steelees could be tamed and used as riding mounts, with the rider sitting in a saddle atop the creatures and controlling the steelee with reins.

Ottoh Blythe, the father of the family, cared for and trained the steelees. Around the year 232 BBY, the Blythe family became a target of a raid by Nihil marauders at the behest of Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro, who wished to attract the attention of the nearby Jedi Order outpost in order to capture a Jedi. The Nihil, led by the Cloud Ultident Margrona, approached on a speeder as Ottoh Blythe was feeding their steelees, and Blythe proceeded to drop the sack of feed and secure himself and his family within their house. The raiders released gas around the homestead, which incapacitated the steelees."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Blythes managed to destroy the Nihil's speeder using a delving droid, but the marauders nevertheless broke into the house and kidnapped the family. With their speeder nonfunctional, the Nihil stole five of the family's steelees in order to return to their two waiting Cloudships, leaving the homestead in flames. The raiders harnessed two of the steelees to pull a repulsorcart that carried their prisoners, with the other three being ridden alongside; the Nihil were inexpert riders, traveling slower than the creatures' potential speed. When the Jedi\u2014having been anonymously tipped off about the raid by Ro himself\u2014arrived at the homestead on a Vanguard ground vehicle, the Jedi Master Porter Engle calmed the three remaining steelees with the Force. After their Vanguard was destroyed by Nihil mole mines, Engle used the Force to convince the creatures to work with them and help save their owners, and he, alongside the Jedi Master Loden Greatstorm and the Padawan Bell Zettifar, climbed atop the steelees to pursue the Nihil."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Jedi versus the Nihil"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The slowed movement of the Nihil's steelees allowed the Jedi to gain distance on the raiders. While the Nihil at first did not notice their approaching pursuers, the Blythes did. However, Asaria, the Nihil placed on guard in the cart, eventually came to notice the steelees behind them, alerting the other Nihil. At that moment, Ottoh Blythe commanded the steelees to stop, and the creatures obeyed immediately, locking their hooves into the ground. Though the steelees had stopped, the momentum of the creatures threw three of the Nihil from their saddles and launched Asaria from the cart onto the rocky surface, killing the guard. The Blythes attempted to escape, but they were prevented from doing so by the remaining Nihil."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Jedi approached, the Nihil continued to ride towards their starships, though two raiders waited in the nearby hills to eliminate their pursuers. One of the raiders shot and killed Engle's steelee, and he leapt from the creature, ordering his fellow Jedi to continue after the Nihil. Engle, angered by the death of the steelee, killed one of the Nihil, prompting the other to attempt to mount a steelee and escape. The steelee, however, remained still, with its head down and hooves locked into the ground, allowing Engle to run his lightsaber through the Nihil's head. As Engle calmed the steelee to commandeer it, the Nihil, having survived the wound, began to fire his blaster, but Engle was saved by Ember, the charhound owned by the Jedi on Elphrona."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the Jedi managed to close some distance between them and their targets, the Nihil managed to reach their ships with their prisoners. Greatstorm let go of his steelee's reins, continuing to steer the creature with his knees and the Force, and used the Vanguard's laser cannon mechanism to destroy one of the vessels. The Nihil positioned the cart between their pursuers and the remaining ship, throwing one, the mother Erika Blythe, from the cart to distract the Jedi. Greatstorm and Zettifar dismounted from their steelees to check on Blythe as the Nihil reached their starship, activating its engines. Engle resolved to take Blythe back to the outpost by steelee so that he could treat her wounds on the way, while the other Jedi pursued the Nihil craft in Jedi Vectors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Steelees appeared in the 2021 novel The High Republic: Light of the Jedi, written by Charles Soule.
