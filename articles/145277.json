Utilizing a basic adhesive blended with detonite gel, it could break through most sealed hatches. On the planet Geonosis during the first battle of the Clone Wars, the Republic commando nicknamed Darman used thermal tape to attach a thermal detonator to a triple-sealed blast door. The door needed to be breached so Delta Squad could pass through, but dirt covering the alloy made it difficult for the tape to take hold, causing a delay."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
