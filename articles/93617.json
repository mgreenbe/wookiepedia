After the Battle of Yavin, Krieg and Doctor Edvar Vang discovered the existence of a new kind of spice. This spice was trafficked by the Rebel Alliance but was also sought by the powerful criminal organization Black Sun. While Vang considered that the situation had become too dangerous, Krieg continued to look into the source of the spice. He was then detected and threatened to stop his investigation. However, Moxxar Krieg refused to do so and was finally assassinated in his house in Mos Eisley. Around 1 ABY, a group of spacers discovered a sample of the new spice while looking for a missing pilot, Cal Handro. They brought it to Doctor Vang but the latter exhorted them to interrogate Krieg instead of him. The spacers only found the corpse of Moxxar Krieg in his house."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moxxar Krieg appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
