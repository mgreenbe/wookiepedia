After speaking to the droid, the droid informed them that Treun Lorn was behind the gate, and would allow the spacer to pass if they brought them a radiated Nak'tra Crystal from within the cavern. The spacer searched for and located the crystal. Bringing it back to the droid and presenting it to them, the battle droid allowed the spacer to pass, but suspiciously did not take the crystal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon entering the cavern behind the gate, the spacer met the quite insane Treun Lorn, who immediately took the crystal from the spacer and used it to activate the machinery in the cavern, which in turn powered up Lorn's \"master\", the N-K Necrosis. As Lorn escaped the lab, the Necrosis and his two NK-3 guards immediately attacked the spacer. What followed was a long, hard fought battle, but eventually the spacer was triumphant over the Necrosis. Searching the droid, the spacer took from his corpse his double-bladed lightsaber, among other things, and escaped the lab through a back way series of caves that were infested with Lorn's previous droid experiments."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Model 3-NIi is a non-playable character in the Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided expansion pack, Rage of the Wookiees.
