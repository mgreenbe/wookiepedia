It was installed in a standard airlock system, and consisted of a telescoping armored \"boarding tube\", capable of creating an airtight seal on a ship's hull\u2014or airlock\u2014within thirty seconds. A high intensity plasma torch assembly integrated into the seal's frame acted as a hull-cutting ring, and was capable of cutting a one-meter-by-two-meter hole within a minute of sealing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
