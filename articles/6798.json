In 21 BBY, during the Clone Wars, he was part of a battle group that was sent to the planet Kothlis to stop a Confederate invasion. Ando fought in the ensuing battle, which became difficult for the Galactic Republic since the Confederate General Grievous introduced a computer virus that jammed all Republic communications. Despite the new weapon, the Republic was eventually successful in repelling the attacks.

In the year 21 BBY, the Galactic Republic dispatched a fleet of cruisers to the planet Kothlis. Ando and his battle group were part of the fleet and were ordered to defend the planet from an attack by the Confederacy of Independent Systems led by the cyborg General Grievous. When the Republic fleet arrived near Kothlis, Grievous made use of a computer virus that jammed all Republic communications. Although their mission was complicated by the virus, Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi ordered an attack in retaliation. Aboard the Republic flagship Indomitable, Ando and his comrades boarded LAAT/i gunships and landed on Kothlis, where they fought against deployed Confederate battle droids. Due to the superior number of droids, the Republic's ground troops suffered heavy losses. However, the technicians aboard the Indomitable were able to restore the communications that were being blocked by the computer virus, and the Republic fleet drove Grievous and his fleet out of the system, forcing him to abandon his plans of capturing Kothlis. After the Confederate fleet had withdrawn, Republic starfighters supported the ground troops, and the Republic was victorious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack from the Confederacy left heavy casualties, and the remaining Republic troops had to be coordinated.
