At Imperial Facility 729-D in the Inner Rim, the bounty hunter Chanath Cha boards the modified Star Courier Scimitar. Chanath is given a tour of the ship by the droid O-66.

Based on the presence of the two guards and the opulent treasures aboard, Korin deduces that they had stolen the Emperor's luxury yacht. She tells him that he killed them all but Calrissian doesn't want to talk about it. While the twins fight, Chanath departs aboard the Scimitar with the head of O-66. Despite being decapitated, O-66 continues to chat with Chanath and reassures her that the Scimitar is able to follow a ship's trail through hyperspace, something considered impossible. After homing in on the signature of the Imperialis, Chanath takes the Scimitar into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before heading back to the central chamber, Lando and Korin steal some blasters from the ship's armor.

After entering the vault, they find that the chamber was holding a Sith helmet. Korin explains that the Jedi and Sith were rivals. Lando thinks that the Sith helmet will be worth a lot on the black market and fancies that it will be compensation for Korin's left eye.
