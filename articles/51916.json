Built underneath the cityspace and cutting across Galactic City diagonally, access to the Pipe was restricted to private speeders whose owners paid a 100-credit toll for use of the tunnel. However, use of the Pipe could cut an hour-long journey through Galactic City down to a fifteen-minute trip. The high toll fee kept traffic through the Pipe to a minimum."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Skirmish on Coruscant, Dark Jedi Tahiri Veila used the Pipe in order to evade pursuit by Jedi Leia Organa Solo; however, Solo pursued Veila through the Pipe illegally."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
