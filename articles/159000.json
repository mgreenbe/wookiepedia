Valaqil was present at the Omega Squad briefing on Ord Mantell before their departure to Qiilura. While the clones tried to remove the colonists from Qiilura, their Jedi General Etain Tur-Mukan blindly led them into a minefield trap laid by the colonists, who had faked their surrender. This forced Valaqil, who was mistakenly thought to be Jinart by Tur-Mukan, to lead them out of the minefield."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
