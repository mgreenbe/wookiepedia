In 32 BBY, during the Battle of Grassy Plains, Gungan General Tobler Ceel attempted to place the Gungan Grand Army atop the ridge, where he hoped to gain the high ground over the forces of the Trade Federation. Unfortunately, the Federation reached the ridge before the Gungans, and Ceel was forced to order an early halt in the valley. The battle started soon after the Gungans saw the Trade Federation vehicles emerge atop the Shaak Ridge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
