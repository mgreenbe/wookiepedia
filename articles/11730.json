The ship's central section had two parts, each of which held six cargo cylinders. At the beginning of the journey, those cylinders were filled of bacta and, once at destination, they were swapped with others similar cylinders with the help of smaller ships. The returned cylinders might be empty or they could carry native goods to be imported on Thyferra or traded later during the rest of the journey. For armament, these ships were armed with two dorsal turbolasers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
