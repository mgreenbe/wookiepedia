This large area of land was filled with statues that portrayed both people and events in Bakura's past. The location was also filled with namana trees and neatly cut shrubs. Visitors would often feel that the Statuary Park was unusually remote despite the fact that they were in the center of the city. Its circular shape covered roughly half the same surface area as the Bakur Memorial Building."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
