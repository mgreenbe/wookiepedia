It was led by the archaeologist Clatriffe. The first artifacts uncovered in the excavation included ancient broken droid parts, but eventually an item thought to be a Jedi holocron was found. The Krypder Riders, a pirate gang led by Hudso Shaku, attempted to steal the holocron from the archaeologists, leading Clatriffe to hire some of the planet's natives to protect the area. The Jedi Council received a message about the holocron, sending Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker on a mission to retrieve the artifact."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
