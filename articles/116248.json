It was owned by a mentally unstable retired adventurer turned terrorist named Riyan Kiner. From there, the insane crate-hating Riner attacked the crate manufacturing company Joben Crate Company and planted bombs at hotels across the galaxy. The retired explorer threatened even more carnage if the production of crates should continue. However, his plan was foiled by a spacer working for Corellia Times reporter Vani Korr. After disarming the bombs, the spacer tracked Riyan Kiner to his hovel and eventually killed him in the confrontation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Riyan Kiner's Hovel was a location in the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011.
