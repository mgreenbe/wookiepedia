Internally, V1 droids had a retractable arm and a starship interface jack. The interface jack was the droid's most important component, which they could use to access almost all the functions of a vessel to replace or supplement a living pilot. In addition to their expert piloting skills, their standard programming included basic skills in repairing space transports, computers, and astrogation. V1 droids could only store three sets of hyperspace coordinates, as opposed to an R2 unit's ten."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "V1 pilot droids were the most common type of pilot droid in use during the Galactic Civil War. V1 droids cost 11,800 credits when new, with used models going for 9,600 credits. The high price was a consequence of the new technology used in their production. This made them too expensive for the Rebel Alliance to purchase new, though they gladly accepted them when they were donated or stolen from the Galactic Empire. V1 units were used by the Alliance to run cargo when living pilots could not be spared."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Both Rebel and Imperial V1 droids were programmed to recognize friendly and enemy starships, but they were not meant to be used in combat. When attacked, they could only raise shields and perform evasive maneuvers.
