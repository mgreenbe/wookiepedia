This unit proved to be quite popular in the Mid Rim, where beings were not as wealthy as their counterparts in the Core Worlds. When Serv-O-Droid learned that Cybot Galactica had produced its 5YQ-series protocol droid with components from the Orbot, they took the larger corporation to court and eventually won their case. This forced Cybot Galactica to halt production of the 5YQ series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
