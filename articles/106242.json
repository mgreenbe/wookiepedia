Plood was notable for its seascapes, which were described as majestic in the datafiles aboard the Separatist freighter Larkrer. When Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Chiss Ascendancy Commander Thrawn investigated the freighter on Batuu in 19 BBY, they looked upon the datafiles to try and deduce where a Separatist base which the Larkrer's crew had been supplying may be located. Skywalker read the descriptions of Plood and a number of other locations along the hyperspace route and remarked that they sounded like they had been pulled out of travel brochures."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plood was mentioned in the 2018 novel Thrawn: Alliances, written by Timothy Zahn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
