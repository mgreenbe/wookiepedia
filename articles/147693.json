The ship came equipped with fire control, maneuvering, and command capabilities, all of which were centralized in the bridge.

The Dorneans decided to send the Torktarak, along with its sister ship, the Braha'tok, under the command of Etahn A'baht and Kiles L'toth, respectively. Since the Braha'tok-class gunships had not been outside of the space surrounding Dornea before 4 ABY, and to avoid arousing the suspicion from Imperial Intelligence, the Dornean government claimed that the two ships were undergoing a \"shakedown cruise.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Torktarak and the Braha'tok met up with the Alliance Fleet, under the command of the Mon Calamari Admiral Ackbar, orbiting the planet of Sullust.

The Alliance discovered that the shield protecting the second Death Star\u2014which was supposed to have been taken down by a strike team that had already landed on Endor\u2014was still up.
