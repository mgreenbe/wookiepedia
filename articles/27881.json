Roughly six months after Marek's death, Vader almost came to believe one clone in particular might have been his first success. Although the clone did not possess any of the physical deformities or violent psychosis that the aberrant clones exhibited, he still suffered from an identity crisis to a certain extent. Ultimately, he suffered from the emotional imprints left behind by his genetic template, much like the clones who failed before him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the Assault on Kamino, Darth Vader succeeded in creating the only perfect clone of the original Starkiller. Unlike the clones that preceded him, this clone was stable where the others weren't. Not only did he inherit Marek's powers, he could also hold his progenitor's memories as separate from his own experience. The clone eventually managed to free himself from his template's emotions by truly realizing that he was the clone of a dead man, thus avoiding the identity crisis and other psychological impediments that undermined all of the other clones of Galen Marek."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Thrawn campaign"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, during his campaign against the New Republic, Grand Admiral Thrawn used ysalamir to \"push back\" the Force around the Spaarti cloning cylinders he was using to create an army.
