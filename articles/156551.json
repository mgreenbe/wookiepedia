Its surface was at least partly covered with forests and mountains. Between the wooded areas, there existed clearings wide enough for a medium-sized starship to land with ease. Humans and Wookiees could breath the planet's atmosphere unassisted, which hinted at a mixture of oxygen, nitrogen and other gases. There were two celestial bodies visible from the planet's surface in full daylight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point during the Galactic Civil War that opposed the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire, the green planet was the stage of a minor attack that involved the Rebel heroes Han Solo and Chewbacca. The two were forced to make a rough landing there with their starship, the Millennium Falcon, while trying to escape Imperial troops who had discovered their presence in Mos Eisley, Tatooine. While the planet appeared to be uninhabited, Solo soon realized there was Imperial presence when a group of Stormtroopers and Imperial officers came out of the wood and ambushed the Falcon. However, the planet was also home to a population of Wookiees. Chewbacca, as a member of their species, successfully sneaked past the Imperial ambush and mobilized his fellow Wookiees to fend off the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Galactic Civil War, a contingent of more than thirty Wookiee warriors had established their domicile on the green planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
