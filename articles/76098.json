The city was built a thousand years before Poe Dameron and Zorii Bliss were inducted into the Spice Runners of Kijimi. The city had a history of being victim of raids and overthrows that saw various factions rule the city throughout its history. It was located on Mount Izukika and was the site of a spaceport. The city had cobblestone streets and also featured many temples, monasteries, and relics used by monks. By the time of the New Republic Era, the city's spiritual centers were abandoned. Kijimi was one of many planets that the New Republic did not reach, allowing Kijimi City to become headquarters for underworld activities and organizations, including the Spice Runners. Slavers were not welcome. The city had no central government and was ruled by the anarchy of criminal self-interests."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 35 ABY, Bliss reunited with Dameron and met Finn, Rey, C-3PO and D-O.
