The module stored around one million distinct forms of communication, and was the leading module of its day. It was still used during the Rebellion era, albeit not nearly as popular as the newer model. While not as powerful as the TranLang III, the module still found its way into protocol droids such as the J9 worker drone, and tutor droids such as the TTS-15."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
