However, when Riboga lost control of crime in the Cularin system to Nirama in a game of sabacc, Nirama gained ownership of the estate. During the time of the Clone Wars, Nirama found a new world for his people, the Oblee to settle, and he kept plans for the settlement in a computer in the estate. When Riboga attempted to regain control of crime in the Cularin system, Nirama became worried that Riboga would capture the estate and discover the settlement's location. To prevent this from happening, he sent the Heroes of Cularin to blow up the estate. The heroes arrived at about the same time as Riboga's thugs and they were successful in preventing the thugs from gaining the information."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
