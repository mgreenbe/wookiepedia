She served as a sniper in the Gloom Walkers unit under the command of Lieutenant Ulabore, and took part in the Battle of Phaseera. Lucia defended Sergeant Dessel's mutinous actions during the battle, as she believed he had saved the unit's lives; however, Dessel was arrested anyway. Believing Dessel to have been court-martialed and killed due to Ulabore's order of arrest, Lucia killed Ulabore during a skirmish on Alaris Prime. After the end of the war, Lucia became a prisoner of war, until the Republic Senate issued an official pardon to the troopers who had served the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being released, Lucia served as a bodyguard and bounty hunter, and in 987 BBY, she became the bodyguard of Serra, a nurse who saved her life after her failed attempt to capture the Meerian Salto Zendar. Serra later married Prince Gerran of Doan, and Lucia was inducted into the Doan Royal Guard. When Gerran was later killed by the planet's mining caste, Lucia hired the Huntress to assassinate the miners' leader.

Lucia was shocked to recognize Bane as Dessel, and, believing she owed him her life for his action during the New Sith Wars, Lucia freed the Sith Lord. She then hurried to find Serra, hoping to get her to safety before Bane could find her. Lucia first saw Bane and confronted him, begging him to spare Serra. Lucia was killed, however, when Bane's apprentice, Darth Zannah, arrived and attacked them, hoping to take from Bane the title of Dark Lord of the Sith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "New Sith Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Human female Lucia was born sometime between 1030 and 1020 BBY, and she served in the Brotherhood of Darkness during the New Sith Wars against the Galactic Republic in the years leading up to the Seventh Battle of Ruusan. Lucia served as a junior officer and sniper in the Gloom Walkers unit, under the command of Lieutenant Ulabore. She served alongside the trooper Dessel of the Gloom Walkers during the battle at Kashyyyk, and again during the battle at Hsskhor. In 1002 BBY, Lucia and the Gloom Walkers participated in the Battle of Phaseera, an effort to capture the Republic manufacturing world of Phaseera. The Gloom Walkers were tasked with taking out a Republic outpost overlooking a valley that led to the Republic base camp in Phaseera's capital city. This outpost prevented the Brotherhood army from moving through the valley during the daytime without being spotted and their presence alerted to the Republic soldiers in the camp. In addition, the Republic had three flatbed gunships that could inflict massive damage from the sky."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the battle began, the Gloom Walkers stayed at a makeshift camp in the jungle. Ulabore eventually received the order from the Brotherhood's commanders to move out, and Lucia was sent to tell the rest of the troopers to assemble. However, when Ulabore told the Gloom Walkers that they were to attack the outpost in one hour, the Gloom Walkers objected, believing it to be a suicide mission. When Ulabore refused to listen, Dessel, who had been promoted to Sergeant, mutinied by knocking Ulabore out and taking command. The Gloom Walkers then waited until nightfall to strike and moved through the jungle, split into four squads, and encircled the outpost, with each squad using interference boxes to jam all transmissions within the perimeter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lucia was in Dessel's squad, and when Dessel saw that the crews of the now-grounded gunships were still there, he asked Lucia if she could snipe them. Lucia answered in the negative, stating that no one could kill so many troopers that fast. Frustrated and acting on impulse, Dessel attacked the crews by himself, killing several before being blinded by a flash canister. Dessel was able to retain his sight, even after the detonation of the flash canister, and went on to kill the rest of the Republic soldiers with incredible speed and precision. Lucia was very shocked by this display and stared with her mouth agape for a moment before continuing the fight for the outpost."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Aftermath of Phaseera"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three hours later, the Gloom Walkers succeeded in taking the outpost, with nine casualties. With the outpost eliminated, the main Brotherhood army was well on its way to surprise-attacking the Republic base camp. Lucia and the rest of the Gloom Walkers, save a small squad led by Senior Trooper Adanar that was tasked with holding the outpost, returned to their jungle camp to find an awake Ulabore surrounded by several Sith enforcers. Dessel was placed in shackles and told by Ulabore that he was going to be court-martialed. Although Lucia tried to defend Dessel, he was taken away by the armed enforcers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A month later, Lucia and the Gloom Walkers traveled to Alaris Prime. On patrol there, they were ambushed by Republic troops\u2014something that Lucia knew would never have happened had Dessel still been with them. The ensuing skirmish was quick and bloody; casualties were heavy on both sides, but the Republic troops were forced to flee. Lucia had not forgiven Ulabore for having Dessel arrested and likely killed, and she shot him in the back during the battle, killing him. The other Gloom Walkers never reported her betrayal, and Ulabore was registered as killed in action. However, unbeknownst to Lucia, Dessel's court-martial never occurred; word had spread of his remarkable shooting, and he was taken to Korriban to train in the dark side of the Force. Dessel eventually became the Sith Lord Darth Bane. Two years after his arrest, he destroyed the Brotherhood by providing them with the thought bomb to use in battle against the Jedi. The war ended after the last battle on Ruusan, and Bane secretly established his own Order of the Sith Lords."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "After the war"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the end of the New Sith Wars and the collapse of the Brotherhood of Darkness Lucia became a prisoner of war. She served for six months on a work planet, repairing starships, until the Galactic Senate released a pardon to all the beings who had served in the Sith army. For the next thirteen years Lucia worked as a freelance bodyguard, mercenary; and later as a bounty hunter.

However, a nurse working in the hospital, Serra, blocked her way and refused to move, even when Lucia pulled a blaster on her. A Twi'lek, who was also hunting Zendar, suddenly arrived and shot Lucia in the stomach before taking Zendar out into a hall. Lucia, although injured, crawled after them, but she fell unconscious. Even as the skirmish continued in the hospital, Serra retrieved Lucia and performed life-saving surgery on her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lucia then vowed to protect Serra and became her loyal bodyguard. With Serra she traveled frequently from place to place, never staying on one world for more than a few weeks at a time. At first, the healer was reluctant to have Lucia always watching over her, but Serra eventually came to appreciate her bodyguard, and the two became very close friends. When Gerran, the Prince of Doan, contracted Idolian fever, his father contacted Serra to heal him. Within three months, Gerran was cured and he and Serra had fallen in love. He proposed to her, and she accepted on the basis that Lucia would remain her bodyguard. The King remained against their union, but accepted reluctantly, allowing Lucia to join the Doan Royal Guard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 980 BBY, the Doan Royal House came into conflict with the planet's mining caste, and the tensions escalated when the miners accidentally killed Gerran, destroying his airspeeder while trying to capture him. Serra became very depressed, and Lucia, concerned for her friend, decided to exact revenge on the miners' leader, Gelba. She traveled to the space station Paradise and hired an Iktotchi assassin, the Huntress, to assassinate Gelba. Meanwhile, however, the king had allowed for the Jedi Order to dispatch an ambassador, Jedi Knight Medd Tandar, to meet with the miners and begin negotiations, and the Huntress also killed Tandar during her attack. The next day, Serra and Lucia met with the King and agreed that they should travel to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to ensure the Jedi that the Royal House had not been behind the attack on Tandar, in order to avoid a diplomatic incident. After their meeting with the King, Lucia revealed to Serra that she had been the one to hire the assassin, and suggested that the Princess turn her in.

The Jedi Master showed them to a monument of five Jedi that had been killed by a Sith Lord in 990 BBY. On the monument, however, was also a sixth name\u2014Caleb of Ambria. Lucia recognized the name as a healer who had lived during the New Sith Wars, and refused to take sides during the war. Obba revealed that an injured Sith Lord had traveled to Ambria after killing the five Jedi, but Caleb had refused to heal him. Obba told them that the healer had sent a message to the Jedi, telling them of the Sith Lord. Obba and a team of Jedi had been sent to arrest him, and had found the healer dead before killing the deranged Dark Lord. Unbeknownst to Lucia, Caleb was Serra's father: in 1,000 BBY, Darth Bane had threatened Serra's life in order to get Caleb to heal him, and Caleb, believing that Bane would some day return, had forced his daughter to change her name and move off-planet, so that the Sith would not be able to force the healer to cure him again. Serra thus assumed that Bane had returned and killed her father. Lucia asked Obba about the Sith that they had killed, and he revealed that the man had been thin and pathetic\u2014not at all like Serra remembered Bane.

Lucia and the Huntress accompanied Serra during the interrogation, and Lucia was surprised to recognize Darth Bane as Dessel\u2014her old Sergeant from the Gloom Walkers whom she had believed to have died twenty years previously. Serra tortured the Sith Lord with the drug injections, and Lucia was shocked by her friend's ruthlessness in interrogating the Sith Lord. When Bane revealed to the princess that he had not killed Caleb, Serra became furious and assaulted him, causing Lucia to try to restrain her from continually attacking Bane, whom Lucia believed had not killed Caleb. She pleaded with Serra that torturing Bane would not bring her father back, even as Bane insisted that Caleb had been weak, and deserved to die. Lucia countered that Bane's own strength had not mattered\u2014he had become a prisoner, anyway; but Bane declared that he deserved his suffering as well\u2014had he been stronger, he would not have been captured. Serra injected him again, and even as he began to lose consciousness, continued arguing with him. Lucia again tried to restrain her friend, telling her that she needed to calm down.

Lucia found the injection that contained a drug that countered the effects of the incapacitating drug, senflax, and injected it in Bane's thigh so that it would take a while to wake him.

As she pleaded with him, he warned her that she would not be able to stop him. Lucia refused to back down, replying that she believed she owed him her life, and that if he wanted to take it, it was his right to do so. As Bane began to gather the power of the dark side, Zannah found them, unleashing a powerful blast of dark side energy.

Lucia was also exceedingly loyal; when Serra saved her life, Lucia vowed to protect the healer, no matter what the cost. When Serra became depressed after Gerran's death, Lucia hired the Huntress to assassinate the miner who had caused Serra's depression; an action which she compared to her decision to kill Ulabore.
