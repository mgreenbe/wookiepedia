The ship's databanks contained records of the first hyperspace explorations, and the starship crashed in the Elrood sector on the planet Akana. However, a datapad containing the ship's distress signal was found thousands of years later during the Cold War between the Republic and the Sith Empire, and the datapad's discovery led to the discovery of the crashed ship itself on Akana."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
