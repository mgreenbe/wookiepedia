It was different from the Souk in that it had permanent shops. It had wide, straight streets and was easily accessible from the Slips. It was where most of the bulk shipping took place. It also was populated with warehouses and storage and had more stringent security than the surrounding neighborhoods."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
