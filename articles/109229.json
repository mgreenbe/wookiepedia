Humans were among the susceptible species, and the pain caused by the disease could be held at bay with doses of painkillers such as perigen, but there was no cure. During the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, the Empire's Moff Taigo was diagnosed with the disease and acquired several organs from the black market in order to replace his infected organs. Zelebitha Effhod, the First Minister of the Coruscant Ministry of Ingress, died from Quannot's Syndrome in 22 BBY on the eve of the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Around 12 ABY, the Jedi trainee Nichos Marr was diagnosed with Quannot's Syndrome, and though his lover Cray Mingla sought to cure him, her efforts to transfer his consciousness to a droid body failed and Marr died."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quannot's Syndrome first appeared in the 1995 novel Children of the Jedi, and has been mentioned in several reference guides and other material since then."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
