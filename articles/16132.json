Bendak tried to hide in a deep hole in the ground, but Fett located him. When a group of hired mercenaries cornered Fett and tried to kill him, Fett killed Bendak, switched clothes with him, and launched him out of the hole using the jetpack. Thanks to this ruse, and due to the fact that Bendak looked remotely similar to Fett, the mercenaries assumed that they had killed Fett."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
