The actual habitable areas were small, sited beneath a twenty-meter fissure in the crust which masked the ship's cooling vanes, and the crew consisted of just seven warriors, two shapers and several Shamed Ones to deal with the less salubrious aspects of the ship's operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the fleet gathered for the attack on Yag'Dhul, the Stalking Moon was captured by the Jedi Anakin Solo, Tahiri Veila and Corran Horn. Tahiri, who had been conditioned with a working knowledge of Yuuzhan Vong biotechnology as part of an attempt by the invaders to brainwash her, was able to pilot the ship, and the Jedi alerted the Givin before the attack began."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
