Although steep, the route was ten meters wide but did not include any guardrails. Vehicles traversed the Grand Avenue around the clock, and one Gorothite j'ber had cornered the market by running a passenger and cargo taxi service along the route. The Grand Avenue was named after the triumphal processional on Chandrila of the same name, but it gained its name sarcastically."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
