Probably the smallest precinct house on Cularin, it was a square one-story structure with only one door. It had a small front room with a pair of desks and half a dozen chairs, a holding area, and a supply closet. Hidden behind the supply closet was a stairway which led down to a secret meeting room which had a round table and nine seats. The room was used by the Cularin resistance, and resistance leader Gerta Haman had OPC agent Corporal Ortin, secretly also a resistance member, bring a group she was recruiting here to meet with her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
