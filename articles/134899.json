Any starships that got too close to a star cluster would be destroyed by its powerful gravity field. At some point, a star cluster imploded somewhere in Wild Space, forming a powerful, maze-like energy anomaly. That anomaly concealed the location of Lira San, the original homeworld of the Lasat people. Despite being normally impossible to navigate, the star cluster allowed the rebel starship known as the Ghost to pass through after Garazeb Orrelios activated its hyperdrive through the ancient ways of his bo-rifle. Two pursuing TIE fighters, who did not have such protection, were destroyed by the gravity. The Minos Cluster was a star cluster within the borders of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
