The Cloud and her unit travelled to the Outer Rim Territories planet Elphrona to kidnap the Blythe family so they could be ransomed to wealthy relatives in the Core Worlds. During the raid, the Jedi of the Elphrona Outpost were alerted to the attack and pursued the pirates. When the pirates became aware of the pursuit, Margrona attempted to arrange an ambush, ordering Rel and Egga to find good vantage points on either side of the canyon they were travelling through."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Jedi Master Porter Engle sensed the ambush, although his steelee mount was killed by one of the pirates, and told Loden Greatstorm and Bell Zettifar to continue the pursuit. One of the pirates shot at Engle's back, but he deflected the shots before killing the man who had fired at them by throwing his lightsaber, cutting him and the ironstone outcropping he had hidden behind in half. Engle then used telekinesis to deflect a shot fired by the other pirate, who retreated to where they had left their own mount and attempted to escape. When the Ikkrukkian Jedi caught up to the pirate, he presumed that one was the one who had shot his mount, before injuring them with their own deflected blaster bolt. However, as Engle prepared to take the steelee and rejoin the pursuit, the pirate, who he presumed to be a member of a species whose brain was not located in their head, sat up. Engle was saved by the charhound Ember, a companion of the Jedi, who breathed fire onto the pirate until he stopped moving. The Jedi Master and charhound then set off to catch up to the others. Ultimately, the Jedi were able to rescue three of the Blythes and kill Margrona and all of her Strikes, but Greatstorm and Ottoh Blythe were captured by Dee and her Tempest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rel first appeared in the 2021 novel The High Republic: Light of the Jedi, by Charles Soule.
