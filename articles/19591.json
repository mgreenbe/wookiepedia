Developed with the intention to be used by the Galactic Empire, they were abandoned due to the unsteadiness of the technology involved, and a number of bot-drones fell into the hands of Wef, an arms dealer who often worked for the Hidden Hand crime syndicate. Rebak, an operative of the Rebel Alliance, requested to purchase the bot-drones, but the bounty hunter crew led by Beilert Valance wished to use them in their hunt for Darth Vader.
