As the tide of the battle turned in the Confederacy's favor, Ventress engaged Tholme in a lightsaber duel and struck him down; according to Dooku, as part of a later attempt to turn Tholme's former Padawan Quinlan Vos against Ventress, her murder of Tholme had violated Dooku's orders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
