He was the final uninfected clone left on the ship, falling victim to the parasites when the other possessed troopers trapped him in a cargo room. The clones Scythe and Edge pinned him down, while Havoc took one of the brain worms and infected him, a scene witnessed by the horrified Ahsoka and Barriss. Later, after Ahsoka discovered that the worms could be killed by frost, she ruptured the ship's cooling tanks, curing this clone trooper and the rest of the crew."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
