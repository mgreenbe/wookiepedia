It was a crudely-written language made of throaty rasps and deep vocalizations. Written Balosur seemed less complex than written Basic due to its crude aspect, but in fact was considered to be no less complex than Basic. Notably, the non-Balosar Marcus Sione had learned the language and spoke it fluently."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
