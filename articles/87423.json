Features, age, disfigurations, even species could be concealed with the Mask (though the latter would require an incredible amount of skill to accomplish convincingly). Owing to its molecular nature, the technique lasted until altered, and even a thorough medical examination would not reveal anything out of place, unlike the tell-tale scars of surgical alterations. As it was a product of the dark side of the Force, it was susceptible to powerful blasts of dark side energy. If the subject was not careful, the Mask would literally melt away, making further attempts at concealment (even with the Mask) difficult."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is said that the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, a master at Sith alchemy, may have used this technique in order to conceal his appearance from the people of the Republic and hide his true nature under the fa\u00e7ade of the mild-mannered Naboo politician Palpatine. When Jedi Master Mace Windu reflected Sidious's lightning blast back at him, the Mask would have melted away, disfiguring him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The \"Mask\" ability was created by Star Wars Roleplaying Game author Gary M.
