At first, Desh hadn't recognized Solo, and was more intrigued by the Ryn, and attempted to determine what Vergere was. Upon recognizing Solo, he assumed Solo was in charge of the defectors. When Solo told him about Chewbacca's death at the destruction of Sernpidal, Desh expressed his sympathy, but hadn't known about that beforehand. It was too risky to let Solo live however, so he forced Solo into a deactivated transfer tube drop shaft, knowing that Solo would die on impact with the ground."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unluckily for Desh, Elan was using her status as defector to infiltrate the Jedi so she could assassinate them. As Desh was transporting Elan back into the hands of the Yuuzhan Vong, she exhaled Bo'tous spores into the shuttle, killing Desh and his cohorts, while she and Vergere took refuge from the spores in the rear holds of the shuttle. Having survived the drop shaft by grabbing Droma's tail, Solo later discovered Desh's corpse in the pilot's seat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
