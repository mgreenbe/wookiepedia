For many, it has all the force of an alternative reality. To understand Star Wars' lasting attraction we must look beyond thrilling action and special effects to a very rich and universal source: the power of myth and legend. The Star Wars universe draws on a common stream of mythic tales which are rooted deeply in our own life stories. This book is a graphic visual guide to one of the greatest mythical adventures of the modern age."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Contents"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The tour"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The book was originally available as a giftshop item from Kellogg's Star Wars: The Power of Myth tour in 1999. This event, designed to promote Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace and Kellogg's own cereal-based promotion of the film, covered much the same ground as the book- the connection between the Star Wars saga and real life myths and legends. The easiest way to recognize a copy of the book obtained from the tour is by lack of a barcode on the outside back cover."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On page 16, the book erroneously claims that Luke Skywalker brought down an AT-AT by entangling its legs with his snowspeeder cable, when in fact it was Wedge Antilles, and his gunner Wes Janson who did so in The Empire Strikes Back."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collected in"}]}
