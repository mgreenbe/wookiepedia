Rebel A-wings dropped out of hyperspace and engaged the Beta-class ETR-3 escort transport Trap Door as it finished laying Type A mines around the supply cache in the asteroid cluster. The Imperial Assault Gunboats, moving in a two-pronged pincer formation, moved to intercept the Rebels and prevent the Heavy Lifters of Beetle Group from carrying off the supply containers. Planning for difficulty, it was arranged that if the battle tilted in favor of the Empire, T-65 X-wing starfighters of Green Squadron could enter the area to help Blue Squadron clear the Assault Gunboats and protect the Heavy Lifters. Whether this occurred is unknown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As players can participate in the mission \"Ambush of Rebel Supply Recovery from Obran Cluster\" in the computer game Star Wars: X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter on either the Rebel or the Imperial side\u2014both sides have conflicting mission objectives\u2014and victory is not essential to access the next set of missions, the battle itself is considered canon but the canon outcome is unknown."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ships listed in this article are those found in the battle Rebel Alliance Operation: Quick Strike, using the default craft assigned to the player."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
