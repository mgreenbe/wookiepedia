The planet had paid its dues to Coruscant, but was undefended when tragedy befell the planet. The planet suffered from an outbreak of brainrot plague, which slammed the population of Jabiim. And prior to the Clone Wars, Trandoshan bandits attacked and conquered Jabiim's lands. After the bandits moved on, the Lythian Pirates attacked the world, seizing small communities and killing many. Despite paying its due taxes to Coruscant and requesting aid, Jabiim received no help from the Republic in any of these cases."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of the lack of assistance from the Senate, the Jabiim Congress sided with Count Dooku's growing Confederacy of Independent Systems. Republic agents on Jabiim informed the Galactic Senate that the Congress had been undermined by Separatist influences. In fact, Alto Stratus had orchestrated a coup, killing most of the Loyalist members of Congress. Although he spoke eloquently about the \"oppression\" of the Republic, many believed these words had been purchased with weapons, supplies, and credits by the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Negotiations spearheaded by the Alderaanian Diplomatic Corps were rebuffed as Jabiim geared towards war. Jabiim was a planet that was rich in valuable ores. None of these ores could fall to the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

After a failed Rebel raid on Carida, Imperial leaders decided that Jabiim was the most likely planet as a launching point of the raid. Darth Vader led an Imperial fleet to wipe out the Rebels on the planet. The resulting attack was known as the Battle at Jabiim, which resulted in Vader not only succeeding in taking control of the planet, but also learning the location of Kalast, a Moff who had sided with the Rebels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, after the Battle of Yavin, Jabiim's ore supplies had been diminished because of Imperial over-mining. Emperor Palpatine was not willing to pull the last of his troopers off Jabiim, despite the repeated harassment of the local Jabiimi rebels, which had persisted for 19 years. The Rebel Alliance dispatched a task force lead by Luke Skywalker to support the Jabiimi. Though as Luke set foot on the planet, he realized that he had stepped into his father's shadow. As a Padawan, Anakin Skywalker had served on Jabiim, and the locals did not forget or forgive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the Empire launched a second invasion of Jabiim.
