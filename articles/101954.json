Ottas were curious, intelligent, and playful. They had a flexible spine for limber movement in and out of water and always being in motion, these swift water creatures outswam their predators and nearly always caught their prey, which included mee and daggerts. A single pup often clung to the belly of its mother, until old enough to defend itself. The Ottas' typical prey were Ollopoms. They were also known to prey on Tookes, and Pom-hoppers. Ottas also crack open Nyorks with rocks on their chests."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
