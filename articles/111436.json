Eagerly taking on his role in the new Empire, Rampart oversaw the implementation of chain codes as well as the enlistment of soldiers for the Imperial Army as part of Project War-Mantle.

He assisted in the transition from Republic to Empire, wishing to strengthen the foundations of the newly-formed regime. Rampart was responsible for the implementation of chain codes, a form of identification for citizens of the Empire. He issued a holographic message regarding chain codes that was displayed at Imperial chain code posts; the message informed citizens that chain codes allowed for the exchange of now-invalid currency for Imperial credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rampart also oversaw Project War-Mantle, an initiative to recruit conscripted soldiers into the Imperial Army to replace the clone troopers formerly used by the Republic. As part of the project, he assembled the first Elite Squad, consisting of four recruited Elite Squad Troopers. Rampart traveled to Tipoca City on the planet Kamino to showcase the squad to Governor Wilhuff Tarkin. Upon meeting with Tarkin, who was watching the enhanced Clone Commander CT-9904 \"Crosshair\" alongside the Kaminoan Nala Se, Rampart's superior complimented the success of his chain code implementation before asking of Project War Mantle's status. Rampart proceeded to inform Tarkin of the recruits' presence, and that the Elite Squad was to train under the command of Crosshair."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Project War-Mantle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On their way to the hangar to meet the squad, Rampart asserted the need for more soldiers. Nala Se insisted that the Kaminoan cloning facilities were capable of producing effective clones, but Rampart believed that enlistment though choice would yield troopers with more loyalty to the Empire. When they arrived in the hangar, Rampart presented the Elite Squad, which he suggested could be trained by skilled clones. Shortly afterward, as Rampart and Tarkin watched the squad undergo a medical examination, Kaminoan Prime Minister Lama Su expressed doubt over recruits being able to match clone troopers in military proficiency. Rampart protested, asserting the value that he saw in the loyalty of willing recruits. To settle the debate, Tarkin proposed a test for the squad; the governor sent them and their Clone Commander to Onderon to eliminate a camp of insurgents led by Saw Gerrera."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the squad's Nu-class attack/transport shuttle returned to Kamino in triumph, Vice Admiral Rampart and Governor Tarkin awaited them in the hangar.

The meeting was interrupted by Crosshair, who reported that the Scrapper Guild on the junk planet Bracca had detected a power surge on a wrecked Jedi cruiser. Rampart ordered Crosshair to send a scout team, but the clone requested more forces, revealing that the source of the surge was Clone Force 99, a rogue unit of clone commandos who had previously escaped Kamino. Though Lama Su insisted that the clones of the unit were highly skilled assets and as such should be returned alive if possible, Rampart, disinterested in rogue clone deserters, dismissed Lama Su and ordered Crosshair to terminate them if they were found."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Occupation of Ryloth"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Uncertain support"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rampart, Crosshair and the elite squad went to the Outer Rim planet Ryloth, where the native Twi'lek population was uneasy with the Empire's military presence, which the preceding Republic had promised to remove after the Clone Wars. In Ryloth's capital city of Lessu, Rampart held a mass gathering at the Capitol building, alongside Senator Orn Free Taa, the Twi'lek Resistance General Cham Syndulla, Cham's wife Eleni Syndulla and the clone Captain Howzer of Ryloth's local clone battalion. Rampart received a report from Crosshair that one of the Empire's skeptics, Cham's lieutenant Gobi Glie, and several fellow insurgents are within the crowd, and Rampart explained his displeasure to Taa at the senator's people's apparent lack of support towards the Empire. Taa reassured the admiral that he spoke for the people that the partnership was most welcome. Rampart inquired whether Cham agreed, to which the Twi'lek general supported peace for Ryloth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rampart watched on as Senator Taa failed to galvanize the support of the people of Ryloth, having delivered a speech about how the Empire would bring peace and prosperity to the planet and that the Twi'leks should step down from their military posts. Cham stepped in, reassuring the crowd by reminding them about how the clones helped liberate their world from the Separatist Alliance and had earned the Twi'leks' respect. After the speech, Rampart remarked to Eleni that it was a shame that her and Cham's daughter, Hera Syndulla, could not be a part of the occasion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a meeting with Taa and Crosshair, Rampart exclaimed that Cham was being more cooperative than he had been led to believe he would be, to which Taa responded that he was worried about the general's influence over the citizens. Crosshair believed Glie was more of a threat than Cham, but the senator believed they all need to be dealt with, to which Rampart stated that everyone had their part to play. Later on, the admiral showed Cham and Eleni around the doonium refinery, claiming that it would help rebuild areas affected by the Clone Wars across the galaxy. Eleni was concerned at the militaristic aspects of the facility, but Rampart responded that the Republic had left Ryloth in a vulnerable position, something which the Empire was rectifying in order to protect the planet's interest, before excusing himself after receiving a message from one of Crosshair's squad."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Arresting insurgents"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rampart received intelligence from Crosshair that Glie, Hera, and the Twi'lek resistance fighter Serin were on a supply run to smuggle weapons, having attached a homing beacon to their ship. Upon their return, the ship was shot down by Crosshair. The trio were quickly apprehended, and Rampart arrived with Taa and numerous clone troopers, expressing how distressing it was to see Hera's involvement in this operation. Taa angrily claimed that Hera's involvement was clear proof that Cham was plotting an uprising against the Empire. However, Rampart disagreed, saying that the public would not see it that way, and that Cham had not technically committed a crime yet. Hera, Gobi and Serin were taken away in a HCVw A9 turbo tank, while Crosshair informed Rampart he had spotted three more of Gobi's insurgents on the mountain ridge. Rampart told Crosshair to hold off and let the resistance fighters report back, having the commander to get into position regardless."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rampart's convoy, comprising of the juggernaut and escorting BARC speeders, was intercepted by Cham and Eleni and the remaining insurgents, and he expressed concern at the whereabouts of the reinforcements, with Howzer stating the comms had been cut. Taa ordered the remaining troopers to defend them, but Rampart had Howzer and his men stand down and surrender. This horrified Taa, but Rampart reassured the senator that his decision would keep them all alive. With Hera reunited with her parents, the insurgents pondered on what to do with Taa, Rampart and the other prisoners. Cham and Taa become locked in a bitter exchange in which they both accused the other of being a traitor, leading to Cham pointing a gun at the senator. Taa pleaded with Rampart and Howzer to do something, but Rampart was unmoved, stating that Cham was the one holding the blaster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With some encouragement from Howzer and Eleni, Cham lowered his weapon, and Rampart thanked Taa for playing his part, signalling Crosshair to shoot one of Taa's lekku from a vantage point. At this exact moment, Imperial reinforcements arrived to aid Rampart and Howzer, leading to the capture of the Twi'lek fighters present, except for Hera and C1-10P \"Chopper,\" who escaped on a landspeeder. Rampart then formally arrested Cham and the insurgents for the attempted assassination of Senator Taa. As Cham, Eleni, Gobi, Serin and fellow fighter Lenk were all led away, Rampart ordered Howzer to assemble his forces to locate Hera, before departing in one of the Low Altitude Assault Transports with the prisoners."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A human male, Rampart had brown hair, brown eyes, and light skin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vice Admiral Rampart eagerly took on his role in the newly-formed Galactic Empire, which aimed to instill order in the galaxy. Rampart perceived the end of the Clone Wars and the formation of the Empire as a chance for peace, claiming it would bring with it opportunity and prosperity. He saw importance in laying a strong foundation for the new Empire and believed that an increase in soldiers was necessary to maintain order and permit a strong ruling government. As such, Rampart's efforts in Project War Mantle sought to produce loyal soldiers without the need for clones, and he was confident that his proposal would strengthen the future of the Empire. Rampart felt that the loyalty of those who willingly enlisted was more valuable than the training underwent by clone troopers, believing that with training, his forces would be unlike anything the galaxy had seen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the effort to expand Imperial presence and power across the galaxy, Rampart was particularly patient, cunning and opportunistic in his approach.
