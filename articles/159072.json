It was originally a mineral-rich world and was setup as a manufacturing center. As the resources were depleted, it was abandoned and became a dumping ground for unwanted machinery and waste products. The only inhabitants were droids that were left to perform automated maintenance on the buildings. Saujutta-Ok-Topii saw the potential in the planet and arranged for Syndicate One to purchase it. To hide its true purpose and keep it obscure, the company had the planet re-classified on star charts as a airless moon orbiting a gas giant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Valgauth had constant precipitation. The moisture in the air would contact the surface and evaporate, creating a corrosive vapor that would condense and fall to the ground again. A benefit of the atmosphere was that it made it extremely hard for sensor scans to detect anything on the planet. Any vehicle entering the atmosphere had to be steam sterilized within 20 hours or risk suffering mechanical and electrical malfunctions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet was the location of The Yard, headquarters of Syndicate One.
