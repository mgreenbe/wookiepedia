Despite not knowing the language, C-3PO attempted to extrapolate its grammar from other percussion-based languages. His attempt was not entirely successful, as he confused third person with first person imperative. C-3PO's mistake offended the Kakrans, but he was able to reconcile with the species, who took him the Elders of Kakra. C-3PO managed to translate the language, and speak to the Elders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
