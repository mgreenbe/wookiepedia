Thanaton was born in 3695 BBY as Teneb Kel, a slave of the Empire who was discovered by the Sith Lord Calypho and taken as his apprentice on the Sith holy world of Korriban. There, Kel trained in the art of assassination and the secrets of the dark side of the Force until his Master's heresy and ambition resulted in Calypho's arrest and internment by the Empire's Dark Council. Now forced to carry the burden of his Master's disloyalty, Kel was sent by the Council to serve with the Imperial Military on the front lines of the Great Galactic War against the Galactic Republic and its Jedi Order. There he was joined by his Abyssin slave Maggot and achieved many successes on the battlefield\u2014including a vital victory in the battle for Begeren, wherein Kel's efforts ensured that the ancient Sith world would be reclaimed by the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, even after numerous military triumphs, Kel still carried with him the taint of his Master's failures in the eyes of the Dark Council. To ensure his obedience and put the young Sith to proper use, the Council recalled Kel to the Imperial capital of Dromund Kaas in 3678 BBY. There, they forced him to combat and nearly kill the imprisoned Calypho before giving Kel a mission of the utmost importance: to locate and execute Exal Kressh, former apprentice to the Sith Emperor and traitor to the Empire. After receiving direction from the Emperor himself, Kel took Maggot to the Lenico system where he unsuccessfully attempted to kill the rogue Sith; he was beaten by Kressh and left stranded on the dead world of Lenico IV, where he experienced a Force-induced vision that revealed to him Kressh's history. He learned that the Emperor was planning on turning her and countless others into his \"Children\"\u2014puppets of his will and extensions of his presence\u2014thereby ensuring his immortality and omnipotence. Kel escaped Lenico IV with Maggot's help and tracked Kressh to Korriban, where she had sparked a massive battle to distract from her plans to destroy the Emperor's Children. In the tombs beneath the Valley of the Dark Lords, Kel caught and killed his quarry, but was also forced to murder Maggot to ensure the Emperor's secret plans would not be revealed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His victory over Kressh and knowledge of the Emperor's Children allowed for Kel to return to the Dark Council and demand that they promote him from an apprentice to a Sith Lord. He seized the mantle of Darth Thanaton for himself and went about building a formidable power base within the Empire's Sphere of Ancient Knowledge. Throughout the remainder of the Great Galactic War, Thanaton gathered to himself a considerable amount of influence within the Imperial hierarchy and garnered a reputation as a strict Sith traditionalist\u2014one who sought to uphold the historical precedents of Imperial politics and dark side philosophy. This disposition repeatedly brought him into conflict with Lord Zash, a young Sith witch who bucked tradition in favor of pursuing her own paths to power. Thanaton and his ally, Darth Skotia, believed Zash to be a corrupting influence, particularly given her supervisory position at the Korriban academy. Together, they worked to block her ascension until 3643 BBY, when Zash manipulated her apprentice into murdering Skotia so that she could access the Dark Temple on Dromund Kaas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thanaton's attempts to punish Zash for the murder backfired and the Dark Council instead promoted her to Darth Zash, replacing Skotia as Thanaton's immediate subordinate. To Darth Thanaton's chagrin, Zash used her new position to pursue knowledge of immortality and spirit transfer by way of her apprentice, sending the slave-turned-Sith into the Dark Temple and the galaxy beyond to gather ancient artifacts of power. Zash's gambit ended when she was killed by her own apprentice, who then took the title of Lord Kallig. Around this time, Thanaton ascended to the Dark Council and used his place on the Empire's governing body to pursue the death of Kallig, who he believed was equally as corrupt as Zash. Despite his rise to the pinnacle of Sith power, Thanaton failed to kill Kallig on several occasions, motivating him to declare that he and the young Sith would engage in a Kaggath on the contested world of Corellia. The ancient Sith honor battle ended in defeat for Thanaton, who was forced to flee the planet and seek aid from his fellow Councilors on Korriban. Thanaton was followed and again defeated by Kallig in view of the Council; the elder Sith's weakness and violation of Kaggath decorum disappointed the Dark Lords and Darth Mortis snapped Thanaton's neck for his failures. Following his death, his command of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge was passed to Kallig, who took Thanaton's seat on the Council and the name Darth Nox."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The trials of the Sith"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Early life and training"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The man who would be known as Darth Thanaton was originally Teneb Kel, a Human male born in 3695 BBY within the territory of the Sith Empire.

Calypho pulled the young man out of slavery and took him as an apprentice, instructing him in the methods of the Sith Inquisitors and training him in the discipline of assassination. Kel's Master specialized in the art of divination and foresight and taught his pupil that one's power to gain insight into the future was most potent when the recipient was close to death. In addition to training in assassination and visions, Kel enthusiastically studied Sith history and philosophy in preparation for his future roles within the Empire's Sphere of Ancient Knowledge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3681 BBY the Empire, which had been hidden in the Stygian Caldera since the end of the Great Hyperspace War, revealed itself to the galaxy and launched the Great Galactic War against the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order. In the first year of the conflict, the Empire reclaimed the ancestral Sith holy world of Korriban and reestablished the Sith Academy on the surface. It was there that Kel trained under Calypho, undergoing many trials in the ancient tombs and caves hidden beneath the Valley of the Dark Lords. During his trials, Kel spent days trapped in these crypts, fighting for his life with a training saber and the dark side of the Force. He ultimately succeeded in escaping the tombs and returned to the academy only to find his trails had been for naught; Lord Calypho had been scheming against the Empire's ruling Dark Council and overstepped his bounds, prompting Councilor Darth Marr and other Sith Lords to condemn and arrest him. Kel walked in on Calypho being taken into custody and was also arrested as per Sith tradition\u2014the students of corrupt Masters usually shared their teacher's fate. However, in consideration of the fact that Kel had not completed his training under Calypho at the time of the arrest, the young Sith was spared internment and was instead sentenced to an extended period of service alongside the Imperial Military in its campaign to crush the Republic and reclaim ancient Sith worlds."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The fields of battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the beginning of the war, Kel traveled to the forested world of Cholganna in the Outer Rim Territories and participated in a skirmish there. Imperial forces prevailed in the engagement and summarily executed their opponents, but Kel chose to give mercy to an Abyssin warrior named Qawohl. The elderly alien was taken by Kel as a slave and forced to follow and serve the young Sith in his missions and adventures across the galaxy. Kel, unable to speak or understand Qawohl's native language, forced the Abyssin to communicate exclusively in Basic Standard and dubbed him \"Maggot,\" thereby depriving him of both his culture and his true name. Nevertheless, Kel formed a close but formal master-slave relationship with Maggot, who pledged to protect his owner and obey his command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3678 BBY, Kel and Maggot joined the Imperial Army for their invasion of the planet Begeren in the Esstran sector. The world\u2014a treasured holding of the previous Sith Empire which had been turned into a mining colony by the Republic\u2014was attacked by ten thousand Imperial soldiers in an assault primarily focused on the Republic governor's cliffside palace. Kel and an Imperial commander devised a plan in which the Sith apprentice would infiltrate the palace and execute the Advozse governor while Army forces below engaged the Republic defenders. Although Kel used his assassination skills to sneak into the palace, his presence was detected by the governor's guards who quickly whisked him away to safety in a sealed blast shelter. The young Sith's plan was set back by this development, and he was forced to scale the side of the building to evade the palace security forces. Atop the structure he intercepted the governor as he fled to his shelter with two guards. While his target barricaded himself in the blast-proof command room, Kel quickly used the Force and his double-bladed lightsaber to kill the two guards and break through the barrier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The young Sith derided the Advozse governor for his participation in the Republic's desecration and profiteering on Begeren, proclaiming that the world rightfully belonged to the Sith as he drove his lightsaber into the governor's chest. With his objective complete, Kel signaled Imperial High Command to inform them of his success. Although his actions won the battle for the Empire, losses were heavy and the forces fighting outside the palace were largely decimated by Republic bombing runs. Kel surveyed the scene after the battle, where he found a grievously injured Maggot amongst piles of dead Republic and Imperial soldiers. He retrieved his slave and helped the Abyssin back to the Imperial camp, where he permitted the surviving Imperial forces to celebrate their hard-fought victory. His own elation was cut short however, when an Imperial major approached him with news from the Dark Council: Kel's service on the battlefront was at an end and he was to face the Dark Lords once more for further punishment. Kel and Maggot surrendered themselves to the major's soldiers and were ferried back to the Empire's capital world of Dromund Kaas."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Hunting for power"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kel arrived on Dromund Kaas during a time of celebration, as the Empire lauded its recent military victories in its capital Kaas City with parades and ceremonial observances. The Sith and his slave observed the revelry from their air taxi as it ferried them to the Sith Sanctum in the Imperial Citadel, where Kel would face the Dark Council. Deep within the Citadel, Kel came upon the Council chambers where he found his former Master, Lord Calypho, badly beaten and fully capitulated on the floor before him. Although Calypho greeted his apprentice in trust, the assembled Dark Councilors\u2014including Darth Marr and Vowrawn\u2014ordered that Kel kill his Master. The apprentice complied without hesitation, immediately blasting the elder Sith with Force lightning. Calypho quickly recovered and drew his own lightsaber, engaging in a short duel with his apprentice. Kel quickly overcame the tortured and tired Calypho, but was prevented from killing his Master by the Council, who insisted that the renegade Lord still had some knowledge to offer.

Her execution had been ordered as a defector and it was Kel's duty, as determined by the Dark Council, to hunt her down and end her treason. Although he was confused by Kressh's reasons for dereliction, Kel accepted his orders and followed Darth Marr to face a final test before being accepted for the assignment. He trailed the Dark Lord even deeper into the Citadel until he was brought before the Emperor himself. Deep in his sanctum, the Emperor evaluated Kel and informed him that he could still feel Kressh's psychic presence in the Lenico system. Kel eagerly agreed to find her, and when the Emperor touched his head the power of the dark side overcame the young Sith and rendered him unconscious for a full day. Kel's body was brought to a Fury-class interceptor, where he was found and cared for by Maggot.

In the Hutt's chambers, Kel and his slave were confronted by Ybann's two guard droids, which drew their weapons and fired on the young Sith.

The young Sith eventually happened upon a chamber of medical stasis pods, where his approach triggered security measures to wake the one patient within: Exal Kressh. The sleeping Sith quickly arose and armed herself, hiding among the chamber's labyrinth before fiercely assaulting Kel.

He was ultimately overwhelmed by his opponent's use of Force lightning, but Kressh chose not to strike him down; instead, she hinted at her reasons for betraying the Empire and the Emperor's mysterious plans before allowing Kel to flee the scene. Their battle caused heavy damage to both Kel and Lenico Colony Blue, which soon fell out of orbit and began to lose power. Defeated and broken, Kel hurried to his interceptor to escape the system with Maggot, but the ship had been jarred away from the Colony's docks and was connected to the station only by a tether of debris. Because the hangar bay's containment field failed and vented Colony Blue's atmosphere into space, Kel had to call upon the Force to allow a short but deadly space walk along the tether to reach his ship.

After defeating a large terentatek, Kel began to weaken from his wounds and made camp to rest. While meditating Kel had a Force vision of Exal Kressh accompanied by Darth Thanaton, a masked Sith who was to guide him in his Force vision. The two led him through an Ortolan colony as Kressh recounted to Kel her history with the Emperor and hinted at the Emperor's plans.

After aiding the colonists, Kel traveled back to his ship. Upon ascending the ship's entry ramp, Kel impaled Hulis' Padawan, who had been talking with Maggot.
