Cid and her employees, the clone mercenary unit known as the Bad Batch, stole the spice that Durand was set to sell to the Pykes in order to disrupt his deal and remove him from power. Durand learned that the spice had been stolen, informing the Pykes, who forced Cid and the Bad Batch to retrieve it. Durand was held by the Pykes, as well as one member of the Bad Batch, Omega, who was used as their hostage until the Bad Batch had retrieved the spice. While being held, Durand told Omega that Ruby did not like many people when his pet snuggled up to her. After the spice was returned safely, the Pykes allowed Durand to live, but cut off one of his horns as punishment. Durand departed, leaving the parlor back in Cid's hands."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Roland Durand appeared in \"Infested,\" the thirteenth episode of the first season of the series Star Wars: The Bad Batch, released on Disney+ on July 23, 2021.
