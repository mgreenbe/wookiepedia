Gra'aton studied as a Consular, specializing in the field of diplomacy and becoming a well-respected diplomat. On a mission assigned by the Jedi High Council, Gra'aton was part of a relief effort to Dathomir that included fellow Masters Vulatan and Yoda, as well as at least fourteen Padawans. Attempting to salvage the wreck of the lost praxeum ship, the Chu'unthor, the Jedi were met with the Witches of Dathomir, who guarded the wreck from the Jedi. After losing fourteen Padawans to the Witches, Yoda negotiated the release of the surviving passengers of the ship and received the guarantee of the Witches to protect the ship's treasures from the violent Nightsisters, a dark side worshiping local cult consisting of female members."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
