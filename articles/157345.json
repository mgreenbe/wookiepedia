They hatched from beautiful shiny eggs, which would sometimes be mistaken for actual gemstones. The creatures were initially very small, but they could grow to great sizes, towering over the native species, such as the Ewoks. A large population of serpents made their residence in a Lost Temple on Endor. It was unknown whether the original builders of the temple had realized that the \"gems\" they had housed in their treasure room were actually the eggs of the serpent, but by 3 ABY, they had disappeared, leaving the serpents as the only inhabitants of the structure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
