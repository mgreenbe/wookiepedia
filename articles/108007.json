The adept using this power enjoyed a better protection from attacks in combat. This could be achieved by making use of the natural power of the giant Firaxan shark that the Selkath called the Progenitor. The Progenitor's Call allowed an Order of Shasa devotee to sense and channel the overwhelming call of the Progenitor, confusing and distracting the mind of a target, and disrupting opponents' actions. The Call echoed in the mind afterward, and this persistent condition took as much as eight hours to wear off."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
