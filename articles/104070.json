The character's name was revealed in the \"Rogues Gallery\" feature of Star Wars Insider 145, released in 2013. Tim Veekhoven, Kevin Beentjes, and Sander de Lange, who contributed to the article, envisioned him as the uncle of Jann Tosh, a character from the TV series Star Wars: Droids: The Adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO. Further speculation was made from the authors about Tosh being one of the Palace Guards killed in the explosion of Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala's J-type diplomatic barge. Because it is unclear if the extra portraying Pedric Tosh is visible at all in Attack of the Clones, this article makes no assumption about the exact time of the Palace Guard's service."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
