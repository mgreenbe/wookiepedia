Originally printed by Marvel Comics, these stories have been meticulously re-colored by Digital Chameleon, using the original 1980s comics as reference. Far, Far Away collects issues 96 to 107 of the original series, taking place after the classic Star Wars trilogy, as our beloved Star Wars heroes continue to fight remaining Imperial Forces and new evils following the Battle of Endor. \"Supply And Demand\" is a gem of a story, with comics legends Archie Goodwin and Al Williamson whisking Han Solo and co-pilot Nien Nunb off on a mission to a former Imperial prison planet. Mary Jo Duffy and Sal Buscema offer an excellent underwater adventure in \"School Spirit!\" as Luke Skywalker and Lando Calrissian return to the water-planet Iskalon and are reunited with old allies. Nine of these stories feature the unique art style of Cynthia Martin, who worked with writer Jo Duffy to tie up loose plot lines and bring an uplifting end to the series. Each volume in this Star Wars: A Long Time Ago... set is sure to please both new and old Star Wars and science fiction fans, and the entire set is a great companion to and expansion of the classic Star Wars trilogy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collected issues"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
