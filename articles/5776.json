Despite this, the scene appeared in various adaptations of the film, starting with Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition, a novelization written by Mur Lafferty and released on September 4, 2018. The novel adaptation of the scene bore only slight differences in dialogue from the film's script. The audiobook of the novel also differs slightly from both the film and novel, as Almudin's use of the term \"smart-ass\" is removed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The scene was depicted for the first time in the first issue of the comic adaptation of Solo, released on October 10, 2018, and written by Robbie Thompson with illustrations by Will Sliney. The depiction of the military tribunal in the comic adaptation differs in several ways from the film script and novelization, including Almudin's dialogue. This article assumes that the dialogue from novelization takes precedence in canon over the comic adaption. The scene itself, in which Almudin was portrayed by Ramon Tikaram, was then included as a deleted scene on the home-video release of the film. Due to its inclusion in the novelization, this article treats the deleted scene as also being canonical."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
