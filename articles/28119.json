The Coalition organized their takeover from within a warship that they had purchased from the Trade Federation, and the Cularin Militia staged an attack on the craft whilst it was near to the city Tolea Biqua on Genarius. The Militia succeeded in destroying the craft, causing wreckage from it to rain down onto Tolea Biqua, making the atmosphere of Genarius more unstable and rendering the planet uninhabitable."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
