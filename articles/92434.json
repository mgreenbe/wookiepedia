The outpost, in order to fit into the waterworld's environment and culture, was a gigantic raft grown out of coralite with kelp dangling from the underside. Drifting with the currents, the outpost provided a reeflike habitat for local sea creatures. Around 232 BBY, Jedi Padawan Bell Zettifar, stationed at the Elphrona Outpost, would have been happier with the Mon Cala posting due to Elphrona's harsh environment, although he did love the outpost itself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mon Cala Jedi outpost was mentioned in the 2021 novel The High Republic: Light of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
