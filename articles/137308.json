However, according to the novel, there was not enough time to notify Rebel command of the \"Endor Project\" plans being transferred on the Suprosa. Therefore, there is no mention of Ace. The novel implies that other than Luke Skywalker and Dash Rendar, all of the pilots present were Bothans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Shadows of the Empire level taking place in the Suprosa makes the ship look substantially larger than it seems from the exterior.
