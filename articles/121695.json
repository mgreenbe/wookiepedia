However, these individuals were not convinced on an open rebellion against the Empire, as they felt that it would be too risky to engage in such an act. It was decided by General Rahm Kota, that there needed to be an action that made the Empire look weak."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Marek agreed to \"meditate\" on the matter and find a target. Instead, he consulted with Darth Vader. Vader ordered him to destroy the Imperial shipyard above Raxus Prime. His plan of attack consisted of using the ground facility's Ore cannon to fire a massive chunk of molten ore and scrap metal at the facility, destroying it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To that end, Galen and the crew of the Rogue Shadow made their way to Raxus Prime, which was now firmly under Imperial control."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Arrival"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon landing, Rahm Kota asked if there were any communications coming from the murdered Jedi Master Kazdan Paratus. When he heard there was none, enquiring that he was killed, Starkiller showed no look of remorse and affection. When disembarking from his starship, Starkiller discovered that the planet was in the grip of a small war between the Empire's forces, the Rodian Salvage Guild, and the native Jawa clans. This resulted in Marek being forced to defeat any opponent in his path, as they were concerned with fighting against one another. He sighted an Imperial dropship transport and attempted to make his way to the dropship landing pad."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After fighting through numerous Rodian heavy defenders and Rodian rippers, Marek began to encounter the native Imperial garrison, which deployed an AT-ST along with stormtroopers through the dropship transport to deal with the Force user. Starkiller, however, managed to defeat these opponents before linking his comm with Juno Eclipse, and informed her that a dropship pad was nearby, and if she could override its controls to which she said she could, but required some time. As she sliced into the computer controls remotely, Marek was busy dealing with the Imperial forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Juno was successful in opening the hangar bay doors at which point a number of Purge troopers along with AT-ST support challenged Starkiller's entry into the facility. Upon defeating the Imperial forces, Marek made his way to the dropship pad, where he disposed of numerous stormtroopers on an Imperial dropship transport at which point he boarded the craft, and traveled to the Imperial Ore Facility."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Infiltration"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the top drop pad, Marek departed the dropship transport allowing it to crash into the junk filled landscape after which, he made his attempt at infiltrating the base. Upon entering the hangar bay, Starkiller disposed of the guards, before using an elevator to gain entry deeper into the base, where he killed two Imperial officers. It was at this point that Galen made his way to the central ring of the facility. Along the way, he fought against numerous stormtroopers that were attempting to protect the base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After destroying the shield generators protecting a doorway into the facility, Starkiller took the elevator deeper into the base. Using the Force, Marek realigned the door mechanisms in order to move further into the ore refinery. Going through various corridors in order to reach the central ring, Galen was forced to fight the defending stormtroopers that guarded the facility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Marek moved through the refinery parts of the facility in order to reach the central control room. After defeating the guards, he attempted to realign the Ore cannon so that it targeted the orbital shipyard. Before he could accomplish this, however, he was attacked through the Force by one of the Emperor's Shadow Guard that was sent to protect the facility. Using a number of Shadow Troopers as the guardsmen's backup, they attempted to kill Starkiller. However, he managed to kill all the Shadow Troopers, and fought against the Shadow Guardsmen. Marek was victorious and used the Force to grip the Guardsmen in the air, and sent him flying into the molten core being assembled at the ore cannon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taking another elevator, Galen reached an external part of the Imperial base."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Unexpected Foes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Marek moved to another point in the facility, he came under attack from another one of the Emperor's Shadow Guards. After a tough battle against this foe, Marek managed to defeat the Guardsmen at which point its appearance changed, thus revealing Starkiller's droid companion PROXY. The droid's tactical computers and programming made it attack its master, as part of his training. Furthermore, the battle computers made PROXY believe that it was the perfect opportunity to attack his master, kill him, and thus fulfill PROXY's programming. To that end, he transformed to the next programmed sequence in his droid brain, which was that of Maris Brood."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thus, Galen was forced to fight the combat stances of enemies he had previously defeated, as PROXY constantly changed his form in order to use a new tactic against his master. This included transforming from Brood, back to the Shadow Guard, and to General Rahm Kota, as well as Shaak Ti. Despite putting up a fight, Starkiller managed to defeat each incarnation of PROXY. Weary as well as desperate to complete his mission, Galen told PROXY to shut down, as there was no one inside him that he had not already defeated. However, the droid asked his master to give him some credit, and stated that there was one combatant that he had studied, which might defeat him. To that end, PROXY holographic appearance and stance changed to that of the Sith Lord Darth Maul."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A furious battle was fought between the two with Starkiller gaining the advantage, by breaking PROXY's Darth Maul's double bladed lightsaber in half. After which, Galen threw the droid at a nearby wall, and used the broken two lightsabers to impale PROXY through his shoulders, thus disabling him. With that complete, Marek went forward to complete his mission."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Victory"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the exterior of the Imperial ore facility, Galen's task was to overload the accelerator in order to destroy the orbital shipyard. To accomplish this, he had to reach four towers, which possessed rail gun tracks that aided in the projection of the refined ore into space. This was a difficult mission, as numerous stormtroopers of varying types were protecting the towers, and attempted to kill Starkiller. At the control room, he also encountered a Shadow Guard that acted as the head of the facility. He then proceeded to duel the guard, and then hurled him into the molten refined projectile just as it was prepped for launch."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the various tasks were complete, Starkiller bore witness to a molten refined projectile being fired from the cannon, which struck the orbital shipyard, thus destroying it. However, this was not the end of the threat as a single Star Destroyer was let loose, and began plummeting to the ore facility. The ship was not falling to the Imperial base, as it remained in low orbit, where it used its TIE fighters as well, as its own weapon batteries to kill the suspected Jedi Knight. Galen attempted to flee, but was told by Rahm Kota that he would never be able to escape in time, and told him to use the Force to pull the massive ship into the ore cannon. Marek did not believe that such a task was possible, but at the prodding of Kota, he attempted to accomplish the feat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite being besieged by TIE fighters, Starkiller used the Force to turn the Star Destroyer, and bring it crashing into the ore facility, which destroyed both."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Starkiller narrowly escaped with his life, as the Star Destroyer crashed into the junk filled landscape. He quickly informed a worried Rahm Kota that he was alive, who in turn told him to get back to the Rogue Shadow so that they could continue their campaign against the Empire. From the wreckage, Galen was surprised to see his droid companion PROXY was still functional. Helping the droid up, Marek learned that the worried droid was distressed as he believed himself to be useless as his primary programming\u2014which compelled him to attack Starkiller\u2014had been erased. A happy Galen, however, aided the holodroid as they returned to the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The destruction of an Imperial shipyard, which was a symbol of the Empire's might, showed that they were capable of being defeated to those political figures that opposed Palpatine's reign.

The duel against PROXY is not featured in the PS2, PSP, and Wii versions of the game, while the fight against the Shadow Guard at the Ore Cannon's controls is not featured in the PS3 or Xbox 360 version of the game. Additionally, while Starkiller brings down an Imperial Star Destroyer in all versions, only the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game make the sequence playable - all other versions have Starkiller destroying the vessel in a cutscene."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
