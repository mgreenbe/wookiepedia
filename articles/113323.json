It was mostly a construct of cargo containers and prefabricated structures. The conditions were horrendous and the refugees were ruled over by brutal Serroco thugs and the Exchange.

She decided to help the Refugees by curing Geriel of a deadly plague, helping Nadaa free her daughter Adana, find a job for Odis as a pilot, help Aaida escape the Refugee Quad and reunite with her husband Lootra, help Kahranna find a ship to Telos, and help Hussef to stop the Exchange and the Serroco from bullying the refugees. Thus, though the refugees did continue to exist on a shoelace, their conditions improved greatly. As a result, the Exile became very notorious in the eyes of the Exchange. While in the Refugee Sector, a pair of Twi'leks told the Exile the true nature of her companion, Atton Rand, and after Atton revealed to her more about his past, the Exile agreed to train Atton as a Jedi Sentinel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the player chooses the dark side path, the Exile can instead help the Exchange further break the will of the Refugees."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
