After years of study he graduated and was selected by a Jedi Master as a Padawan. After years of study, Belzara took the Trials of Knighthood and passed to become a Jedi Knight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In about 31 BBY, Belzara accepted a solo mission from the Jedi High Council; he was to be the recipient of a cargo ship flying in from the Almas Academy and return with it to the Temple. The ship's cargo was an ancient Sith artifact known as the Pulas, which had been recovered by the Jedi on Almas and sent to the Temple for analysis. Arriving at the designated landing platform, Belzara was ambushed by a group of Sith cultists called the \"Believers\" and killed. The Pulas was never on the ship however as the Council had expected such an assault. The true artifact was turned over to the Temple while the cultists were hunted down and defeated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
