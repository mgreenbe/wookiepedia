Being waders and runners, they could cover long distances quickly both in and out of the water. Pikobis also had long, pointed beaks lined with sharp teeth that were used to spear and hold onto slippery prey which it usually swallowed in one gulp."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These creatures possessed large, webbed feet which they used to create shadowy areas to attract fish, keen eyesight, external ears which were different from those of most reptavians, and a long tail for balance while it ran. Pikobis could shed their tail when attacked. The tail would grow back quickly, even sometimes forked. Scientists have also studied the Pikobis for medical purposes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Pikobi traveled in pairs or groups of five to six.
