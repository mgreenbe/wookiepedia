This smuggler, along with a few Gotal servants, and Tee Va, another Moogan, traveled to Mandalore to deliver tea. But Tee Va decided to double the profit by adding slabin to the tea, which in turn made it poisonous. One night, when the crew arrived at night to deliver more tea, this Moogan smuggler met with the customs officer and bribed him into letting them work. However, they were caught the next day by Duchess Satine Kryze, the Naboo Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who had come to investigate the corruption, a few of Satine's bodyguards, and a police captain. A firefight ensued, which resulted in the deaths of one of the Moogan smugglers, two Gotals, and two royal Mandalorian guards. The surviving smugglers were then arrested."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Near the end of the episode, one of Tee Va's companions is killed by Padm\u00e9 Amidala, but it is unknown if it was this Moogan smuggler or Tee Va's other companion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
