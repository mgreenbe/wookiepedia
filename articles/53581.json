The previous owner, Iep Tumu, had made a poor job with its maintenance, but the Brentaalan mechanics had overhauled most of its problems except for an acceleration vibration."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For several years, Bernar used the Merasy in long raiding runs, obtaining a good profit and new, valuable contacts in each of them. Bernar then modified the ship upon his needs: He increased the consumables capacities and bought advanced entertainment. He also bought the best available astrogation charts (including secret, cooperative and military charts) that allowed him to save several days per trip. Obsessed with logging his trips, he made backup charts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He almost managed to get rid of Tumuy's vibration."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After several years of profit, Bernar sold the ship to invest in a high-speed shipping venture.
