A group of Twi'lek Pilgrims, their homeworlds devastated in the Great Galactic War, petitioned the Galactic Senate to allow them to establish a colony on the recently rediscovered world. However, the Senate refused their petition, as the planet was largely unexplored and still potentially dangerous. But in defiance of the decree, the Twi'leks established their colony anyway. The colonists landed in a valley in the Tythos Ridge, a mountain range just to the east of the still-under construction Jedi Temple. There, they established a small camp, which over the next decade developed into a large village."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located on the edge of the native Flesh Raiders' territory, the Twi'leks begrudged the Jedi Order who refused to protect them due to the illegality of their settlement.
