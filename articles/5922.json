A relatively flat region along the coastline, the Lowlands were home to Fort Orrus and the estate of House Teral, as well as the estate of House Teraan, but House Baliss ousted the Teraans and took over the estate as their own during the Alderaan Civil War. Wardpost Duvaal was located in the Serene Meadow, the name given to the eastern section of the region, and the Mensaav Military Laboratory was built into the mountainside north of the meadow and House Teral. The Frostflower Path ran along the coastline, linking the area to the Apalis Coast to the west."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
