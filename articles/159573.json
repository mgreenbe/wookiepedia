According to Hutt legend, it was devastated in a cataclysm that vaporized its atmosphere and obliterated its moons, as well as all other planets in its star system. The planet was located in the Ardos system, in the Hutt Space oversector. It was the original capital of the Hutt Empire, from the empire's formation in 25,200 BBY, to the planet's destruction in 15,000 BBY, where the Hutts relocated to Nal Hutta, as the sector and empire's new capital."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Varl was a conquest of the Rakata, and was a part of the Infinite Empire for some period prior to the rise of the Hutts."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The cataclysm"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Hutt legend, the planet Varl orbited around two suns, Evona and Ardos.

The Hutts fled Varl before the cataclysm, and soon resettled at their colony on Evocar which they promptly renamed Nal Hutta. They believed that by surviving the cataclysm they had been elevated to the status of 'near-gods'. The planet they left behind was reinhabited by the descendants of abandoned servants of the Hutts, with only a few squalid manufacturing centers built in airdomes."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Speculation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tale was generally dismissed as more Huttese hyperbole, and the most commonly accepted alternate theory was that the Hutts destroyed their world themselves in some ancient civil war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Interestingly, there were signs indicating that the cratered wasteland of the planet Varl was once a pleasant green world, and besides many asteroids, no other world orbited the white dwarf, Ardos.
