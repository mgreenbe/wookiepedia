Their rivalry took a turn for the worse, as Snitkin sabotaged a weapon of Odle's, which resulted in the death of one of Jabba's pets. The Baragwin got his revenge when he shot Snitkin on Jabba's sail barge in the frantic battle over the Pit of Carkoon during the attempted execution of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca. Although only stunned, Snitkin was unable to escape the blast. Odle, however, did escape and traveled to Mos Eisley, where he stole one of Jabba's starships and left Tatooine for good."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Return of the Jedi, mime artist Phil Herbert wore a full-body creature suit to portray Hermi Odle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hermi's deformed lip is unique to him.
