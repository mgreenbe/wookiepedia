When Talon Karrde and his group of smugglers entered the Exocron system to visit Jorj Car'das, David gave them permission to land at Circle 15 of the Rintatta City military landing field. David sent Karrde's crew the coordinates for the landing site, and provided them with an escort while they landed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "David later commanded the force from the Air-Space Fleet posted to prevent Exocron from the incoming pirate fleet of Rei'Kas, pursuing a vendetta against Karrde.  Rei'Kas's lieutenant, Xern, openly mocked David's rank, measured against the size of his fleet, and his demand that Rei'Kas withdraw his forces, but David simply withdrew his forces toward the planet, waiting until Rei'Kas was trapped in Exocron's gravity well before the Aing-Tii jumped into the system and annihilated the pirate fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
