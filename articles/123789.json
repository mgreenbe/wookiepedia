At the beginning of the party, both players got the same contingent of at least nine kinds of pieces pieces, which included the Beast, the Counselor, the Craft, the Disciple, the Dowager, the Imperator, the Knight, the Outcast, and the Vizier. Each kind of piece had a distinctive appearance. The Imperator, for example, was shaped like a tall, bent man wearing a hooded robe. The Knight was a hulking hooded figure holding a long weapon, and the Vizier was a thin man wearing a large, pillar-shaped hat. The pieces that belonged to each player were distinguished by color: one player had black pieces with white highlights, and the other white pieces with black highlights."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Rules"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The object of Shah-tezh was to make an inescapable and indefensible attack upon the enemy Imperator, while protecting one's own. Each piece upon the demesne had its own special role and associated moves. For example, the Vizier could only move along the diagonal of the demesne, but had no limit to how many steps it could take. However, the Knight could only move two steps at a time, but in any direction at all."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The game of Shah-tezh was created eons before 19 BBY.
