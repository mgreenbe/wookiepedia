When the Hutt lost control of the Cularin system's crime to Nirama, he hastily sold off many of his possessions. A pair of Trandoshans bought his barge and converted into the preeminent casino of Tolea Biqua. The Trandoshans had a history of bad blood with the Hutts, and found the opportunity to buy a Hutt's barge too rich to pass up on. They probably gave the establishment such a transparent name as a gesture of contempt toward the Hutt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The barge was divided into two sections\u2014a public (but pay) area and a member's only section.
