In 1 BBY, Vox commented on the entry for the AS-M12-series messenger droid, relaying information that some of the droids were programmed to hunt down targets and explode. The droids were modified by equipping them with detonite, a proximit detonator, and information regarding a target's bio-signature. In 0 ABY, Vox commented on Class I Defense Droid entry, passing on information that the Corporate Sector Authority's Security Police had deployed a large number of the units against the Trianii. In 2 ABY, Vox gave advice on turning MD-series medical specialist droids into security droids by replacing the medical module with a security chip. Vox reasoned that the medical droids were cheaper than security models, and that no one would expect a medical droid to be used in such a fashion. A fellow commentator, Gunman, rebutted Vox's idea, citing the fact that a medical droid had poor targeting, no inbuilt weapons and core programming that prevented it from applying lethal force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
