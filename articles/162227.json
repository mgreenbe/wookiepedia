They were primarily scavengers, but were known to bring down larger animals in packs. It is unknown which planet they were native to, though some researchers speculated that they were once a sentient species driven to near-extinction by the Killiks and taken to Alderaan to work in the Killik hives. Others suggested that they were descended from Killik Joiners who mutated unexpectedly and were driven from the nests. The vulagools feared, hated, and actively avoided the Killiks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
