Like many of the merchants on the space station, he would deal in black market items, as well as slaves, and also spy for the Galactic Empire for additional income. Due to the unsavory nature of his work, Rudaga had Trandoshan bodyguards in his employ. In 0 ABY, Rudaga was approached by the Empire to take in one of their spies, Inferno Squad member Seyn Marana, who would pose as his slave. Marana's plan was to be captured by members of the Partisan remnant cell, called the Dreamers. The Dreamers were known to be making their rounds on Otor's Hub, liberating slaves and dealing any blows they could to allies of the Empire. When the Dreamers arrived at Rudaga's store, Marana assured the Dug that he would be safe. In truth, Marana's words were only meant for comfort and the rebels killed him in his office."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
