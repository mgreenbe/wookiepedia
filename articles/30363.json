They were discovered by New Republic Intelligence when they were scouting locations underground for possible 'safe houses'. After initial encounters, they learned to leave the corridor ghouls alone, who served as a form of natural defense system against intruders. In appearance, the ghouls were four-legged animals that stood about a meter tall with pale skin, large ears, long teeth, and no visible eyes. They navigated by echolocation, using high pitched screams in concert with their ears to locate prey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
