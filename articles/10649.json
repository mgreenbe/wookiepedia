The cannon was deemed to be their attempt in creating anti-orbital weaponry with it possibly being more powerful than its successors in later generations given the nature of Rakatan technology. During the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire, the Dread Guard attempted to gain control of the ancient weapon and use its power for the Dread Masters. Once having learned of this, the Republic and Empire sent strike teams into Section X to destroy the weapon's energy core using ion detonators spoiling the Dread Masters' plan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
