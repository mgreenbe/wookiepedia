Following the sacking of Foerost, new battlefronts opened up across the galaxy because of the advancing Sith Empire. The Sith advanced on Roche, Axxila, and Battle of Allanteen; then, the Empire and conquered Yag'Dhul. At the highest extent of the Sith Empire, the planet remained under Imperial control as part of an isolated area of Sith space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Yag'Dhul makes its only appearance in The Essential Atlas.
