The mission was assigned to Squad 40 of the 501st Legion's Imperial Commando Special Unit, which was made up of Niner and Darman Skirata, clone commandos from Omega Squad, and Rede, who was a recent addition to the squad."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Squad 40 tracked Yelgo to the Coth Fuuras space station and tried to separate him from the civilians. Sensing that he was being herded, Yelgo tried to lose himself in the crowds but accidentally revealed his position when he felt Darman's anger through the Force . Trapped with nowhere to go, Yelgo tried to bring down a heavy transparisteel wall on the commandos using the Force. He was distracted by Rede when the commando broke the transparisteel glass above Yelgo's head. Yelgo was then subsequently shot twice in the head by Rede."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
