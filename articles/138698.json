The two stormtroopers made their way up the ramp to assist the then-unconscious technicians. Instead TK-422, along with TK-421, was stunned by Han Solo, stripped of his armor, tied up, and stowed in one of the Falcon's service lockers. His armor was then donned by Solo, who complained of the smell and speculated that TK-422 didn't wash himself regularly. His weapon was taken by Luke Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When a firefight broke out between the staff of Detention Block AA-23 and a Wookiee with two stormtroopers, a security team was dispatched to the hangar housing the recently captured freighter.
