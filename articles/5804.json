During the time of the Galactic Empire, Aloxor was under the jurisdiction of Governor Haveland, possessing an Imperial presence. However, the planet also hosted a criminal element in the city of Tiquwe, including several pirate gangs. Aloxor was one of the worlds that received and distributed resources for the Empire's Project Stardust. Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit dispatched a number of agents to Aloxor as part of a campaign against pirates in the sector, disrupting the operations of Tiquwe's criminals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While investigating issues in the Stardust's supply line that were a result of Savit's theft of components from the project, Grand Admiral Thrawn sent former Imperial Eli Vanto and Assistant Director Brierly Ronan to Aloxor, having figured out that it was one of the worlds where the stolen components originated. The group was briefly hindered by the pirate gang led by Sisay, but received assistance from Imperial Security Bureau agent Dayja Collerand. The Imperials were successful in their mission, discovering proof of the treachery in one of the freighters destined for the Stardust transfer point. However, Ronan's attempt to take the evidence directly to Stardust led to himself, Collerand, and the freighter being captured by the Star Destroyer Stormbird, leaving Vanto and the group's death trooper escort to return to Thrawn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located in the Aloxor system of the Esaga sector, Aloxor was a terrestrial planet with a large amount of desert terrain.

After Haveland pushed Director Orson Krennic to funnel supply chains for his Project Stardust through her territory, Aloxor became one of the worlds where equipment was brought to be repackaged and sent to a transfer point. When Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit, who opposed the use of resources on the Stardust project, orchestrated the theft of turbolaser components arriving at the transfer point, Aloxor was one of three worlds where starships and their cargo were modified in preparation for them to be stolen. Savit disguised the theft as the result of gralloc attacks, and while the transfer point's location was periodically changed to avoid the creatures, Haveland's territory continued to serve as part of the Stardust pipeline."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a cover for his dealings with the pirates stealing from Project Stardust, and to eliminate competitors, Savit undertook an anti-piracy campaign in the Esaga sector, including on Aloxor. Savit sent agents and spies into Aloxor, hindering the operations of local groups, such as the gang led by the pirate Sisay. One of the operatives was Major Dayja Collerand of the Imperial Security Bureau, who went undercover as \"Mole,\" a drifter and slicer."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Investigations and treachery"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While investigating Stardust's supposed gralloc problem, Grand Admiral Thrawn sent Imperial defector Eli Vanto, Assistant Director Brierly Ronan, and the death troopers Pik and Waffle to Aloxor, as it was the closest of the three suspect worlds. Thrawn additionally asked Colonel Wullf Yularen to have one of his Imperial Security Bureau agents watch over his operatives, and Collerand, already being present on Aloxor, was assigned the task. Vanto, Ronan, and the death troopers landed in the city of Tiquwe in a shuttle, intending to locate a starship in the Imperial spaceport headed to the transfer point and examine it. However, en route, the group was accosted by Sisay's gang, believing them to be agents of Savit. Questioned about their activities, Vanto provided a cover story, claiming to be on Aloxor to eliminate Savit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sisay led the group to her gang's stronghold, where she continued to question them. When Collerand arrived at the stronghold, Sisay called \"Mole\" in to examine the operatives' ident data cards. Collerand backed up their cover story, suggesting to take them through a back door to the Imperial section of the spaceport. Sisay insisted that she and her men accompany them, and the group traveled through the city, stopping in the building that led to the entrance. Once inside, Sisay held Thrawn's operatives at gunpoint; the Star Destroyer Stormbird of Savit's Third Fleet had arrived above Tiquwe, which she believed to be confirmation that the group were working for Savit. Collerand incapacitated Sisay's subordinates and killed the gang leader, revealing his identity to the Imperial operatives and resolving to assist them in their mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The group entered the spaceport, where they examined the freighter Brylan Ross, learning that it carried turbolaser components rather than its listed cargo and that it had been modified to draw in grallocs. Ronan intended to abandon the others and take the freighter and its evidence directly to Krennic on the planet Scarif, but Collerand remained aboard the vessel, suggesting they go to the ISB headquarters. While Ronan attempted to pilot the Brylan Ross, the Stormbird caught the freighter in its tractor beam, despite Collerand's near-successful efforts to escape. Having witnessed the events, Vanto and the death troopers walked back to their shuttle, returning to meet with Thrawn, while Savit had the Stormbird leave Aloxor in order to transfer the freighter, its passengers, and the evidence to him.

It had an Imperial presence and a general population, though both groups either helped out or hid from the criminals. Both spaceport officials and Imperials in Tiquwe were corrupted by Aloxor's criminal organizations through bribes or extortions.

While the spaceport of Tiquwe had a commercial section and a section that was affiliated with the Empire, a larger part of the port was utilized by smugglers and pirates. The commercial port was surrounded by walls, featuring sensor wire and percher guard droids. A condemned building held a narrow back entrance to the commercial section. The Imperial section of the port was similarly walled off, though it had more elaborate defenses. An underground passage from within a scorched freighter wreck led to an abandoned dispatch office within the Imperial port. Several taller buildings were situated on the rim of the spaceport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The streets of the smuggler port were winding and noisy, crowded with vendor carts, shopping kiosks, and faded storefront businesses.
