He served in the Republic Naval Starfighter Corps, fighting for the Galactic Republic he loved above all else in such conflicts as the Mandalorian Wars against expanding Mandalorian clans, earning several honors for his bravery during combat. During the war, Onasi served under Admiral Saul Karath, who would become his greatest ally and mentor. After the war ended, Onasi planned to leave the Navy and return to Telos to be with his family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, such plans were put to an end when war heroes Revan and Malak, two Jedi who had decided to fight in the war, turned on the Republic, becoming Sith Lords while taking many Jedi that had followed him to war and the Republic soldiers who served under them with them when they created a Sith Empire that would oppose the Republic. During that conflict, Telos was attacked by Karath\u2014who bombed the planet from his flagship, Leviathan, until it was made completely uninhabitable so he could prove his loyalty to the Sith. The orbital bombardment killed Morgana while Dustil, being Force-sensitive, was abducted by the Sith so he could be trained as a Dark Jedi. Onasi swore to seek revenge against Karath for the death of his family and the destruction of his homeworld; he would hold that grudge for three years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that time, 3956 BBY, Onasi played a crucial role in the search for the Star Forge, the Sith's super-productive space factory that continually fed their fleet new ships. He was stationed aboard the Hammerhead-class cruiser Endar Spire over the planet Taris when it was attacked by the Sith, now lead by Malak after he had usurped control from Revan. The former leader was then reprogrammed by the Jedi and made to forget his time as both a Jedi and a Sith before being placed in the Republic's armed forces aboard the Spire, where he met Onasi as the two were both fleeing the doomed ship. They temporarily settled on Taris while searching for Jedi Knight Bastila Shan, the only other person known to have survived the attack on the Endar Spire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After finding her, the three fled Taris and Onasi would serve as the pilot of the Ebon Hawk, their personal starship, transporting the trio and a growing group of allies across the galaxy as they searched for Star Maps that would lead them to the Star Forge, a mission given to them by the Jedi Council. As they traveled through the stars, Onasi was able to both find his son, who was then turned from the Sith ways by Revan and his father, as well as enact his revenge upon Karath, whom the group killed aboard the Leviathan. Once the Star Forge was located and destroyed during the Battle of Rakata Prime, Onasi was made an admiral in the Republic Navy, taking a leading role in the effort to help the Republic recover in the wake of the two subsequent wars. To this end, Onasi would later defend Telos from another Sith attack during another conflict that would stem from the Jedi Civil War Revan and Malak began almost a decade before."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mandalorian Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Carth Onasi, nicknamed Fleet, lived on his homeworld of Telos IV, a planet in the Outer Rim, with his wife, Morgana, and son, Dustil.

At this point he was widely referred to by a pilot nickname, Fleet. He participated in several battles, including the Battles of Vanquo and Serroco, where he met the fugitive Padawan Zayne Carrick, disguised as a janitor named Shad Camper."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pair would later meet up again when \"Shad Camper\" stowed aboard Onasi's cargo ship. Carrick asked Onasi to bring him to Admiral Saul Karath due to a vision he had had of the Mandalorians attacking Serroco. At first, Onasi believed him to be a lunatic. After Carrick then demonstrated that he was in fact a Jedi, Onasi agreed to take him to Karath, though admitted they might get themselves killed for interrupting the admiral during battle preparations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Onasi brought him to Admiral Karath on the bridge of the Courageous. Karath was impressed with Onasi, not for returning Shad Camper, but for bringing him the fugitive Zayne Carrick. As Carrick protested his innocence of the Padawan Massacre of Taris, Karath ordered Onasi to inform the Revanchists, Jedi who decided to fight in the Mandalorian Wars, of Carrick's capture. Instead, Onasi attempted to contact a Jedi named Squint, whom Carrick said could prove his innocence. Despite being unable to make contact with Squint who was on a mission elsewhere, and so with his doubts as to Carrick's innocence, Onasi nevertheless believed his story of the vision of the destruction of the Stereb cities. As such, Onasi contacted seventeen cities on the planets surface to set off tornado alarms\u2014hoping to drive anyone into underground shelters. Sure enough, Carrick's vision came true when the Mandalorians launched nuclear missiles and killed billions on Serroco."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Carrick was sealed in a cell, Onasi paid him a visit and informed him of the possibility of survival on the surface. However, the Courageous came under attack by the Mandalorians. While the rest of the crew was ordered to evacuate, Onasi, Admiral Karath and other Republic forces made their stand on the vessel as Mandalorian shock troopers boarded it. Backed into the brig, Karath ordered for Zayne Carrick's cell to opened to acquire his lightsaber, to cut into the cargo bays. However, his lightsaber was kept on board Onasi's ship, the Deadweight. Carrick had been prying out the bolts on the walls with the Force for several days and escaped, meeting Onasi aboard the ship. Karath reluctantly took Carrick with them as they fled the Courageous on the Deadweight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after escaping from the Mandalorians, the Deadweight received a transmission from Eejee, Arkoh Adasca's servant, requesting Karath's presence at a meeting aboard the Arkanian Legacy. After being informed about the exogorths, Karath quickly redirected the ship to the Legacy. Onasi accompanied Karath, Morris, and Carrick onto Adasca's ship, and was just as shocked as his superiors at the arrival of Mandalore the Ultimate, leader of the Mandalorians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Disgusted at what he witnessed, as the exogorths were tested before Saul Karath and Mandalore the Ultimate, Carth Onasi excused himself to the Deadweight. However, Onasi only visited it to grab Zayne Carrick's gear and lightsaber. Onasi returned his gear to Carrick when he discovered Lucien Draay and him standing about a piles of broken HK-24 units. Carrick came up with a plan stop Adasca. The plan would trick Mandalore the Ultimate into thinking Adasca had lured him into a trap. Carrick, disguised as a Mandalorian, shoved Onasi upon their return to the observatory, creating a distraction for Carrick to get close enough to Mandalore and Adasca. Lucien revealed himself and with the thought that Adasca betrayed him, Mandalore and his warriors opened fire on the Jedi and Adasca's HK-24 units. During the brawl, the elderly scientist, Gorman Vandrayk, seized control of the exogorths and plunged them into the Arkanian Legacy observatory, killing Arkoh Adasca. Onasi, Carrick and the Jedi managed to escape although Mandalore had also escaped to his shuttle. During the fight, Saul Karath was injured and needed to be carried back to the Deadweight, Morvis commanded Onasi to take Carrick. However, Onasi did not view Carrick as an enemy and allowed him to go free, bidding him farewell. Karath, Onasi, and Morvis successfully escaped the crumbling ship in the Deadweight and later reported to the Republic on the events on the Legacy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the successful escape, Onasi was removed from his bridge post for \"losing\" Zayne Carrick on the Arkanian Legacy. He was reassigned to the Lance Squadron, whose Aurek fighters were preventing Carrick from reaching Coruscant several months later. When Moomo Williwaw\u2014the ship Carrick was on\u2014entered Coruscant space, the squadron moved to intercept. Onasi demanded the ship to identify itself only to find that \"Shad Camper\" was indeed on board. Not being able to let Zayne escape again, he commanded the squadron to intercept the intruder. When they chased the Williwaw to the Swiftsure, Onasi's wingmate noticed that the Deadweight was flying away. He allowed his supply carrier to go, knowing that Zayne was on it. Despite letting Carrick escape once more, Onasi redeemed his post on the bridge of Swiftsure and was present for the capture of the Gladiator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Onasi continued to serve with the Republic forces fighting alongside the Revanchists for the remainder of the war, which eventually began to turn in the Republic's favor. The Republic and its Jedi allies eventually ended the conflict when Mandalore the Ultimate was slain and the majority of the Mandalorian forces were destroyed during the final battle of the war.

Soon the legions of Sith forces were joined by traitorous Republic servicemen; among these defectors one name stood out to Onasi from the rest: Admiral Saul Karath."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Onasi viewed Saul as a mentor and hero and so he was devastated when, in a test of his Sith allegiance, Revan's apprentice Darth Malak, who was previously Squint, ordered Saul to bomb Telos, due to its strategic significance to the Republic. Upon hearing the news, Onasi rushed back to his home planet but was too late to save his wife, who died in his arms. To add to his emotional pain, his son had disappeared, and though Onasi searched for him, he eventually came to the conclusion that Dustil was dead. These events deeply affected Onasi, who from that point onwards, resolved never to trust anybody, lest he suffer betrayal again. He swore that if he ever had the opportunity, he would kill Saul Karath for what he had done."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Onasi eventually found himself on board the Endar Spire as mostly an advisor, carrying Bastila Shan, a Jedi whose abilities were vital to the success of the war effort. However, the ship was attacked and boarded by Sith forces over the Outer Rim world of Taris. When Bastila and the remainder of the crew abandoned ship, Onasi remained behind to wait for and help survivors; however, there remained only one lone Republic soldier. The pair then took the last escape pod and crash-landed onto the planet below."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The other soldier was in fact Revan, though mentally reprogrammed by the Jedi Council and using a different name. Revan was knocked out in the escape pod's rough landing, and Onasi had to care for him for some time before he recovered consciousness. When Revan came around, they began exploring Taris, searching for information concerning Bastila's whereabouts. They learned of other escape pods that had crashed in the Undercity, and struck a bargain with Gadon Thek, the leader of the Hidden Beks swoop gang."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Successfully rescuing Bastila, as well as picking up a street urchin known as Mission Vao and a Wookiee named Zaalbar, the group worked to find a way off-planet, which came in the form of the starship known as the Ebon Hawk. The Ebon Hawk was held by local crime lord Davik Kang, and the group recruited the aid of the Mandalorian Canderous Ordo to steal it. They also required clearance codes to escape from Taris, and so three of the group broke into the local Sith base and obtained the codes. Retrieving the remaining members, they made it past the Sith blockade and escaped Taris."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon their escape from the Sith bombardment of Taris, Onasi became pilot of the newly-acquired Ebon Hawk, which the group then used to reach the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine. As Bastila discussed the matter of their Force-sensitive companion with the Dantooine Council, Onasi expressed his disgruntlement with being \"left out of the loop\". Eventually it was decided to train Revan, who had no knowledge of his former identity, as a Jedi. Shortly afterwards, the Council gave Bastila and the new Jedi Padawan an assignment to discover the location of the Star Forge\u2014an assignment Onasi begrudgingly assisted them with, despite feeling he could be doing more good on the front lines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The journey for the Star Forge took the crew of the Ebon Hawk to the planets Tatooine, Kashyyyk, Manaan and Korriban. On these four planets, the group searched for ancient artifacts known as Star Maps. Onasi grew suspicious of Revan's presence with them, wondering why the Jedi Council would send a neophyte Padawan along with them on their quest. Onasi eventually demanded that Revan tell him what the Jedi Council had told him\u2014something Bastila refused herself to do. Revan did inform Onasi of the Force bond he and Bastila shared. However, Onasi did not believe that was the only reason why Revan was with them\u2014still unaware of Revan's true identity as the former Dark Lord, the true reason behind Revan's presence."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Revenge"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually the ever-growing group was seized by the Leviathan, Saul Karath's vessel. At last, Onasi found himself face to face with the admiral, yet a force-cage barred his path to revenge.

Regardless, Karath was mortally wounded, and in his final moments, revealed a horrible truth to Onasi: that his mysterious companion was none other than the amnesiac Revan, former Dark Lord of the Sith. Furious, Onasi reluctantly accepted the judgment of the other party members to continue the quest, but still watched Revan, whom he had recently began to trust and consider a comrade, for any sign of a fall. Eventually, he admitted that while he wanted to blame Revan for his losses, he could not bring himself to hate him. Onasi confessed that he had exacted his revenge when Saul Karath was killed, but it did not bring him peace. He then offered Revan his loyalty, along with a promise that, if necessary, he would save Revan from himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During their travels, Onasi also encountered his lost son, Dustil, on the Sith planet of Korriban.

A game update for The Old Republic later made Onasi's outfit available for purchase by players through the game's Cartel Market system.
