Many of the prisoners were referred to by such rather than their name. When Ryn one-one-five, a member of the Ryn Network, smuggled a secret message into the compound, all three Bith and the Jenet Thorsh viewed and memorized the mathematical codes displayed by the holowafer, and escaped the compound in order to bring the information to New Republic High Command.
