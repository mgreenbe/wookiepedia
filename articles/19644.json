Written by Golm Fervse'dra, the Way outlined how Bothans should act. It stated that individual Bothans should put their own interests above those of their comrades, their family above those of other families, their clan above the other clans, and the Bothan race as a whole above other races. It also stated that anything short of violence was a perfectly acceptable method of gaining power. While revered as the most sacred text by the Bothans, other races considered it the source of everything wrong with the Bothans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
