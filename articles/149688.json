After C-3PO got his memory wipe from Senator Bail Prestor Organa he had trouble remembering R2-D2. The Gran, Garsa gave Antilles a datapad and warned him to get out before the Imperial forces found them. Captain Antilles told 3PO to get everyone back on the ship but unbeknownst to them the seeker droid was trying to send a message to an the Galactic Empire. The droid did not notice that R2 was watching."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after on their ship, C-3PO was not convinced by R2-D2's report of what he saw PTZ-1K doing. R2 insulted 3PO and rolled off. C-3PO rejoined R2 and they snuck into the cargo hold when they noticed that the seeker droid was there. While they were hiding, 3PO brought up his displeasure in doing this but R2 had ditched him. PTZ-1K tried to access a control panel but was zapped back by R2. As the astromech droid was fighting off PTZ, Captain Antilles arrived with Caibol and Bonipa to see what was going on. They took 3PO and R2 away as PTZ managed to hide. Antilles did not believe the claim that 3PO made about PTZ being a spy and the captain ordered Bonipa and Caibol to whip the droid's minds. R2-D2 spread oil on the floor, causing Bonipa and Caribol to fall. R2 got away but C-3PO was still with them. Caribol pushed the protocol droid into a dark room where PTZ was. C-3PO was relieved to see the droid but when the door closed PTZ snuck up on to 3PO."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Caribol and Bonipa continued to chase R2-D2 down the hallways, Bonipa believed the droid had a plan as he went back into the cargo hold. But the astromech was not looking where he was going and went right over the edge of the balcony, slamming into Captain Antilles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back in the room, PTZ-1K was trying to access the Communications array to send a message back to the Galactic Empire. Realizing what was going on, C-3PO told PTZ to use a binary language to send the message. On a screen, the message popped up and 3PO was happy that a droid was listening to him. But things went down hill for PTZ when the message stopped working and 3PO told him that the binary language would not work with the Corellian command codes installed. The protocol droid's trick worked and Captain Antilles with the other droids arrived to take PTZ-1K away. The captain congratulated C-3PO and R2-D2 for their work and told them that they will make a great team."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
