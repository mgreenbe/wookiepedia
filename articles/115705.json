Lanchenzoor was undaunted by the opposition she faced and continued to push for the Authority to establish an independent currency, figuring that she would either change the minds of those who opposed her or wait for them to leave their positions of power."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
