This planet was colonized when, under Rakatan domination, the Humans of Coruscant sent out sleeper ships to colonize distant worlds. These sleeper ships ended up throughout the galaxy, in locations such as Corulag, Alderaan, in the Tion Cluster, Seoul 5, Kuat, Alsakan, Argai, Axum, Anaxes, Atrisia, Metellos, and many others."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet was an early member of the Galactic Republic, and was the site of a battle in the First Great Schism in which Jedi Danzigorro Potts slew his own Master, Jook-jook H'broozin, who had joined the Legions of Lettow, though other Dark Jedi escaped, including Blendri and her Padawan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet was known for its swoop races.
