They had a variety of uses, such as creating smoke signals for landing zones, aerial attacks, or evacuation. They were also used to block the sight of enemy forces or to create chaos in a crowd. The BlasTech Nacht-5 smoke grenades used by the Rebel Alliance were modified to release colored smoke, such as red, green, or blue. Smoke grenades could either be thrown or launched from a grenade launcher."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A smoke grenade was carried by Loodux, a Rodian assassin that was hired to kill Tsillog, a Quarren ambassador.
