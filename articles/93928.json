A large proportion of Munto Codru also appeared to be covered by oceans. The planetary capital was at Capital Codru which contained the headquarters of the government as well as the planetary spaceport and the Forbidden Castle. A series of ornate stone castles were scattered across Munto Codru."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These castles were produced not by the Codru-Ji, but by an unknown extinct civilization. Their thin rock walls appeared to most visitors to be translucent and were decorated with mysterious symbols and arcane petroglyphs, causing a sense of mystery and awe to many offworld visitors. Despite these wonders, many Codru-Ji avoided these castles as they considered them to be haunted. However, they were sometimes used as provincial capitals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the planet was located within Separatist space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the most part, Munto Codru remained isolated over the centuries, with the Galactic Republic and Galactic Empire leaving the planet alone. What little industry Munto Codru could sustain was devoted almost entirely to the survival of the native Codru-Ji. As a result of this, the Codru-Ji were able to concentrate on their own complicated internal politics. Leading Codru-Ji families were often the target of \"coup abductions\"\u2014ritualized kidnappings of children by political rivals. These abductions almost always ended with the payment of ransoms and the safe return of the children."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 ABY, the New Republic Chief of State Leia Organa Solo visited Munto Codru with her children Jaina, Jacen and Anakin as part of her tour of remote member worlds. Unfortunately, her children were kidnapped by agents of Hethrir, the leader of the Empire Reborn, as part of his campaign against the New Republic's authority. Hethrir used the tradition of political kidnappings on the world as a cover, and had his Empire Youth Proctors infiltrate the compound in a skiff and detonate a pressure bomb, which knocked out everyone within its range. Hethrir then took the children off-planet; they would later be rescued."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the demise of Hethrir and his Empire Reborn, the planet joined the Galactic Alliance. In 130 ABY, Munto Codru was under the control of Governor Vikar Dorn, who turned it over to Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire.
