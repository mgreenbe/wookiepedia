Based on Coruscant deep within the Jedi Temple's Halls of Healing, the Circle was made up of some of the Order's best healers. Reporting directly to the Council of Reassignment, the Circle filled many roles, including the protection of the Healing Crystals of Fire and the organization of the Medical Corps."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Membership within the Circle was not restricted to Masters as many times Knights were inducted into their ranks. Following her completion of the Jedi Trials, Knight Barriss Offee was selected to join the Circle. Jedi High Council member Master Stass Allie was also a member."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the formation of the Galactic Empire and the Great Jedi Purge, Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious saw to it that the members of the Circle, as well as the rest of the Order, were killed during Order 66 through the efforts of the Grand Army of the Republic. Several decades after the Circle was disbanded, the reformed Jedi Order did not reconstitute the Circle. While Grand Master Luke Skywalker knew of students that would have made great members of the organizational body, such as Master Cilghal, he did not see a reason to reinstate the tradition."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
