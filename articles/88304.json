Even with reinforcements, the flesh and blood of the Republic forces are just no match for battle droids' durasteel.

Dr. Vondar is still wallowing in grief over the loss of his late friend Zan Yant, even as Zan is replaced by the adolescent surgeon, Kornell \"Uli\" Divini, who takes a liking toward Barriss, who does not reciprocate his interests because of the Jedi Order's ban of attachments. Kaird succeeds in his operations on Drongar for the Separatists and Black Sun's interests and leaves. Meanwhile, the spy, who is also working for the Separatists and Black Sun, continues his duties of sabotaging the Republic Rimsoos. Barriss nearly falls to the dark side when she takes bota to heal herself, but rejects it at the last second. She then uses her Force powers to locate who the spy is, and finds the culprit in Klo Merit. Dr. Vondar confronts him with a blaster and kills Merit, avenging Zan's death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic and the Separatists leave Drongar when they figure out that the drug has mutated into a useless weed, but its effects in enhancing one's Force abilities to the point of the dark side, such as from Barriss's case, still lives on unbeknownst to the Republic or Separatists. I-5YQ and Den Dhur depart for Coruscant to fulfill the late Lorn Pavan's wishes to look after his son, Jax, just as I-Five believes he has gained sentience.
