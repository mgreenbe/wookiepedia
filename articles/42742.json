By 4 ABY, it was considered a vessel past its prime, assigned to training missions and war games. Its equipment was stripped for other purposes so that eventually only the core components remained. Its starfighter complement was also reduced to  TIE drone fighters. Consequently, it was seen as a relatively low-importance asset in the months immediately following the apparent death of Emperor Sheev Palpatine at the Battle of Endor, escaping engagement with New Republic forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, the Edict's hyperdrive malfunctioned, and its crew was unable to repair it without replacement parts\u2014including a replacement generator, reactant agitator injector, coaxium suspension element, and 28 Imperial-standard sealing bolts\u2014that were impossible to obtain due to the Empire's fracturing. For several weeks, the crippled Star Destroyer floated through the Pormthulis system; the New Republic would capture the vessel, but they too did not effect repairs, instead allowing it to continue drifting through the system under starfighter escort."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after the Attack on Pandem Nai, the Edict was found by the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing, which drove off the Republic escorts, recaptured the vessel, and freed its Imperial skeleton crew. The cruiser-carrier Allegiance was sacrificed for parts so that the Star Destroyer would live on, serving under the 204th. Soran Keize suggested a celebration to welcome the Edict and its crew as the 204th's newest members; however, celebrations were disrupted by pilot Nord Kandende, who announced the news that Andara had fallen to the New Republic and questioned why they were celebrating instead of fighting. Following the sacrifice of the Allegiance, its commanding officer, Captain Rogart Styll, was given command of the Edict."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
