When the Jedi were sent to investigate the murder, the Ranger was ordered to sabotage their mission, he and a couple of insurgents destroyed the vehicle of Jedi Master Tahl, They confronted her but were defeated, only the ranger was able to escape, thanks to his training, this led Tahl to believe that the Rangers were indeed involved with the recent events, the next day he changed to civilian clothes to go unnoticed and informed Dairoki of the situation claiming that he never actually fought a Jedi before, Dairoki recommended using his Ranger uniform to which he neglected, then Dairoki told him about his next objective, and gave him a lightsaber the mission was to introduce the lightsaber in some skirmish between the Telos police and the insurgents so it would be found to make the conspiracy of the Rangers and the Jedi being involved in the revolution gain more strength. While the mission was successful, Dairoki didn't know that the insurgents were going to be hitting the royal palace, which resulted in the death of Nason, Crion's Daughter and Dairoki's lover, this caused Dairoki not only grief, but also a loss in credibility to his benefactor, Crion, when Dairoki explained the situation about the lightsaber to Crion, the lord replied that it would be useless if someone had seen him during the raid on the palace, Dairoki suggested that the Antarian Ranger made another appearance, but Crion said that since Tahl, who was the only person that could actually identify the Ranger, was called away by the Jedi Council, that the Ranger could just disappear and ordered Dairoki to get offworld, one way or another."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While not at the same level of power of a Jedi, the Antarian Ranger showed being capable of withstanding against and escape one like Master Tahl back when she wasn't blind, he was also trusted enough by Dairoki to carry out important missions, like sneaking a lightsaber in one skirmish, being able to survive and escape, he was usually mostly successful in his objectives and was shown to be a good pilot when he escaped Tahl with a vehicle in a street with many obstacles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ranger was equipped with a variety of weapons and tools such as a couple of blaster pistols a speeder bike his Ranger uniform and a knife which he seemed skilled in throwing.
