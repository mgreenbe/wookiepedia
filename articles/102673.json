Pablo-Jill was one of few completely computer-generated characters in the Prequel trilogy. He was one of only three CGI Jedi in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. Because of Pablo-Jill's awkward, bulky form and multi-jointed legs, it was decided that he would look best using computer animation. There was originally some confusion between Pablo-Jill and the Ongree member of the Jedi Council seen in Revenge of the Sith, with early Set Diaries naming the other Ongree Pablo-Jill and later Sweitt Concorkill, though he was eventually named Coleman Kcaj. The character was originally meant to be Pablo-Jill, but because the Ongree in Episode III needed a more detailed CGI model, a new character was created."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
