It was a mining world that hosted numerous refineries. The person in charge of the refineries was considered more or less in charge of the planet. Kreeling's atmosphere was breathable for its human population, but had a permanent effect on their eyesight. The Kreelingi people considered the wearing of gloves in polite company to be rude."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 32 BBY, the woman in charge of the refineries, invited to a summit on the planet Naboo hosted by newly-elected Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, sent her son Tobruna to represent her. Amidala was not insulted, although she suspected that had been the intent, as she found dealing with children closer to her in age more straightforward. During the negotiations, Tobruna brought up that Kreeling was obliged to send their best ores to Naboo so the planet's artisans could use them to decorate instruments, and Amidala agreed to lift the obligation, hoping to make less flashy instruments more popular. Late in the summit, the Kreeling distaste for gloves led Amidala's handmaiden Sab\u00e9 to impersonate her after Amidala snuck out to see a concert and spilled the contents of a glitter-lit on her hands, which would not wash off easily."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kreeling was first canonically mentioned in E.
