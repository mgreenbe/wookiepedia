In 22 BBY, Kul Teska brought his droid army there to test his new gravity weapon, which was supposed to destroy Naboo's sun, proving Teska's worth to Dooku. He captured Padm\u00e9 Amidala when she went to investigate reports of Separatist activity on the planet. Not long after, the Republic launched an attack on the facility in three stages. First Clone Commander Cody and Clone Captain Rex attacked on AT-RT walkers to draw the droids' attention away from Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who managed to sneak into the facility and deactivate the shield protecting it. Meanwhile Mace Windu and Ahsoka Tano scaled a sheer cliff on AT-TE walkers to reach the facility, then led the charge inside. At some point during the battle Skywalker liberated Amidala from Kul Teska and directed her to a power regulator. While Skywalker and his Padawan, Tano, fought Teska and his droids, Amidala managed to redirect power from the firing weapon back into the base. Skywalker and Tano killed Kul Teska and the two of them, along with Amidala, managed to escape the facility on STAPs before it was obliterated by a resounding explosion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
