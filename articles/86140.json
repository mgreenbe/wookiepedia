In response, their arsenal and armor were designed to combat them, and they began to often win as a result. The Mandalorian crusaders fought against the Jedi during their crusades. According to legend, Mandalore the Great fought a series of battles against the Jedi. The Mandalorians also waged war against the Old Republic, and, during the period of its fall, members of House Vizsla reclaimed the Darksaber, a unique lightsaber created by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian ever inducted into the Jedi Order, from the Jedi Temple after its creator's passing. Before the end of the Mandalorian-Jedi War, the Mandalorians turned Concordia, a moon of their homeworld of Mandalore, into a mining base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The last great struggle between the Jedi and the Mandalorian warlords resulted in a large battle on Mandalore.

In addition, the Concordian moon was strip-mined to such an extent that its forests were only just recovering by the time of the Clone Wars, by which point some Mandalorians still held a grudge against the Jedi for their perceived crimes against Mandalore. The Peace Park, a memorial to the victims of Mandalore's violent past, was erected in Sundari, Mandalore's capital city, during the reign the New Mandalorians, a pacifistic movement that arose after local conflicts between the many Mandalorian clans. The warrior clans of Mandalore were believed to have been wiped out during the conflict, their tattered remnants exiled to Concordia, though they were resurrected by Pre Vizsla, the moon's treacherous Mandalorian governor and leader of Death Watch whose ancestors as warriors proudly fought against the Jedi for generations, during the Clone Wars. Backed by Count Dooku and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, he began building an army to retake Mandalore from the control of pacifists who were trying to bury  Mandalore's violent past and carry on its warrior traditions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Death Watch, with assistance from former Sith Lord Maul and the Shadow Collective were able to take control away from the New Mandalorians. Vizsla was killed by Maul, but the Republic, which became the Galactic Empire, occupied Mandalore. Circa 9 ABY, upon learning that Grogu had telekinetic powers, the Mandalorian armorer told Din Djarin that songs of eons past spoke about Mandalore the Great fighting the Jedi, who she revealed was an order that possessed such powers. This made Djarin question if Grogu was actually an adversary, although she told him that only the infant's kind had been enemies. After the armorer told him that he needed to return Grogu to his own kind, Djarin believed he would be searching for the order of enemies, but she informed him this task was the Way of the Mandalore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The conflict between the Mandalorians and the Jedi was first mentioned, albeit indirectly, in \"The Mandalore Plot,\" the twelfth episode of the canon animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars' second season, which originally aired on January 29, 2010.
