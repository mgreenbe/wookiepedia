After the Batonn insurgency, Chiss Imperial Grand Admiral Mitth'raw'nuruodo dispatched one of his subordinates, Commander Eli Vanto of the Imperial Navy, to rendezvous with the Steadfast so that he could join the Chiss Ascendancy. Immediately after reaching the ship, Commander Vanto was inducted into the Chiss Defense Fleet and demoted to the rank of lieutenant. He subsequently was given an intensive course in the main Chiss language, Cheunh. Instead of being given a command role, Lieutenant Vanto was placed in the analysis department, and as such, was responsible for making predictions, searching for patterns, and going through data. Eventually, the Steadfast was involved in a brutal skirmish with military forces of the Grysk Hegemony and their allies, which paved the way for several unsettling days."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the climax of the Imperial\u2013Grysk conflict in the Unknown Regions, the Steadfast returned Force-sensitive female Chiss children after the Grysks had kidnapped them. Around one year after Eli Vanto had joined the Chiss Ascendency, Admiral Ar'alani placed the Steadfast into a hard shutdown three hours after arriving at a star system in Imperial territory to avoid detection while tracking another starship from the Unknown Regions, and was there for a week hiding in an asteroid belt. At that time, Lieutenant Vanto was summoned to the bridge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Crew"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many personnel aboard the Steadfast spoke Sy Bisti, and the ship was commanded by Admiral Ar'alani.
