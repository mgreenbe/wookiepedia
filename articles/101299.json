In the days before the Life Day celebration, the bravest Wookiee hunters went searching for orgas, which they held to be sacred and consumed during the festival."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first canonical mention of the orga plant was found in Collapse of the Republic, an era sourcebook for Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars roleplaying game system.
