It was a reward from the \"Buddy Token\" system. Players who invited others to play Star Wars Galaxies were awarded these Buddy Tokens once the people they had invited purchased the game and a subscription. One token was rewarded for each person they invited. The inviting player could then redeem the tokens for this painting and other rewards, including two other paintings and a Light Bending BARC Speeder. The painting required two Buddy Tokens to acquire. It could be used in one of the player's personal structures as decoration. The painting is actually a cropped version of the theatrical poster for Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, and, since it depicts an out-of-universe image, its canon status is ambiguous."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
