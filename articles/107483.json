Following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, B'oola was leading a group of thugs active around Coronet City. Circa 1 ABY, Preens B'oola assassinated a courier working for the Corellian government in a street of Coronet City. His objective was to steal the government documents that the courier was carrying for ransom. Gallura Handerin, a government aide at the Coronet Capitol, thus tasked a spacer with finding the missing courier. The spacer eventually found the dead courier and a message from B'oola, asking for a huge ransom of 1,000,000 credits. The spacer, who was also working as a CorSec agent for Lieutenant Mack Jasper, tracked Preens B'oola to his camp on the outskirts of Coronet City and finally killed him to recover the government documents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Preens B'oola was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Preens B'oola was added to the game with the expansion Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan, released on November 1, 2005.
