By developing resonators which set up feedback in a Marasan's mind, Leth created weapons which could cause disorientation and pain in a Marasan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Initial models were hand-held devices which could be used against single Marasans, but larger, more powerful resonators could torture and incapacitate a planet full of Marasans. The threat of such collective punishment allowed the Empire to conquer the Marasan homeworld of Marasai, as well as the Marasan colonies in the Marasa Nebula."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
