The transport was held up by the Accuser, which had also brought the Immobilizer 418 cruiser Grappler to prevent them from leaving. When the Interdictor was driven out by Rebels in X-wings and A-wings both of the freighters, as well as all of the other ships, made a run for their hyperspace junctions but were fired upon by the Accuser.
