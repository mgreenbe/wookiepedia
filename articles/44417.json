By replacing several internal components with such systems, a technician could increase both the speed and frequency of a vibro weapon's blade action, and as a result, a vibro weapon could be charged for amplified cutting power, but at the expense of unpredictable power fluctuations. While there was little fear of the weapon falling apart, power fluctuations could cause the weapon's internal electronics to break down or disconnect during use, which rendered it useless until repaired."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
