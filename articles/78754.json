He left Skor II in search of the junk heap of the ancients. In the process, he discovered a talent: he could collect cast-off junk (sometimes by shadowing Imperial capital ships) and refashioned it into art. He earned a respectable profit due to the essentially non-existent overhead with regard to his art supplies. His personality was fairly normal for his species: overconfident, inquisitive, and annoying to others."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kwilper carried a datapad, a multi-pocket toolbelt, and a blaster with several non-functioning modifications.
