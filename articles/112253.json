Blades of razor grass appeared smooth and felt smooth to the touch, but were lined with microscopic \"blades\" that could slice easily through cloth and flesh. The blades were so fine that razor grass was as painless as it was deadly. One might brush up against it and not notice the bleeding for several minutes. The grass had no effect on duraplast or reinforced building materials, but was known to leave ugly scratches on speeders made of cheap metal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
