Jet-black with two large, round, orange-illuminated viewports, the ship resembled a bloated black frog. When docked, the ship sat very low to the ground on three short landing struts. Interestingly, the airlock was located on the underside, centered between the landing gear. This configuration would force the pilot to have to crawl on their hands and knees in order to enter and exit the ship. Greedo used this ship to follow Han Solo to the planet Kalkovak during the search for the Yavin Vassilika. He abandoned the ship on Kalkovak when he stowed away onboard the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
