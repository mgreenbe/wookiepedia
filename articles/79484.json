While the Order were invited by Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh to join forces with the Republic Defense Coalition in a mission against the Nihil, some members of the Order held reservations against interfering in galactic military affairs. Such Jedi included Ephru Shinn, a Mon Calamari who was selected by Grandmaster Yoda as a temporary replacement on the Council. When Shinn countered Councilor Yarael Poof's belief that the Jedi should intervene in the Nihil conflict, the Mon Calamari voicing her fears that such would only lead to further complications, Lahru rhetorically asked whether the Jedi should refrain from doing so if only for simplicity. After other members of the High Council made their stances clear, the Order ultimately decided to accept Chancellor Soh's offer. Later, Jedi Master Estala Maru informed Lahru that Master Avar Kriss had requested an autopsy of a Hutt trader who had been killed during a Nihil attack while transporting Vratixian barley. Although the request perturbed Lahru, the autopsy was authorized."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
