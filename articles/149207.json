As the Mandalorian Wars raged throughout the galaxy, Kace, believing that the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders would win, defected to their side and attempted to provide them with very own Jedi Knights by kidnapping Jedi trainees from the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine. His plan was foiled by former Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick, and Kace was taken into custody by Jedi Master Zhar Lestin.
