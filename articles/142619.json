A proper balance among intelligence and anger would grant one the aggression that can kill with precision, crush cartilage from afar, or as Palpatine claimed, murder opponents from a great distance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Palpatine also recorded the origin of his most powerful ability, Force storms, in a section titled On The Origin Of Force Storms.
