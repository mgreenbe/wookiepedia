However, Amidala declined the honor, and Jamillia ran for the position of Queen, but lost to R\u00e9illata.

At the beginning of Amidala's sojourn, Jamillia met her predecessor in the Royal Palace, and the two discussed the probability of an imminent full-scale conflict between the Republic and the Separatists. Not long afterwards, those concerns came true as the Clone Wars broke out between the two factions.
