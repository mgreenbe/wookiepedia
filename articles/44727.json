The mountains were riddled with deep caves which Jedi Masters sent their Padawans into as a trial, where some would emerge with kyber crystals. In the western part of the mountains, the city of Knossa was located, as well as the Knossa Spaceport which was constructed around Agorn Mountain. Nearby to both of these locations was the Eye of Ashlanae, a vergence in the Force which was frequently visited by pilgrims."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to the legendary Qel-Droma Epics, Jedi survivors of the Cron Supernova hid in the caves of the Eocho Mountains, and their descendants became the Ysanna people. The Ysanna would continue to live nearby to these caves, farming in the nitrogen-rich valleys near the mountains."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
