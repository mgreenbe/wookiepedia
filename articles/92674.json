Monoliths were beyond normal Sithspawn; they were seemingly unkillable creatures that were built from the dark side itself rather than by mutating an existing creature. As Vitiate's power over the population of Ziost grew, he was able to create larger and larger Monoliths, and after the Invasion of Ziost ended with Vitiate consuming all life on Ziost, two particularly large Monoliths\u2014known as the Colossal Monolith and the Worldbreaker Monolith\u2014were among the Monoliths that survived on the now barren and ashen surface of the world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
