Only careful scrutiny could pierce the immersion technique, and even then the weak-minded would remain oblivious to their presence, unless the Fallanassi in question interacted with the beings in question. Masters of Force immersion were capable of immersing others outside of themselves, such as another person or even objects, into the Current."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
