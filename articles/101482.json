Kept in a private hangar in the Capitol building in Lessu, Taa believed the shuttle's existence was a secret, so he could make a hasty retreat to Coruscant if need be. However, Eleni Syndulla knew of the shuttle's existence, and when she and her husband Cham and other members of the Free Ryloth Movement were rescued by members of Clone Force 99 early in the Imperial Era, they used the shuttle as an escape vehicle. Cham kept the starship afterwards, as he and his followers departed Ord Mantell after regrouping there with their rescuers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
