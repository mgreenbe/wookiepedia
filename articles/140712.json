More difficult than the other drag courses on the planet, it featured sharp turns and tight squeezes in between rocks and cliff-sides. The entirety of the course took place within the deserts of Tatooine. A sandcrawler would occasionally park near the course, providing an obstacle to pilots, albeit a fairly out of the way one. The Gran from Hok, Mawhonic, was favored on this course, and he would challenge other pilots to race against him here."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The course first appeared, unnamed, in the 1999 Gameboy Color video game Star Wars Episode I: Racer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
