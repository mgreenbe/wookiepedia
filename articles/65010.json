Considered state-of-the-art in 14 BBY, it had many vulnerabilities, and so production of the vessel was discontinued in 0 ABY following the Battle of Yavin. However, the cruiser continued to be utilized by the Imperial Navy up until the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 600-meter long Immobilizer 418 cruiser possessed four spherical gravity well projectors on its sharp-bowed hull. The projectors contained equipment to pull a number of ships out of hyperspace. At the time of its use in the Obroa-skai system in 14 BBY, it was considered a state-of-the-art design. With it being originally developed as part of the Deep Core Security Zone, it was later used for various other purposes. One hemispherical projector was more than enough to pull a ship from hyperspace, while the others could be used to block possible hyperspace routes for escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY, five years after the foundation of the Galactic Empire, an untested Immobilizer 418 cruiser vessel fresh from a deep dock in the Corellia system was present in the Obroa-skai system as part of an Imperial flotilla commanded by Moff Wilhuff Tarkin attempting to intercept the corvette Carrion Spike. When the Immobilizer activated its gravity well generators, its overcurrent resistors failed to prevent its gravitic systems from redlining, jolting Tarkin's flagship, the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Executrix. Following the skirmish, the Immobilizer was sent back to Corellian Engineering for reassessment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 ABY,[source?] shortly after the Battle of Yavin, production of the Immobilizer 418 was discontinued by the Imperial Navy due to its vulnerabilities, though they continued to be used throughout the galaxy due to their large numbers. An Immobilizer 418 managed to pull Luke Skywalker out of hyperspace into the Daalang system after he managed to free a high-priority asset from the Imperial cause. However, due to the ship's frequent use against Alliance raiding groups, Luke Skywalker was able to form an attack strategy against the ship, ultimately destroying the vessel by splitting it in half with an Utheel Rockcrusher Compact Seismic Charge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Immobilizer Glaciate participated in the Battle of Jakku, where it was infiltrated and captured by the New Republic operatives acting on General Carlist Rieekan's orders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Immobilizer 418 first appeared in canon in the 2014 James Luceno novel Tarkin.
