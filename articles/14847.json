The cult's thirty-four crusades against alien species and suspected alien sympathizers angered countless beings in the galaxy, but few were strong enough to stand up against the group that controlled the major galactic government."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Order had long ago recused themselves from the Republic, severing all ties and retreating to their academy world of Ossus. But around 11,100 BBY, the peaceful Caamasi were able to convince the Order to act against the cult, which had begun a series of Inquisitions in the Core Worlds to root out alien sympathizers. The Order and the Caamasi worked to inspire a religious revolution amongst the Pius Dea for the next few centuries, also allying with the planet Alsakan, the Hutts, Herglics, and Duros."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 10,967 BBY, the Renunciates declared themselves, and war broke out between the Faithful and the heretics.

Coordinating with the Renunciates and the alliance, the BoSS secretly seeded Pius Dea's fleet of cathedral ships with rogue navicomputer code. The Order and its allies gathered their forces at Uquine, baiting the Faithful into attacking the Renunciate fleet there. Just before the Pius Dea's fleet jumped to hyperspace, the BoSS sent a signal to every ship in the fleet that activated the implanted code."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "More than half of the fleet disappeared, lost in hyperspace. Many of those missing cathedral ships found themselves stranded in deep space, with their navicomputers wiped clean and their hyperdrives and communications systems rendered useless. Those aboard would be unable to return, and would eventually die from lack of supplies. The remaining ships arrived at Uquine to find themselves under attack by the combined forces of the Renunciates and the Jedi-led alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A strike team of Jedi Knights boarded the flagship Flame of Sinthara and captured Supreme Chancellor Contispex XIX, ending the Pius Dea's rule of the Republic. Contispex was taken to Caamas, where he was found guilty of crimes against the galaxy and imprisoned for the rest of his life. Without their leader, the Pius Dea faith crumbled after their defeat at Uquine. Every single member of the faith was removed from office, and Jedi Grand Master Biel Ductavis assumed the office of Supreme Chancellor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Uquine was first mentioned as the \"famous encounter\" that ended the Pius Dea Era in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Praji.
