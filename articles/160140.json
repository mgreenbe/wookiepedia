Chemically similar to venenit shadaaga, Quesh venom could be refined into adrenals, proving to be the planet's main export. Over the centuries, Quesh venom had evaporated, and much of it was found to taint the planet's atmosphere. The chemical was mined by both the Empire and Republic, and several complexes sprung up, including the Chem-Basin Mine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Venenit queshaaga had no effect on Hutt physiology."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
