The B-wing starfighter was the major output of this project, and development of the B-wing Expanded soon followed. However, the Shantipole research facility was compromised by an Imperial spy, who led Captain Kolaff to the Roche asteroids; the Imperial corvette, Javelin 3 was one starship that was sent to destroy the project. Transports such as Shantipole were able to evacuate personnel from the facility, though ultimately Ackbar's forces were able to drive Kolaff away. The light freighter Out Runner participated in the project."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
