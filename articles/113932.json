Alphabet Squadron surrounded the starship and pilots Chass na Chadic and Nath Tensent disabled the ship. The captain of the starship agreed to surrender, but was murdered and replaced by one of the crew. The new commander had the freighter open fire on the squadron, which defeated the vessel regardless. However, the RZ-1 A-wing interceptor pilot Wyl Lark accidentally shot the oxygen generator, which meant Alphabet Squadron had to tow the Imperial survivors away in escape pods."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rentaxius VIII appeared in the 2019 novel Alphabet Squadron, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
