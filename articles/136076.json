Hux sought to reform the Imperial Stormtrooper Corps in order to create an army of super-soldiers comparable to its Republic ancestor. Due to the fact that both the clone army and the Jedi Order trained their members at a young age, Hux conceived the idea of training stormtrooper recruits from birth, believing that a combination of Republic and Imperial training methods would produce excellent soldiers and loyal servants of the Empire.

The First Order scoured the galaxy's outlying star systems, such as the Jinata system, with the help of local contacts like the Jinata Security. They took human infants from their homeworlds to fill the ranks of the First Order army, and raised them to fight in the Supreme Leader's name.

The First Order wanted the Benathy to stop their expansion and was willing to use diplomacy to achieve this objective. However, the Stormtrooper Corps stood ready to force the Benathy's capitulation in the event that the negotiations failed. Their mission commander was Kylo Ren, the grandson of the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Knowing about his grandfather's history with the Benathy, Ren saw an opportunity to prove himself by finishing what Vader started\u2014the subjugation of the Benathy race.

Kristoff shrugged off Ren's efforts to influence him by way of the Force and proceeded to mock the former Jedi Padawan, prompting Ruthford to warn the king against testing Ren's temper.

Despite the doubts of Ruthford, who believed the mission was a futile endeavor, Ren managed to infiltrate the beast in order to kill it from within, where it was most vulnerable. After Ren emerged from the Zillo Beast's corpse, the Benathy submitted to the warrior who defeated the creature that they worshipped as their god.

Assigned to a division led by Captain Phasma, FN-2187 and his squadmates accompanied Kylo Ren to the desert world of Jakku, where the dark warrior sought a clue to the location of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. FN-2187 quickly discovered the reality of war when one of his squadmates, FN-2003, was killed during the raid on Tuanul.
