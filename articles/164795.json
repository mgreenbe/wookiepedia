It was a type of encasing shield, making it cheaper to produce and able to operate longer, but created a solid wall of energy which did not allow friendly ships and weapons fire to pass through except heavily-guarded firing slots or gaps. The generator required a crew of twenty-five to operate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
