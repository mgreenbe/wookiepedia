The disease was believed to be caused by a microorganism that was neither bacteria nor virus, and was considered about fifty percent fatal even when treated with muscle relaxants. Although there was no known cure for the disease, it sometimes went into remission; but it could still reappear later in life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
