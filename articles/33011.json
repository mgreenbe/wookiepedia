The insurgents quickly turned on and off the shield, allowing them to fire Ion cannons at Imperial forces during the battle there. After Governor Arihnda Pryce rescued her parents from their home which was in the shield, she detonated explosives set by Agent Gudry prematurely after he discovered Pryce's true intentions and died when he was shot. The explosion was contained by the shield, resulting in the annihilation of the area, resulting in high civilian casualties as well as the destruction of the insurgents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
