In this way, a target could be identified by ship type, model, visual details, or any combination of these, depending on the situation. These systems were most often used when it was clear that an opposing force was flying in ships that were consistently different, so that common parameters could be loaded before a battle was engaged."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
