Alone, fighters had little to no chance of penetrating the shields of capital ships, but most starfighters worked in squadrons and carried weapons like proton torpedoes and concussion missiles. These squadrons could take out a large capital ship with precision fire directed at weak points that might otherwise be hard to target (such as a shield generator or the ship's bridge)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars 1 refers to the Tantive IV as a starfighter.
