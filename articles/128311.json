Solis was only his nickname, but his \"real name\" may have merely been a serial number. Solis served a family for years. Around 220 BBY his family was attacked. He was ordered to save the family jewels, but his mistress had to use a loyalty override to prevent Solis from instead protecting the family. Unfortunately, his family was betrayed, and ambushed at their \"secret passage\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solis claimed to not remember the fate of the soldiers who murdered his family, but considering his model's loyalty, lethality, and tendency to develop personalities, that was very likely false, indicating that he killed all of the soldiers. He eventually teamed up with Fidelis, also a Footman Droid, but one who had kept most of his family. The two droids waited for 10 years outside the Jedi Temple for the time when Whie Malreaux would return to Vjun. Finally, in 20 BBY, the time came."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He and Fidelis stalked Whie and his team until meeting them on the Reasonable Doubt.

However, Asajj later refused to pay the amount she promised. Solis followed the remaining Jedi team to Vjun. After hearing Fidelis's mechanical death scream, Solis moved to the Malreaux cellar. He easily took out the A-series assassin droids, but was shot by Asajj with a neural-net eraser.
