When they landed outside of Old Ord Mantell City, where the slavers were based, Omega was excited for their new mission, and was thus dejected when Hunter told her to stay with the ship as the squad moved in. Omega sat in the ship's cockpit and played with her doll, coloring it to resemble the Bad Batch's armor. As she showed her work to Gonky, she heard voices outside.

As they helped the others escape, Omega claimed a Zygerrian energy bow off of the ground. With their mission successful, the team left to return to Cid, with Omega coming to ride on top of Muchi. Once the rancor was taken away by the majordomo Bib Fortuna, who was representing Muchi's rightful owner, the crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, Cid payed Hunter what she owed the squad and informed him about Shand, understanding that there had to be a reason a bounty hunter like her was chasing them."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First job for Cid"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After their successful mission, Omega practiced shooting with her new bow in Cid's Parlor.

However, another individual disguised as a worker went in and stole the head. Omega alerted the others of this development before she found herself face-to-face with another person, Rafa Martez. Omega quickly drew her bow, causing Rafa to freeze and put her hands up. However, Rafa convinced her to lower the bow and talk it out, and when Omega did, Rafa knocked the bow out of her hands. The bow managed to discharge a single bolt that ruptured a steam pipe, alerting the facility workers to their presence.

However, it turned out to be a prank from Wrecker, who had only let her try on a smoke bomb. The pair met up with Echo to return to the group, but Echo noticed that they were being watched by the Scrapper Guild. He and Wrecker attacked the trio of scavengers, eventually stunning all three of them.

Tech did not elaborate, but when Omega asked why a button was blinking, Tech got up and told her it was the proximity sensor.

As Hunter pondered, Omega consulted Hera, telling her that Hunter meant well and would come around. Hera asked why she trusted him, to which Omega said that he, as well as the others, were all her brothers. Finally, Omega said that if Hera could use her local knowledge to form a plan, they might be able to convince Hunter to help her. Omega and Hera concocted a strategy and introduced it to the squad: they proposed they split up to attack the refinery to draw away Imperial reinforcements away while the others infiltrated the city to rescue Hera's parents. Hunter decided to follow Hera's lead, ordering Tech and Wrecker to mount the attack on the refinery while he and Echo snuck into the city."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Omega and Hera arrive at the refinery and order Chopper to shut down the control console that are controlling the cannons stationed there. However, Chopper gets captured by two clone troopers, leaving Omega and Hera to steal a shuttle to destroy the control console.

Meanwhile, Hunter and Echo sneak into the capital and rescue Cham Syndulla, his wife, and several others.

She looked up to the squad, and even copied Hunter's mannerisms while sitting next to him. During the Bad Batch's brief imprisonment, she consoled Crosshair even though he had made a snide remark about her earlier. As the group tried to make its escape, she saved Wrecker's tooka doll Lula for him amidst the battle. Although she had no combat experience, she proved fairly capable with a blaster during a battle against Crosshair and a squad of clone shock troopers. Although she was not the most skilled fighter, she was smart as well as resourceful.

She was na\u00efve to many of the galaxy's intricacies. She was quick to trust strangers, which got her into some trouble on Pantora when she trusted Fennec Shand, although this friendliness was also helpful during the Bad Batch's mission to Corellia, when Omega quickly became friendly with Trace Martez. As the group traveled the galaxy to various planets, she was new to many of the things she saw, from the markets on Ord Mantell and Pantora to even simple things like sunshine and dirt. She was excited by seeing and experiencing new things, becoming fascinated by the soil, plants, and butterflies on Saleucami and insisting on accompanying Hunter to the central marketplace when they stopped on Pantora for a resupply so she could see the city.
