After three to sixty seconds, as selected by the user, the grenade activates the gas with a laser charge, detonating in a highly explosive fashion. The resulting explosion was very similar in appearance and effect to a blaster, but more powerful than even a heavy blaster, and dispersed over a much larger area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
