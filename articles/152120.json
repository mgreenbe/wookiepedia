A former Jedi Knight, Meetra Surik, met him in his laboratory in the Nar Shaddaa Docks and questioned him about what he was doing. The Bith scientist explained to her that he was trying to pinpoint the source of a signal that seemed to encompass the entirety of the moon. Surik offered her assistance to the scientist, who gave her a simple courier job: to pick up a package from one of his suppliers, a Twi'lek, at one of the docking pylons. When Surik arrived to meet the Twi'lek, she found only his body and no package, and was attacked by a droid. When Surik returned to tell the scientist the news, she found only his dismembered arm clutching a datapad with a message stating that he had found the signal source but was attacked by his assistant droid. Surik later learned that the Exchange crime syndicate leader G0-T0 was the source of the signal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A male Bith scientist resided on Nal Hutta's moon Nar Shaddaa during the closing stages of the Dark Wars in 3951 BBY. Meetra Surik, a former Jedi Knight, was exploring the Nar Shaddaa Docks and met the scientist in his apartment room, which the Bith had turned into a makeshift laboratory. Surik began questioning the scientist about what he was doing. The Bith explained the he was investigating a strange signal, and was using his equipment to tie into some listening devices he had installed atop the docking pylons. He explained that his species was able to detect much higher frequencies than Humans and that no matter how many signal dampeners he surrounded himself with, he could not get the signal out of his head."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bith scientist claimed that if it were not for his knowledge of such things, he probably would not have been able to detect the signal, and that due to his familiarity with such technologies, he was unable to tune it out like other Bith probably could. He noted that whatever was generating the signal had to be enormous, as it was surrounding the entire moon, and that the signal was unique in that it was buried among a myriad of other signals and background noises. The Bith speculated that whomever was generating this signal wanted to keep it as secret as possible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Surik asked if there was any way she could help, and the Bith replied that he did need a courier to pick up an important part for his equipment from a Twi'lek supplier of his at docking pylon three on the docks, as he did not have the time to leave his work. He offered Surik his thanks and 200 credits. Surik accepted and headed to the pylon, but upon arriving, she only found the corpse of the Twi'lek. She inspected the body but was unable to locate the part. The pylon door then suddenly sealed shut and a cleaning droid in the pylon attacked her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After destroying the droid, Surik returned to the Bith's laboratory, only to find his severed arm clutching a datapad with a message stating that he had discovered the source of the signal but was immediately attacked by his lab assistant droid.

He appears in a room within a series of apartments off the docks on Nar Shaddaa. The player can visit his room and receive a side quest from him. While the player is not required to start this quest or even talk to the Bith, completing the quest increases the Exchange's notice of the player's activities on the moon. The events of the quest can also be used later when talking to G0-T0 to get him to admit he is a droid. The Bith is named simply \"Bith Scientist\" in the game and shares the same model with all other Bith characters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
