The vessel served as both the flagship and mobile headquarters of the Hutt crime lord Graballa. The Rancor's Fist hosted a large complement of starfighters and could transport his henchmen. The starship also contained Graballa's throne room and a trapdoor which housed a Nexu named Smiley. The Rancor's Fist was capable of hyperspace travel but its engines could be damaged by sea water. Besides Graballa, other notable residents aboard the ship including the bounty hunters Dengar, Baash, Raam, and the Toydarian servant Yeppau."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Graballa's headquarters"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For two centuries before the Battle of Hoth, Graballa served as the manager of a barren ore mine in the Belgaroth asteroid field. The Rancor's Fist served as headquarters and flagship. Following the Battle of Hoth, Graballa tried to borrow money from his wealthy cousin Jabba to build a beachside resort and buffet. However, Jabba was not interested and refused to loan Graballa money."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Enter the Freemakers"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Graballa's \"think tank\" staff Baash and Raam invited two bounty hunters aboard the Rancor's Fist. These bounty hunters turned out to be the Force-sensitive Rowan Freemaker and his B1-series battle droid companion Roger. Graballa and his entourage soon discovered Rowan and Roger's true identities. When Graballa learned about the Kyber Saber crystal, he saw an opportunity to get rich and demanded that Rowan lead him to more crystals. When he refused, Graballa ordered that Rowan and Roger be fed to his pet Nexu Smiley."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before Graballa could eliminate Rowan and Roger, the boy's older sister Kordi and older brother Zander Freemaker entered the throne room and tried to entice the Hutt to buy a Z-wing ship. While Graballa was distracted, their \"Jedi\" friend Naare managed to free Rowan and Roger. Following a struggle, the Freemakers and Naare escaped aboard the Z-wing and broke a hole through the throne room's window. Only Graballa's large body mass prevented his entourage from being sucked out into space. Graballa ordered Dengar to lead a swam of starfighters after them but Naare used the Force to summon asteroids to crush them. Following the ordeal, Graballa ordered Dengar, Baash, and Raam to hunt down the mysterious boy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After escaping Cloud City prison, Dengar and his fellow bounty hunters returned to the Rancor's Fist. Graballa had been too preoccupied with lobbying Jabba for funds to bail his employees out of jail. However, the Hutt crime lord was pleased to learn that Dengar had learned the identity of Rowan after obtaining one of the Freemakers' business cards. Graballa tried to trap the Freemakers on the desert planet of Tatooine but they escaped with the help of Naare, who was subsequently posed as a Sith agent working for the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Hunt for the Kyber Saber"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Graballa subsequently forged an alliance with Naare to hunt down the Freemakers in return for sharing the Kyber Saber crystals. As part of the alliance, the Rancor's Fist provided firepower support for Naare's starship Eclipse Fighter during their pursuit of the Freemakers. Using the battle droid Roger's transmission pack as a homing beacon, Naare followed the Freemakers to Takodana, Ningoth, and Naboo and stole the fourth, fifth, and sixth Kyber Saber crystals. On Ningoth, the Rancor's Fist engines were flooded with seawater after the escaping Freemakers' ship StarScavenger's hyperspace jump triggered a tsunami. This caused some quarrel between Graballa and Naare, with the former resenting having to foot the bill."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Naare and Graballa were unable to track them after the Freemakers discovered their leak and deactivated Roger's transmission pack. While waiting on the Rancor's Fist for Rowan to resurface, Naare and Graballa were contacted by the Emperor and Jabba respectively. Both expressed frustration with their superiors, who belittled and mocked them. After Roger reattached his transmission pack in an effort to save his masters and their friend Jek-14 from being killed by mutinous droids led by N-3RO, Naare and Graballa took the Rancor's Fist to the planet Zoh. They proceeded to bombard the junkyard world but failed to prevent the Freemakers from escaping into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rancor's Fist along with the Eclipse Fighter and Dengar's starfighter pursued the Freemakers to the icy planet of Hoth. Unable to see through the snowy storm, the Rancor's Fist along with its companions ships crashed into a mountain while the StarScavenger managed to escape unscathed. The ship survived the collision but was trapped in the snow. While Graballa and Naare discussed their next move, Graballa's minions including Baash, Raam, and Yeppau dug the ship out of the snow. Later, the Rancor's Fist was used to attack the Freemakers at Echo Base. Kordi's refurbished AT-AT walker shot the Rancor's Fist down, causing the ship to crash into an ice lake. The impact freed the frozen StarScavenger from its tomb and allowed the Freemakers to flee offworld with the seventh Kyber Saber crystal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After making their way off Hoth, Graballa briefed Naare that his spy network was searching for the Freemakers. Frustrated with the loss of the seventh Kyber Saber crystal on Hoth, Naare threw a tantrum and used the Force to hurl Graballa and his henchmen against the wall. While Naare was meditating, Graballa received news from Yeppau that the Kubaz spy Garindan had spotted Zander and Kordi on Tatooine. At the behest of Naare, Graballa brought the Rancor's Fist to the Wheel in the Abrion system. Naare tortured Zander and Kordi and managed to lure Rowan out of hiding. Despite a fierce fight, Naare learned that Roger knew the location of the last Kyber Saber crystal and stole the battle droid's head. She then turned on Graballa and his henchmen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Graballa and his henchmen took revenge on Naare and had her frozen in carbonite.

While visiting the Mygeeto Auction House, they left the Rancor's Fist berthed at the local spaceport. After Baash and Raam accidentally bid for a Theta-class H-2 executive star shuttle, a furious Graballa returned to the Rancor's Fist where he berated his minions for their incompetence. Shortly later, the-now Rebel Alliance operative Kordi Freemaker, who was disguised as the Clawdite princess Alo Kortessi, visited the Rancor's Fist in an attempt to exchange the Theta-class shuttle for an Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Believing that \"Princess Kortessi\" was rich, Graballa kidnapped Kordi and attempted to extort a ransom from the Clawdite royal family. While Graballa's henchmen Dengar, Baash, and Raam were preoccupied with fighting off Kordi's brothers Rowan and Zander, \"Kortessi\" ingratiated herself with Graballa and offered her services as a business adviser. She convinced Graballa to install energy-efficient light emitters, lower the thermostat, and to downsize his retinue. Rowan and Zander subsequently landed in the ship's hangar. Following a brief skirmish with Dengar, the Freemakers managed to escape but Zander's Eta-2 light interceptor was destroyed. Graballa then had to contend with an employment dispute with Dengar, Baash, and Raam. Shortly later, Graballa's cousin Jabba informed him that Darth Vader was seeking his mining expertise to obtain more kyber crystals for the second Death Star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rancor's Fist first appeared in the 2016\u20132017 Disney XD animated television series LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
