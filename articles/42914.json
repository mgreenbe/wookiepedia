He was the oldest man of the clan, dying at the age of 40 which was 5 standard years longer than the average deathrate. He trained Phasma and Porr prior to 22 ABY. As he got weaker and older, the people of Scyre started seeing him as unfit to lead. Acting upon this idea, Porr murdered him in his sleep in the Nautilus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
