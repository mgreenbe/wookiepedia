The flag marked the location where the beta testers entered the game, and provided an in-universe description in memory of the \"brave Captain Moraj.\" This was recognized by the Guinness World Records as the earliest virtual memorial ever included in an MMORPG, as first noted in an entry of the Guinness World Records 2008: Gamer's Edition."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An online memorial page for Nathan highlights his valued history as a member of the beta test community, including his membership in a guild known as The Crescent Order, and as a beloved participant of the Newbie Welcome Wagon (NWW). With the release of Star Wars Galaxies in 2003, Maroj Melons were included as a starting item for players of the game. However, unlike the historical marker near Bestine, the game did not clearly indicate whether these melons were intended to be yet another tribute to Nathan Larkins (note the slight transposition of letters between Maroj and Moraj)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
