Obsessed with neutralizing the Wookiee smuggler Jakarro and his droid partner C2-D4, Kern set them up to deliver a crate of glitterstim spice to a buyer, with Depu and twenty other men waiting for them in an ambush. However, the trap failed - seventeen people were injured and four killed, while the targets escaped. Depu himself was killed by Jakarro, who bashed him to death with the very crate he was supposed to deliver."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
