During the Conquest of Makeb in 3638 BBY, the Hutt Cartel hired the InterStellar Regulators to force Kai Teyun and the others to turn the lasers to the surface and fire on anything Hutts deemed hostile. Kai's friend Mena was killed when she refused to cooperate. Teyun himself was only spared from the same fate by the arrival of an Imperial hero who killed his oppressors and gave Kai the chance to hit the Hutts back by reprogramming the satellites to be fired against them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
