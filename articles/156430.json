She and her partner arrived at Darth Nyriss's stronghold in a airspeeder firing the auto-targeting blaster cannon at the Sith Lord, who took shelter behind the statue of the Emperor. After seeing that they were turning around to make another pass, Scourge threw his lightsaber at the speeder clipping the back end. They abandoned the speeder, after beheading the statue of the Emperor and crash landing. She drew her blaster pistols and attempted to defend her partner, while attempted to free his blaster rifle of the wreckage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Scourge leapt over the speeder and slew the male mercenary before he could bring his weapon to bear. She unloaded another series of shots at Scourge, even wounding him with one shot, as her partner went down. In response Scourge Force pushed her into one of Nyriss's statues, the impact jarring her blaster from her hands, and leaving her defenseless for a few moments. As Scourge vaulted over the crashed speeder and raced to he position, she pulled out her short electrorod as she dropped into a fighting crouch. After circling each other Scourge offered her the chance to live and to work with him if she named who hired her to kill him. She hesitated for a second as she debated whether to tell him or not, when Nyriss's security chief Murtog and several guards exited the stronghold and shot her multiple times."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The female mercenary first appeared in Drew Karpyshyn's novel The Old Republic: Revan, which was released on November 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
