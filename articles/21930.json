When the gang decided to try and claim the lost treasure of the Sith Lord Count Dooku from the Obrexta III, a crashed cruiser in the Sea of Sands on the desert planet Ponemah Terminal. He accompanied the gang on board a skiff toward the vessel, and en route informed Scorza that the gang's rivals, the crew of the pirate Sidon Ithano, were traveling on a faster vessel, the Shrike.
