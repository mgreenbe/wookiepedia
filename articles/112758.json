Separatist naval commanders such as General Grievous often employed Recusant-class starships as their flagship. They saw extensive service in numerous battles of the Clone Wars, such as Saleucami, Kamino, and Coruscant.

There, Grievous used the light destroyer as a means of boarding the Star Destroyer, where he would make his way to the Steadfast's command bridge with four IG-100 MagnaGuards to engage Koth in a brief duel, resulting in the Jedi's subsequent defeat and imprisonment aboard the Recusant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after, the Jedi Temple on Coruscant received a message from Grievous about his capture of Koth, however, after the transmission ended, Clone Commander Wolffe of the 104th Battalion discovered a hidden message from the captive Jedi, which gave coordinates to sector J-19, the Saleucami system.
