In 76 BBY, Lorian Nod used her voice to let Dooku and his Padawan believe that she was on his ship. Qui-Gon, being very inexperienced yet, thought a young child could die and so he tried to save her from the pirates. However, on the ship he only found a recorder with her voice; she and her father had been killed days before."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
