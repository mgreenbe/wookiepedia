Although the mission itself was a success, there ended up being a disagreement between Vader and the Stormtrooper squad on what to do with their quarry. The former wanted to personally interrogate the man immediately, while the latter party intended to deliver him to Imperial Center for further questioning. This ultimately resulted in Vader mercilessly killing the squad, eventually telling one of the stormtrooper squad members after the latter protested that they both served Palpatine that Vader served the Emperor directly, while the elite Stormtroopers were simply compensated by the Empire for their service."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
