They were ambushed by Imperial stormtroopers and saved by the People's Liberation Battalion and other Rogues in X-wings. In the capital, Plourr chose to side with Harran and officially announced her desire to remove the hypocritical noble class from power. Plourr and Count Rial Pernon were attacked by forces bearing ties to the Priamsta and Count Arian Laabann. In the swamps, several Rogues (Ibtisam, Derek Klivian, Feylis Ardele, Wes Janson, Dllr Nep, and Herian I'ngre) were captured by Moff Leonia Tavira. Plourr finally revealed to Count Pernon and Wedge Antilles that Harran cannot possibly be the true Harrandatha, because she killed Harran herself when she was a child after he had been corrupted by Darth Vader. Moff Tavira then revealed to the captive Rogues that the current Harran Estillo was really an imposter meant to take the real Harran's place in the royal family as a spy for the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Rogue pilot Nrin Vakil infiltred the Imperial Citadel to rescue his fellows, the PLB attacked the capital with the remaining Rogues (Wedge, Plourr and Tycho Celchu) in the air.
