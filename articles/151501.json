By the time following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, the Kimogila Fanatics had conquered the territory, stealing it away from the Blood Razors and pushing them back to the other side of the Spine of Lok. The once-peaceful space system of Lok, by now riddled with war, often prevented civilians and freighters from passing through the area unharmed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A space station was located within the Umber Scale territory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
