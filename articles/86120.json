A ruthless bounty hunter, Vizla was often employed by the Sith Empire, who made use of her martial skills when undertaking the most risk-intensive missions. She assassinated Republic Senator Keenig, was part of the Imperial force attacking the planet of Alderaan, and launched a strike on a Republic political envoy, during which Vizla's brother was killed by the Jedi Master Aurei Eadon, causing her to develop an intense hatred for the Jedi Order. When the Empire launched an attack on the galactic capital of Coruscant, Vizla was contracted to disable the planet's defense grid, located within the Jedi Temple. In conjunction with a frontal assault by the Sith Lord Darth Malgus, Vizla infiltrated the Temple, proceeding to kill several members of the Temple Security Force. She successfully completed her mission to disable the defense grid, allowing Darth Angral's Sith armada to strike at Coruscant, and when the attack was over, utilized her jetpack to fly away from the Temple."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Cold War Vizla retired from Imperial service and settled with her clan on Rishi, cooperating with the Nova Blades pirates to maintain civil relations in Raider's Cove. When the Nova Blades aligned with the Order of Revan, Vizla, nicknamed \"Torch\" by the locals, broke ties with them and settled on the Tracyn Island to stay clear of the Revanites. Approached by an individual looking for intel on Revanites, Vizla challenged the intruder in combat and only provided the information after she was defeated in a sparring match. Refusing to let her clan join the all-out war, Vizla nevertheless traveled to Yavin IV to join in a fight against reborn Revan himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Eternal Empire of Zakuul invaded the galaxy and Mandalore the Vindicated was slain in battle, Vizla was chosen as the next Mandalore and reluctantly took up the title Mandalore the Avenger. She united some of the scattered clans and led them in their first victory against Zakuul in many months. Receiving an offer from Theron Shan, the new Mandalore assembled her people for a raid on Darvannis weapons factory to re-arm themselves. With her second-in-command Khomo Fett she met the Commander of the Alliance that opposed Zakuul, assigning him to work with scout Torian Cadera. Disabling the factory's shield, perimeter guns and other defenses, the Mandalorians moved inside the factory, with Vizla leading the assault. They were able to claim a large amount of weapons and deal sufficient damage to the factory before Vizla ordered an organized retreat. After the battle, the Mandalore assigned Torian Cadera to act as her representative and liaison within the Alliance, later joining it herself and making their partnership official."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early work for the Sith Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shae Vizla was a female Human Mandalorian warrior who spent her youth during the time of the Great Galactic War. In her younger years, she was earning a living as a ruthless bounty hunter, taking high-profile jobs in the pursuit of money, without a care for her employers goals. Following the return of the Sith Empire from their millennia-long era of seclusion, and the start of the Great Galactic War between the resurgent Sith and the Galactic Republic, the Sith Imperials formed an alliance with the Mandalorian warrior clans, one that remained strong under the reign of Mandalore the Vindicated. Vizla's brutal assassination of Senator Keenig caught the attention of Sith Lord Darth Malgus, beginning her a partnership with the Sith Empire. Her exceptional skill earned her a reputation that found Vizla commonly employed by the Imperials for heavy-risk operations of a large and important nature. Vizla's skill and efficiency led her to join the Empire's biggest campaigns against the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3667 BBY, during the heat of the Great Galactic War, Shae Vizla took part in the Sith Empire's attack on the peaceful Core World of Alderaan. Led by Darth Malgus, Imperial forces numbering hundreds of Sith warriors, several thousand assault droids, and a multitude of Sith troopers strong, invaded the arboreal world. Despite these odds, the Sith were held off by the combined forces of the Republic's special forces unit, Havoc Squad, and a cadre of Jedi Knights that included Satele Shan. Shan personally engaged Malgus, defeating and wounding the Sith Lord, leaving him beneath the rubble of a shattered rock face. However, Malgus escaped and returned to the war, and Shan theorized that it had been Vizla who was responsible for the Sith Lord's rescue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three years later, in 3664 BBY, Vizla was tasked with assaulting a Republic political envoy. During the course of the attack, Vizla's brother was slain by Jedi Master Aurei Eadon. The Mandalorian mercenary challenged Eadon to a duel, seeking to avenge her brother's death, but Eadon refused. This event caused Vizla to develop an intense hatred for the Jedi, though she kept the reasons behind her bitter feelings to herself."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Sacking of Coruscant"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3653 BBY, twenty-eight years after the start of the Great Galactic War, Sith forces contacted the Republic, expressing a desire to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the war. As delegates from both sides met on the planet Alderaan to form a peace agreement, Shae Vizla was contracted by the Sith Empire to aid in their surprise assault on the galactic capital world of Coruscant. Tasked with neutralizing Coruscant's defense grid, located within the Jedi Temple, Vizla found herself again working with Darth Malgus, in addition to his Twi'lek attendant, Eleena Daru. Once all three were in position at the Temple, and upon receiving Malgus' order, Vizla infiltrated the ancient ziggurat via a high window over the Temple's main entrance. At the same time, a Republic shuttle that had been co-opted by the Sith slammed into the Temple's main hall and the Sith warriors within had rushed out to engage the Temple's Jedi defenders, in what may have been little more than a distraction designed to allow the Mandalorian infiltrator to go unnoticed. Inside, Vizla shot and killed several members of the Temple Security Force as she made her way to the security grid mainframe. There, she brought down Coruscant's defenses and allowed for the Sith fleet commanded by Darth Angral to begin a planet-wide attack on Coruscant. Following the takedown of the defense mainframe, Vizla flew into the fray in the Temple's lower levels using her jetpack, where she was responsible for numerous other deaths, of both Temple Security guards and Republic soldiers alike."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the battle for the Jedi Temple, and as the Sith stood victorious over the Jedi, Shae Vizla lingered outside the ruined entrance to the Temple, surveying the damage with her helmet off and held beneath her arm. When she was approached by Malgus, the two nodded to each other in turn. Recognized for her work, Vizla donned her helmet again, and flew away from the burning temple to await her payment from the Empire for services rendered."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Retirement on Rishi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sacking of Coruscant led the Republic to sign the Treaty of Coruscant, marking the beginning of a Cold War, which lasted for over a decade. Vizla continued the mercenary work, over decades becoming top-tier in her profession, and her list of victories eventually surpassed that of Mandalore the Vindicated himself. Following years of success, Shae started taking fewer and fewer contracts as she became the leader of Clan Vizla. By the time hostilities between the Republic and the Sith Empire erupted in a new Galactic War, Vizla and her clan had almost completely withdrawn from galactic events, settling on the remote planet of Rishi. There, they established a base on the Tracyn Island, on which the warriors could train against each other in the arenas or against the local beasts in the wilderness. Vizla carefully avoided the war and distanced herself from other Mandalorians, although their presence on Rishi was not a secret to the locals, who nicknamed her \"Torch.\" Clan Vizla helped the Nova Blades pirates have a good relationship with the people of Raider's Cove and later, when the Order of Revan came to Rishi at some point after 3642 BBY, briefly allied with them. Vizla and her clan introduced the Revanites to Nova Blades and helped them win a few small engagements, but as their motives to manipulate the Empire-Republic war to their own end came to light, Vizla withdrew her clan from the partnership."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 3637 BBY the Revanites and the Nova Blades had amassed an entire fleet of warships on Rishi. An associate of Theron Shan and Lana Beniko, who were working against the Revanites, learned about the involvement of \"Torch\" from the files of Dael Margok, the Nova Blades captain, and traveled to Tracyn Island to ask her for more information. The shuttle was shut down on the approach, and Vizla observed as the outsider set foot on the island, sending a team of her warriors against them. To her surprise, the intruder prevailed and made it inside her Clan's compound, so Vizla set them against several of the beasts her Clan had kept in there. The outsider prevailed once more, and Vizla ordered a Mandalorian couple of Jos and Valk Beroya to test them in the arena. The two were defeated, and Vizla, deciding that the fresh face was a worthy challenge for herself, met them at the nearby lava lake, refitted into a battleground. When asked for information about the Revanites and the Nova Blades, Vizla instead demanded a challenge and engaged the intruder. After a prolonged fight, Vizla was beaten, though she complimented her opponent on a decent fight, declaring that it felt good. Feeling that the information was earned, Vizla revealed the existence of the Revanite fleet on Rishi and provided her opponent with a speeder to take them back to Raider's Cove to replace the destroyed shuttle. Before departing, Vizla's opponent asked her to join the fight against the Revanites, but the Mandalorian declined, explaining that she had her fill of war and preferred going toe-to-toe against single strong opponents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vizla's information soon caused the Battle of Rishi, in which the Revanite fleet was neutralized and a Coalition between Imperial and Republic forces was formed to take down Revan himself. Learning about this, Vizla traveled to the moon of Yavin 4, where she arrived just in time to join an unlikely union of people such as Grand Master of the Jedi Order Satele Shan and Dark Council member Darth Marr in a stand against Revan. A prolonged fight ensued, in which Revan was defeated and subsequently became one with the Force, though this also led to the revival of the Sith Emperor. Vizla then departed from Yavin, though not before renegotiating her Imperial contract with Darth Marr, telling him to let her know where the next fight would be."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mandalore the Avenger"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Coalition led by Darth Marr continued its hunt for the former Sith Emperor, which led to the first skirmish with the Eternal Fleet and the subsequent Zakuulan Eternal Empire conquest of the galaxy. The Mandalorians fought back, and Clan Lok was hit hard in return, as Mandalore the Vindicated himself led his forces on the front lines and was ultimately killed in combat with the Skytroopers. After the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire signed treaties with the Eternal Empire, many of the Core Worlds were blockaded by the Eternal Fleet and the Star Fortresses, trapping almost half of Mandalorian clans on those worlds. Most of the other clans had scattered, with Clan Vizla surviving better than most. Her reputation legendary even by Mandalorian standards, Shae Vizla was chosen by leaderless Mandalorians as their new commander and \"Mandalore the Avenger,\" a title she reluctantly accepted. The new position was not an easy one for Vizla, who had spent most of her life as a lone hunter and had very little experience leading people, much less an entire culture. She had to quickly adapt to bring together her people who were beaten down after years of opposing Zakuul, yet her very first battle as Mandalore the Avenger was the clans' first victory in six months."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3630 BBY Vizla was contacted by an old acquaintance, Theron Shan from the Mestani sector, who offered her and the clans a chance to strike against Zakuul by assembling a raid on Darvannis weapons factory, the taking of which would allow the Mandalorians to re-arm themselves for the first time in years. Assembling a dozen clans, including Fett, Chorn, Beroya and her own, Mandalore Vizla traveled to Darvannis and laid siege to the factory, placing rotating assault teams of two hundred commandos each around it. There, Vizla and her second-in-command Khomo Fett were joined by the Commander of the Alliance that opposed Zakuul\u2014Vizla's old acquaintance from Rishi. Vizla asked the scout Torian Cadera to join the Commander in the recapturing of the factory's perimeter guns, while the forward team led by Breyer Chorn went to take down the energy shield. That wave of assault alone took the lives of twenty-eight warriors, but in the end the factory's shields went down and the inner ring of defenses suffered severe damage. The day coming to close, Mandalorians held a Kote ky'ram for the fallen, while celebrating their own survival during the night."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next morning, Shae Vizla and Khomo Fett planned an assault on the factory's power stations, after which they were ready to move inside the factory itself. Vizla shared her battle plan with the Alliance Commander, who added to it by providing the factory's inner schematics, recently procured by Theron Shan. Vizla gave a rallying cry to her warriors and went to lead the assault, while Torian Cadera and the Commander went to retrieve the GEMINI Prime, the reason the Alliance decided to attack the factory in the first place. Inside the factory, the Mandalorians encountered resistance, but were able to claim a large amount of weapons and deal sufficient damage to the factory before Vizla ordered an organized retreat. In the aftermath, Vizla assigned Torian Cadera to act as her representative and liaison within the Alliance, while sharing with the Commander her concern that her warriors would want to reclaim their honor fighting more than droids in the near future. After the Alliance Commander was able to strike a massive blow against the Eternal Empire by dethroning Emperor Arcann, the Mandalorians became eager to join their cause. Having her people's support, Vizla decided to make the partnership official and traveled to the Alliance base on Odessen, formally adding her strength and that of her warriors to the Alliance's cause. The Mandalorians, led by Torian Cadera, would go on to fight in the liberation of Voss and defend the Alliance base during Vaylin's Assault on Odessen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the war had ended and the Eternal Empire was defeated, and with piracy having increased by 3627 BBY, Mandalore began working with Hylo Visz to help secure their supply lines.

She later sent Jekiah aboard the Spirit of Vengeance II as security, but communication with him was lost when the ship came under attack by the Hidden Chain, which consisted of Clan Varad, the Dar'manda, and the Ash'ad. Mandalore, along with the Alliance Commander and Jekiah Ordo's brother, Rass Ordo, arrived to fight off the attackers. Mandalore rushed to initiate a challenge with the leader of the groups, Field Marshal Heta Kol, but was forced to fight off reinforcements while the Alliance Commander and Rass Ordo fought Kol. Ultimately Heta Kol escaped after her forces captured Clan Cadera's banner. Following this, Mandalore proclaimed Jekiah Ordo to be her arbiter.

Vizla was an extremely skilled warrior, as noted by the Sith Lord Darth Malgus, and was capable of gracefully wielding her armor's numerous weapons while maintaining flight via her jetpack during battle.
