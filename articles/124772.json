The crash suit was made of relatively tough synthetic materials reinforced with a light armored mesh, and consisted of a snug full-body suit with heavy fasteners, gloves, boots, and a helmet; combined, these components provided unparalleled protection to any driver."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to the armoring, the crash suit hosted special impact-absorbing gel at vital areas, such as the spine, elbows, knees, hips, palms of the hands, and shoulders. This gel helped to mitigate shocks to these areas of the body that are known to be the first ones to be affected in a severe crash. Also embedded in the suit was a fire and radiation-proof chemical to help the user survive any fire that may happen to break out in the aftermath of the crash."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
