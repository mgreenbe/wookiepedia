A ruthless and ambitious man, he had a reputation for caring more for the successful completion of a mission than the welfare of his subordinates\u2014and, as so, he was unsurprisingly disliked by the common troops. In spite of that, he was able to inspire loyalty in his men. He specifically chose the soldiers who served under him for loyalty and having similar moral outlook."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tramsig had been a devoted officer since his first days, being a talented soldier who made all the available efforts to obtain promotions. Intelligent and manipulative, he was effectively promoted, although he made a few enemies in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Initially assigned to a fleet, Tramsig chose promising captain Kurth San to serve in his flagship. From that point onwards, San became Tramsig's right-hand man.

He had requested the assignment to the Cularin system, and it was speculated that he had been given the posting to get him out of the Thaereian system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Initially, Tramsig reviewed the troops under his commands, made some changes, and went to the system with less forces than he had been allowed. Tramsig also called Tira Wils and offered her a job as his personal bodyguard and unofficial security chief.

Although Tramsig did not organize any secret operation, he maintained a high level of secrecy to avoid critical information to be filtered, such as his own strategy \u2014 Tramsig was known to make secret deals.

Due to this, local crimelord Nirama offered to replace it at a low cost. Tramsig asked Nirama for more quantity than he had lost, and the no-nonsense alien noticed, but nevertheless fulfilled, his order. Tramsig also asked for less legal material."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tramsig and the Thaereian military also dealt with eccentric financier Qar Jalunn; Tramsig only accepted secret meetings with Jalunn, and only Tira Wils was informed to organize them.

The Colonel reacted by sending military cruisers through that same route. In one of the ambushes, one single cruiser destroyed five pirate ships, and the other pirates suddenly became more cautious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even after this, Tramsig did not manage to stop the pirate attacks. Although the pirates were no longer bold enough to make important raids, smaller ones were frequent, commonly whenever there were less military ships. In short term, Tramsig was unable to serve as police force, but he nevertheless disturbed the local traffic, gaining the population's scorn. Only Senator Wren, the native Tarasin species and a few gullible idealists were impressed by Tramsig's achievements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jir Trimsig kept his hair cut in a severe style and had an angular jaw that made him look obstinate. His uniform, which was a few sizes to small so that he filled it out, was decorated with a plethora of medals. He was ambitious and manipulative, and had been described as cold. He did not value life highly, though he would not unnecessarily waste his mens' lives. He did not like anybody, an attitude he did not hide as well as he thought he did. His heavy-handed methods, his secrecy, and his seeming ineffectiveness against the pirates (or rumored deals with criminals) made him very unpopular in the Cularin system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
