When Republic scouts ventured near the planet Murkhana in the Outer Rim Territories, they came across a nest of Duinuogwuin, giant, fire-breathing beings colloquially known as \"Star Dragons\". The scouts responded with fear and fled, prompting the Duinuogwuin to respond by chasing them back to Coruscant, and laying waste to the capital's city scape during what came to be known as the Duinuogwuin Contention."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
