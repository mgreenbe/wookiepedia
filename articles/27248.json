Drawing its name from the Basic transliteration of the word vhett, the Mando'a word for farmer, members of the Fett clan throughout the galaxy's history ranged from simple farmers, to conquering Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders, in addition to several mercenaries and bounty hunters throughout the years. Over time, Clan Fett developed a reputation for members who were skilled and ruthless in battle, as well as for their efforts to uplift the Mandalorian people."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An ancient Mandalorian clan, the Fett clan had been in existence since the time of the Mandalorian Wars, thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire. In proper Mando'a, the clan would be referred to as Vhett aliit. Perhaps the earliest member of the Fett clan known to history was Cassus Fett, a Human Mandalorian who grew to infamy as Mandalore the Ultimate's second-in-command in the Mandalorian Neo-Crusader movement that sparked the Mandalorian Wars with the Galactic Republic. The Neo-Crusaders' dreams of conquering the galaxy under Mandalorian rule were dashed, however, by the Jedi Knight Revan, and their armies defeated in battle at Malachor V, ending the Mandalorian Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Millennia later, following the foundation of the peaceful New Mandalorian faction in the aftermath of the Mandalorian Excision, Clan Fett found itself divided among the pacifist New Mandalorians and the traditional warrior clans. By the year 60 BBY, a small family from the Fett clan were making an agricultural living for themselves as farmers on the Outer Rim world of Concord Dawn. Though Concord Dawn was located in the Mandalore sector and had a long history of being affiliated with the Mandalorians, the Fett family living on Concord Dawn were not Mandalorian. The eldest Fett male was a Journeyman Protector, a keeper of law on Concord Dawn; he was married, and was the father of two children, his son Jango Fett, and his daughter Arla Fett. The family owned a farm on the agricultural world, in addition to a speeder and a crop harvester that was used to maintain the farm. Tragedy befell the Fett family when Concord Dawn became the scene of a battle between the forces of the violent Mandalorian splinter group known as the Death Watch, and the loyalist True Mandalorians who opposed them, each faction counting members of the Mandalorian Fett clan among their supporters. The Death Watch leader, Tor Vizsla, tortured and later killed the elder Fett for harboring the current Mand'alor and leader of the True Mandalorians, Jaster Mereel; Fett's son Jango was rescued by Mereel and his soldiers, but his wife was later killed, and his daughter Arla kidnapped by the Death Watch. Nevertheless, members of Clan Fett did serve not only in the Death Watch, but in the New Mandalorian faction as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under Jaster Mereel's fatherly tutelage, Jango Fett followed in the footsteps of his ancestors and became a Mandalorian. Maturing into a skilled fighter, by the time Jango was fourteen years old\u2014an adult in Mandalorian culture\u2014he was actively fighting alongside Mereel. That would change in 52 BBY, when the Death Watch ambushed the True Mandalorian army on Korda Six, and Vizsla killed Mereel during the battle. With Mereel dead, Jango ascended to the position of Mand'alor and led the Mandalorians throughout the remainder of the Mandalorian Civil War against the Death Watch up until the Battle of Galidraan, where Tor Vizsla's gift for deceit brought a Jedi striketeam down on the True Mandalorians, under the mistaken belief that they had been slaughtering innocents. The True Mandalorians were defeated, and though Jango Fett killed six Jedi with his bare hands, he was captured and turned over to the Governor of Galidraan, only to be subsequently sold into slavery by the governor. Slavery did not hold Jango for long, however, as he escaped during a pirate raid on the ship where he was being held. Once free, he reclaimed his lost Mandalorian armor from Galidraan's governor and hunted Vizsla to the planet Corellia. There, Jango destroyed Vizsla's ship and after a lengthy fight with Vizsla on the world's surface, left the Death Watch leader to die at the hands of a pack of dire-cats. With the war over, Jango turned to a life as a bounty hunter to make a living. In 32 BBY, Jango was recruited by Count Dooku as the progenitor for a clone army, after proving himself by killing Dark Jedi Komari Vosa. Entering into the service of Dooku, Jango acted as the Count's bodyguard during his time on the planet Geonosis, and engaged several Jedi Knights on behalf of Dooku's newly formed Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Battle of Geonosis. There in the Petranaki arena, Fett faced off against Jedi Master Mace Windu, only to be slain by the veteran Jedi Councilor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jango's demise on Geonosis did not spell the end of the Fett bloodline, for as part of his deal with Count Dooku to allow himself to be the clone army's progenitor, Fett demanded a clone of himself in return. This clone, which Fett named Boba, was brought up as though he were Jango's own son. Boba Fett was raised on Kamino, and received limited early training in the Mandalorian ways by his father before Jango's untimely death. Following Jango's death, Boba claimed his father's ship and armor, and set out to make a living as a bounty hunter. When he was only sixteen, Boba met fellow bounty hunter Sintas Vel; the two fell in love, and were married, settling down together on Concord Dawn. The Fett clan grew with the birth of a daughter, whom they named Ailyn. Their happiness together was short lived: Sintas was raped by a man called Lenovar, whom Fett killed upon learning of his crime. Exiled from Concord Dawn for the murder, Fett and Sintas split up and the two scarcely saw each other again. Ailyn grew to hate her absentee father as she got older, and attempted to kill him later in life. Under the rule of the Galactic Empire, Boba grew into a bounty hunter whose skill and fame even surpassed his father. He amassed a large fortune, taking jobs from the likes of Jabba the Hutt and any who could pay. It was while working for Jabba that Fett was knocked into the mouth of a sarlacc at the Great Pit of Carkoon on Tatooine, sustaining significant acid scarring that, although fading with age, would remain for the rest of his life. Fett escaped the sarlacc and continued his bounty hunting career for many years after, before eventually becoming Mand'alor in accordance with the last wish of a dying Fenn Shysa, the previous Mand'alor. Though he did not give up his bounty hunting career, Fett led the Mandalorians during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of the galaxy, and helped the planet Mandalore rebuild in the wake of the Vong's attack on the world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Boba had been gone from his daughter Ailyn's life since she was around two years old, life went on for Ailyn and her mother, Sintas.

However, Sintas never returned, having been captured and entombed in carbonite. With her mother now gone as well, Ailyn grew bitter and came to hate Boba Fett for leaving. She tracked her father for years, eventually killing a clone she believed to be him. Be that as it may, Ailyn's life was not without some respite from hate. At some point prior to the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, Ailyn met and fell in love with the Mandalorian warrior Makin Marec; the two were briefly married, a relationship that produced a daughter by the name of Mirta.

She grew closer to Fett as they spent more time together, and as facts about the past Ailyn hadn't known came to light. During this time, Mirta also became involved in a relationship with Mandalorian soldier Ghes Orade, a relationship that brought the Fett clan closer to Clan Vevut. Mirta and Fett were often partners in Fett's endeavors to halt his terminal sickness, and later to recover Sintas Vel from carbonite. Emerging from carbonite after nearly thirty years, Sintas suffered from severe carbon sickness in the form of blindness and amnesia, and Mirta became determined to help her long-lost grandmother make a recovery. With the help of Jedi Knight Jaina Solo\u2014who was on Mandalore seeking the assistance of Fett\u2014and the Jedi-turned-Mandalorian Gotab, Sintas was able to recover both her memories and her eyesight. Once restored to good health, Sintas was able to make peace with Boba Fett and start a relationship with her granddaughter, Mirta. It was also around this time that Mirta married her lover, Ghes Orade.

Taken in by the leader of the Mandalorians, Jaster Mereel, Jango was subsequently adopted into the Mandalorian culture. After a Death Watch ambush on Korda 6 left Mereel dead, Jango took his surrogate father's place as Mand'alor, leader of the Mandalorians, and led the True Mandalorian army until the Battle of Galidraan.

Escaping from captivity, Jango tracked the Death Watch leader, Tor Vizsla, to Corellia and battled him to the death. His loses and time in captivity made Jango a bitter man, and though he was still the Mand'alor, he grew distant from the Mandalorian people, turning instead to a life as a bounty hunter. Chosen by Count Dooku as the progenitor of the clones of the Grand Army of the Republic, Jango adopted an unmodified clone he named Boba as his son, viewing the child to be worth more to him than all the credits the job paid.

Mirta finally met her grandfather, Boba Fett, in 40 ABY, when she played her part in her mother's latest plan to kill Fett. Attempting to lure Fett into a trap set by Ailyn, everything quickly fell apart when Ailyn was captured, interrogated, and accidentally killed by the up-and-coming Darth Caedus.

During all of this, Mirta became interested in the fate of her vanished grandmother, and through her diligence, found that Sintas Vel was not dead, but in fact trapped within carbonite. Fett and Mirta rescued Sintas and released her from carbonite with the help of two of Fett's friends; when it became evident that Sintas had emerged suffering from severe carbonite sickness, Mirta dedicated herself to rehabilitating her long-lost grandmother.
