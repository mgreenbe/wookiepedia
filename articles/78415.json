These shipyards were the Maw Shipyards, the Deponn Shipyards, and the Andrim Shipyards. There were also three facilities that played a key role in the function of the ring. The first was the Kuati supply space station, located on the West portion of the Orbital Array, which was responsible for receiving and distributing various supplies required for both creating/maintaining the various warships docked there, and for maintaining the orbital array itself. The second was the Kuati residential space station, located to the north, which acted as living space for the workers at the Orbital Array. The third was the Kuati military space station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Owing to the Orbital Array's primary function of laying down, constructing, and maintaining various starships, the ring was littered with various drydocks, warehouses, machine shops, and factories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As many Kuati lived in the ring, the Orbital Array also consisted of many apartment complexes, hotels, restaurants, shops, medical facilities, and places of entertainment. Most of offworlders that visited Kuat remained in the ring during their entire stay. Kuati Security Forces regularly patrolled all areas within the ring, and as such had multiple headquarter offices distributed throughout."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Orbital Array had its own weapons systems to defend against hostile starships, although they lack fire power to destroy capital ships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, a series of fatal collisions halted production at the shipyards.
