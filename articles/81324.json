A being with a propensity for murder, Leurm earned a reputation as a heinous killer before he was stopped through the efforts of Jedi Knight Tahiri Veila. Following his arrest, trial, and subsequent conviction, the homicidal Hutt was remanded to galactic penal service in the Armand Isard Correctional Facility of Coruscant. While incarcerated, Leurm made the acquaintance of many other criminals, among them a murderous Wookiee gangster named Gaharrag, and the Mon Calamari vehicle thief Furan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 44 ABY, an opportunity for Leurm to avenge himself arose when Tahiri Veila, the same Jedi responsible for his own incarceration, was herself subjected to confinement within the walls of the Armand Isard Correctional Facility for her own crimes during the recent civil war. The Hutt was enjoying a time of recess when Veila was mistakenly brought to the same exercise yard occupied by the majority of the prison's male population\u2014Leurm included. Furan was the first of them to confront her; when it became apparent that she would not be intimidated, Leurm, Gaharrag, and several other prisoners were summoned by the Mon Calamari to partake in her imminent thrashing. Taunting ensued as inmates prepared to attack, but Veila preceded them by assaulting Leurm and breaking his arm. The Wookiee charged and, as Veila faced him, swung, only to pummel Leurm as she ducked. The Hutt fell onto his broken arm as Veila proceeded to dispatch each of his remaining comrades. The former Jedi's victory was short-lived, however; while the battered tended to their injuries, prison staff dropped Veila with a stun bolt, one especially designed for the incapacitation of Hutts like Leurm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leurm was a greasy Hutt and was considered an especially large member of his species. Slithering constituted his method of forward locomotion, during which Leurm was able to flatten his girth to effect greater traction. His predilection for crime earned him a stint in the Armand Isard Correctional Facility, though his tenure did nothing to diminish his violent tendencies. While former Jedi Veila was slightly less cautious of Leurm than Gaharrag, she recognized the threat posed by their combined effort, and sought to first eliminate the Hutt in order to focus on the more dangerous Wookiee. The combination of his immense size; short, impractical arms; and inability to withstand a full strength\u2014albeit inadvertent\u2014attack from a Wookiee resulted in a swift and utter defeat for Leurm in the prison exercise yard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leurm's first and only Legends appearance is in Aaron Allston's Fate of the Jedi: Conviction, the seventh novel in the nine-part Fate of the Jedi series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
