Charger was free-climbing with the rest of the team to the top of the Citadel and was one of the last to reach the top after Ahsoka Tano deactivated the ray shielded door. Fellow Advanced Recon Commando trooper Fives tried to help him up, but before Charger could grab Fives' hand, he lost his footing by a loose rock, then slipped and free-fell down toward an electro-mine, which electrocuted him to death and sounded an alarm within the Citadel, thus making the mission more difficult for the rest of the group."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a clone of Jango Fett Charger stood at 1.83 Imperial standard meters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Charger utilized white Phase I clone trooper armor, a standard DC-15S, and a Backpack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the episode, Charger was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, who voices all clone troopers through the series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
