Due to his skills as a mathematician, Edell later became the Tribe's chief engineer and was tasked with finding a way for the Tribe to travel across the ocean to the continent.

Since the death of the reigning Grand Lord Lillia Venn in 3960 BBY, several Sith factions had fought for the right to control the Grand Lordship and the Tribe's capital city of Tahv. As a result of this conflict, much of Keshtah had fallen into ruins and lawlessness. Prior to 2975 BBY, Edell joined the Golden Destiny, a faction which was obsessed with the stellar aspects of the Tribe's origins. Edell believed that the Tribe's founder Yaru Korsin was a \"great conqueror\" and that the Tribe's ancestors had been part of a powerful people.

The Golden Destiny had a hostile relationship with the other Sith factions particularly the Korsinite League, led by Korsin Bentado, which revered the Testament of Yaru Korsin as a holy text.

Caretaker Varner Hilts and his Keshiri aide Jaye Vuhld were able to calm the tensions by offering to do a reading of the Testament. Hilts was able to legally convene the Pantheon's Peace after Jaye revealed that the Keshiri calendar was actually eight days behind the Galactic Standard Calendar.

The Omen had crash-landed on Kesh while delivering Lignan ores to Sith Empire forces on Kirrek. Korsin and the Tribe had stayed on Kesh because Korsin was unwilling to return and face his wrathful Master who did not tolerate failure. This revelation immediately discredited the Tribe's myth that they were the Protectors, powerful gods in Keshiri mythology.

Edell got the Sith warriors to loop long leather cables around the supports of the watchtower. Several teams of Sith on the ground and uvaks in the air then worked simultaneously to lower the building.

In desperation, Hilts believed could save the Tribe from its downward spiral of destruction. Edell and Bentado's deconstruction team discovered Hilts' party after Hilts had sent Jaye to obtain glowrods for them to examine a secret map room on the seventh step of the stairway leading to the temple. During this brief confrontation, Bentado murdered Jaye. The Sith party, which included Edell and several of his Golden Destiny companions, then stumbled on Hilts and Iliana, who had discovered Korsin's secret room.

When Hilts reprimanded the Sith for trying to destroy the temple which the Keshiri had helped build in the first place, Neera responded that all life was \"profane\". She cited the \"alien masters\" of the Tribe's forebears as an example of how disgusting life could be. Edell, the most moderate and conciliatory member of the Sith party, attempted to reason with Hilts by telling him that everything they had known about the Tribe was a lie and that there was no sense in clinging to ancient sites like the Sith Temple since it contributed to infighting among the Tribe. In response, Hilts argued that the Tribe was not doomed but Edell did not see his point and instead argued that the end had already happened but that the Tribe did not know it.

Hilts responded that the object was a map of the rest of the world. After explaining the significance of his discovery for the Tribe, Hilts read a message from Yaru to his daughter Nida Korsin, which argued that this hidden knowledge was a cause that could one day be used to reunite the Tribe. As the Caretaker turned back, the various Sith warriors began using their light sabers to illuminate the inscriptions on the wall, which were written in the Tapani language. When Edell asked Hilts about the writing, a Hilts replied that these inscriptions had been carved into the wall with a diamond stylus by none other than Kirsin himself. After reciting the wall inscriptions, Hilts proceeded to read a letter from Yaru's mother Takara Korsin to her son Yaru Korsin, where the former prophesied that their descendants would one day rule a \"great people\" and be free of the Red Sith. Both of these texts were in the Tapani language, a tongue which had been forgotten by the contemporary descendants of the Tribe.

He praised Hilts for redeeming the Tribe's faith in Korsin. Thirdly, Neera also knelt and praised him for finding a path that was wide enough for all the Sith to follow and placed all her trust in him.

This would enable Iliana to share his power while giving her protection from the other Sith who still sought retribution against her. Shortly, later the couple were married at the mountainside Sith Temple on the last day of the Festival of Nida's Rise. Meanwhile, Edell along with several other Sith leaders including Bentado and Neera travelled throughout mainland Keshtah Minor, bringing with them the good news that the Tribe's governing system would be restored and set towards a new goal: reaching the continent of Keshtah Major, which lay across the Endless Sea."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A New Goal"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to his expertise in mathematics and engineering, Edell Vrai was designated by Grand Lord Hilts as the new chief engineer for the Tribe's efforts to reach \"Keshtah Major.\" Edell was tasked with developing a way for the Tribe to travel to and back from the new continent. He vowed to attack the problem vigorously and to study ways for the Tribe to reach distances greater than any uvak or watercraft ever had. For the Tribe and the Keshiri living on Keshtah Minor, Keshtah Minor was the only known world for them. Hilts also hypothesized that Adari Vaal might have successfully traveled to the new continent with her flight of stolen uvak, and that the residents would thus know that the Sith existed.

For millennia, no riders had ever crossed the Endless Sea and returned to report their travels. Based on their limited knowledge of geography and space, the Sith knew that the planet Kesh was a globe as did the Keshiri, who had figured that fact out on their own. Based on Yaru Korsin's map, the Tribe knew that there were two ocean routes to Keshtah Major. While the western Sea of Flames was shorter, it fought the currents. Thus, the Tribe was forced to settle for the longer Endless Sea. Following the failure of the uvak long distance flights, Edell experimented with boats which also met with failure. The plentiful hejarbo shoots, which were used to build houses, were unable to withstand water currents. Hardwoods from the interior like, vosso, were too dense to float while other species were too rubbery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the second decade of his research, Edell had spent endless hours researching those materials in an attempt to find something that would make the trip possible. Due to successive failed efforts, many of his aides grew frustrated with him and became rivals, experimenting with their own plans. While Hilts promoted Edell to the position of High Lord to afford him with full access to resources, Edell had little interest in court politics or starting a family. Due to his fascination with finding a way to reach Keshtah Major, Edell never married and produced children. Finally, Edell discovered a solution in 2978 BBY; the volcano Sessal Spire emitted various noxious gases including methane. Edell and his team used glass vessels to extract the methane and then used a simple water catalyst to isolate the hydrogen, the lightest element known to the Tribe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the success of these experiments, Edell established a production line to build structures that the gas could carry afloat. Thus, Edell became the inventor of the Tribe's airships. The Keshiri artisans were able to develop a thin containment fabric which stiffened against pressure; and these became known as gasbags. Edell's \"rising bell\" shape became the most stable gas bag, which attached to a gondola that was crafted with several layers of latticed hejarbo. These gondolas were used to carry the crew and their provisions. However, Edell's engineering team then encountered another problem. The airships lacked a means of controlling direction which caused the winds to blow them in various directions. Several riders and their aircraft were killed or disappeared on these test flights, with some presumably ending up in the South Pole and the others drowning in the equatorial ocean farther north."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2975 BBY, the Tribe discovered that they could use uvak as a means of controlling direction and propulsion. These uvak were attached to the airships' gondolas where they could rest, eat, and even sleep when their services were not needed. That same year, Edell Vrai gained permission from his liege Grand Lord Hilts and his wife Iliana to lead a reconnaissance mission to \"Keshtah Major\". This expedition consisted of three scouting airships: the Candra, Lillia, and the Dann Itra which were named after several historical figures from the Time of the Rot. Each of these airships were capable of carrying ten crew members and were propelled by two uvak. Edell served as the commander of the mission and the captain of the Candra. Edell's plan was to sail across the Endless Sea to scout the new continent and then return to Keshtah Minor by the Sea of Flames. Korsin Bentado, who was now a High Lord, was designated as the leader of the invasion force\u2014a fleet of sixty airships known as the Ebon Fleet.

Upon arriving, the Candra's thoughtcrier Taymor sensed that there was a lot of energy and emotions in the new continent, confirming that it was already populated. She also sent a thought impression indicating that the Sith had discovered the new continent. Unknown to the Sith, this new continent was already home to a Keshiri civilization who called themselves the Alanciari and their homeland Alanciar. Two thousand years ago, the Keshiri Herald Adari Vaal and three-hundred followers had fled to Alanciar on their uvak. After landing on an offshore island, they were picked up by the Alanciari. Adari succeeded in warning the Alanciari about the threat posed by the Sith in Keshtah Minor and became a highly-respected figure in Alanciari society. As a result, the Alanciari evolved into a highly disciplined and militaristic society that was dedicated to resisting any invasion by the Sith. The Alanciari maintained a strong military that was augmented by a highly complex network of signal stations and thoughtcriers, Force-sensitive individuals who were trained to send messages by thought projection. In addition, Alanciar had a well-run system of roads, canals, and a well-organized bureaucracy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Edell's airships flew over Garrow's Neck, one of the six peninsulas that made up the Six Claws, Alanciar's southern coastal region which faced the Endless Sea, which they called the Western Sea.

These two spotted the Sith airships and quickly raised the alarm. Within minutes, the Candra's sister airships the Lillia and Dann Itra were destroyed by flaming projectiles which ignited their hydrogen gasbags, killing all hands aboard. These projectiles were fired by a large ballista based at Point Vigilance, which lay to the north of Garrow's Neck.

However, she was killed by several diamond flak projectiles before she could finish sending the message. The only message that the Grand Consort Iliana's thoughtcriers received was a garbled message of surprise, shock, and confusion. Edell then saw that these projectiles had come from three Alanciari uvak-riders who were armed with hand-ballistae. These were part of the Alanciari air force and they began to pursue and strafe the Candra.

Edell was surprised to learn that the Sith had attacked so early and attempted to warn them about the local Keshiri. However, the Tyro blocked his view of the table containing the map of Keshtah Major and told him that his services were no longer needed.

However, Edell needed a guide and he was able to use Jogan, whom he assumed to be her spouse, as leverage. Like all Alanciari sea vessels, it relied on sails which trapped the wind in order to propel the ship. While most of the Alanciari harvester fleet usually worked in the Coral Banks of the Southern Passage, ship captains who were behind in harvesting their quotas of seafood were known to cut corners by fishing in the Western Sea, which was a restricted military zone that was patrolled by the Shore Guard, the Alanciari coast guard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Keshiri sailors aboard the Mischance had been unaware of the earlier battle and were taken by surprise, they fought fiercely against the Sith invaders.

Due to their experiences on the previous night, Edell and Peppin noted the strong martial tradition among the Keshiri they had encountered on Alanciar. While the Mischance was a lowly harvester by Alanciari standards, it was considered to be advanced by the Tribe's standards since they had never built anything larger than a boat.

His Sith subordinates had also obtained a map of Alanciar which showed that there was a cove to the northeast of Garrow's Neck called Meori Cove, which was not under military surveillance. Edell's decision was also influenced by his recent nightmare about being marginalized or even excluded from the Tribe. Having made up his mind, Edell then initiated a meeting with Quarra.
