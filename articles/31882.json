This was to stop light from being picked up by enemy sensors. It also had a hull that was designed to mimic the environment around it. Another way that it was designed for stealth was its general oval shape, so it could keep a low profile. It also had a special stealth coating that would cause scans to bounce back to the ship sending them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
