An esteemed doctor in his own right by the time of the Cold War with the Sith Empire, Deduun designed the M1-4X Advanced War Droid under the codename Project Ignition, but the project was scrapped on account of problems with the droid's power core. However, Lieutenant Harron Tavus of the Republic Special Forces Division approached Deduun and convinced him to restart the project using Tavus' own funds, claiming that its cancellation had been a front to keep the project secret. Deduun finished the droid in his lab at a classified location, instilling a deep love of the Republic and a fierce hatred of the Empire in M1-4X before Tavus took the completed droid to use for his own ends."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boab Deduun was first mentioned on the Holonet section of the official site for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011, in the entry for the Trooper companion M1-4X.
