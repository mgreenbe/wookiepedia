After discovering the base to be empty, (and finding the remains of countless clone troopers and battle droids) Secura goes out scouting where she encounters a lone battle droid. Disposing its appendages, Secura is caught unaware by the native Ewoks and is shot with a tranquilizer dart. Waking up in a treehouse, Secura uses the battle droid as a translator, who sarcastically informs her that she is thought to be a forest spirit. As a spirit, it is her duty to vanquish the Beast in the Mouth of the Mountain. Secura, taking the droid along, complies. Reaching the cave, the Jedi Knight trips on a pile of bones, alerting the Beast to her presence. The Beast quickly impales the battle droid with its claw, leaving Secura free to work on collapsing parts of the ceiling upon the monster. Fulfilling her duty as the Ewok's spirit, the Jedi Master returns to the Republic gunship, where Bly is waiting. Dismissing her commander's worries, the pair, along with their squadron, heads to Felucia. As the squadron flies away, the Ewok chief, who has recovered the droid's head as a totem, paints a memorial of Aayla's victory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
