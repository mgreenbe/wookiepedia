The Geonosian sonic blaster and the LR1K sonic cannon were models of sonic weapon used by the Geonosian species. During a period of war on the planet Geonosis, the Geonosian hives used sonic weapons in their battles for the planet's resources as well as dominance over each other. Sonic cannons, including the LR1Ks manufactured by Gordarl Weaponsmiths, could be set to forces of varying degrees to smash bones while leaving the Geonosians' rock tunnels unharmed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
