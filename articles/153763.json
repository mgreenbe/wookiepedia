While this mouse droid survived the hijacking with a number of other droids, all clone personnel on board were killed. When D-Squad arrived on the Renown, they ran into BNI-393 who brought them back to their shuttle where the surviving droids, including this MSE-6, were hiding. The group later followed a buzz droid through the ship and, after the buzz droids were defeated, returned to the shuttle and escaped before the Renown exploded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
