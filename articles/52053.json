This imperfectly surveyed frontier region of the galaxy attracted only scouts and the bravest of traders. Javin itself belonged to Mugaari Space, a semi-independent collection of eleven worlds ruled for millennia by the humanoid Mugaari, who were wary of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The region's traders journeyed across the Mid Rim frontier to the outer reaches of Mugaari Space and sometimes beyond in order to make contact with worlds controlled by two other relatively nearby alien civilizations, the Lutrillians and Nothoiin. These natives had traded sporadically with the Republic for centuries, but their respective homeworlds of Lutrillia and Nothoiin could only be reached by taking painfully slow detours around the region's sprawling Twin Nebulae gas clouds and by surrendering major profit shares to the Mugaari."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The war"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic defeated the Mugaari in a brief, one-sided war, forcibly annexing the eleven member worlds of Mugaari Space as Republic cartographers established the sprawling new Javin sector in the Outer Rim Territories.

Launching from Gerrenthum, scout ships of entrepreneur Ecclessis Figg eventually succeeded in blazing new star lanes straight through the Twin Nebulae to connect the Trade Spine with Lutrillia and Nothoiin.
