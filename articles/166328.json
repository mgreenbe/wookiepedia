By the time following the Second Galactic Civil War, he had achieved the rank of Jedi Knight in the Jedi Order. In 43.5 ABY, several Jedi began falling prey to a Force psychosis, causing tensions between the Order and the Galactic Alliance. Meanwhile, exiled Grand Master Luke Skywalker encountered a Sith Tribe. The Jedi Council wanted to send StealthXs to help him, but interim Grand Master Kenth Hamner was opposed to the action, as he feared it would start a war between the Jedi and the Galactic Alliance. Hamner was eventually relieved from duty and confined to his quarters by the other Masters, who then set the plan to launch the StealthXs in motion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bwua'tu, along with the Arcona Jedi Vaala Razelle, was stationed outside of the Jedi Temple hangar.
