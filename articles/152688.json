The task force consisted of four Venator-class Star Destroyers that participated in the Battle of Lola Sayu, although one received heavy damage and no longer took part in the battle. Additionally, groups of ARC-170 starfighters were used on all Star Destroyers, as well as at least one space gunship. The task force was led by four Jedi Generals; Plo Koon, Saesee Tiin, Adi Gallia, and Kit Fisto alongside Admiral Barton Coburn. Additionally, the task forces' ground units included the 104th Battalion, which crewed at least one of the Star Destroyers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
