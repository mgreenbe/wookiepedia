A garrison was established on the planet while a naval battle group blockaded the area. After several years, the garrison dwindled in strength and the battle group saw fluctuations of power in that time as the Imperial Military used the posting to get rid of ineffective officers, ships, and malcontents despite Galactic Emperor Palpatine insisting on Ilum's importance.

When a Gladiator did appear over a world that supported the Rebel Alliance, rebel forces there had little options except attempt to remain hidden, flee, or attempt to destroy the Gladiators."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the Blood Ambition, a Gladiator I variant, served as the flagship of a naval task force led by Captain Ralchio Nervi.
