Piloting Redshift starfighters throughout the war as part of the Army of Light, the Army was dissolved as part of the Ruusan Reformation and the Corps returned to its smaller form. Upgrading to the Savage Star fighters, the Corps maintained a much smaller fleet, and over the years eventually phased out much of its armed craft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Centuries later, the Order updated their Starfighter fleet with the Delta-6 starfighter model. Used for recon missions, Master Clee Rhara proposed to build a new starfighter facility on Centax-2. However, Rhara's plans were foiled by Senator Vox Chun who opposed the Order's move to re-militarize. Yet this would not be a lasting trend as the Order purchased a fleet of Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor during the Separatist Crisis to counter the rising violence on the Outer Rim."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the Starfighter Corps became a part of the Grand Army of the Republic, eventually upgrading once more, this time to the Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor.
