It soon killed most of the population in the city-state of Aubendo. The Jedi were sent to aid in the evacuation and to help curb the crisis' resultant panic, looting, and general chaos: the Radnorans were desperate to flee and escape the disaster (even the Radnoran security officers panicked and immediately stole the cruiser the Jedi had just arrived in). After the toxins subsided and a threat from their planet's neighbor, Avon, was averted, the Radnorans were left to rebuild and mourn the dead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
