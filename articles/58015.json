As they were small and easy prey for other animals, like pikobis, gullipuds would extend their spine to make themselves harder to catch and swallow. When inflated, gullipuds actually bounced. Because of this, they were used in gullipud ball games by the Gungans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
