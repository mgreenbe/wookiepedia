In that year, she was an agent of deception in a ruse orchestrated by Fel against the Sith Lord Darth Krayt. When the Empire defeated the Galactic Alliance and won the Sith\u2013Imperial War, Fel was informed by Nyna Calixte, the Director of Imperial Intelligence, that his Sith allies intended to betray him. Darth Krayt planned to murder Fel and seize the Imperial throne at an upcoming meeting of the Imperial Moff Council. Before Fel accordingly fled from the Imperial throneworld of Coruscant, he arranged for his double to meet with Krayt in the Imperial Palace and buy him time to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fel's cousin Mohrgan, an Imperial Knight, volunteered to lead three other Knights against Krayt in order to promote the deception.

The meeting was interrupted by Krayt and three of his fellow Sith Lords, and Krayt demanded Fel's life. Mohrgan called on his contingent to protect the Emperor, but Krayt ignited two lightsabers and quickly slew them all despite their attempts at a defense.
