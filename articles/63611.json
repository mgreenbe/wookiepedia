Millennia later, Mika Anjiliac Chiera's troops found a cache of the then-rare droids on Varl, which Mika had restored to guard the Tempest. The droids used by Mika were so old that, though their motivators were fully restored, the same was not possible for their battle computers and weapons, which frequently malfunctioned and broke down, although the droids could resort to unarmed melee combat. Each droid had two light repeating blaster rifle, a set of manipulating appendages, a fragmentation grenade launcher with four grenades, armor, and a deflector shield.
