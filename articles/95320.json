It was also crossed by at least two trade routes: the Pabol Kreeta, which linked Nar Kreeta to Nar Bo Sholla within the eponymous system, and the Pabol Sleheyron, whose endpoints were the worlds Formos and Randon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The territory surrounding the Nar Kreeta system came under the control of the Hutt Empire as early as the year 22,000 BBY and was considered well-explored by 8000 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early years of the New Republic, the Mining Guild had control of the planet Nar Kreeta, although Hutt crime lords dominated the underworld.

On Nar Kreeta, Aurebesh and a Huttese script could be seen in certain locations, in the form of signs and posters.
