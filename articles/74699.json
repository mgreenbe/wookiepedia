After discovering Holdo's intention to evacuate the crew of the Raddus, Connix and several Resistance officers supported Dameron's mutiny against Holdo.

During her time at the Resistance Camp on the garbage planet of Anoat, Connix witnessed the destruction of Tah'Nuhna and informed General Organa. She also assured Organa that the General had done everything she could and it wasn't her fault, pointing at their main mission of protecting as many as they can as long as they were still alive. Later, she also informed General Jonato about a First Order armada heading towards Mon Cala where General Organa, Rey, Rose Tico, and C-3PO had gone on a mission.

However, while serving under Amilyn Holdo, Connix sympathized with Poe Dameron's misgivings about the Vice Admiral's leadership style. Her support for Dameron led Connix to engage in activities ranging from conspiracy to open rebellion against Holdo. After abandoning the Raddus during the First Order's assault on the Resistance fleet, Connix watched as Holdo altered course and assumed that the Vice Admiral was trying to save herself.
