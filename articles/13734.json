With the Core Worlds Recopia and Ralltiir supporting the New Republic, the Provisional Council began to look toward liberating more of the Core, with an eye toward eventually taking Coruscant itself. Following a reconnaissance by Rogue Squadron, the planet Brentaal IV was chosen as a target of the Republic's offensive. The Empire, headed by Imperial Grand Vizier Sate Pestage, struggled to hold itself together, threatened both by internal discontent and the fragmenting of their military force into individual warlord holdings. To appease the Cabal, a wealthy and politically connected faction whose members all had investments on the world, Pestage vowed to hold Brentaal IV at all costs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Republic hit the world in force, with Admiral Gial Ackbar in command of the task force, supported by Rogue Squadron and Aggressor Wing.

Further operations allowed the Republic forces to establish a presence on the planet itself, in the city of Oradin, although at a cost\u2014the 181st Imperial Fighter Group, led by Colonel Baron Soontir Fel, had reinforced Brentaal IV. Despite their presence, however, it became clear that Brentaal IV was lost to the New Republic. Director of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard ordered an evacuation of Brentaal IV, sending ships from Coruscant to rescue the wealthy and influential citizens. Fearing that the evacuation would strip Brentaal of its wealth, New Republic forces mobilized to stop the escape.

A five-fighter element, consisting of four Incom T-65 X-wing starfighters and a T-65BR X-wing reconnaissance starfighter, entered the Brentaal system and began to collect reconnaissance data. Imperial forces stationed at the Brentaal IV moonbase responded to the New Republic intrusion, deploying TIE fighters to engage the Rogues. A brief dogfight ensued, with the Rogues covering the reconnaissance fighter, piloted by Nrin Vakil. All but one of the TIE fighters deployed was destroyed; however, as the fighter raced for the safety of the moonbase, Rogue pilot Wes Janson fired two proton torpedoes into the launch bay, causing massive internal damage.

However, Isard was playing Pestage and the Cabal against each other, causing friction between the two in the hopes of weakening both Pestage's rule and the Cabal's power base. When report of New Republic reconnaissance missions probing the Core Worlds came to Pestage's attention, Isard advised him to invite an attack against Brentaal IV. Setting into motion a plan she called Project Ambition, Isard believed that if she could orchestrate a New Republic victory at Brentaal, it would lead to Pestage's downfall and weaken the Ruling Council enough for her to ascend to the throne.

Pestage mused that he would have to find a replacement for Admiral Lon Isoto, commander of the planet's military forces, since he was incompetent and allegedly addicted to the drug glitterstim. Isard counseled Pestage to take the opposite action and allow Isoto to retain his command\u2014although considered to be an idiot, he was favored by the Cabal.

The planet had been a target for several months, but had been a low priority. With Pestage vowing to hold the planet at all costs, Ackbar decided that they needed to strike Brentaal IV swiftly before the world could be extensively reinforced. A task force was assembled, commanded by Ackbar himself aboard the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Independence, and including Colonel Horton Salm's Aggressor Wing and Rogue Squadron\u2014which was brought back up to full strength for the operation.

Establishing his headquarters in Vuultin, Fel was initially impressed by Admiral Isoto's efforts to comply with his request for better city defenses by constructing hardened missile sites and a launch bunker for his group's fighters. However, Isoto's lack of talent when it came to military tactics and strategy became apparent when he insisted that the New Republic's next target would be Vuultin itself since it was where he had made his headquarters. Fel argued that the city of Oradin, to the west of Vuultin, was the logical target since it had extensive spaceport facilities that the Republic would need if they wanted to land troops in large numbers.

Once Dendo returned, he informed Janson and Ibtisam of the situation, and sent a message to the Republic forces informing them of their survival. When the two Rogues inquired about rejoining their unit, Dendo replied that he could not spare the men to ferry them back, as they had a big operation planned for the next day. First, they would be hitting a massive construction droid that was being used to construct defenses for Vuultin, and then they would be attempting to get Isoto\u2014alive, if possible.
