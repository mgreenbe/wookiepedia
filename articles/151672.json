Their durable frame, coupled with the low-output repulsorlift engines, made them easy to produce and stow aboard ships like the Eta-class shuttle. Collapsible, their simple saddle and control panel were sufficient for short trips between a starship and a destination. During the Clone Wars, the jumpspeeders saw frequent use by the Grand Army of the Republic and members of the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
