However, while aware that she was definitely the sister of Krasov Hara, the two referred to themselves as hatchmates, along with Tesar. The three were each trained in the ways of the Jedi by Tesar's mother, Saba Sebatyne. Bela's experiences with her two hatchmates resulted in them sharing an extremely strong connection through the Force, which served them well as members of the Wild Knights; allowing them to sense the intentions and feelings of the others during combat."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Yuuzhan Vong War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Saba decided that her three apprentices would go to the Jedi academy to continue their Force training under Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, the Wild Knights set out for Yavin 4.

Bela became the fourth Jedi to die during the disastrous mission, after having been bitten by an amphistaff. Tesar and Krasov used telekinesis to levitate the body of their beloved hatchmate for some time, until they were forced to use it to lure out feral voxyn; they felt that Bela would have been honored to help her hatchmates, and the remainder of the strike team to escape. Shortly after Bela's death, Krasov was killed when a voxyn spat acid at her face."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
