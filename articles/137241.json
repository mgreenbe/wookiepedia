A First Order fleet bombarded a section of the neutral world of Aeos Prime as punishment for assisting the Colossus, a fugitive refueling station. While the First Order TIE Fighter Pilot cadet Jace Rucklin believed that the Aeosians deserved it for aiding the Resistance, his comrade Tamara Ryvora was horrified and decided to defect from the First Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial Era, the Aeosians of Aeos Prime gave refuge to the Rebel Alliance, allowing them to set up a base on Aeos Prime.

Commander Pyre and Agent Tierny reported the bombardment of Aeos Prime to Supreme Leader Kylo Ren, stating that the Aeos system had been suppressed and that there was no more Resistance presence there. Ren was however displeased at their failure to capture the Colossus and used the Force to force them to aim their blasters at each other. He spared them and gave them another chance to destroy the Colossus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The devastation of Aeos Prime confirmed Tam's concerns about the First Order's ruthlessness. After recovering her comlink from Agent Tierny's office, she \"borrowed\" a power cell from the mouse droid 5-L and used it to power up her comlink.

After the other TIE/sf space superiority fighters tried to shoot down Kaz and Yeager's stolen Atmospheric Assault Lander, Tam knocked out Rucklin and shot down the other fighters. The rescue mission was complicated when Agent Tierny learnt about Tam's defection and dispatched her Star Destroyer to the Castilon system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite being captured, Kaz and his friends managed to warn the Colossus that the First Order was pursuing them.
