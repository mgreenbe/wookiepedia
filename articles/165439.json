The Empire stored the shipment in one of their facilities on the planet Mataou's moon, Nar Hypa. Later, a local human gangster known as \"Happy\" Dapp devised a plan to break into the Empire's various storehouses, full as a result of Adelhard's blockade. Dapp ordered a scoundrel under his employ to travel to the moon and abscond with anything of value confiscated by the Empire. After fighting through waves of Stormtroopers and IT-O Interrogation Units, the scoundrel found a cache and returned to Dapp on the planet Burnin Konn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
