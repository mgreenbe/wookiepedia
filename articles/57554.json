It was owned by the Neimoidian Groshik, who also served as the bartender. It was a popular hangout for cortosis miners. The bar was made to look like it was three stories high, when in reality the top two levels were colored glass made to give an illusion of importance. It contained sabacc tables. A portion of the cantina's profits were given to ORO as required by the company which dominated Apatros. The young miner Dessel, who would later become Darth Bane, played sabacc here, and once won a small fortune from a Republic ensign, nearly starting a riot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
