Although Dreebo was not one of Bogga's best, the Hutt trusted him enough to send him on important missions, such as the defense of a Nessie Ithullian ore hauler that was captained by a man named Gruna in the Stenness system in 3999 BBY. Dreebo, flying escort for the ore hauler in his light tactical fighter, came across two pirate ships that were trying to siphon the hauler's load of mutonium. Maneuvering his starfighter around to attack the pirates, Dreebo drew the attention of the main ship, the Marauder Starjacker, captained by pirate leader Finhead Stonebone. However, Dreebo's gunning skills left much to be desired, and every shot he fired missed its target. As Dreebo continued to strafe the pirate ships, C'borp, chief gunner on the Starjacker, aimed his turret guns at Dreebo. C'borp quickly destroyed Dreebo's fighter, killing him. Feeling merciful after Dreebo's death, Bogga decided to withhold Dreebo's service bonus and not charge Dreebo's home clan for the destroyed starfighter's replacement."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Dreebo was not one of Bogga's best enforcers, he was still trusted enough to be tasked with defending the ore hauler.
