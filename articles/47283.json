Fax Ventures held many investments and operations throughout the Outer Rim, including a mining operation that mined Aluminite and Corax Ore from the Kadal Asteroid Field and processed it on the planet Bestal Three. Bestal Three was also the location of their most impressive operation, where they used the crusty seeds from Vortal Trees for medicinal purposes, creating medpacs which were roughly 25% more effective than their regular counterparts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
