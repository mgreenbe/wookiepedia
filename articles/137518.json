Early into the Clone Wars, she fell in love with and married army deserter Cut Lawquane, who became the adoptive father of her children. Together, the family was known as the Lawquanes and maintained a homestead on Saleucami."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Clone Wars eventually reached Saleucami, Suu and Cut allowed a wounded soldier, Captain Rex, to stay with them while he recovered. Rex helped Suu and Cut protect their farm from a group of commando droids and decided not to turn Cut in, leaving the family in peace. The Lawquanes also became well acquainted with Clone Force 99, a special forces squad. After the end of the war and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Suu and Cut worried that they would have to leave Saleucami to evade the new authorities. With the help of the now-fugitive Clone Force 99, the Lawquanes managed to leave Saleucami and search for a new planet to start over."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life and raising a family"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Suu Lawquane was a female Twi'lek refugee who lived on the temperate world of Saleucami during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. At some point, Suu married, though she was eventually widowed. By the time of the pan-galactic Clone Wars between the Republic and its splinter state, the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Suu had given birth to two children, Shaeeah and Jek Lawquane. Early into the war, Suu met a clone trooper from the Grand Army of the Republic, Cut. Cut had deserted from his post after becoming the sole survivor of an attack on his unit's troop transport during the First Battle of Geonosis. Suu and Cut got to know each other and eventually fell in love. They married, and he became the adoptive step-father to her children. The family made their home at a farm in the desert of Saleucami, where they grew crops and raised livestock such as eopies."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "War on Saleucami"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 21 BBY, shortly after the Lawquanes' first harvest, the war made its way to Saleucami. Confederate General Grievous had brought his fleet to Saleucami, and the Republic launched a daring counterattack to capture him. When the Republic won the space battle, Grievous attempted to flee to the planet's surface in a landing craft. His ship was shot down as it made its escape, however, and the general and his droids were forced to flee to the surface in escape pods. The Republic quickly began a search effort, and squads of clone troopers combed the planet on speeder bikes. Cut was away from home at the time, delivering their harvest. One group of clones made their way to the Lawquane homestead, where Suu observed them carefully. Suu emerged from her house with her antique hunting rifle, wary of the clones' intentions. Suu aimed her blaster at the clones as they pulled up near her and told them that she didn't want any trouble. The clones explained to Suu that their captain, CT-7567, nicknamed \"Rex,\" had been injured, though she was quick to point out that she was not a doctor and continued to urge them along. Shaeeah and Jek ran outside as Suu attempted to ward off the soldiers, and she softened her stance and told them to go back inside. Suu had a quick change of heart and told the clones that there were benches in their barn where Rex could stay overnight. While the clones set the captain up for the night, Suu prepared them some fruit and offered it to them in the barn. As she handed the bowl over to the clones, a ball Shaeeah and Jek were playing with bounced in, followed closely by her daughter. Shaeeah noticed Rex and remarked that he looked like her father, and Suu told her that Cut was not a soldier and had her go back to their house. Suu told the clones that her husband was away delivering the harvest, and left after assuring they wouldn't be needing anything else."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the clones had left to resume their search and left Rex with Suu, Cut returned home from delivering the first harvest. He discovered Rex and the two had a brief standoff before they each recognized the other as clones. Noticing the commotion, Suu and her children went to the barn to greet Cut. Suu explained why Rex was with them, and Cut told the kids that they should never turn away someone in need. Cut invited Rex to dinner, though the captain was reluctant until Jek and Shaeeah begged him to join them. Over a meal of a cooked nuna, Suu and her children listened as Cut and Rex talked about their service, and the former's choice to leave. Rex insisted that, in accordance with protocol, he would have to turn Cut in for deserting his post. After dinner, Suu read to her children while Cut and Rex played a game of dejarik and continued their conversation. With their parent's permission, Shaeeah and Jek went outside to play. While playing in the fields, they discovered one of the escape pods from General Grievous' crashed landing ship. The two accidentally activated the pod, powering up a group of commando droids inside. Hearing the children's screams, Suu ran outside to find them and make sure they were alright. Shaeeah told Suu and Cut that they were being chased by \"monsters.\" Suu tried to comfort them, but as she backed into the house she, Cut, and Rex noticed the commando droids lurking in the fields. Cut told Suu to take the children upstairs, while he and Rex locked up the house and turned off the lights. Using Suu's ancient rifle, Cut fought against the droids. During the skirmish, a wooden beam fell onto Cut, trapping him temporarily. The droids came close to finding Suu, Rex, and the kids, but Cut managed to regain his bearings and help Rex destroy the last units."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next morning, Suu and Cut helped prepare Rex for his return to Republic forces. They gave Rex an eopie for transport and watched as he loaded his gear onto the mount. Suu was concerned that Rex still planned on turning Cut in for his desertion, but Rex admitted that he wouldn't, saying that although Cut was a deserter, he was no coward. Overjoyed, Suu embraced Cut and thanked Rex for his discretion. Happy, Suu stood with Cut and their children and watched as Rex left their farm. At some point following their encounter with Rex, the Lawquanes installed a new fence around their property, as well as a series of booby traps. They also became acquainted with the genetically modified special forces group Clone Force 99, nicknamed the \"Bad Batch.\" The members of the group, Hunter, Wrecker, Tech, and Crosshair, frequently visited the Lawquanes and were treated as family by Shaeeah and Jek. Suu had a good rapport with Hunter, who marveled at her sharpshooting skills."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Age of the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, Sheev Palpatine, ordered the systematic genocide of the Jedi Order by the clone armies and declared himself Galactic Emperor. Under the new Galactic Empire, Saleucami faced hardened security as ships were impounded and chain codes were enforced. Rex, having defied Order 66, arrived on Saleucami to speak with Cut and Suu. Rex warned them about the Empire and told them about the inhibitor chips placed in the clones that forced them to carry out Order 66 and kill the Jedi. Suu and Cut feared that they would have to leave Saleucami and find a safer home, and after Rex left they began preparations to leave the planet on a transport. The day after Rex left the Lawquanes, Clone Force 99 arrived to meet with Cut as well. The Bad Batch had become fugitives after defying orders and escaping Kamino with a young female clone, Omega. The Bad Batch accidentally tripped Cut and Suu's traps, and the couple found them on their property. The Lawquanes brought the squad to their house, where Cut gave them drinks and Suu prepared them some fruit. Suu noticed new members of the squad, and Hunter introduced Echo and Omega to the Suu and Cut. Cut noticed that Crosshair was no longer with them, but Hunter only told them that things had become complicated. Cut told the Bad Batch about Rex's visit and his talk of the inhibitor chips, which prompted confusion until Omega told them about the implants. As she finished talking, Shaeeah and Jek ran inside and told their parents that there was a ship outside. Wrecker excitedly greeted the kids, who noticed Omega, and brought her to play with them outside. Hunter looked to Suu with concern, but she smiled at him and nodded that it would be alright."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Cut and Hunter went to a nearby spaceport to book passage on a shuttle for the Lawquanes. There, they discovered that the Empire was only allowing travel for citizens with chain codes, which Cut and Suu couldn't arrange to get because Cut would be apprehended. Meanwhile, Omega was playing with Shaeeah and Jek when the ball they were throwing went beyond the fence. Shaeeah and Jek, knowing not to go past the gates, told Omega that they would retrieve it later and instead went back to the house to continue packing. Omega, however, decided to get the ball. While getting the ball, she was stalked by a nexu. Inside, Suu and Cut discussed the chain code situation with Hunter and Tech. Shaeeah and Jek ran inside and told Suu that Omega went past the fence. Suu quickly jumped into action and grabbed her rifle. She ran outside and climbed up the side of the house to the roof, where she had an unobstructed view of Omega and the nexu. She fired a shot just as the creature prepared to pounce on Omega, forcing it back. Hunter ran past the gate to the girl, where he slashed the nexu with his knife while Suu continued firing on it, eventually sending it running away. Hunter scolded Omega, but Cut intervened and softly spoke with her and carried her. Suu returned from the roof and helped Cut care for Omega, who he brought to the Bad Batch's shuttle. Later, as Hunter stood watch outside the house, Suu greeted him and asked if he wanted her to take over. He complimented her shooting skills, which he had forgotten were as good as they were. Suu told him that children always had ways of getting into trouble but explained that it was their guardian's job to protect them. Cut arrived and told Hunter that Omega was on their ship. The incident had convinced Hunter that he was not able to care for her, and he asked Suu and Cut if they could take her in when they left Saleucami. Suu asked him if that was what he wanted, and he told her that it was what Omega needed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Echo and Tech, meanwhile, arranged for their ship to be impounded by the Empire so they could sneak inside the facility and steal and forge chain codes for the Lawquanes and Omega. They informed Hunter of their plan, but he was angry not only that his ship was being impounded but that Omega was still on board. While Tech and Echo worked on their plan, Wrecker and Hunter helped Suu and her family finish packing up their belongings. Later that evening, the Lawquanes and clones arrived at the spaceport. Jek was scared and walked closely to Suu, who assured him that everything would be okay. Tech and Echo finished forging the chain codes, but they couldn't get them to the Lawquanes on the other side of the spaceport. Omega took the chain codes when they weren't looking and snuck out of the impound lot and brought them to the other group. Tech informed Hunter of this, and when he reacted angrily, Suu calmed him and again told him that children could always find trouble. When Omega arrived, she remarked that there had been a fifth one made by accident, and Cut and Suu realized that Hunter hadn't told her about his plan. While Hunter told Omega about his decision, Suu and her family approached the security station. Omega reluctantly joined the Lawquanes, who were in the process of getting their codes checked. While Suu and Cut unloaded their luggage, they noticed the sad Omega and asked her if she was ready to go. Omega, however, decided to go back to Hunter and ran to the impound lot to return to the Bad Batch. While the Lawquanes boarded their transport, Cut was stopped by security clones, who thought he looked familiar. Before they could confirm their suspicions that he was a clone, however, they were called to the other side of the spaceport, where the Bad Batch had started a firefight to free their ship. Cut boarded the shuttle with Suu, Shaeeah, and Jek, and the family left Saleucami to find a new place to call home."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Suu Lawquane was a female Twi'lek with blue eyes, pink skin, and a slender but built frame.

Suu wanted to make a peaceful and humble living with her family on their farm, and preferred to stay out of galactic affairs. She dreamed and hoped that the war would remain far away from her family, though she was ready and prepared to take up arms to keep them from danger. Being a parent, Suu was comfortable with giving her children range to grow up, a lesson she passed on to Hunter as he became nervous about both his and Omega's naivete."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Suu was cautious of outsiders, though, like her husband, her compassion kept her from refusing aid to those in need. Despite her initial wariness around strangers, Suu was a welcoming and gracious host to those who came to her and her family for help, such as Rex and Clone Force 99. Suu was concerned for her husband's safety, first when Rex intended to report him for desertion, and especially when the Empire began enforcing its influence on Saleucami. She trusted the Bad Batch to help her family escape the planet, though even when facing such a difficult task, she remained calm and assuring for the sake of her children."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trained in combat, Suu was a skilled sharpshooter and sniper, a skill she used to protect her home.

Later in the Clone Wars and after the rise of the Empire, she began to wear a wide-brimmed hat that allowed her lekku to hang out the back and swapped her chaps for a more modest grey shirt and brown jumpsuit.
