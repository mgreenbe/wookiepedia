About twenty-nine years after the Battle of Endor, Poe Dameron, Rapier Leader, received a distress signal from the Yissira Zyde in the Mirrin sector. Muran and the rest of Rapier Squadron jumped to lightspeed and found forces of the First Order boarding the distressed freighter. Rapier Squadron engaged the hijackers, but the First Order successfully commandeered the ship and entered hyperspace.
