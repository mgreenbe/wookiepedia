Meanwhile, Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was in Tipoca City during the battle, was curious about the debris falling from the starships as he considered the space attack to be weak, and dived underwater in a Kamino submarine where he discovered the Separatist's plan. This droid was the first to notice Obi-Wan and alerted the other droids who then attacked his submarine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This Aqua droid only appeared in the episode ARC Troopers and was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
