They were a type of arthropod that could grow up to as large as a Human arm, and resembled slow-moving centipedes. Their civilization was wiped out when the living planet Zonama Sekot passed through their star system and caused prolonged periods of seismic and volcanic activity that was almost responsible for their extinction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A small population of Jostrans did manage to survive the upheavals though, as they adapted to the new environment by becoming symbiotic with the native Krizlaw species, crawling into the mouths of their hosts and then burrowing into their abdominal cavity. Once there they would wrap themselves around the spine and use their legs and fine hairs to infiltrate neural tissue and take control of the body."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of this unusual configuration, the resultant species had two minds, a controlling and intelligent \"rider\" and a primitive animal mind. Jedi who were following the trail of Zonama Sekot's retreat into the Unknown Regions soon learned how hard it was to influence the minds of these creatures because of how different both minds were and also because of the natural adaptive habit of the Krizlaws to form hunting packs of eleven hive-linked minds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
