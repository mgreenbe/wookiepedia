The purpose of the campaign was to draw out the witch Mother Talzin and destroy her. The Separatist Droid Army and Confederacy navy fought against the Collective, which included the Pyke Syndicate, Black Sun, Nightbrothers, and Maul's Mandalorian super commandos. The Separatists suffered a loss in the Battle of Ord Mantell, as the Separatist leaders of the campaign, Count Dooku and General Grievous, were captured, but Dooku eventually freed Grievous, and he and Maul escaped from the Galactic Republic when they engaged the Shadow Collective during the Assault on Vizsla Keep 09. This alliance between the two was a ploy on both sides, and Maul planned to use it to bring back Talzin using Dooku's body, but were interrupted by Grievous and Darth Sidious himself. In the end, Sidious and the Confederacy defeated the Shadow Collective, as well as achieving Darth Sidious' goal of killing Talzin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
