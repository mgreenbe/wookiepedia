Nadd's career began as a student in training on the planet Ossus, but a lust for greater power caused him to slay his Master, Matta Tremayne, and renounce his affiliation with the Jedi Order. He fled Ossus and made his way to the heart of the old Sith Empire, where he gained an enormous wealth of dark side knowledge. He eventually followed the Force to the jungle moon of Yavin 4, where he found and apprenticed himself to the ancient Dark Lord Naga Sadow. Sadow trained Nadd in the Sith arts, and led the young Jedi even further down the dark path. When he determined that he had learned all his Sith Master had to offer, Nadd used his newfound powers to destroy Sadow and left Yavin 4 behind in search of a world to conquer as his own. He proclaimed himself Dark Lord of the Sith, and used his sorcerous powers to subjugate the world of Onderon, where he ruled as king from the capital of Iziz for more than a hundred years until his physical demise. His body was entombed below the royal palace of Iziz, which became a focal point of Sith power. Nadd's spirit lingered in the tomb, from whence it taught the descendants of his bloodline and further steeped Onderon in the miasma that was the dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 4000 BBY, the exaltation of Freedon Nadd's memory was the catalyst for the final battle of the centuries-spanning Beast Wars of Onderon, a conflict that arose between the citizens of Iziz who worshiped the deceased Dark Lord and those who had been cast out for their refusal to pledge allegiance to the Sith. A team of Jedi Knights led by Arkanian Master Arca Jeth came to Onderon, ended the battle, and brought a temporary halt to Nadd's influence over the planet with the defeat of Queen Amanoa. However, Amanoa's husband, King Ommin, reasserted Sith influence over the planet when he summoned Freedon Nadd's spirit from Chaos. The restored Naddist cult then rose up in arms and stole the Dark Lord's sarcophagus in a surprise attack during Amanoa's funeral. Nadd revealed himself to the Jedi and participated in the capture of Arca Jeth, who was ultimately rescued by the Jedi after the defeat of King Ommin during the final stages of the Naddist insurrection. Conceding failure, Nadd abandoned Ommin to the mercy of the Jedi, and his spirit was forever banished from Onderon by the power of Arca Jeth. Prior to his departure, however, Nadd happened upon Tetan socialites Aleema and Satal Keto\u2014who had come to Onderon in search of dark side knowledge\u2014and chose to pass the Sith teachings on to them. While Nadd's tomb was relocated to Onderon's jungle moon by the Jedi, his spirit appeared to one of them, Ulic Qel-Droma, and foretold the young Knight's destiny as a Lord of the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For months Freedon Nadd trained the Ketos in Sith magic, but his interests shifted when Exar Kun, a powerful fallen Jedi with dark side curiosities, stirred the Dark Lord's spirit from within his lunar grave. Nadd guided Kun to the ancient Sith homeworld of Korriban where, through a series of trials designed to test his resolve, he decided that Exar Kun was worthy of Sith apprenticeship. Nadd then led Kun to the ancient dwellings of his own Sith Master on Yavin 4 and was pleased when Kun wholeheartedly embraced the Sith after he defeated an enormous Sith wyrm and subjugated the native Massassi warriors. Finally convinced that his apprentice had become one with the dark side, Nadd revealed his need for Exar Kun to create a physical body for him through alchemical means, that he might once again command the power of the Force. Kun, however, refused to entertain Nadd any longer, and in that moment betrayed him. His apprentice's strength tremendously amplified by a Sith amulet, Nadd was attacked by Kun with a potent blast of Force energy that mortally wounded the Sith spirit. Consigned to oblivion for a second time, Nadd contacted the Ketos in his final act and warned them of the threat that Exar Kun posed. He then declared that, along with Ulic Qel-Droma, the future of the Sith rested with Satal and Aleema, before fading into Chaos and dying a second death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early career"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Jedi prodigy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Four hundred years before the outbreak of the Great Sith War, Freedon Nadd appeared on the Jedi Library world of Ossus to begin his Jedi training. Upon his initial arrival, the Jedi Masters on Ossus were astounded by the level of knowledge and proficiency that Nadd demonstrated through his use of the Force. Likewise, the Masters were also impressed with his openness and efforts to attain universal harmony. Under the guidance of his teachers, Nadd learned to willingly trust in the Force and to immerse himself in its fabrics. Many of the Masters on Ossus actively took part in Nadd's training, including the progenitor of the Great Jedi Library, Odan-Urr himself. Nadd's teachers all agreed that he would become a Jedi Master far sooner than any other student who had come before him\u2014if not in technique, then in understanding of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nadd's first test, however, came in an unexpected form when the time arose to grant several apprentices the rank of Jedi Knight. He fully believed that his own promotion to Knight was imminent, but was shocked when the Masters passed over him entirely. With their final decision made, Nadd's universe seemed to collapse around him. As he dwelt on the situation, feelings of hurt and despair began to cloud his mind. He could not understand why the Masters had not graduated him as a reward for all of the progress and hard work he had demonstrated during his time on Ossus. The fact that he had been denied the rank of Jedi Knight caused an enormous internal conflict to take place within Nadd's mind."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The test of Matta Tremayne"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Confused about what the Jedi Masters now expected of him, Nadd sought out his own Master, Matta Tremayne, for advice. As the lightsaber combat instructor of the Jedi Order, Tremayne spent a large majority of her time in a garden on the outskirts of Ossus City practicing lightsaber cadences with perfect execution. What attracted Nadd was her sense of calm and serenity with the universe, something he could feel through the Force. Believing that she could help guide him toward what the other Masters expected of him, Nadd positioned himself just outside of the garden where Tremayne was performing a flawless rhythm of lightsaber moves. Growing frustrated that the elderly woman had not acknowledged his presence, Nadd was determined to wait for her attention\u2014however, after thirty minutes of watching her practice without addressing him, Nadd exploded with the frustration that he had been feeling since the Knighting ceremony. In a flurry of movement, Master Tremayne brought her lightsaber to bear mere centimeters away from Nadd's chest. With Nadd stunned by her sudden acknowledgment of him, Tremayne then resumed her practice motions. This action, however, caused Nadd to grow even more perturbed and he proceeded to storm away from the garden."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Nadd hurriedly walked away, Tremayne called to him and proceeded to tell him that the Masters could not show him what needed to be done\u2014he needed to figure out what was required for himself and learn from that experience. Tremayne further explained that until then, he would not be promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight. Nadd's frustration gave way to pure anger, and he accused Tremayne and the other Masters of being afraid to share their knowledge, and thus any power they had in the Force. Nadd then declared himself a Jedi, one who did not require the permission of the Masters. He vowed to become the greatest Jedi that ever lived, but Tremayne interrupted him with the ignition of her lightsaber, and issued a challenge for Nadd to prove to her that he deserved all the power he claimed. He responded in kind, and a fierce duel ensued, one that saw Nadd struggling to match the pace with which his Master fought. After several passes, Nadd noticed and took advantage of an opening in Tremayne's defenses and swung his lightsaber down in a killing blow. At that moment, Tremayne looked into Nadd's eyes and he was filled with a sudden sense of calm. The entire confrontation had been a test manufactured by Tremayne, and Nadd realized at the last moment before his lightsaber cut into the wizened Master. He tried to halt the blade of his falling lightsaber, to no avail; Tremayne, who had deactivated her own weapon, was struck and killed instantly, leaving only her Jedi robes behind as she disappeared into the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At first, Nadd was overcome with grief over his actions as he stared at the empty robe that had just moments before contained the person of Matta Tremayne. As Nadd continued to dwell on what had transpired, however, his anger rose to new heights. He believed that the Masters had incorrectly chosen the way with which to test him, and that Tremayne had brought her own death upon herself by playing games with him. Believing that she was responsible for all the pain and rage he was feeling, Nadd continued to allow his anger to draw him further toward to the dark side of the Force. He left Ossus in a fit of rage, believing that the Masters had engineered the tests to drive him from the Order. With thoughts of revenge clouding his judgment and fueling his anger, Nadd set his starship's coordinates for the heart of the old Sith Empire, believing that he could find the revenge he craved by becoming a thrall of the dark side.

His search for the Sith led him first to the planet Ashas Ree, where he rediscovered the original Sith holocron: that of King Adas, which had been lost several hundred years earlier by a Sith Lord named Garu. Rumors then led Nadd to continue his search across the expanse of the old empire, but when he failed to find any of the members of the original Sith species, disillusionment threatened to end his journey prematurely. His fortune finally made a turn for the better when he learned of the legendary Dark Lord Naga Sadow, and his forced exile on Yavin 4. Nadd set a course for the jungle moon, hoping to find the Lord of the Ancient Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When he landed on Yavin 4, Nadd encountered the Massassi, a Sith subspecies that had been alchemically bred generations ago by Sadow himself. They immediately set upon him, but the power Nadd had gained during his expedition served him well, and the Massassi deemed him worthy of Naga Sadow's consideration. Nadd was led to Yavin's Great Temple, where he roused Sadow from his centuries-long slumber. The Dark Lord realized that Nadd was indeed a prime candidate for his dark legacy and took the fallen Jedi as his Sith apprentice. Nadd learned all he could from Sadow and even mastered his teachings in the magic of the Sith. However, Nadd's training eventually came to a halt because, according to tradition, only one being could hold the position of Dark Lord of the Sith\u2014which Sadow, still occupied. When he believed that he had learned all that Sadow had to offer, Nadd compiled the sum of his knowledge into a holocron of his own creation.

He made his way to Onderon where, using the knowledge he gained from studying Adas's holocron, he deposed the planet's existing monarchs and assumed the throne as king. Nadd transformed Onderonian culture into one steeped in Sith lore and magic. Although his dynasty was cruel and oppressive, his teachings were widely accepted by the Onderonian people. He ruled from the planet's only establishment, the city of Iziz, a walled fortress that protected Onderon's citizens from the vicious predators that had migrated to the planet from its fourth moon, Dxun. Nadd assisted the Onderonians in the development of modern technology with which to repel the beasts, and later, those who refused to accept his Sith teachings. The punishment for anyone who denied Nadd and his decrees was exile from Iziz, where they were left to face the monstrous creatures from which the walled city offered protection. However, those same outcasts were able to tame the creatures of Onderon's wilderness, and became the Beast Riders, with whom Nadd engaged in a protracted civil war. After many years of war with them, the Beast Riders continued to pose a threat to Iziz, and not even Freedon Nadd's power was enough to stop them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Onderon was subject to the unyielding power of Freedon Nadd for more than a century.

The rulers of Iziz constantly refreshed their skills in the presence of Nadd's spirit, and the Dark Lord readily obliged those who summoned him from Chaos with the desire to study Sith sorcery. One such was Ommin, a direct descendant of Nadd's who, after rising to power as king of Onderon, appealed to the Dark Lord for completion of his Sith indoctrination. For many years Nadd trained Ommin in the arts of Sith sorcery, a secret that was kept from the King's wife, Queen Amanoa. When she finally discovered the relationship between Nadd and her husband, Amanoa fell into despair. Nadd, however, patiently waited as the Queen's depression turned into a loathing that gave way to anger and eventually a deep-seated hatred for Ommin's dark side devotion.

Years passed before Ommin's progression in Sith power caused him to eventually lose control of his body completely, and he was forced to retire from the forefront of Onderonian events in order to receive medical attention. Amanoa took full control of Iziz, and her relentless persecution of the Beast Riders pushed the conflict to the fringes of all-out war.

A team arrived led by Ulic Qel-Droma, and when negotiations failed, Amanoa called upon the power of Freedon Nadd to support her during the ensuing battle against the combined forces of Jedi and Beast Riders. Amanoa fled to Nadd's tomb in the midst of the chaos and summoned the Dark Lord's power to aid the Naddists against her enemies. Nadd assisted his worshipers for a time, but the arrival and subsequent intervention of Jedi Master Arca Jeth turned the tide of battle in the Beast Riders' favor.

They plotted to ambush the Jedi while preparations were being made to move both Nadd's sarcophagus and Amanoa's remains to Onderon's fourth moon of Dxun, and as the funeral procession commenced, the Naddist army attacked.

The primary reason for Nadd sharing his knowledge was to find an individual whose skill would eventually reach the necessary level to create for Nadd a physical body through Sith alchemy, into which the Dark Lord could be resurrected and once again command the full scope of the dark side's power. He actively pushed King Ommin and Queen Amanoa to achieve their full potential through competition with one another, hoping that one of them would become powerful enough to bring his plan to reality. When he realized that neither Ommin nor Amanoa would ever achieve the level of ability that he required, Nadd abandoned them both to the mercy of the Jedi. Nadd was also given to frequent moments of sinister laughter when his schemes seemed to go according to his plans."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Collector"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Freedon Nadd amassed a considerable collection of antiquities as he steeped himself further in the ways of the Sith. The first in his possession were the holocrons of King Adas and Darth Andeddu. By the time of King Ommin's reign over Onderon, Nadd had gifted his descendant with a plethora of amulets, tomes, and other artifacts, all brimming with the power of Sith magic. Upon Ommin's death, the majority of Nadd's relics were confiscated by the Jedi and stored within Nadd's tomb on Dxun. However, several escaped the Jedi's attempt to catalogue them, including two Sith swords that Nadd's spirit bequeathed unto Satal and Aleema Keto as they fled capture in Iziz. Another item, a priceless Sith scroll that detailed the fall of Nadd's Sith Master, was hidden beneath the remains of Nadd's former self, and was given by the Dark Lord to his final apprentice, Exar Kun."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Freedon Nadd was a scholar of the Force and impressed the Jedi Masters on Ossus with his ability to effortlessly handle it. Even prior to beginning his Jedi training, Nadd displayed the capability to wield many of the powers the Jedi Masters themselves commanded, and more. His teachers believed such intuitiveness would surely see Nadd sit among them, far sooner than any student that preceded him. His skill with a lightsaber was just barely on par with that of his Master, Matta Tremayne, whom Nadd was still able to kill, though only after Tremayne refused to defend herself any longer. The murder of Master Tremayne combined with a lust for power led Freedon Nadd to the dark side, where he gained access to more violent and corrupting uses of the Force. The holocrons of King Adas and Darth Andeddu comprised his initial knowledge base, and further study under Naga Sadow saw Nadd become a master of Sith sorcery. Sith magic was the means by which Nadd eliminated Sadow when the Dark Lord was no longer of any use to him, and was also the power Nadd called upon to assist him in the conquest of Onderon. The Dark Lord recorded the totality of his knowledge within his own holocron, a device which would contribute to the tutelage of the Sith apprentice Darth Zannah some three thousand years later. Also within Nadd's holocron was his extensive knowledge regarding the orbalisk parasites of Dxun, crustaceans that fed on the power of the dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his sickly appearance, Nadd was still a force to be reckoned with. Countless Jedi fell in battle to his short bronze-bladed lightsaber, and many more were destroyed with his personal blaster. Nadd's very occupation of Onderon infected its atmosphere with the dark side so completely that the planet remained under its pall even after Nadd's physical death. Both his sarcophagus and tomb became focal points of dark side energy, and radiated so potently that Force-sensitives within close proximity were immediately affected; darksiders became empowered, while followers of the light felt stifled in the Force, as if being smothered by the dark side. When confronted by the power of Arca Jeth, Nadd's influence was unable to endure in the Jedi Master's presence, and was driven from Iziz\u2014temporarily."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike his future apprentice, when Nadd was confronted by the Massassi, he was powerful enough to fight and hold them off until he was deemed worthy of Naga Sadow's consideration. Nadd's spirit retained a measure of the power he had commanded in life and continued to exert influence over his descendants, who maintained dominion over Onderon in Nadd's name. The Dark Lord's spirit came and went as it pleased, even being able to move across the galaxy from from one celestial body to another. Nadd was gifted with foresight, evidenced by his predictions about the men that both Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma would become. He was able to reach through the Force to attack adversaries with the dark side, an ability he used to prevent Vodo-Siosk Baas from interfering in the corruption of Exar Kun. Nadd was gifted with Force healing, an act in which he engaged to further convince Exar Kun of the dark side's superiority. It was Exar Kun who put an end to Freedon Nadd's spirit once and for all, however, after he assaulted the Dark Lord with a blast of Force energy that Nadd was unable to withstand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Freedon Nadd was created by author Tom Veitch for the second issue of the first Tales of the Jedi story arc, 1993's Ulic Qel-Droma and the Beast Wars of Onderon. The process of creating the Tales of the Jedi series was discussed in Making Star Wars Comics Come Alive, an interview with Veitch, Tales of the Jedi artist Christian Gossett, and editor Dan Thorsland. Thorsland explained the significance of Freedon Nadd and the events on Onderon to Tales of the Jedi, and the climactic end to the situation that was planned to be released in an upcoming Tales of the Jedi special release. The Freedon Nadd Uprising story arc was released several months later which, as Thorsland detailed in Making Star Wars Comics Come Alive, saw an end to Freedon Nadd's involvement with Onderon. Nadd is not shown alive in The Freedon Nadd Uprising, but rather as a mummified corpse, and continued to appear as such, as well as a ghost, in the subsequent Dark Lords of the Sith story arc. Nadd also appeared in both Tales of the Jedi audio adaptations, the first of which encompassed Ulic Qel-Droma and the Beast Wars of Onderon, as well as The Freedon Nadd Uprising. Nadd was mentioned in passing in two issues of The Sith War story arc, as well as in the last of the Star Wars: Legacy of the Force novels, Legacy of the Force: Invincible.

Further details for Nadd's backstory were given in several issues of The Official Star Wars Fact File as well as The Dark Side Sourcebook.
