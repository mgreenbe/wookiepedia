Rather than interfere with or conceal against an opponent's scanning attempts, a sensor blind like the Tranquility sought to disguised the target as something else. After analyzing the scanning energy emitted by the enemy's sensors it then transmitted additional energy waves to be picked up by the scanning sensor. The result was that any energy use and equipment picked up by the enemy sensors appeared to be natural phenomenon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although it worked most of the timer results did vary, and it was usually easier when employed in an area which already concentrated a large amount of technology and energy such as a city. A single operator, skilled in the use of sensor equipment, was required to operate the sensor blind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
