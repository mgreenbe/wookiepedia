The ship stumbled upon the O'reen system and its main planet, O'reen. Upon landing on the world, the ship's crew were taken as slaves by the native species, the O'reenians. The Jedi General Morningfire later mounted a rescue of the troops, an assault during which the leader of the planet, known as the Magnus, was killed. The incident convinced the subsequent ruler of O'reen to further isolate the planet from the outside galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
