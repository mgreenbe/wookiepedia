Much of Frigate Ludwick's TIE fighter and Interceptor stores could not be fielded as a fighter screen during Thrawn's inspection, due to repair and refurbishing necessities; thus the Ludwick would suffice with heavily armed TIE Bombers to oversee the Vice Admiral's visit.

No sooner had Thrawn begun his journey to NL-1 an attack composed of Rebel A-wings, X-wings and Y-wings arrived. Imperial fighters moved to intercept as Thrawn's inspection team boarded the platform. Imperial pilots, one of which was Maarek Stele, managed to finish off this low level hit and run just as Admiral Thrawn completed his inspection, returning to the Stalwart aboard Transport Omega. Moments after Imperial TIE Bombers moved to escort Thrawn back to the Stalwart, several groups of pirate shuttles arrived to add the disruption. Thrawn safely arrived aboard his vessel as Imperial fighters suppressed the last of the rebel and pirate nuisance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The skirmish was considered a close call for Thrawn's safety.
