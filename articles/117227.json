During the last years of the Republic, Roona was represented in the Galactic Senate by Senator Edcel Bar Gane. Even before the Battle of Naboo, Gane had voiced concerns about Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum's actions and their impact on the stability of the Republic as early as 33 BBY. He believed that Valorum's perceived ineffectiveness would further divide the myriad politicians of the Senate to extremes. Subsequently, when Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala moved for a Vote of No Confidence for Valorum, Gane seconded the motion, which was resoundingly successful."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his time on Coruscant, Gane allied himself with the influential yet corrupt Senators Orn Free Taa, Passel Argente, and Toonbuck Toora, and was a supporter of then-Senator Palpatine. Despite his alliance with Taa, Gane vigorously disagreed with his fellow Senator following the bail-jumping of former Senator Tikkes, who had joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems. He believed that Tikkes was not guilty of the charges against him, but rather had fled Coruscant to avoid the same fate as Senator Aks Moe. Gane continued to serve in the Senate up until, and possibly through, the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 22 BBY, a Roonan was a Match Master employed at the BlasTech Gikosphere on Coruscant.
