He and his fellow stormtrooper guarded a landing platform, when Tyber Zann staged a robbery at the area. Zann dropped down in a stolen Lambda-class T-4a shuttle at the landing platform the two soldiers were guarding. The stormtrooper noticed that this wasn't on his schedule, and demanded that Zann provide identification. Tyber said the trooper did not need to see his identification. The stormtrooper joked that Tyber was pretending to be a Jedi, and asked for what reason did Tyber not need to provide identification. Zann calmly stated the trooper didn't need to because he was dead, as a cloaked Urai Fen instantly killed him, allowing Tyber to shoot the other stormtrooper."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
