During the Galactic Civil War, Naator produced resources for the Galactic Empire's war effort. In 3 ABY, the Rebel Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry targeted Naator as part of its campaign, Operation Ringbreaker, which sought targets which were situated along the Rimma Trade Route. The 61st fought and defeated the Empire's forces there before moving on."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Operation Ringbreaker was vetted by the Rebel Alliance Intelligence Service, and General Crix Madine listed Naator among the targets in a report on the campaign's first phase. The report was later acquired by archivist Hendri Underholt and included among a compilation of information called the The Rebel Files. At some point, an Alliance strike team spotted a crashed Galactic Republic GX1 Short Hauler in the mountains of Naator. Records suggested that it could have been a vessel named the Intrepid Heart."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Naator was first mentioned in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
