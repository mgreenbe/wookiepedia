Ships that had been modified thusly were intended to pose as ordinary cargo vessels in order to lure pirates into firing range, whereupon the crew would engage the unsuspecting raiders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gozanti Cruiser Krayt's Honor was a Q-Ship that served to protect legitimate merchant vessels from attack. Many GR-75 medium transports were also converted to Q-Ship status, being armed with military-grade weaponry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Q-ship was a British naval tactic which was developed in WW1, the Germans were raiding British shipping and by 1915 Britain was desperate to find a way to beat the raiders, they come with the idea of arming a freighter with hidden weapons which could be hidden until needed, making the ship look like any other unarmed merchant ship. When a raider appeared (German submarines usually attacked convoys with their deck gun, to save precious torpedoes) the Q-ship could bring out its weaponry and sink the raider, these ships were also used by the US Navy. Q-ships later served in WW2 against German and Japanese submarines, some say they could also be used to combat modern-day pirates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
