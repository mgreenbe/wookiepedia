Back on board the Ghost, the crew discussed how to infiltrate the Sovereign and rescue Kanan, who was imprisoned there and was being tortured by the Grand Inquisitor for the location of other Rebel cells and the real identity of \"Fulcrum.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rest of the crew decided to use the TIE fighter stolen by Ezra and Zeb and fill it full of EMP grenades, to take out the ship's power then dock their stolen transport with the ship to enter. Meanwhile, The Grand Inquisitor taunted Kanan with memories of his master, Depa Billaba's death during Order 66."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rebels successfully infiltrated Grand Moff Tarkin's Star Destroyer, but their sabotage elicited a swift response from Tarkin, who ordered stormtroopers from adjacent Star Destroyers to board the Sovereign. Chased by stormtroopers, Ezra was forced to separate from the crew to rescue Kanan alone. The rest of the crew attempted to get off the Sovereign. On board the stolen transport, Chopper called \"Fulcrum\" for help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ezra rescued Kanan from his cell, but they were stopped by the Inquisitor in the ship's reactor core room, and a fierce duel ensued between Kanan and the Inquisitor. While caught in a crossblade, Ezra joined the fight with Kanan Jarrus' lightsaber (his own being borrowed by Kanan for the duel) that was attached to the Inquisitor's belt. After briefly disarming Kanan, the Inquisitor hurled his lightsaber at Ezra, knocking him off of the platform, unconscious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kanan, initially shocked and dismayed by what he perceived to be the \"death\" of his Padawan, quickly recovered and dueled the Inquisitor with renewed focus. He destroyed the Grand Inquisitor's lightsaber and forced him to hang on the ledge of the platform. The discarded lightsaber fell into the Sovereign's reactor core, destroying it and setting off a chain reaction. The Inquisitor then warned Kanan that \"there are things far worse than death\" before letting go and allowing himself to fall to his doom."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ezra, who was not dead but briefly unconscious, reunited with a relieved Kanan. Hera, Zeb, and Sabine, having found their way back to the TIE fighter they used to infiltrate the Sovereign, escaped the Star Destroyer but were shocked to find that Chopper and their transport were nowhere in sight. Kanan and Ezra stole the Inquisitor's TIE Advanced and rejoined their comrades,who were now stranded in space without Chopper. Tarkin evacuated the Sovereign, which was rapidly falling apart. In the ensuing space battle, the crew of the Ghost recognized the futility of escape. At the last moment, Chopper returned with the transport, the Ghost, and three Corellian Corvettes. After the TIEs docked with the transport, the fleet escaped from the Imperial flotilla."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hera reunited with Kanan and they received a message from Bail Organa, who revealed that they are one of many cells fighting the Empire. \"Fulcrum\" descended from the dorsal turret of the Ghost and introduced herself as Ahsoka Tano.
