Although its name was perhaps overstated, it kept the Galactic Empire looking in other locations for a much larger facility. The yard was a pillar of webbed metalwork hidden along the exposed underside of an Acclamator-class transgalactic military assault ship left over from the Clone Wars, with a 100-meter-long armature that slid along its entire length."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The primary function of the shipyard was to repair starships that were unable to utilize ports under Imperial control or oversight. However, it was also responsible for refitting bulk freighters and haulers with armor, weaponry, and increased hangar space to transform cargo ships into combat vessels for usage by mercenaries, pirates, and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The engineer team accomplished this through judicious usage of shipyard droids. Together, they mounted weaponry produced in Foundry Four on the surface and convert cargo bays into hangars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ferra Sector Shipyard was introduced in the 2016 Fantasy Flight Games adventure book Friends Like These as part of the Star Wars: Age of Rebellion roleplaying game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
