The rights for it were about to be sold by the Metellos Exchange on the auction, when Marn Hierogryph, Jarael and Rohlan Dyre had tried to run a con there, claiming that a native of Italbos was there to claim their share of money from the deal. After Gryph dealt with Nunk Plaarvin, Zayne Carrick told the people at the auction that Italbos was presumably inhabitable, and that weren't any confirmed mineral riches, but the rights to the planet had been sold anyway."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
