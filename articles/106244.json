A rival of Servid Norn, both Hartar and Norn believed that they employed the best pilots in the galaxy. Nominating a pilot from their crew to participate in a race across the galaxy, they agreed that the winner would be whoever reached the destination first. Beginning on Tynna, each pilot had to obtain a docking permit from the planets Bothawui, Nal Hutta, Dac, Almania, Ord Mantell, Fondor, and Bespin. Once the permits were acquired they had to be delivered to the spaceport controller in Mos Eisley. Unbeknownst to Hartar, Norn had placed a bounty on Scranton Toon, Hartar's pilot, in an attempt to win."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
