Initially, Gascon believed that the Galactic Republic had come to rescue them, however, once they arrived to the Star Destroyer's bridge, they discovered that Separatist forces had hijacked the vessel. After escaping the battle droids, D-Squad found a detonator, and that the docking bays of the cruiser were filled with rhydonium, which was known to be extremely explosive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Further on the ship, D-Squad ran into a small group of Republic droids including servant droid BNI-393, who explained that the Separatists had taken over the starship and planned to destroy the space station Valor, where the Republic strategy conference was taking place."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, buzz droids discovered D-Squad's location, and as the buzz droids were closing in, BZ decided to open the air lock which would force the buzz droids out into hyperspace.
