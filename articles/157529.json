Searching for ties to the Rebel Alliance, the Empire blockaded the world and declared martial law. The stormtrooper, under the leadership of a commander and alongside a technician and fellow stormtrooper B4711, entered the home of the famous Rebel Chewbacca. After terrorizing Chewbacca's family, the group left save for B4711, who remained behind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike B4711, this stormtrooper is not named in The Star Wars Holiday Special.
