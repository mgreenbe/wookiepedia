Deeming the Advisory Council ineffectual and defunct after the agreement was struck, Antilles sought out Jedi Master Luke Skywalker of the Jedi Order for advice. Suggesting that the Council should gently be subverted in order to perform more effectively, Skywalker recalled the fighting style of the Rebel Alliance and from these talks the Insiders were created. Subsequently, Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo, along with other members, set up resistance cells on a number of worlds without informing the Republic of their activities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
