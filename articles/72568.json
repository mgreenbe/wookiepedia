Vader is displeased with the time it is taking for the Officers to plant a spy in the Rebel's ranks in order to find the Rebel base. Darth Vader orders for them to send a squadron to capture one of the \"Two Droids, known and trusted among the Rebels\" (i.e. R2-D2 or C-3PO.) Vader reasons that the Rebels would not suspect a mechanical spy and so a reprogrammed droid could relay plans straight to the Empire.

As the Officers run to check on the explosion, Luke climbs through a window and replaces the real R2 with the pile of junk that looks like him.
