He was officially full with rights during the Outbound Project and was soon promoted into the ranks as judge, master, and supreme guardian, but his efforts were turned down when Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth took command. He, like most non-Force users of the time, had very little knowledge of the Jedi Order. He was killed along with most of the passengers and crew when Chiss Commander Thrawn destroyed the ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
