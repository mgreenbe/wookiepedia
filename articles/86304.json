The aim of the Kallidahin efforts at the dig site was to find traces of the extinct Eellayin species\u2014the supposed ancestors of the Kallidahin\u2014and discover why the planet Polis Massa was destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the pregnant human Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala was brought to the dig site by her allies in 19 BBY, Tuun was part of the medical team that helped to deliver her twins, Luke and Leia. Amidala was also heavily injured, and her condition was judged to be so critical that Tuun and the rest of the team did not have time to change out of their caving jumpsuits. Only two of the technicians on the team were trained physicians, with the rest being xenobiologists who were usually attached to the archaeological team in order to analyze artifacts for organic tissue. After the twins were successfully delivered, Amidala died despite the best efforts of the team. The dig site was later completely abandoned."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the First Order occupation of the planet Batuu around 34 ABY, Tuun was 86 years old. At the time, the Kallidahin's stolen identity profile was in the possession of the pirate Hondo Ohnaka, who used the profile along with several others to test a group of potential new employees for his company, Ohnaka Transport Solutions. Ohnaka hoped to use the employees in a heist he was planning. In order to test the employees' ability to memorize details from a cover identity, he sent the profiles, including Tuun's, to the employees' datapads and then quizzed them on details from the data."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like the other Kallidahin technicians at the Polis Massa dig site, Maneeli Tuun had had little contact with humans and so knew little about their parturition. He and the others involved in the delivery asked few questions of those accompanying the pregnant Padm\u00e9 Amidala, showing discretion in their task. The team was baffled when it could not save the senator's life. Tuun had purple-and-white skin, red eyes, and no hair. Tuun spoke using sign language and was telepathic.
