It was then put into service for the Trade Federation. This droid was stationed aboard the Command ship Saak'ak during the Blockade of Naboo, where it served in an eight-droid squad led by the OOM commander battle droid OWO-1, under the command of Viceroy Nute Gunray. He, alongside his squad were tasked with the mission to see if the Dioxis gas had killed the two Jedi in the conference room. He was then ordered by OWO-1 to go in first to investigate, promising that they give support fire if he needed it: If the Jedi survived, they were to be shot on sight. Before he could step in, however, he and the other soldiers saw the Jedi ignite their lightsabers. His mission went uncompleted and he was destroyed along with his squad."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
