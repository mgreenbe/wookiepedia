But during the Sacking of Coruscant and the subsequent Cold War, the programming of many of these droids became corrupted. They turned against the biological inhabitants of the planet, seizing control of much of The Works. As they continued to \"convert\" other droids, the threat they posed grew to the point where the Galactic Republic was forced to send troopers down into the Works to combat them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the year 3643 BBY, a group of mobiles attempted to destroy the machines known by Ozurist as Thermodraft. Thermodraft's destruction would result in a massive explosion and radiation leak, which would kill an untold number of civilians. To stop this threat, Ozurist asked a traveling hero to venture into the Works and repair Thermodraft. The hero fought their way through the mobiles, defeating many of them and managing to repair the machine, preventing the catastrophe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mobiles appear in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (MMORPG) by BioWare released on December 20, 2011.
