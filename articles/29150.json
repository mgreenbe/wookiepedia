It was a large turret used similarly like anti-armor artillery. The cannon would fire a pair of concussion energy balls at a vehicle or tank, and would do serious damage to the vehicle if they hit. Although mainly used as anti-armor during the Clone Wars, they could also be used against large groups of infantry if aimed properly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
