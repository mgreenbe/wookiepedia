Once a hot jungle planet, its rich veins of ore attracted heavy industry, and by the time of the Clone Wars Metalorn had become a polluted factory world covered with industrial plants, mines and ore refineries. Metalorn was one of the Confederacy of Independent System's most productive industrial planets during the Clone Wars, and under the Galactic Empire became a penal colony for dissidents. The planet was occupied during the Yuuzhan Vong War and was heavily Vongformed, reversing many centuries of pollution and turning it into a prime recruiting ground for the Peace Brigade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one point, Metalorn was a sun-beaten jungle world where, in the upper atmosphere, it was almost impossible for weaker ships to land because the intense heat would melt them. At the surface however, there were lush tropical forests separated by shallow seas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Metalorn's rich veins of ore attracted heavy industry in the decades before the Clone Wars, in particular Baktoid and the Techno Union. Metalorn was remade as a factory world covered in plants, refineries and ore-processing centers making everything from security droids for the Trade Federation to industrial goods for the Core and Colonies. The surface became a barren wasteland of rock, ash, and industrial magma pits created by underground city-factories, the rainforests withered and burned, and the planet's shallow seas became irreversibly polluted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A large area of the planet was dominated by a gigantic refuse pile known as the Wasteland, which held large amounts of trash and junk.

Under the Techno Union, rivers were converted into canyons so they could move the materials to the factories more easily."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Clone Wars erupted, the planet was part of the Foundry of the Confederacy, a swath of industrial planets loyal to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, supplying it with weapons and warships.

After finding out about this, senator Bail Prestor Organa of Alderaan came up with a desperate mission to save the imprisoned Jedi by convincing Wat Tambor that Alderaan wanted to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems and convert Alderaan into a factory world like Metalorn. Tambor was deceived and allowed Organa to land the Tantive IV on Metalorn so that he could give the Alderaanian a tour of the factories. During the tour Bail asked to see the Techno Union's prison facilities. Tambor brought the group to Unreal City, the prison complex of Metalorn that was so big it could hold twice the population of a normal planet and was visible from orbit. While touring the complex, Bail was able to locate Shaak Ti's holding cell and free her using her lightsaber. During the battle that ensued, they were then able to escape in the Tantive IV and leave the planet for good, saying that they had to notify the Galactic Republic and the Jedi High Council about the atrocities that were going on on Metalorn."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Later history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after the Declaration of a New Order, a campaign was fought when the Galactic Empire attempted to drive out the holdout forces of the CIS led by ex-Senator Toonbuck Toora from the region of the \"Foundry of the Confederacy\".

The invaders' terraforming restored Metalorn's ecology, albeit with a decidedly Yuuzhan Vong flavour, and the planet became a recruiting place for the Peace Brigade.
