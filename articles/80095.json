After winning the pageant Larisselle toured the galaxy as her music made her famous. Once Emperor Palpatine rose to power and instituted the Galactic Empire, new xenophobic policies cost non-humans such as Larisselle their livelihoods. Chatrunis subsequently joined the Rebel Alliance, determined to use her fame and talents in order to help end Palpatine's tyrannical reign and restore freedom to fellow discriminated aliens. Under the guise of a simple singing troupe, Larisselle served the Alliance undercover, stealing Empire secrets and passing them on to key members in the Rebellion.
