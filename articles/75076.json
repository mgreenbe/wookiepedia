Hoping for a big story, Rand noticed a Council Authority officer following Ambassador Dictio L'varren's aide, Tev Aden, into a corridor. Rand decided to follow but was stopped by another Authority Officer. When a blaster went off in the hallway beyond, she disobeyed the guard and followed him to investigate; there, they found Aden dead, shot by Officer Kaleb Darme.

He pulled her into the turbolift, threatened her with a vibroknife, took her datacards, and shot her with a stun bolt. In his escape from the turbolift, L'varren's people, after seeing the evidence, caught Darme and rescued Rand.
