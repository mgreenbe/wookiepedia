It was in a small and hidden fortress, located in a system of the same name in the Khuiumin sector of the Outer Rim Territories, past Lan Barell and the end of the Enarc Run. It served as home to his family, servants, and trusted associates, but was off limits for business transactions or uninvited visitation.
