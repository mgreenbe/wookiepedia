He was tall and thin, which gave him an unusual appearance for a swoop gang leader. Flint had short black hair, with a long moustache and beard. He always wore a flight suit with \"Knights\" on the back of it. Most of the time he was a calm man, but in combat, Finegan Flint fought like a wild man. The purposes of his swoop gang were also quite different than most swoop gangs. He opposed and battled the Galactic Empire, as well as other swoop gangs such as The Skulls."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
