Any starship stuck in the middle of an interdiction field became unable to jump into hyperspace. Inversely, such a field could yank a ship out of hyperspace, pulling it out abruptly into normal space. Such fields were created by gravity well projectors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
