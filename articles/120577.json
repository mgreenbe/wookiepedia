At some point it explored the unremarkable comet Resh 9376. It performed full scanning, took dozens of samples and made a holomap of the comet, all in twenty-two minutes. Then it broadcast all data to Corellia in a burst transmission and moved to its next destination. The data was briefly analyzed by Corellian astronomers, then filed away and forgotten."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
