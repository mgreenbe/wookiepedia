Instead of that, he spending a lot of time sitting on a \"secret\" branch of one of the oldest trees in the village, daydreaming.

Then, the boys encountered Zandor Rockers who led them to Gantu's cave, which was lit by the nectar they were seeking. Gantu discovered them and Wicket distracted him with the bridge crystal, then threw it to Teebo, whom Gantu caught, causing him to drop and break the crystal. Angry, the ogre vowed to eat the young Ewoks, but one of Zandor rockers jumped on his foot, after which he spilled the whole plate of nectar on his own head.

Wicket then had an idea of building a glider that wouldn't fly and Teebo caused the Quorks to argue by telling them that only the smartest among them will be able to fly the glider. While the Quorks were arguing over who was the most intelligent among them, the boys grabbed the wood and flew away. The Quork king Marlox went after them, but the glider fell apart.

The two friends then fought back by tossing burr balls at the lizard warriors, which bought them some time. As they were heading towards the swamp at the end of the valley, angered Graak sent Joddar to personally stop them, having seen that all the other warriors have failed.

Convinced that the bird was mocking him, he plucked its tail feather and stuck it in his hood, after which his mood changed to somewhat hyperactive. As his two friends were carrying his basket as additional load, Teebo brought them down as if they were bowling pins and skipped his way to the village; where he heavily damaged two huts - one belonging to a young married couple and the one to an older Ewok named Neddoo, used fire bellows to blast some flour and spilled honey. Initially, all the affected Ewoks were laughing as well, but then they ran to complain to Chief Chirpa, interrupting the meeting of the Council of Elders, solely to witness Teebo jump in and trash everything once again.

Teebo saved them and concluded that he would rather remain under the spell forever than put Wicket and Kneesaa's life in danger again.

To his surprise, Squik cut the pearl like a loaf of bread and offered the Ewoks to eat it. The underwater creatures then showed their guests their most precious red pearl, which supplied the light for the yellow pearls to glow. They were quickly interrupted by Orcon, the tyrant with a trident, riding the devil serpent. The critters proceeded to give him a net full of their yellow pearls, which surprised the Ewoks, who decided to intervene. This enraged Orcon and he asked for all yellow pearls. Upon being denied his wish, he poked the devil serpent with his trident and the beast fired rays on the underlings. He stopped when he noticed the red pearl and decided to take it away with him, despite knowing that Squick and his friend will perish without it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wearing plants shaped as diving masks and riding water wallocks, the trio followed Orcon to his lair.

Wicket grabbed Orcon's trident and turned the beast against him. On their way back to the cavern, Teebo spotted the same blue pearl he dropped when the serpent attacked the boat earlier that day and he brought it with him. The blue pearl appeared to be stronger than red and Teebo was offered a whole yellow pearl as a sign of gratitude, but he refused to take it, claiming that he had more pearls that he could stomach."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Saving the shrunken princess"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After princess Kneesaa was tricked into smelling the damsel flower, shrunken and kidnapped by the fleebogs, Wicket and Teebo offered to help rescue her.

The boys were given a batch of growing powder and were then transported to the forest floor in a bucket. After having narrowly escaped a bunch of bugs, they were attacked by the ra-lugg. The beast caught Wicket. Teebo set his friend free, but the powder remained on the webbing.

Urged by Kneesaa, they traced the ra-lugg to its lair and made up a plan on the go. While Wicket was distracting the aranchid, Kneesaa used some growing powder on it and the ra-lugg got big and ran away, scared of himself.

The result got him worried and he hesitated to announce it. Once he said it was Teebo, everybody laughed. Teebo himself, chasing a butterfly not far away, ran to see what he was called for and tripped on his butterfly net, causing the villagers to tease him even further, claiming that he would not be able to lead them out of a berry patch, with a map.

The angry Ewoks ran after Teebo and he managed to ran away on his hang-glider, terrified, as Wicket and Kneesaa were trying to talk everybody else out of harming their friend. His glider was then attacked by an unknown probe droid and, as he crashed in some bushes, Teebo tried to remain still until the threat went away. Then he decided to warn the others about possible danger.

While aware that his friend was not really meaning to hurt him, Teebo was unsure what to do other than tuck the stun gun, until his hood got stuck to a crummy branch. He then placed the hood over a bush and tricked Wicket into firing at the bush as he dropped a fruit on him from a tree. Once Wicket came to his consciousness, Teebo assured him that he was not angry and he got a risky idea. He placed the stone back around his friend's neck, effectively getting command of him. Once they were back in the spaceship, he was pretending to be betrayed and captured, until Wicket got close enough to Zornak. Teebo then commanded Wicket to place the obedience stone around the enemy's neck.

After some of the troops were taken down using catapults and balanced wood trunks, Teebo led the next phase of the assault, where the Ewoks were flying skin-gliders, dropping rocks on the stormtroopers, or dive-bombing with spears. He was hit in the wing by a laser and almost crushed by a walker, but Wicket swooped down to save him. After this, they were both hit by a speeder bike and out of the battle for a while."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Recovered, the two childhood friends clinged onto Chewbacca's back as he took their example and used a swinging vine to jump on a Tempest Scout 2, one of the AT-ST walkers. The Wookiee then dashed the first Stormtrooper who got out to see what hit his vehicle to the ground, while Teebo and Wicket immediately dove into the hatch and subdued the other trooper. They tried to drive the walker, almost causing Chewbacca to fall off its top, but they managed to hit another walker before he came inside to take control over the vehicle. The hijacked walker then destroyed all the remaining ones, paving its way back to the bunker; where Han had managed to hotwire the controls and a wounded Leia took a couple more Imperial soldiers down."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "After the battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the celebration went on in Bright Tree Village, Teebo played drums alongside Leektar, who was involved with other percussion instruments and another Ewok, who played on Stormtrooper's helmets, and eventually he reconciled with R2-D2."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Appearance changes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teebo's personality and appearance varied greatly throughout all of the material he appears in; compared to most of the other prominent Ewoks - and they often depend one on the other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Return of the Jedi, Teebo appears to be taller than the other featured Ewoks (second only to then-deceased Chukha-Trok overall), has gray and black stripped fur."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout the first couple of young reader books released between the film and the cartoon series, Teebo is shown wearing standard Ewok hoods of various colors (orange, green) and with plain gray fur.
