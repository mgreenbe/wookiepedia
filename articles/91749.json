Rather than have his Jedi be targets on and off the battlefield, Mace Windu assembled a team of the most powerful Jedi available\u2014Jedi Masters Kit Fisto, Saesee Tiin and Agen Kolar, the same Jedi that would later fight with Palpatine\u2014and infiltrated the Crimson Nova headquarters on The Rig spacestation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Windu's team successfully breached The Rig's security. Mace himself remained fully visible to the bounty hunters, deflecting attention from the other Jedi. Kolar posed as Argent Kole, a bounty hunter looking to collect credits for his \"captive\", Kit Fisto. While Fisto incited riots among the prisoners, Tiin, in the guise of a smuggler, set off an explosion in the hangar bays."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Windu had arrived on the Rig and he demanded to know who in the Bounty Hunters' Guild was responsible for the bounties that were posted on the Jedi. The bounty hunters who were present attacked Windu, but were cut down. With The Rig in turmoil, the Jedi executed their show of force, fighting their way into the command center and ensuring the deaths of the guild leaders. The bounties were rescinded, and the originator, Kh'aris Fenn, was later executed by Quinlan Vos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
