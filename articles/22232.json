When Boba Fett entered the reactor room aboard the Endurance, CT-1477 assumed he was a lost cadet and contacted security to escort him back to his company. While talking, Boba convinced the trooper to let him hold his DC-15A blaster rifle. Boba used the weapon to deliver multiple blows to CT-1477, who pleaded for him not shoot when the younger clone aimed the blaster at him, saying that they were brothers. Ignoring this, Boba stunned him and proceeded to destroy the main reactor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
