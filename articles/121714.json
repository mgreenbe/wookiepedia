Attempting to prevent Gor from activating the Phylanx Redux Transmitter, Han Solo and Lando Calrissian's team tracked the transmitter to the Mesulan Remnants, but their starship, the Vermillion, was hijacked by Gor. Solo and Calrissian themselves later arrived in the Chevalier, having been visiting the asylum on Grava, finding the Remnants. During the skirmish, the Elthree Assault Team, founded years earlier by L3-37, entered the skirmish against Gor's Original Dozen. Calrissian managed to destroy the transmitter, and Solo killed Gor with the Chevalier's laser cannons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
