And, taking advantage of this, Nom Anor decides to use Ngaaluh to report lies to Shimrra about certain enemy colleagues of Nom Anor. These lies state that Nom Anor's antagonistic colleagues were corrupt and supporting the Jedi heresy, and the lies pass successfully well in Anor's enemies' eliminations. But Shoon-mi Esh, one of Nom Anor's most trusted assistants, turns on Nom Anor and tries to kill him with a band of other heretics because Shoon-mi knew that Anor didn't care about all those who died for the heresy, and so Shoon-mi is aiming to establish another heresy to overthrow Shimrra. But the Shamed warrior Kunra, another trusted ally of Nom Anor's, saves him from Shoon-mi and the betraying band of heretics, and Nom Anor kills Shoon-mi in retaliation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Onadax, Goure Conor told Jaina and her party to go to next after the Battle of Bakura, the plan to reestablish contacts ends badly.

But the Millennium Falcon accidentally kills several of Esfandia's natives, dubbed the \"Cold Ones\" by the Communications Base inhabitants, the former being ectoplasmic species that are the only thing alive on Esfandia. Han and his company realize about the ignorant massacre they accidentally caused, thanks to help of understanding them by C-3PO, and establish trust between them and the Cold Ones by saving them from a Yuuzhan Vong orbital bombardment. And with that, the Cold Ones lead the Falcon over to the Communications Base.
