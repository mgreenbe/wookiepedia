It occurred when two or more players laid down their card-chips, and it was discovered they had the same total. One additional card was drawn by each applicable contestant. The player with the best score after this card-chip was factored in, was declared the winner of that hand. If the first extra card-chip failed to break the tie, a second extra card-chip would be dealt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
