Made by Arakyd Industries, the three-legged droid had an uncanny resemblance to a spider."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Used early on by the Galactic Empire as crowd control because of their incapacitating abilities, the Agonizer-6 was a common sight on backwater worlds, where Imperial Rule wasn't as strongly enforced as the Core Worlds.
