They guided the injured and dying ship to Seline, which was \"thousands of parsecs\" closer to Coruscant than any other feasible \"emergency\" location. The Jedi duo was met there at the starport's deserted hangar by Jedi High Council member Mace Windu and Jedi Master Thracia Cho Leem, who counseled the young Skywalker after a very trying mission, then escorted him and his Master back to the capital. Kenobi had learned of Seline's existence years earlier, after a harrowing adventure with his own Jedi Master, Qui-Gon Jinn. The deserted station, known only to the Jedi, was one of the closest Galactic Republic worlds to the original location of Zonama Sekot in the Gardaji sector of the Outer Rim Territories. Seline was the last resting place of the Sekotan organic ship, the Jabitha."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Seline was attacked by the extra-galactic invaders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
