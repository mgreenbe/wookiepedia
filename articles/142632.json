But it's not who you think! On the odd planet of Xokhal, the vile Quaffug the Hutt has staged a hunt for his private amusement. With the unscrupulous bounty hunters all vying for the same purse, all rules are thrown out. But Quaffug and his hired rogues may get more than they bargained for from their \"helpless\" prey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This comic book follows Lando Calrissian, who visited the palace of Quaffug the Hutt on a diplomatic mission from the Rebel Alliance. Upon visiting Quaffug, he found himself captured and sentenced to death; ostensibly because of a game of sabacc which Quaffug had accused Lando of cheating at. For Quaffug's amusement, Lando was given time to escape, before numerous mercenaries were sent to kill him for sport. In his journey he came across a friendly race of which he had never previously encountered, known as the Jokhalli. Upon besting them at divot, Lando was able to rally the support of the Jokhalli, convincing them he would assist in the destruction of Quaffug and use them to capture his pursuers. He then returned to Quaffug palace, with the Jokhalli and the mercenaries captured. Lando convinced Quaffug to join the Alliance, frustrating the leader of the Jokhalli, who wanted Quaffug dead. This sparked a battle between him and the Jokhalli leader which Lando won. Subsiquently Lando left the palace of Quaffug, having successfully convinced Quaffug to join forces with the Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
