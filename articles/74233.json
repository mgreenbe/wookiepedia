He often served as a double for the Imperial Head of State, Jagged Fel. In 43.5 ABY, Valanti accompanied Fel as part of the Imperial Remnant delegation to the Unification Summit on the galactic capital of Coruscant. During the Summit, Fel joined Darkmeld, a secret organization created by Jedi Knight Jaina Solo to counter Galactic Federation of Free Alliances Chief of State Natasi Daala's anti-Jedi policies. During one of Darkmeld's missions, in which they captured the psychotic Jedi Knight Seff Hellin, Valanti took up Fel's place at the Imperial Embassy, so the Head of State would not be missed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after, Valanti officially joined Darkmeld, taking on the codename of \"Carved.\" Meanwhile, reporters and journalists had begun following Fel and Solo\u2014who were in a relationship\u2014wherever they went, making it difficult for the two to have an evening alone together. During a mission deemed Operation Caranak, Valanti partnered up with a double of Solo, Lina Zev, and the two dined together at the restaurant Indigo Tower to throw off anyone who might be following Fel and Solo. One such journalist, Javis Tyrr, fell for the ploy and dined at the restaurant, hoping to raise the ratings of his show by exposing information about Fel and Solo's relationship. He eventually discovered that Valanti and Zev were simply doubles, but by that time Fel and Solo were on their way to an inn halfway around the planet, free to dine alone. Later, in 44 ABY, Valanti and Zev again masqueraded as the two on the planet Hapes, making occasional public appearances while the real Fel and Solo\u2014who had recently been married\u2014embarked on a secret trip to the planet Sakuub."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Jagged Fel's double, Karn Valanti was very similar in appearance to the Imperial Remnant Head of State, with black hair, green eyes, and light skin.
