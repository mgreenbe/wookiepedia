The figurine was intended to be Princess Leia Organa holding a spear and wearing a primitive dress. When he showed Organa she, not knowing it was actually her, asked if it was meant to be one of the Ewok's. In embarrassment Solo tossed the figurine aside, Organa recovered it later and had it in her pocket when the second Death Star exploded. During the funeral of Han Solo on D'Qar in 34 ABY, Organa placed the figurine along with other items amongst the roots of a tree."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
