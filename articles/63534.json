One of his first targets were the TIE/ad starfighter production facilities in the Omar system: Omar 1, Omar 2, and Omar 3. Sending a massive fleet that overwhelmed the local defenses, Zaarin left the loyalist Imperial forces with no other choice but to abandon the facilities and to save the surviving personnel on these stations. The Libro was one of the many Imperial transports assigned to rescue as many of the surviving crew as possible on Omar 1, and then escape before Zaarin's forces could intercept it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Loyalist forces sent 3 TIE Defenders lead by Maarek Stele to hold of the forces long enough for the personnel to escape.
