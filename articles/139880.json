They were considered to be a highly unintelligent yet very dangerous species. They had a shaggy coat of fur and moved about on two legs. Tangak's were surprisingly agile for their immense size, and they could easily blend into their surroundings. Although Tangak's preferred to eat the six-legged tris, there were several documented accounts of them attacking young Coynites."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
