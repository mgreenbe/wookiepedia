Kek was an older Human who had a strict command style, but was able to improvise with unusual assets or situations. Before his service in the Rebel Alliance, Kek had served in the Confederacy of Independent Systems' navy as gunner on the Recusant-class light destroyer Vanguard Flare. The ship was destroyed during the Battle of Coruscant. Romar Kek escaped to another ship and made it back to Separatist space. During his service within the Rebel Alliance he was one of the early developers of the base on Yavin 4. Kek was promoted to General after the Defiant Core base received its complement of Y-wing starfighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
