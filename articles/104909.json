The blaster rifle was claid in chromium to match its owner's distinctive armor. However, Phasma's blaster rifle lacked the full trigger guard standard for an F-11D blaster. The barrel of Phasma's blaster rifle had heat dispersal vents, while it also had an extended stock which contained a gas reservoir."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time she returned to her homeworld of Parnassos to create her armor a year after joining the First Order, Phasma had secretly ordered the blaster and it was already tuned to her gloves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 34 ABY, Phasma carried her blaster at Jakku and used it under the orders of Kylo Ren to execute some of the remaining villagers that survived the attack of the stormtroopers following Lor San Tekka's death.

After escaping from the compactor, Phasma attempted to use her rifle to take out Lieutenant Sol Rivas, but as the base was being destroyed around her, failed to do so."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that same year, Phasma carried her blaster aboard the Supremacy, the flagship of Supreme Leader Snoke.

For Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, the blaster was redesigned and featured a slight color change, making it more in line with the chrome of Phasma's armor. According to Matthew Savage, the blaster seen in The Force Awakens was more gold than the one of The Last Jedi, though he isn't sure if director Rian Johnson requested the blaster to be more chrome."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
