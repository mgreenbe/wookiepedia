When the Sith Lord Darth Vader undertook a search for the carbonite-frozen body of the smuggler Han Solo, which had been lost by the bounty hunter Boba Fett before he could deliver it to Jabba the Hutt, Vader and the Sith assassin Ochi of Bestoon visited Bokku. Under Vader's command, Ochi ordered that Bokku recover Solo, promising the Hutt an increase of power. Bokku was dubious about the plan and questioned Ochi's legitimacy, leading the Sith Lord to reveal his presence as Ochi insisted that Bokku would serve Vader.\nBecause Bokku didn't want to serve Vader, the Sith Lord slaughtered many of the Hutt's guards, eventually leading Bokku to the decision to help him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
