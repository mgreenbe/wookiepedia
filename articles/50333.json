The Fourth Division attempted to group at Rendezvous Point Delta-Three, but were tracked by the Galactic Empire when they attempted to contact the Eighth Division, and were blockaded against a star, preventing their escape and resulting in the loss of one ship, the Tyvarex, to heavy fire. The Millennium Falcon arrived at the rendezvous point and managed to break the blockade enough for the surviving ships of the Fourth Division to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Fourth Division was composed of at least three EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigates, including the Redemption and the Tyvarex, at least four CR90 corvettes, at least two GR-75 medium transports and multiple X-wing, Y-wing and A-wing starfighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
