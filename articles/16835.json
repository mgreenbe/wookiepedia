Fortuna was successful in claiming the job, while Kwerve ended up as an early victim of the crime lord's pet rancor Pateesa in Jabba's Palace on the planet Tatooine. Kwerve's skull remained in the rancor's pit below the palace, until the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker was dropped into the pit for execution. The Jedi picked up the skull and threw it across the pit as the rancor attempted to eat him. The button caused the door to the pit to lower onto Pateesa's neck and killed the creature, inadvertently avenging Kwerve."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bidlo Kwerve's skull first appeared in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi in 1983.
