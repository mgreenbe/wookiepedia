After storming an entrance and killing most of the clones that were present, this OOM command battle droid was assigned to eliminate the rest of the clones while Ventress would go take on the Jedi Anakin Skywalker. He was then ordered to seal the main gate and all portals, so nothing could escape the monastery. However, after affirming the command, he was shot in the head by Clone Captain Rex, who survived the attack, after which Ventress snatched the blaster from Rex and captured him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
