During an attempt to rescue Darth Wredd's Nalydian henchman Dieben, the Imperial Knight Jao Assam commandeered a floating jellyfish and grabbed it by its tendrils. Later, his friend Ania Solo and Dieben clung on to the creature. However, their weight caused the tentacle to break off and threw everyone down into a swamp below. While Jao and Ania survived the fall, Dieben was impaled by a sharp, thorny plant, leading to injuries which resulted in his death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
