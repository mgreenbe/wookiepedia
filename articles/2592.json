Because of the compactness of the armor, the AV-1S was not only far lighter than most powersuits, but far more maneuverable even when unpowered - while still offering impressive armor coverage and moderate resistance to kinetic and energy based attacks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like most powersuits, the AV-1s was equipped with small, yet powerful servomotors capable of greatly enhancing the wearer's strength, though like most GTU power armors, was additionally equipped with a repulsorlift engine for flight, a power lamp capable of producing a cone of light up to 100m, as well as a full life support system. These systems were powered by three standard standard power cells contained in an armored housing on the suits back - the the entirety of the suit capable of operating for thirty six standard hours continuously."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The helmet itself contained multiple systems for reconnaissance duty, including a long range thermal imaging module allowing for heat based gradation up to 200m away, a low light imaging module that amplified ambient light for night vision, a detailed environmental scanner, a bio-readout/med sensor appraising the wearer of their condition, integrated macrobinoculars, and lastly, a multi-channel comm unit with a 50 kilometer range, consisting of a built in encoder, and an external amplifier."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
