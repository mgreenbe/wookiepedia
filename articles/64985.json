However, the SoroSuub office was raided by members of the Fireclaw Horde, a Togorian criminal gang that sought to develop modified versions of the MMR-9 to use to hijack starships. Suum was taking an unauthorized lunch break when the Togorians launched their attack and when he returned to the office, he witnessed their raid and fled before the Togorians could capture him.
