On the lava rivers of  the volcanic planet Nevarro, ferry droids provided safe passage for travelers. One ferry droid rowed a boat that was used by the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin, the former shock trooper Cara Dune, the Bounty Hunters' Guild operative Greef Karga, and the former assassin droid IG-11 to escape the pursuit of the forces of Moff Gideon's Imperial remnant with the infant known as Grogu. When the ferry droid refused to stop rowing the boat as it approached the exit of the lava river, where Gideon's stormtroopers were waiting, Dune shot the droid, but was unable to prevent the boat's motion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
