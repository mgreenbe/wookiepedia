It was developed by local Gungan and Quarren engineers looking for a means to move through either surface and the lower levels of The Ring district."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A gondola skimmersub was similar to a bongo, with a fish-like central fin, a central sail that collapsed when diving, hydrojets to maneuver underwater and smaller repulsorsails both in port and starboard sides. It had transparisteel windows and could reach a maximum depth of 500 meters. Unlike the bongo, the gondola skimmersub could not use the locab plasma of Naboo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As of 29 BBY, most families in Bartyn's Landing owned one of these."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This vehicle might have some relation with the subskimmers available for rent at Ackrahbala's Swoops & Speeders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
