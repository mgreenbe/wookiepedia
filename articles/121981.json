ORO provided Bartyn with a land for his personal use, and he built Bartyn's Landing, a coastal city, there. Bartyn secretly intended to create a community of fishermen and profit with the business of seafood, without giving a part of his incomes to ORO. At the same time, he continued managing the mine and giving ORO a good profit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having succeede in creating a thriving seafood company, Bartyn Gourmet Delicacies, Bartyn skimmed ORO from several assets including key planetary locations. He also seized the budget of Security and Law Enforcement, a division from ORO, and manipulated it so that ORO would pay the salary of the Security Chief of Bartyn's Landing. The Chief could name official Security Chief's Seconds, and ORO would also pay them. Although the responsabilities of the Chief were to the city, the Chief answered to the Administrator of the mine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When ORO discovered that Bartyn had been creating his own fief in Lamaredd, it was too late to revoke most of his changes.
