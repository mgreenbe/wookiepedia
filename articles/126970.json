In the year 3643 BBY, Ren was stationed on the planet Alderaan where the Alderaan Civil War was being fought amongst the planet's many noble houses. Whilst in the Apalis Coast region of the planet, he encountered a noble from the Great House of Organa\u2014a house allied with the Republic and the Jedi\u2014at the Republic base named Wardpost Duvaal. The noble was in the process of being joined to the Killik species due to long-term exposure to their pheromones, a process which would make him a drone who served them at the expense of his own feelings and memories. Ren attempted to help the noble fight off the joining process by purging his mind, but could not manage it alone against the many voices of the Killiks that were affecting the noble's mind."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Whilst Ren was trying to help the noble, he was approached by a Republic-aligned individual whom the Jedi asked to help him. He requested that the individual attack nearby Killiks and Killik egg clusters in an attempt to distract the species hive mind from the noble. It was Ren's hope that with the Killiks distracted, he could more successfully help the noble fight off being joined to the Killiks. The individual agreed and attacked Killik egg clusters and forces located near Wardpost Duvaal in the ruins of the Mensaav Laboratory. As they did so, the noble managed to successfully fight off becoming a joiner with Ren's help and began recovering slowly.
