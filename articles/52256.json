A male Miraluka, Galen put aside his lightsaber after the Great Galactic War and settled on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine, where he believed he could make a better difference by helping settlers. He quickly became a leader amongst the settlers, but remained aware of many of the events on the planet and the galaxy as a whole. When a Republic-allied individual arrived on the planet, Besk asked the individual for help in solving many of the settlers' problems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A male Miraluka, Galen Besk was originally a member of the Jedi Order who served during the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. After the Treaty of Coruscant ended the fighting, Besk decided that he could make a bigger difference on a smaller scale, and he left the Order. Besk made his home on the Outer Rim planet of Tatooine, where he lived in the city of Anchorhead. His training allowed him to quickly assume a leadership role among his fellow settlers. Through a combination of his power in the Force and his position, Besk was able to remain aware of major events on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the year 3643 BBY, an operative of the Republic arrived on the planet. Besk was aware of the agent's exploits on the planet, and when a sandstorm hit Anchorhead as the operative was leaving, Besk asked for the individual's assistance in getting people inside the spaceport and out of the storm. After the sandstorm, Besk revealed his knowledge of the individual's travels and asked the operative to stay and help a little longer, in order to help unify the settlements."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Besk had learned of the Empire's plans to destroy the trading post of Espelar, a nearby settlement. He believed that if the individual helped solve the problems afflicting many of the Republic settlements on the planet, the citizens would be able to better stand up against the native Sand People, pirates, warlords, and even the Empire. The sandstorm had disabled the trading post's defenses, prompting the Empire to send in a team of saboteurs to eliminate it. Besk asked the individual to stop the saboteurs, using the agent's feelings of responsibility to gain the individual's help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The individual succeeded in defeating the saboteurs, and traveled to Espelar itself to speak with Mayor Airen. There, the individual went on to help a number of settlers across the Jundland Wastes, a region to the south of Anchorhead which lay between the city and the Imperial-controlled town of Mos Ila. The hero helped train Espelar's militia, and took the recruit Vastil and his men to rescue a group of militiamen from Manister Base, a nearby militia base. The base had been overrun by a Geonosian hive, which had seized control of the base's supplies and weapons. The individual held off the Geonosians while the militia fled to Outpost Largona to the south. The hero also helped recover stolen water from the Twin Suns pirates for Dester and several other Largona settlers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the operative returned to Besk, he thanked the hero and urged the individual to continue on the journey, warning the individual that enemies were still working against the Republic. When asked how he knew so much, Besk revealed that he was a former Jedi and thanked the operative again for the help."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A dark-skinned Miraluka male with black hair, Galen Besk lacked eyes, as was normal for his species. As was also common among Miraluka, Besk made up for that physical weakness by perceiving the environment around him through Force sight. Like many of his species, he was strong enough in the Force to become a member of the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the bloodshed of the Great Galactic War, Besk believed that he could make a bigger difference on a smaller scale and left the Jedi Order to settle on Tatooine. Besk assumed a leadership role there, working to help the settlers survive in the harsh environment. While Besk appeared to be gruff, abrupt, and even mysterious at times, he was a true Jedi at heart. He deeply cared for those he protected, even after he left the Order, and he would do everything in his power to protect them. He convinced the Republic-allied individual to help out by playing on their responsibilities, knowing that the individual would help out because of the threat of the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Galen Besk first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic, the massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. He gives Republic players the Tatooine Bonus Series of missions, using his knowledge of the player's Tatooine class storyline to convince them to help. The events he discusses will vary depending upon the character's class. Upon completion of the Bonus Series, Galen Besk can reveal that he was a former Jedi if asked. The quests of the Bonus Series each have their own light and dark side options, but the overall interactions with Besk remain the same. As Besk is part of the Republic Bonus Series, and therefore is only accessible by Republic players, this article assumes that only the light side options are taken by Republic individuals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
