Kodo offered credits but the leader of the gang, a Duros, still expressed a desire to cause harm to the two Omwati as a message to Kodo from Xizor for he and his wife to keep silent. Ekria, Zonder and Drake Lo'gaan came to their rescue, however not before the Duros was able to hit Kodo once. The punch resulted in fourth-stage burns in the shape of the Black Sun symbol. Kodo was branded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
