After leaving his homeworld with his older brother Thok, Gorc traveled the galaxy, serving first as a test subject for a scientist named Pineas Pontak, and later as an enforcer for the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure on the planet Tatooine. However, when the brothers found themselves in trouble after a cantina fight, Gorc was sold out to the Galactic Empire by Thok. The Gamorrean was subsequently mutated into Sithspawn by Galactic Emperor Palpatine's \"monster-maker\" Cronal. As a result of his mutation, Gorc shared genes, abilities, and characteristics and had a symbiotic link through the Force with his fellow test subject, the Kowakian monkey-lizard Picaroon C. Boodle. Because of that connection, Gorc and Pic were eventually dubbed \"the Brothers of the Sith.\" The \"twins\" were pressed into service of the Miraluka Inquisitor Jerec and, as part of his Dark Jedi team, helped him in the search for the long-lost Valley of the Jedi, the source of great power which Jerec hoped to use for his own needs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 5 ABY, Jerec sent Gorc and Pic to deactivate the droid information broker 8t88\u2014a mission which the brothers easily completed aboard Jerec's personal cargo ship, the Sulon Star.

A member of the Skunnt clan, Gorc and his older brother Thok both shared a rather uncommon trait among their species\u2014they were Force-sensitive. The two were initially oblivious to their powers, but Thok, generally regarded as the smarter of the two, eventually realized their true potential when he accidentally belched out a ball of fire into the snout of his rival Scumbo. Believing that they would be able to put their powers to good use and make fortune, Thok acquired a universal transliterator and took Gorc offworld. Gorc and his sibling first found work as guinea pigs for a scientist named Doctor Pineas Pontak on the planet Zlarbv IV. As part of his development of the Pontak Hypergland, Pontak performed painful experiments on the pair, infusing their bodies with alien secretions, which had an unexpected side-effect of making Gorc's and Thok's muscles swell when they were enraged. Fed up with the Doctor's methods, the brothers eventually left him and moved to the desert planet of Tatooine. There, Gorc and his brother met a fellow Gamorrean named Ortugg, who recruited them to serve as bodyguards for a notorious local crime lord, the Hutt Jabba Desilijic Tiure. The two spent some time in Jabba's employ until one night in Mos Eisley's Red Moon Saloon. During an incident that erupted there\u2014which involved Thok, Gorc, seven barrels of Zelosian wine, and a Kloo horn\u2014three Gungans were bludgeoned to death and five Ugnaughts ended up being fricasseed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gorc and Thok were captured and ended up in the custody of a local Imperial darksider named Sariss, who was better known as the \"Prophetess\". Gorc's older brother betrayed him in an effort to save his own life and told Sariss about Gorc's Force-sensitivity. However, this only piqued the Prophetess' interest and she took Gorc away. Gorc ended up in Imperial scientist Tuzin Gast's Project Chubar, a research effort intending to provide super-intelligent, loyal, and Force-sensitive non-Humans to serve the Empire as spies. However, Gorc and the Kowakian monkey-lizard Picaroon C. Boodle were soon taken by Lord Cronal, who needed two Force-sensitive \"animal\" subjects for his latest experiment.

The twins became members of Jerec's cadre of Dark Jedi, which, besides Sariss and Jerec himself, also included the young Epicanthix Yun, the former Jedi Maw, and the Twi'lek Boc Aseca. Jerec was amused with Gorc and Pic and found them \"quite an interesting pair\". Gorc then constructed for himself a lightclub variant of the lightsaber which resembled the traditional Gamorrean thogk club, as well as a set of M'uhk'gfa armor for Pic."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Search for the Valley of the Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The \"Brothers of the Sith\" assisted Jerec in his search for the long-lost Valley of the Jedi, a Force nexus containing numerous Jedi and Sith souls. Jerec, who hoped to harness the valley's power in order to rebuild the collapsing Galactic Empire, eventually discovered that the Jedi Master Qu Rahn might have some clues as to its location. In 5 ABY, Jerec finally tracked Rahn to the planet Dorlo, where the Jedi Master was on a mission alongside several members of the Rebel Alliance. Jerec sent Maw, Sariss, and Yun to capture Rahn, but the Jedi Master escaped on a CR90 corvette.

Before Rahn woke up, Pic stole his lightsaber, which\u2014unbeknownst to the monkey-lizard\u2014had once belonged to Jedi Grand Master Yoda. Rahn and his Rebel companions were then escorted to the Vengeance's bridge, where Jerec started questioning them about the valley. One of the Rebels, the Klatooinian technologist Rolanda Gron defied Jerec, and the Miraluka ordered Gorc and Pic to kill him.

After the droid completed his objective, Jerec told him to go to Jerec's personal cargo ship, the Sulon Star, to receive his reward. In reality, Jerec sent Gorc and Pic to dispatch the droid, and the twins were also ordered to kill Kyle Katarn, the son of Morgan Katarn and an aspiring Jedi, who was trying to stop Jerec. 8t88 soon arrived to the Sulon Star on a shuttle and met Pic and Gorc in a dark corridor, asking for his pay.

As Katarn moved toward the droid, its head fell off its shoulders, landing on the floor, where 8t88's pet Hornagaunt lunged forward and digested it. Gorc then emerged from the shadows and attempted to crudely attack Katarn with his large weapon. However, Gorc overestimated the ease with which he would be able to defeat his foe and showed his lack of intelligence by standing in the way of Katarn's Bryar pistol. Katarn shot Gorc in the face, destroying the Gamorrean's brain and killing him instantly. Gorc's death drove Pic insane, and he attacked Katarn with his Sith dagger, but was killed shortly thereafter when Katarn threw 8t88's heavy head at him, crushing Pic's skull."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Katarn ultimately managed to kill Jerec and free the spirits of the Jedi trapped in the valley.

A blue-eyed Gamorrean, Gorc was very heavy and slow, being over three meters in height and weighing 200 kilograms. In contrast to his size, Gorc was somewhat dim-witted, even more-so than his older brother, a trait he displayed by standing in the way of Katarn's blaster. Gorc preferred not to engage in conversation, which he usually left to Pic. He was the less aggressive of the pair, but that did not make him any less dangerous, as he was not afraid to slaughter his enemies. Over the years, Gorc and Pic's closeness became more than just a dark side connection\u2014it could almost be described as friendship. Pic, who considered himself the \"older\" brother, deeply cared about his slower sibling and protected him from abuse.

Trained by Jerec and Sariss in the ways of the dark side, Gorc and Pic\u2014despite their nearly comical appearance\u2014were a deadly pair. Pic was quick, agile, and intelligent and Gorc was extremely powerful. Gorc rarely moved or spoke, though when Pic stirred him up, the duo worked together as a team, covering all angles as well as each other's weaknesses. Gorc had a long and thick orange-bladed lightclub and used it to deliver slow yet powerful strikes at his enemies, whom he preferred to immobilize with Force Grip first. When hit, Gorc was able to use the Force to heal himself. Gorc could also hide his presence within the dark side, thus avoiding being detected by other Force-sensitives. He displayed this ability on the Sulon Star while hiding from Katarn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bond between Pic and Gorc allowed them to be aware of each other's location, sense, and feelings at any given time. It also boosted their powers when the twins were near each other.

Apart from his usage of the lightclub, Gorc was also proficient with a wide variety of other weapons, including blaster pistols, blaster rifles, vibroweapons, and even some primitive and simple weapons.

Gorc's silent nature is preserved in the novel, where he only grunts. In the audio drama, however, Gorc has several lines and is voiced by Gary Groomes. Additionally, Gorc was briefly mentioned in the second part of the game's adaptation, the Dark Forces: Jedi Knight novel and audio drama.
