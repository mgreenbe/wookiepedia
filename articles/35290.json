In 43.5 ABY, the Lost Tribe of Sith sent a team of Sith to retrieve Sith apprentice Vestara Khai from Dathomir, as well as a group of Nightsisters, whom they intended to convert into Sith. They arrived in the landing meadow, where they captured the Nightsisters. The team then took the Nightsisters to the main fleet in orbit, while the team's leader, Viun Gaalan, stayed behind with three Sith Sabers to await Khai, who was retrieving one last Nightsister. However, Luke Skywalker, his son, Ben Skywalker, and the Force-sensitive Dyon Stadd arrived and attacked the Sith, defeating them in a duel and forcing Gaalan to flee as Khai arrived on the scene. The Jedi then took Khai captive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
