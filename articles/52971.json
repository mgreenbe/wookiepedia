It was equipped with two powerful turbolasers, four anti-infantry laser cannons, and 2 shield generators. The Gargantuan could overload its shields, resulting in a blast which created a large energy shockwave 360 degrees around the battle platform; the power of the blast was directly proportional to the shield power at the time of overload. It was also vulnerable to concentrated fire, although it had backup systems to ensure the survival of at least part of the crew."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
