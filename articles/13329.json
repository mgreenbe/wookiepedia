When the Smugglers' Alliance arrived, they were forced into the battle. However, the tide quickly turned against the Yuuzhan Vong; Lah, after discovering the nature of the trap, was forced to order his fleets to withdraw back to Yuuzhan Vong Space. However, the Yun-Harla group and the Yun-Txiin battle group were pulled out of hyperspace and severely damaged by the mines that the New Republic had laid out to further hamper any retreat. Both groups suffered extreme casualties both in terms of warships and personnel as a result of the battle and subsequent evacuation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
