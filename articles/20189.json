The senator spoke to the newly declared head of the Empire, Emperor Palpatine, via hologram in 19 BBY, one month after the declaration of the New Order, while the latter was on the Imperial capital planet of Coruscant. During the exchange, Braxis sought aid for the planet he represented, which Palpatine had previously promised him, though the Emperor denied the aid on the grounds that he could not intervene in local politics.
