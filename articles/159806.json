Calrissian then confronted Vedain for the control of the skiff while Skywalker fought against Jabba's other guards and slaves and freed Chewbacca and Solo. In order to annihilate the rebels, another Nikto guard fired a laser projectile from Jabba's sail barge, which struck Vedain's skiff, causing him and Calrissian to fall out of the vehicle. Both fighters were able to hold from a rope tied to the skiff's rail, but Vedain did not have the same fate as Calrissian. Because of the fall, Vedain could not hold Calrissian and fell rolling towards the sand of the pit, falling inside the mouth of the Sarlacc, to be slowly digested over thousands of years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vedain was played uncredited by stuntman Paul Weston in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, the final installment of the Star Wars original trilogy.
