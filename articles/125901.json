Eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master, Siolo Ur Manka was a renowned warrior on his home planet, garnering much respect and prestige among his people. After years of service, Master Manka departed the Coruscant Temple for the final time, retiring from active duty to the Order and making his way to the Jentares system where he would remain in solitude for over seventy years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Only at his hermitage, Master Manka remained separate from the galaxy, meditating on the Force. Having left his lightsaber at the Temple, Master Manka constructed a simple wooden staff, which he imbued with the Force making it strong and sturdy against attack. Sometime before 32 BBY, Master Manka's solitude was broken when a Dathomirian Zabrak Sith apprentice arrived on his doorstep. The dark warrior wielded a crimson-bladed lightsaber when he attacked the Jedi Master, but his weapon was easily batted away by Master Manka's staff. To combat this, the Zabrak retreated and constructed a double-bladed lightsaber in order to surprise the Jedi. Returning to the hermitage, the Sith assassin attacked as he had the previous time, activating the second blade only when he was inside striking distance of the Master. The Sith's plan worked, and Master Manka was killed with a strike to the back."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Manka was skilled with a wooden staff of his own construction, able to easily defeat Darth Maul during their first duel. During both of the duels, he either dodged Maul's blows or filled his staff with the Force, imbuing it with the Force, allowing him to parry the blows without the staff being severed. His given name, Siolo, meant 'poet' in Twi'leki."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
