There, she served as a police officer with the Coruscant Security Force under the Republic government. Around 3643 BBY, Anstiss was assigned the task of arresting a Houk criminal named Gambo. However, Anstiss believed that she had an enemy at CSF Headquarters as Gambo was known to be a brutal Black Sun enforcer and murderer, and Anstiss was to arrest him by herself. She made several attempts to arrest Gambo inside the Dealer's Den cantina in the Old Galactic Market sector but was unable to subdue Gambo. On her final attempt Gambo beat her severely, nearly killing her. With that, Anstiss retreated to outside the cantina and called for backup."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was at that time that a Republic individual offered assistance to Anstiss, who was wounded outside of the Dealer's Den cantina.

The mission can be completed by a Republic character who meets Anstiss outside of the club where Gambo is located. The character can then go inside and confront Gambo. Depending on the character class, several options give the character the choice to either convince Gambo to turn himself in, to arrest Gambo, or to kill him. By killing Gambo, the player receives dark side points, though the mission itself is only available to light side characters.
