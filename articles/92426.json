Ships that were equipped with military-grade shields and starfighter wings. They became the primary defense force for the colonial empire which spanned hundreds of systems. It continued to operate till the subjugation of the homeworld Dac by the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After they liberated their homeworld Dac from the Imperials, the Mon Cal forces mined and disrupted the existing routes to the Mon Calamari sector, and scouted new routes into the sector. Making any attempt to conquer their sector an extremely difficult endeavor, one that would require a brutal struggle. It made the Empire hesitant to engage in such  a campaign, fearing that if they did not achieve a speedy victory it would embolden other systems to rebel. A fear that was wisely exploited by the Calamarian Council by declaring itself neutral. The Mon Calamari at first refused to formally join the Rebel Alliance out of fear of the isolationist Quarren reaction to another treaty with a Human-dominated group."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When it came to the battlefield though, captains of Mon Cala warships entered Alliance service and Rebel warships in turn were deployed to protect the Mon Calamari secctor. The legendary Mon Calamari admiral, Ackbar, served in the Alliance High Command as an unofficial member. Though Imperial forces harried the fringes of the Calamari Sector they declined to force a showdown, wary of committing too many of their forces to a remote part of the galaxy. In the aftermath of the Battle of Yavin, the Mon Calamari Council agreed to officially join the Rebellion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Mon Calamari threw off the Imperial yoke, they invited Ackbar to return home and lead their rebuilt fleet. Ackbar was able to convince his people to give the rebellion its star cruisers, even though by doing so the Mon Calamari were sacrificing the immense protection that the star cruisers provided to their homeworld. The Mon Calamari donated their entire naval strength to the Rebel Alliance, therefore becoming the backbone of the rebuilt Rebel fleet, and nearly four years later, Admiral Ackbar led Mon Calamari's finest warships and the rest of the Rebel fleet to victory at the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
