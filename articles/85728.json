He lived in a large castle with his feisty daughter Gerin and his idealist son Coby. Toda was the leader of a large company of able-bodied Tammuz-an warriors and frequently found himself in conflict with the planet's ruling heir, King Mon Julpa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several years prior to the Battle of Yavin, Mon Julpa wanted to declare a cease of hostilities between his kingdom and the lands governed by Lord Toda. He traveled to Toda's castle and offered him a charter of peace. Toda was dubious of the new king's offer and suspected that he was conspiring upon a plan to unseat him. It was actually his daughter, Gerin, who convinced her father to entertain the prospect of a treaty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the peace accords could be settled however, the pirate Gir Kybo Ren-Cha escaped from prison and kidnapped Gerin. As Kybo was formerly a custodian of Mon Julpa's dungeons, Toda blamed Julpa for Kybo's escape, and the subsequent abduction of his daughter. Kybo stole an R-22 Spearhead starfighter and took Gerin to the swamp world of Bogden. Toda had Mon Julpa arrested."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Captain Kybo sent a message from Bogden declaring that Gerin would be returned to Tammuz-an pending the release of his imprisoned crew mates. Mon Julpa pleaded with Toda to allow him to assist in freeing Gerin from Kybo. He warned Lord Toda that Kybo was not to be trusted, and that he would likely refuse to hand Gerin over to them. Reluctantly, Toda agreed to work with Mon Julpa on a secret plan to rescue her. They modified Kybo's impounded attack ship, the Dianoga, with a secret cargo basin that could adequately hide a squad of Toda's most capable warriors. They released Kybo's first mate, Jyn Obah (as well as the rest of the crew) and allowed them to leave Tammuz-an. Little did the pirates know however, that Toda and his warriors were hiding inside the ship. When they arrived on Bogden, Toda and Mon Julpa fought together to free Gerin. They defeated Captain Kybo and his crew, and safely returned Gerin to Tammuz-an."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In recognition of Julpa's invaluable aid in helping to rescue his daughter, Lord Toda agreed to sign the charter of peace, uniting their respective kingdoms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lord Toda was not a man of great humor. His face was perpetually contorted into a grim frown and he spoke in clipped, measured tones. One of the few occasions when he was known to laugh, occurred in the presence of the protocol droid, C-3PO. A small animal named Ingey scurried about 3PO's shoulders causing the clumsy droid to stumble into a sideboard of food. Toda took great delight in the droid's apparent embarrassment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lord Toda did not place his trust in anyone lightly. He was irrationally suspicious of Mon Julpa and feared that the new king would try to usurp his power base from him. This may have been because Mon Julpa commanded a fleet of R-22 Spearhead fighters, whereas Toda did not have any starfighters of his own."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lord Toda was the epitome of an august warrior. He had dark, piercing eyes, a broad nose, and receding brown hair with sideburns. His countenance was one of a man always ready to do battle. Lord Toda may have in fact hailed from a different race of Tammuz-anian than his contemporary, Mon Julpa. Toda and his family all possessed a deep blue skin color as opposed to the more flamboyant, purple hue of Mon Julpa's entourage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This character was voiced by Graeme Campbell in the animated series Star Wars Droids"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
