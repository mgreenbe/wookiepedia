Imperial Governor Mag\u00e9 kept a bottle in her office in the Imperial headquarters of the planet Allst Prime. When the Alliance to Restore the Republic's 61st Mobile Infantry attacked the planet's Imperial outpost, the unit's leader Micha Evon found the whiskey after the governor had been stunned by the Rebel soldier Brand. Evon poured a glass of whiskey for himself and Brand, but found his subordinate aiming a blaster at him, as she intended to claim the bounty on his head. Leaving Brand's whiskey on the governor's table, Evon drank and enjoyed his own glass while recounting what he knew of Brand's life. He then persuaded her to remain with the Rebels instead of claiming the bounty, and once convinced Brand took her whiskey and downed it in one gulp. Evon then poured each of them a new glass and raised his in toast to her joining the Alliance properly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nabooian whiskey first appeared in the short story \"Inbrief\", which was written by Janine K.
