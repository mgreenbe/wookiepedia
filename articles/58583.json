Circa 31 BBY, the rogue protocol droid LN-73 fell to the surface of Uffel during a debris storm and set about sabotaging droid production facilities in the city X2-4.

HG-211 served as the head of security for a community of droids that operated a series of droid production facilities on the moon, and he maintained an office in the city X2-4. In about 31 BBY, a debris storm over Uffel caused the ancient protocol droid LN-73 to fall to the surface of the moon. The droid had first been dispatched to Uffel about half a century earlier by the investor Hesk Beldross to take over the moon's droid production facilities, and it initiated its plans to to subjugate Uffel by sabotaging the moon's manufacturing lines, including a line producing MSF-series droids, a variant of the MSE-series mouse droid. Following the sabotage, HG-211 ordered that all droids working on the MSF production line be fitted with restraining bolts, to prevent them from affecting other droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after LN-73's reactivation, the droids of Uffel ordered a halt in their production schedule to allow groups of tourists to visit the moon. The protocol droid LV-15 was appointed to escort one such group of visitors that included the Heroes of Cularin, a team of renowned freelance agents who operated in the system. As LV-15 led the tourists into X2-4, HG-211 dismissed the protocol droid and took over the escort of the tourist group. He led the agents to the office and played them a hologram of Gor Kolomo, a deceased Twi'lek under whose name the droids of Uffel conducted their business affairs, and the hologram hired the agents to investigate the recent acts of sabotage. HG-211 provided the agents with comlinks and translator units to assist with their investigations, and he introduced them to the IT-series droid IT-R9, which was to follow the agents around on behalf of the droids of the Uffel Research and Development facility, who sought to study the behavior of organic beings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the agents had investigated X2-4's production lines and droid development facilities for evidence of the identity of the saboteur, HG-211 contacted the agents via comlink and summoned them back to his office to explain their findings to him. However, LN-73 had learned of HG-211's investigation, and, while the security droid was interviewing the agents, the rogue mechanical initiated a power cell overload that caused a surge at HG-211's computer terminal and incapacitated the security droid. The Heroes of Cularin proceeded to locate and defeat LN-73, and HG-211 was taken away to be fixed. Two hours later, the repairs on the security droid were complete, and HG-211 thanked the agents for their services. He paid them a sum of credits and bequeathed to them the droid MSF-111, an MSF-series unit that had developed a fondness for the agents during the course of their investigation."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Thaereian incursion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 20 BBY, during the era of the Clone Wars, the Thaereian military\u2014a force from the Thaereian system that was charged by the Republic with the defense of the Cularin system\u2014became engaged in an armed conflict with the rival Cularin Militia. In an attempt to subvert the droids of Uffel to their cause, Thaereian forces landed on the moon to try to seize control of the droid production facilities. HG-211 led a security team that endeavored to repulse the invaders, but, to counter his attack, the Thaereians deployed ion guns, a type of handheld weapon that could disable the electrical systems of droids. As a result, HG-211 was unable to defeat the Thaereians, and the soldiers occupied a military droid production line in X2-4."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Thaereian incursion led to the activation of hidden protocols within the programming of about half of the droids on Uffel, which caused them to become hostile to all organic beings. A number of the rogue droids barricaded themselves inside the X2-4 Research and Development facility, and HG-211, who was not programed with the anti-organic protocols, had some of his technicians examine one of the insurrectionist droids. HG-211 soon became the leader of a loyalist droid faction that, while opposed to the Thaereian encroachment, had nothing against organic beings in general, and he established a headquarters for himself inside a security post in X2-4. He began searching for ways to reverse the protocols and to repel the forces of the Thaereians from Uffel, and he feared that if news of the anti-organic programming reached the wider galaxy, it would cause a public relations crisis for the Uffel droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Cularin Militia received word of the Thaereian invasion and sent the Heroes of Cularin to restore order to Uffel, and the agents arrived on the moon a week after the initial Thaereian attack. Word of the agents' presence reached HG-211, and he sent the loyalist protocol droid OO-7JB to direct them to his headquarters. The security droid appealed to the agents to help repulse the Thaereians and to remove the hostile droid protocols, and the agents agreed to assist him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Thaereian military learned of the anti-organic protocols within the programming of the Uffel droids, and they attempted to transmit a signal that would activate the protocols within all Uffel-built droids across the entire Cularin system. However, the Heroes of Cularin prevented the transmission from being sent and they defeated the Thaereian forces on the moon. To commend their efforts, HG-211 relayed a note of thanks to the Cularin Militia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "HG-211 was a tall, lanky, military droid who was similar in appearance to an early IG-series droid. He had a gunmetal gray-colored torso that was crisscrossed with thick, black stripes. A thin, red wire crossed one of the stripes and denoted a self-destruct mechanism that was contained within the droid. Only HG-211 had knowledge of how to activate the system, and he was prepared to destroy himself if doing so aided the defense of the Uffel droid colony. In addition, HG-211 was armed with two mounted blaster pistols, and he was fitted with a sensor package, a motion detector, and infrared vision."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his role as a military droid, HG-211 was programed with a diplomacy mode that, when activated, caused him to behave in a perfunctory manner. He was not particularly fond of organic beings and believed that droids were superior to them in a number of respects, yet he wished organics no ill. After the production facilities on Uffel were sabotaged, HG-211 found it difficult to believe that a droid could be responsible, and, when LN-73 was found to be behind the damage, HG-211 felt grumpy and slightly humiliated, because his assertions had been proved incorrect. He played a direct role in the running of Uffel's droid manufacturing facilities, and, following the Thaereian invasion, he became concerned that the anti-organic protocols displayed by some of the Uffel droids would generate a public relations crisis for the droid community, because the protocols threatened to undermine confidence in the reliability of Uffel-built droids. The droid administrator N-4PO thought HG-211 to be brutish and believed that the security droid had no sense of what was in the best interests of the droids of Uffel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "HG-211 was first mentioned in the Living Force Campaign Guide in 2001, a sourcebook written by Robert Wiese and Andy Collins that set the scene for the Living Force roleplaying campaign. HG-211 went on to appear in the roleplaying adventure Something Uffel, by Morrie Mullins, in the first year of the campaign, and he made a further appearance in the adventure Uffel's Prisoners, by Rob Edwards, in 2004. The security droid later received an entry in the 2008 compendium The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The players of the Living Force campaign roleplay as the Heroes of Cularin, and, during Something Uffel and Uffel's Prisoners, the decisions made by the players can affect the actions of HG-211. In Something Uffel, if the player-characters choose to modify or reprogram any of the droids in X2-4, or to fire upon any of the city's MSF droids, HG-211 arrives at the scene with a team of warrior droids to stop them. During the player-characters' subsequent investigation into the acts of sabotage caused by LN-73, it is possible for the players to discover that a worm in the computer systems of X2-4 is feeding information to a satellite in orbit of Uffel. If they inform HG-211 of such a discovery, the security droid immediately makes his way to the fire controls for X2-4's military defense systems, and he blasts the satellite from orbit. Another possibility allows players to choose to attempt to connect datapads or other devices to the droids under production in X2-4; if they do so, the droids with which they have tampered shut down. If three or more droids are deactivated in such a manner, HG-211 arrives and berates the agents for not being attentive to their assignment. However, the agents can then negotiate with HG-211 for permission to continue connecting to the droids, and to try to convince him that gathering data in such a way is beneficial to the player-characters' investigations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the player-characters used in Uffel's Prisoners have previously participated in the events of Something Uffel, HG-211 is pleased to see such characters again and engages in his diplomacy mode. Depending on the player-characters' skills and expertise, in Uffel's Prisoners HG-211 can task the agents with resolving the droid schism or with using their combat abilities to drive out the Thaereians, or he can request that they attempt both tasks. If the players fail to prevent the Thaereians from activating the anti-organic protocols within droids across the Cularin system, there are various droid revolts through the system, and the Cularin Militia intelligence chief Major Xirossk travels to Uffel to enlist HG-211's help with countering the rogue droids. HG-211 assures Xirossk that the loyalist droids can resolve the problem but warns that it will take several weeks for the renegade droids to be pacified."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
