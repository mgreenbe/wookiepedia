Endocott raced against Sebulba during the Boonta Eve Classic of 32 BBY, finishing in fourth place.

Endocott was a Triffian male from the Mid Rim planet Triffis who worked as a deliveryman who employed unorthodox daredevil tactics to make his deliveries, an activity that eventually left him with a large scar across his stomach after a swoop accident. The thrill-seeker soon found a more suitable output for his piloting skills in the form of landspeeder racing, which was popular on Boonta. However, looking to score higher victory purses, the Triffian's personal clerk recommended that Endocott take up Podracing instead, which Endocott agreed to."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Podracing was a popular sport at the time where a cockpit was pulled along by two engines at high-speeds through hazardous courses. Purchasing a blue JAK Racing J930 Dash-8 racer, known for its excellent traction, Endocott's early career was focused on the Semipro Podracing Circuit, where he won three championships on the planet Malastare and become the track favorite on one of Malastare's drag courses. He even dominated Malastare's difficult Dug Derby racecourse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "High on his victories, the cocky Triffian purchased a brand new Corellian freighter in order to transport his Dash-8 from race to race.

The Triffian believed that the Dug's winning days were over, and thought that he could unseat Sebulba as Malastare's media favorite. Endocott eventually followed Sebulba to Tatooine, where pilots were gathering for the next iteration of the famed Boonta Eve Classic. Upon the arrival of the Boonta race, Endocott's Podracer was placed on the outside pole position of the third row, next to the Xexto Podracer Gasgano and behind the Vulptereen Dud Bolt, who unbeknownst to Endocott was working as Sebulba's secret on-track bodyguard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jabba the Hutt, the race's host, officially started the race off, and pilots roared off into the desert, with the exception of two\u2014the Human Anakin Skywalker and the Toong Ben Quadinaros.

Endocott however began to fall far behind, ending up behind the the main pack. At the start of the second lap, he had been passed up by Anakin Skywalker, and the two pilots roared across the grid together into the second lap.

Ebe Endocott continued his career throughout 22 BBY, racing against many of his old foes including Gasgano, Ark Roose, and Elan Mak. Sebulba, whom Endocott had once shared a one-sided rivalry with, was no longer racing, however, having instead retired. Sebulba still operated a Podracing team known as Team Sebulba, where the Glymphid assassin Aldar Beedo acted as Sebulba's pilot. The new Podracing circuit started on Tatooine, but expanded to other worlds as well, including the jungle planet of Felucia, Cloud City located on the planet Bespin, the sinkhole world of Utapau, and the capital planet of the Galactic Republic, Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ebe E. Endocott believed himself to be one of the best of the best. After his victories on Malastare, Endocott developed a brash over-confidence that perused him to purchase an expensive Corellian freighter. High on his success, Endocott raced on Baroonda and achieved further fame that caused him to fantasize about unseating Sebulba as the poster child of Malastare Podracing. With new goals set, Endocott became driven to beat Sebulba. While he didn't place first during the Boonta, he decided that placing at all, whereas Sebulba crashed, was victory enough."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Triffian, Endocott's arms and legs were covered with blue, cream, and black colored fur, as well parts of his body and his tail.

Endocott was known for his ego and boasting, yet he was not one who could not live up to his boasts. Endocott had the agility and reflexes to participate in Podracing, and took home numerous trophies, including three consecutive championships on Malastare. Before that, he was a skilled speeder pilot on his homeworld as well as on Boonta. However, as proved during his daredevil delivery stunts, he was not invincible, having suffered an accident that left him with a large scar across his stomach.

The Dash-8 was renowned for it's traction and handling, that allowed Endocott a surplus of control over the vehicle, which was especially useful for the twisty courses of Baroonda and Malastare where he was most popular. The cockpit was raised enough for Endocott to see clear over the engines for any obstacles, though as his career flourished, he also enjoyed the cockpit's height for the extra exposure it would grant him to his adoring fans. The Pod's color scheme was predominantly blue, with red details on the engine's fins and on the rear of the engine casings. Parts of the engine's rear sides were also white. The cockpit was blue overall, matching the engines, though the front and the underside of the cockpit were red. The cockpit was 3.05 meters in length, while each engine was 9.55 meters long."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After several victories on Malastare, Endocott bought himself a freighter that he used to transport his Podracer from planet to planet.

Endocott first appeared in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, a 1999 film directed by George Lucas. Endocott was realized in the film as a low resolution digital model that could be seen in the cockpit of Endocott's Podracer, as well seen outside of the Podracer on a view-screen behind Fode and Beed. A far more detailed sculpt of the character was also built by the art department. Endocott was created by concept artist Terryl Whitlatch, who provided several pieces of artwork for Endocott. Some early art portrayed Endocott to much larger, and also much skinnier, than his final design. Endocott's digital model was reused for the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, where the model was used to represent a Triffian named Ony Bobissia who appeared outside of Dex's Diner. Endocott's model was one of several retooled Podracer models used in Attack of the Clones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Endocott also appeared in the 1999 video game Star Wars Episode I: Racer, which was released on the same day as the The Phantom Menace, where he was voiced by Roger Jackson, who was also responsible for voicing Ark \"Bumpy\" Roose in the game. Endocott later appeared in the 2012 video game Kinect Star Wars, where he served as an opponent to the player during Podraces. The player could also use Endocott's Podracer to race in. In addition to these video games, Endocott was also set to appear in 2002's Star Wars: Racer Revenge, a sequel to the earlier Episode I Racer. Although voice lines were recorded for the character, Endocott was ultimately cut from the game. His voice files and other references to his involvement can still be found in the game's files, however.
