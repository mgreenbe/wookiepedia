However, Skywalker managed to leap back onto the skiff and, armed with a lightsaber provided by his astromech droid R2-D2, attacked the guards aboard the prisoners' skiff. As Skywalker dispatched the last of the guards aboard his own skiff, Snitkin piloted his skiff closer so that Oren and the others on board could fire at Skywalker.
