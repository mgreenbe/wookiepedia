In the game Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, Grendel is not even mentioned. Since the game shows 8t88 constantly without any pet, and since its depiction of the droid's fate eliminates any possibility of the creature's involvement, a retcon of incorporating Grendel into the original game would be practically impossible. However, the game designers at one point may have considered Grendel's inclusion since an unused fully textured model and animations can be found in the archives of the Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith CD."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Grendel\" is the name the great monster and major antagonist of the epic poem Beowulf."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the audio drama that adapts the Rebel Agent novella, 8t88 calls Grendel a vornskr."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
