It was one of the five Imperial-class Star Destroyers assigned to Death Squadron, Darth Vader's elite Imperial fleet, which was commanded by the Dark Lord of the Sith from his flagship, the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that time, as part of an Imperial operation known as Project Swarm, Death Squadron was searching for the Rebel Alliance's secret base. After a probe droid discovered the base on the ice planet Hoth, Vader and Death Squadron's admiral, Kendal Ozzel, led the fleet to the Hoth system to wipe out the rebellion. However, Ozzel had his ships drop out of hyperspace too close to the system, alerting the rebels to the Imperial presence and allowing them to deploy a deflector shield over their base, protecting it from orbital bombardment."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Hoth and rebel pursuit"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of the rebels' shield, Death Squadron was forced to deploy a ground assault, with its Star Destroyers forming a blockade to prevent the rebels from escaping. However, with the help of their v-150 Planet Defender ion cannon, which could disable a Star Destroyer, much of the rebel force on Hoth escaped, although the Empire did succeed in destroying their base. One of the last ships to leave Hoth was the rebel freighter Millennium Falcon, which was carrying the high-ranking rebels Leia Organa and Han Solo. Fleeing into the Hoth asteroid belt, Death Squadron pursued the rebel craft, despite the danger posed by the asteroids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the asteroid pursuit, the Star Destroyer was serving as an escort to the Executor, and Captain Canonhaus joined Captain Lorth Needa and another Imperial officer in a hologram report to Darth Vader. As Needa was relaying the last time the Falcon appeared in any of his scopes, the Ultimatum's command tower was hit by an asteroid, obliterating it. The ship was then instantly engulfed in massive explosions, which destroyed it. As such, the captain's hologram disappeared from Vader's view as he was killed, although the Sith Lord ignored this disruption. Subsequently, Needa suggested that due to the amount of damage Death Squadron had sustained, the rebel freighter must have been destroyed, although Vader correctly maintained that it was still intact."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ultimatum was created by John Jackson Miller for his 2014 canon novel, A New Dawn. The novel's cover, illustrated by Douglas Wheatley, provides a visual depiction of the Ultimatum. The vessel later appeared in Seth Dickinson's short story \"The Final Order,\" published in the 2020 anthology, From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back, which confirmed that the Star Destroyer that was struck by an asteroid in the 1980 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, was in fact the Ultimatum. In the Star Wars Legends continuity, the vessel first appeared in the The Empire Strikes Back novelization by Donald F. Glut, released prior to the film in 1980."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
