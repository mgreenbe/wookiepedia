They were founded by a renegade Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Millennial, and hence can be considered a splinter-faction of the Order of the Sith Lords."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Prophets were trained in the use of the dark side of the Force and used its power to delve into the possible future outcomes of any event. During the time of the Galactic Empire, they were led by Kadann, the Supreme Prophet. The prophets were all black-bearded individuals who wore gleaming black robes, and who obtained a great deal of power within the remnants of the Empire after the death of Palpatine. Among their many predictions, the Prophets supposedly foresaw the precise time and place for the destruction of both Death Stars by the Rebel Alliance. In order to retain their power, the Prophets used any means necessary to ensure the predicted outcome."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the group became part of the Secret Order of the Empire, the term became interchangeable with the title Emperor's Mage, used for a true Prophet of the Dark Side after they were recruited by Palpatine to serve him.

The Dromund system was one of 36 systems deleted from the Jedi Archives, as Yoda discovered after the revelation that Kamino had been deleted. Yoda may have visited the Dromund system, but if so the records of his visit were lost as a result of the Great Jedi Purge. During the Clone Wars, Separatist forces led by the Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress fought the 327th Star Corps during the Battle of Dromund Kaas. To her forces' advantage, Ventress used information provided by the Prophets of the Dark Side. Prior to the Jedi Purge, Palpatine appointed the Dark Jedi Kadann as Supreme Prophet of the Dark Side.

The pseudo-Kadann fled back to Scardia Station. Grand Admiral Makati cajoled Azrakel, whom also believed the pseudo-Kadann to be the true Kadann, into revealing much data on Scardia Station and the Lost City of the Jedi on Yavin 4.

The true Prophets viewed Palpatine as their enemy for having rejected Kadann's prophecies, and they despised Cronal as a traitor for becoming an Emperor's Hand and not coming with them to Bosthirda. Ignoring the actions of the Central Committee of Moffs, the true Prophets contacted Jerec, now a Great InQuestor of Judgment for the Pentastar Alignment. Jerec agreed to search for the lost Valley of the Jedi on behalf of the Prophets, while at the same time pretending to search for the Valley on behalf of the Alignment. Shortly thereafter, Emperor's Hand \"Blackhole\" (formerly an Emperor's Mage himself, and the father of Sariss) contacted Jerec and informed him of the existence of the clone Emperor on Byss and asked him to search for the lost Valley on the Emperor's behalf.

It was while studying on Dromund Kaas that Jerec first heard the legend of the Valley of the Jedi from the Prophet Cronal and first met Cronal's daughter, Sariss. Supreme Prophet Kadann trained Azrakel as a secret weapon to use against Palpatine and Darth Vader should the Sith ever turn on Kadann, but Azrakel came to hate Kadann and deserted him prior to the Battle of Endor. The Prophets sent agents to many planets: for example, Sariss worked on Tatooine under the alias \"Prophetess\".
