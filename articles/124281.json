These shells were used to protect themselves from radiation. Their massive bulk was supported by built-in repulsors. Shell Hutts grew to even larger proportions than regular Hutts, as their repulsorlift shells freed them from having to use their muscles for anything except for shoveling food into their mouths. Several times during their lives they would change to larger shells because of their growing masses. These events would be celebrated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Shell Hutts hired Pollux Poi to design the A-series assassin droids against the Gejalli kajidic, who retaliated using Dashade Shadow Killers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
