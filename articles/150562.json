As a new and younger champion, replacing the elderly Marl, Twitch was respected for his expert performance, crazy or not. Even so, he was not as skilled as Bendak Starkiller, the legendary former champion who only fought death matches, and Gerlon Two-Fingers thought that not even Twitch was insane enough to challenge Bendak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Twitch favored two heavy blaster pistols as his chosen weapons in the Taris dueling ring.
