In about 21 BBY, Esu was captured by the Galactic Republic and imprisoned by the Galactic Republic alongside various other bounty hunters aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tempestuous for transport to the planet Coruscant. During the voyage, the bounty hunter Arlain Zee escaped from his cell and freed Esu and several other hunters.
