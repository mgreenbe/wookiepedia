These episodes detailed the timeframe leading up to Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. Although criticized by fans (primarily for not being consistent with the Episode III tie-in novel Labyrinth of Evil) they were also a hit, and led to George Lucas announcing plans to continue the show as a half-hour, 3D cartoon, which began in 2008 under the title The Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The collected episodes of the show were made available on DVD in Star Wars: Clone Wars Volume One and Volume Two.
