The followup series, Crimson Empire II: Council of Blood, was released in November of that year, concluding in April 1999. After the end of the second story arc, a third was planned for release in 2001; the one shot comic Hard Currency was released as an introduction to the new storyline.

Following the final death of Palpatine during the Battle of Onderon and the slaughter of the rest of his kin on Yinchorr, Kir Kanos is left with a blood oath against the enemies of the Empire, swearing death to all involved in the death of his former master. The first storyline focused on the conflict between Kanos and Carnor Jax, a former Imperial Royal Guard and aspiring Sith Lord who made a bid for the throne following Palpatine's death, while the followup series chronicled Kanos' time as a bounty hunter and his targeting of members of the Imperial Ruling Council. The third and final series focused on both Kanos' desire to kill Luke Skywalker, the Jedi Master who was the main rival of the former Emperor, and his conflict with Devian, a former Imperial \"thug\" leading a splinter faction of the Imperial Remnant known as the \"Restored Empire\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to the three story arcs and various one off comics, an audio dramatization of the first Crimson Empire was released in 1999."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Conception"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1983, following the release of Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, writer Randy Stradley, who was working for the license holder of Star Wars related comics at the time, Marvel Comics, finished his first script. After turning in his script, the editor requested another story pitch. What resulted was a story focusing on four surviving members of the red-robed Imperial Royal Guard, seen fleetingly in the scenes on the Death Star II in Return of the Jedi. The guards would have \"stalked\" Luke Skywalker following the events of the film. A few weeks after submitting the pitch, Stradley was told that the story had been rejected by LucasFilm, who were uncomfortable with any mythology surrounding the Royal Guards at the time. The concept was put on the backburner for over a decade; in 1989, the Star Wars license was acquired by Dark Horse Comics, publishing the Star Wars: Dark Empire series in 1991, focusing on the constant rebirth of Emperor Palpatine through clone bodies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1997, Stradley had a brainstorming session with editor Ryder Windham and publisher Mike Richardson for potential new projects. It was then that Stradley revived his fourteen year old concept, making some changes to account for new continuity. For example, the concept was moved forward in the timeline to take place after the final death of the Emperor over Onderon rather than immediately after the Battle of Endor, and the four Royal Guard characters were consolidated into one, resulting in the creation of Kir Kanos. At the suggestion of Richardson, the concept became a trilogy, in which Kanos would first target a traitorous fellow guardsmen before working his way up and confronting Luke Skywalker himself.

Certain plot elements in the second installment, such as the introduction of the seedy Nom Anor, were intended to foreshadow a future cross-media project by Dark Horse Comics and Bantam Spectra; this project, chronicling the invasion of the extragalactic race, the Yuuzhan Vong, would be turned over to Del Rey, who published The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime in 1999."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Crimson Empire III"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the fact that the one off comic Hard Currency was apparently written as a prelude to the third chapter of the Crimson Empire saga, because of the release of Vector Prime and its follow up novels in the late 90's and early 2000's, plans for a Crimson Empire III were put on hold, due in part to the everchanging continuity for that time period. Randy Stradley himself could not come up with a satisfying conclusion to the saga. Years later, in 2010, Mike Richardson announced his intentions to resurrect the project, with the deluge of New Jedi Order-related material far in the past.
