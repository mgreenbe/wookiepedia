She tasked them first to investigate the criminals known as the Peddlers, then Borvo's thug Derm Worrit, and finally Jarkey's father himself. They then found that Jarkey briefly took refuge among different criminal organization, namely the Muskegs, the Skaak Tippers and the Mummers. The spacers eventually discovered that Jarkey had recruited a small army of Naboo pirates and fortified a ranch near Theed.
