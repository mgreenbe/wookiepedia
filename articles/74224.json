During the Great Galactic War, Karm acted as the pilot of the personal shuttle of the Sith Lord Darth Malgus and was stationed in the city Livien Magnus on the planet Ord Radama during a Sith attack on the world. During the latter stages of the battle, a Galactic Republic fleet attacked Malgus' capital ships in orbit of Ord Radama and Malgus ordered Karm to fly him from Livien Magnus to the Sith dreadnaught Lindworm. Karm flew the shuttle with skill and evaded the Republic's Aurek-class tactical strikefighters, and the Captain landed Malgus' shuttle in the Lindworm's ventral hangar bay."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Karm was created by Daniel Wallace and was mentioned in the 2012 publication Book of Sith: Secrets from the Dark Side.
