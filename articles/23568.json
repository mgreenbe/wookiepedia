During the Battle of Teth in 22 BBY, the RA-7 protocol droid 4-A7 claimed to be the caretaker of a B'omarr Order Monastery on the Wild Space world, though he was truly a spy droid for the Confederacy of Independent Systems. While Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and his Torrent Company initially believed the unit's lies, the droid's true loyalties were exposed when Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano saw him with several B1 battle droids. She then turned her lightsaber on the Separatist droids, quickly taking out the combat droids and 4-A7 himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A caretaker droid was a droid that had been tasked with looking over a location, such as the monasteries of the B'omarr Order.

Thus, during the Battle of Teth, after the Republic's Torrent Company fought past the battle droids guarding an occupied B'omarr Order Monastery, Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress dispatched 4-A7 to greet their enemies. Pretending to be the monastery's humble caretaker droid, 4-A7 approached the company's Jedi General, Anakin Skywalker, claiming that the Republic had liberated him from the battle droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Skywalker asked him where Rotta was being held, 4-A7 pointed the Jedi Knight to the detention level, warning him that it was dangerous and not a place for Ahsoka Tano, Skywalker's Padawan learner whom he claimed to have confused for a servant girl. After 4-A7 offered a thousand apologies for this, Skywalker and Tano rescued Rotta from the dungeons and brought him to the courtyard. 4-A7 recorded them place the screaming infant into a backpack, fulfilling his role to frame the Jedi Order in the kidnapping, as the edited footage was sent to Count Dooku to use as evidence against the Republic for Jabba. A short time later and unfortunately for the protocol droid, Tano, Skywalker, Rotta, and the astromech droid R2-D2 arrived at the platform containing the G9 Rigger freighter Twilight, which 4-A7 and a group of B1 battle droids hoped to escape on."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon spotting him, Tano, who had been wondering what had happened to 4-A7, continued to assume he was a caretaker droid and greeted him as such. Though 4-A7 initially tried to keep up his caretaker act, the B1 units walked into view, exposing his true loyalties to the Jedi Commander. Tano accused the fake caretaker of treason, and 4-A7 dropped his act, ordering the battle droids to kill her to prevent Rotta's rescue. However, Tano made short work of the B1s with her lightsaber. The young Jedi then turned her blade on 4-A7, swiftly decapitating the droid she had thought was an ally."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The position of caretaker droid was first mentioned in the 2008 film Star Wars: The Clone Wars.
