Essex Yerac, was a Rebel Alliance Lieutenant Colonel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yerac fought in the Battle of Archais, probably as a member of Midnight Squadron from Eclipse Team. During the battle, with the Rebel units trapped by the Assassin's Guild and by Lieutenant Colonel Freja Covell's forces, Rebel officer Mosara Thiirn deserted, which led to an increasingly bad situation for the Rebels. Many Rebels died in the battle because of Thiirn's treason. Yerac's hatred towards Thiirn was well-known; General Airen Cracken feared for her life should Yerac ever find her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yerac also tracked independent bounty hunters through the fog banks of Hewl's Karap Valley. Suddenly, two red eyes appeared from the fog itself and it asked the Rebel to keep his distance. Yerac obeyed, but identified the \"eyes\" as Filar-Nitzan spy Vacander. Yerac eventually tried to write a report on Vacander for the Task Force on Alliance Security, but could not find very much information."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
