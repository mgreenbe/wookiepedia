As well as increasing the blood pressure, it also cut off oxygen exchange in the lungs, throttled the esophagus and crushed brain tissue in the skull. Rebel scientists were searching for a cure for it during the Galactic Civil War, but what they did not know was that it had in fact been bioengineered by the Galactic Empire for use as a poison. Imperial spy Tanya Madera used this poison to kill both Chief Technician Adonar Dellox and one of the X-wing pilots from Reginard Base.
