It was fed by underground tributaries which flowed from the planet's core and connected it with other bodies of water like Lake Paonga. The human population that settled Naboo built a small farming village on the banks of the Solleu named Theed, which eventually grew into the planet's capital city. For many generations the humans used the river to meet with members of the Gungan species native to Naboo. During the Invasion of Naboo by the Trade Federation, the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Gungan exile Jar Jar Binks traveled from the Gungan city of Otoh Gunga in Lake Paonga through the planet's core and into the Solleu to arrive in Theed. Following the Invasion, where the Gungans and human communities fought together, the trading through the river greatly increased between the two species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Solleu River first appeared in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace in 1999.
