Starships of many pirate organizations arrived at the moon to collect the prisoners, and the New Republic Defense Fleet was mobilized, blockading them in and preventing their escape. Eventually, the Pau'an gangster Fyzen Gor, who was aboard the pirate frigate Radium Destrobar, rammed the ship into one of the other pirate flagships, escaping during the destruction. Following the loss of their two largest warships, the pirates surrendered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
