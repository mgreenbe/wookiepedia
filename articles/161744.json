By 32 BBY, he worked at the Grand Arena of Mos Espa. That year, Vomak met the Toydarian junk dealer Watto, who had just lost his slave Anakin Skywalker in a bet with the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. Watto enlisted the services of Vomak and tasked him to corner Master Jinn in the streets of Mos Espa before he could leave the planet with the young Skywalker. To do so, Vomak brought several henchmen with him, but his attempt at stopping the Jedi was unsuccessful."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vomak and the group of hired thugs appear in Episode I: Qui-Gon Jinn, a one-shot comic story written by Ryder Windham that ties into the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. According to Star Wars Galaxy Collector 6, the comic's script names the character \"Vomac,\" but the proper spelling appeared in the Star Wars: Episode I Insider's Guide CD-ROM reference guide. None of the thugs are named in the comic book story, but Vomak can be indentified since he is the lead thug, and is hired personally by Watto. The Insider's Guide refers to him as an Abyssin, but the comic shows him to be of an unidentified reptilian species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
