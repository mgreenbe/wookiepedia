However, in 29 BBY, the Hutts began to squeeze the Syndicate out of organized crime, so she left it. She traveled to Cularin and created the Cularin Spacer's Union there. She believed that it could make her a lot of money, if she could gain some influence of the Cularin system's hotshot freighter pilots. She ran a stall for the Union at the Cularin Trade Show, to try and gain new members for it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
