Resembling fleshy, starfish-like creatures, the gnullith sealed itself over the mouth of the wearer and inserted a long proboscis down the throat in order to provide the host with a supply of breathable air. While uncomfortable to use, unlike most Yuuzhan Vong biots, gnulliths did not inflict pain on the wearer. Unlike breath masks, gnulliths could be used indefinitely as they did not use air canisters or require replacement filters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yuuzhan Vong created a hybrid gnullith-villip hybrid combining the function of both a communication device and breathing apparatus.
