Nejaa Halcyon, Ylenic It'kla (who referred to Tyris as Nightsweat), and one It'kla called \"Desertwind\" (actually Obi-Wan Kenobi) attempted to turn the Dark Jedi from their path, but were rebuffed. Attacked, the Jedi squared off against Tyris and his companions and battle was joined. \"Desertwind\" managed to kill his opponent, the apparent leader of the Jensaarai, and Ylenic slew the Dark Jedi he identified as \"Dustrose\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Halcyon, however, was less fortunate than the others. Tyris took advantage of Halcyon's lack of telekinetic powers and ran him through. Before succumbing to his injuries, Halcyon drained the energy out of Tyris's lightsaber and used the Force to break every bone in his body, killing him. The release of dark side energies at the deaths of the three Jensaarai leaders collapsed the structure where the rest of the Jensaarai were dwelling, killing all but four of the apprentices. The survivors included the wife of one of Tyris' apprentices, the woman who would later become the Saarai-kaar of the Jensaarai."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the declaration of the Empire, Obi-Wan Kenobi journeyed to Tatooine in order to bring Luke Skywalker to his uncle and aunt.
