The 0033X was the standard-issue grenade of the Old Republic's rocket jumpers. It was the size of a Human fist and could be set to either explode instantaneously or on a ten-second delay. While some examples survived into the time of the Empire, whether they were still capable of working or not could depend greatly on their condition."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
