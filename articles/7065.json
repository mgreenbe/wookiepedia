She was also a distant cousin of Empress Marasiah Fel and Jedi Cade Skywalker. Towards the end of the Second Imperial Civil War, Ania escaped from an Imperial prison camp on Drash-So and encountered the kindly assassin droid AG-37, who gave her transportation offworld to honor a promise that he made to her ancestor Han Solo. By 138 ABY, Solo was working as a junk dealer in the Carreras system, and she accidentally discovered the lightsaber of Imperial Knight Yalta Val after an Imperial communications droid containing the lightsaber turned up in her junkyard. Enlisting the help of her Mon Calamari friend Sauk, Solo attempted to sell the weapon on Carreras Major, but soon became the target of a Sith posing as Val. Assisted by Sauk, AG-37 and an Imperial Knight named Jao Assam, Ania found herself in the middle of an insurgency led by a rogue Sith Lord named Darth Wredd. The consequence of their action was the destruction of the Galactic Federation Triumvirate's communications array in the Carreras system, which brought Ania to the attention of Empress Fel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Carreras Incident, Ania joined forces with Jao Assam to hunt down Darth Wredd. Tracking him to the dead world of Dac, Ania and Jao discovered that a Sith Lord named Darth Luft had secretly been constructing a pirate fleet, using the remains of the Mon Calamari Shipyards and a slavery operation composed of Mon Calamari and Quarren refugees. Assisted by a Triumvirate force led by Admiral Gar Stazi and Yalta Val, they succeeded in saving the slaves and killing Darth Luft. However, their hunt for Wredd had been stalled as they discovered he had not been on Dac and that he had manipulated them into killing Darth Luft. Matters where complicated when Ania's past caught up with her. Framed for the murder of an Imperial Knight named Teemen Alton, she was kidnapped by her former lover Ramid who wanted to collect the bounty on her head as revenge for her abandonment of him in the past. They were forced to work together when a mysterious bounty hunter shot them down and became determined to capture Ania. The true murderer of the Imperial Knight and a former guard at the prison camp where Ania had been imprisoned during the war, the bounty hunter killed Ramid and tried to frame Ania for Alton's murder. However, Jao saved her and they were quickly retrieved by a squad of Trandoshan stormtroopers, who arrested Ania.

Using coordinates sent by the latter, Ania and her team tracked them to the floating dead world of Mala, the location of the Carreras Incident. After rescuing Jao, ships carrying infiltrated members of the One Sith arrived as did Empress Fel and a fleet of stormtroopers and Imperial Knights. A great battle ensued on Mala between the Sith and the Knights during which Ania and her companions temporarily joined forces with Darth Wredd, who had orchestrated the whole confrontation to destroy the Sith. Once the battle was done, Wredd turned on them and tried to kill Empress Fel, badly wounding her. After a brief confrontation with Jao during which the Imperial Knight refused to kill the rogue Sith, Ania killed Wredd with a blaster rifle.

Early in her life, some people believed that Solo would come to a bad end, while others believed that she had a great destiny ahead of her; Solo, on the other hand, did not believe in destiny.

Ania and Ramid attempted to escape the prison camp but caught the attention of the guards. During the escape, Ramid was shot and recaptured but Ania managed to escape.

Seeing that she had no money to buy a transport out of the Selvatas system, AG-37 granted lodging and passage to Ania Solo.

When the shop owner insinuated that he might turn the pair in for possessing the weapon, Solo angrily confronted him, but the owner threw both Solo and Sauk out into the street.

The two returned to Solo's junkyard, where Sauk continued to work on the Imperial comm droid, but Solo insisted that she would not abandon Sauk, though she intended to get rid of the lightsaber. Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of AG-37, a droid and frequent customer that Solo was friends with, and she directed him to the north side of the junkyard to find a linear converter.

Fortunately for the two, the guards were distracted by several gesaw rats scavenging the remains of Solo's droid, allowing Sauk and Solo to escape into the junkyard. Firing at her pursuers, Solo and Sauk fled deeper into the junkyard, but the timely arrival of AG-37 saved them from execution as he eliminated the guards.

AG-37 convinced Sauk and Solo to stand down, explaining that \"Val\" had been attacking them, and the Imperial comm droid showed Assam the hologram of the fight.

Dozens of tiny droids burst through the hull when the freighter was deposited in the larger ship's hangar, and Solo and her friends were forced out into the hangar where they were captured by Carreras guards. Knocked unconscious and imprisoned in holding cells on the Carreras G51 communications array with Sauk and a deactivated AG-37, Solo began searching for a way out immediately upon awaking, but her efforts were in vain.

The Sith escaped the explosion and leaped back to the hangar floor, where he choked Solo with the Force and threw her aside.

Escaping aboard the freighter, AG-37 flew back down to the planet's surface and Solo rushed to the boarding ramp so that Master Val could leap aboard, and the freighter escaped just before the array crashed into the planet.

Fel was requesting a formal audience, and the officer expressed her belief that Solo could gain a comfortable assignment on the capital Coruscant from the audience, as the Triumvirate wished to keep her happy. Solo soon learned from Sauk that AG-37 had offered her friend a job as an engineer on his ship, and AG-37 offered her a place on his ship as well, but when she decided to take the offer on Coruscant, the droid advised her to remain alert before departing the Animus with Sauk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A little while later, Jao Assam confided in Solo that he had foreseen Darth Wredd attacking the Empress, and the Knight admitted his belief that Wredd wished to make Assam his apprentice to reinstate the Rule of Two Sith doctrine.

However, Solo eventually decided otherwise and went to Assam's quarters, where she convinced him to join her in hunting down Wredd. Once Assam had donned his armor, the two headed for the hangar to secure a ship, but found Master Val and a squad of stormtroopers waiting for them.

Master Val allowed Assam reluctantly to leave with Ania on his quest but warned the younger Knight that he was being selfish.

She also wondered whether the Triumivrate would have purged these documents as well. Assam commented that Wredd was probably a Sith apprentice since he did not wear the traditional Sith tattoos which most members of the One Sith wore.

The two quickly learnt that Dieben was a wanted fugitive who had been extradited to his homeworld of Nalyd to face punishment for various crimes. Ania and Jao then travled to Nalyd, a planet of swirling orange fog. After landing at a spaceport on that planet, Assam discovered from local sources that Dieben had been sentenced to death for various felonies including the assassination of a minister, assaulting an \"officer of the law\", and the sabotage of a public transport resulting in ten deaths.

While Ania and Jao were unable to extract any information from Dieben, they quickly found out from the guards that Dieben had planned to rendezvous with Darth Wredd on the planet Dac following the events in Carreras. Dac, the homeworld of the Mon Calamari and Quarren species, had become a 'dead world' after the One Sith unleashed a biological weapon into its oceans the previous year.

While preparing to disembark to Dac, Ania tried to convince a skeptical Jao that Dieben had been telling the truth because he was not smart enough to lie. Jao also recalled that Dieben had bragged about having powerful friends, whom Ania assumed to be Darth Wredd. Since the One Sith had poisoned Dac a year ago, the planet had become uninhabited and was lawless.

Jao deduced that the two were merely common criminals but sensed the presence of the dark side of the Force, which implied a Sith presence.

He also mentioned that the One Sith had sent emissaries to contact the Galactic Triumvirate and claimed that the government was not interested in Dac. Instead of killing Jao, Ania and the two escaped slaves, Darth Luft decided to dump them through a trapdoor into the poisonous oceans of Dac.
