He served in the opening battle of the Clone Wars on the planet Geonosis in 22 BBY, in which the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic fought the Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the battle, Sarge was the only trooper in his squad to survive the battle. He, along with all other commando units, joined the ranks of the Special Operations Brigade, a special forces unit within the Grand Army made up of clone commandos and Advanced Recon Commandos.

Sarge and his team worked in conjunction with a squad of blue-armored commandos in an attempt to secure the stolen gift from the Trandoshan mercenaries who had taken it. Sarge's team secured a position on top of one of the buildings in the city where the mercenaries were located, while the other squad set a street-level trap for the bounty hunters.

Upon entering one of the buildings, the commandos eliminated a team of B1-Series battle droids, losing one of their comrades in the process. Sarge and the remaining two commandos fought until they had secured the room, which resulted in the death of another team member. The remaining Trandoshan who had the diplomatic gift surprised Sarge by shooting and killing the only other member of the Sergeant's squad. Sarge promptly hurled himself at the mercenary and overpowered him, killing him with his knuckle plate vibro blade and successfully securing the package.

In 19 BBY, Sarge and his squad were placed under the command of Jedi General Traavis. Under the Jedi Master's leadership, they helped to liberate the world of Garqi from the Separatists.

During the trek, Evan managed to flee from the squad, but was ambushed by a OG-9 homing spider droid. As the droid was threatening Evan, Sarge drew the spider droid's attention away from the boy, ambushing the droid with his squad and destroying it. The Sergeant checked on Evan's condition and made the decision to seek a campsite for the night.

Sarge then spoke with Evan, instructing him to be careful and always obey his superiors. After the conversation, Sarge received Order 66 from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, which commanded clone troopers to eliminate the Jedi Knights as enemies of the Republic. Sarge immediately ordered Aiwha Squad to carry out the order, and they turned their weapons against Traavis, killing the Jedi. Sarge explained to Evan, who witnessed Traavis' execution, that the Jedi were now enemies of the Republic, reiterating his beliefs in obeying the orders given to him. Sometime after that, RC-1013 filed the details of Traavis' execution in a report shortly after Palpatine declared himself Emperor of the first Galactic Empire. The official records, which were modified by Imperial Advisor Sate Pestage from a compilation of various reports created by Moff Marcellin Wessel, stated that Traavis was killed in the act of stealing children in order to indoctrinate them in the Jedi ways."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a clone of Jango Fett, RC-1013 had tan skin, a brown patch of hair on his head, and brown eyes. He stood at 1.83 meters tall. He was diligent in obeying the commands of his superiors and did not question their orders, regardless of his personal feelings. Sarge's commitment to the soldiers under his command was such that he viewed his fellow clones as his brothers. During the mission to Ord Mantell, he executed the last Trandoshan mercenary out of vengeance for his perished squadmates. When he and Aiwha Squad were escorting Evan to the refugee camp on Garqi, the Sergeant at times became frustrated with the boy due to his stubborn refusal to submit to the squad's assistance, but later explained his background to the boy and offered him advice to survive in the galaxy. When Order 66 was issued, Sarge obeyed the command without hesitation, and made it a point to explain to Evan why his squad had executed Traavis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars' opening battle on Geonosis, Sarge was equipped with a set of Phase I clone trooper armor.
