It is a typical diner game where you try to obtain a certain amount of money before the day is over. During the day, customers with certain dislikes or likes drop in and many of them order more than one beverage. Bosses are also present throughout the game. Afterward, a rest period allows you to purchase upgrades to facilitate the management of the cantina with the money you earned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "THQ's license for Star Wars app games appears to have expired and the game was removed from listings at the end of August 2011.
