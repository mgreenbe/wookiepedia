Master Fate represented the winds and currents that aided early Wroonian seafarers. Master Fate was stylized as a jolly old man with a great blue beard that Wroonians believed to be represent the blue of both the oceans and skies. Those who faithfully served Master Fate were granted the blessing known as \"Fate's Pleasure.\" However, Fate also had a capricious nature that led him to create wild storms or becalmed seas. Once Wroonians took to the stars, many still invoked the name of Master Fate as either a praise or curse."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
