It was a smart bomb that was said to be capable of launching over any defensive grid to come down in the heart of enemy troop formations. The weed-cutter exploded at chest height, spraying out tiny, smart, durasteel flechettes in a circular pattern. Against soft targets such as clone troopers, the weapon had a kill zone of 200 meters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
