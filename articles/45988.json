However, in the last moment the Onderon rebels, led by Steela Gerrera, interrupted the execution by shooting the battle droids and IG-100 MagnaGuards. While the rebels were about to free the two, General Kalani called for reinforcements, and in the process rebel Dono was killed. The execution was about to be done at once, when General Tandin, leader of the Royal Onderon Militia and his men aided the rebels, so Dendup and Saw Gerrera could escape along with the other rebels. When Tandin was about to be killed by Droidekas and B2 super battle droids, Ahsoka Tano force-pushed the droids, and helped Tandin to escape as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
