They analyzed the data provided by other sensors to determine if a life form was present, and if so, what kind. For example, a full-spectrum transceiver might detect a 37.0 Celsius mobile heat source, massing at eighty kilograms, and that the ship's life-support systems were providing a standard terrestrial atmosphere and gravity; an LFI would conclude that this being was probably a Human."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
