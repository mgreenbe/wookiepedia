Units cost 2000 credits and weighed 12 kilograms. The HH-15 was older than its Imperial counterpart, the MiniMag PTL, and had inferior targeting sensors. However, many Rebel soldiers became quite adept at aiming the missile launcher manually to acquire a target lock. Further, its rugged design meant it could be operated in extreme climates and conditions, such as in the freezing temperatures of Hoth. A number of HH-15 launchers were deployed during the Battle of Hoth. Some models were modified by Rebel vanguards to fire two missiles per pull of the trigger. Such variants had a capacity for 8 missiles rather than 7 to compensate this feature and were used in a number of battlefields during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Battlefront video game series, the HH-15 launcher serves as the Rebel vanguard's primary weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
