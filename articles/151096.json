When Hethrir suggested sending the then three-year old Anakin Solo back to where he came from, she suggested memory wiping Anakin and then putting him back, before concluding by saying that Hethrir was so wise. Like Qaqquqqu and Cnorec, she auctioned for children whom were held captive on Hethrir's Worldcraft. On that meeting, she won the auction and the right to sell them as slaves to the Imperial loyalists in Hethrir's trade gathering at Crseih Station, which supported his achievements."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the meeting, she and Qaqquqqu witnessed Hethrir use the Force to murder Cnorec for disagreeing with him.
