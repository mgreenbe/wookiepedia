The Duro-based concern also employed a relatively large (though poorly trained) security force at its main offices, located in the Duro orbital city of Bburru. The CorDuro logo was distinctively triangular, serving as an easy way to identify a constituent of its motor pool. Its vice-director was Durgard Brarun."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 13 ABY, CorDuro Shipping took control of the Pri-Andylan shipyards. During the Yuuzhan Vong War in 26 ABY, Jedi Tresina Lobi and Thrynni Vae discovered CorDuro Shipping's ties to the Peace Brigade, resulting in the Brigade murdering Thrynni. Jedi masters Luke Skywalker, Mara Jade Skywalker, Jacen Solo, and Jaina Solo spearheaded a discreet investigation into Thrynni's disappearance, which culminated in an abduction attempt on Jacen Solo, in turn spoiled by a rogue Sunesi priest. However, Luke was able to recover information on Thrynni which revealed the young apprentice's death. Their collaboration, however, did little to help them, as most of CorDuro's executives were fed to Sgauru and Tu-Scart by Warmaster Tsavong Lah."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
