After Sadras Koyan, Prime Minister of the Five Worlds, received a holocomm transmission from Denjax Teppler, the Five Worlds' Minister of Information, he left the station's fire-control chamber in an attempt to reach airlock Epsilon 34G, and escape. In his absence Vibro used Centerpoint to target Coruscant, capital of the Galactic Alliance, in his desire to get revenge for his wife, who had been arrested during a security sweep by the Galactic Alliance Guard, and later found dead. When the technician asked Vibro what he was doing, he responded that he was getting things ready for Koyan to fire the station, which she accepted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Galactic Alliance forces were about to enter the fire-control chamber, Vibro hissed to get her attention. He told her to watch as he pressed the button to fire the station. However, the scientist Toval Seyah had been able to reprogram the star data in the station's systems, and reset all the other coordinates as the center of Hollowtown, an open sphere in the exact center of the station itself.
