It is not clear if this is the same man, but the context suggests that the title applies to Darth Vader or Valorum (aka Dodona), as he is to be sent to the Imperial/Royal capital for his execution before the Galactic ruler. This inconsistency may be explained if one of these courtiers was also entitled Consul (there were two in ancient Rome and during the Consulate in France), and was therefore not a unique title."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
