Most of those were confiscated by the Galactic Empire, but one was deliberatly abandoned in the ice of the planet Hoth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Iron Blockade of the Anoat sector, the Uprising acquired the Hoth stardrop. They intended to use it as a last resort, should their mission to capture Commander Bragh of the Imperial Purge Troopers go awry. And indeed, the kidnapping attempt failed; not only did Bragh avoid capture, but two high-profile members of the Uprising\u2014Her Majesty and Loathe\u2014were taken to the black site prison known as the Crypt. Later, when the Uprising launched a rescue mission to the Crypt, they aimed the recovered stardrop at the prison's command compound, dissuading the Imperials from calling reinforcements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
