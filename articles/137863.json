It was designed to offer hyperspace travel to starfighters that were too small to allow for an onboard hyperdrive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Syliure-31 was designed for the Kuat Systems Engineering Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor, though it was also used to transport Delta-7Bs, and Delta-12 Skysprites. Two large hyperdrive engines were mounted on opposite sides of the ring, which split across the middle with a socket that connected the fighter to the ring. The engines were fitted with Class 1.0 hyperdrives, with an operational range of 150,000 light years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the introduction of the Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor, and its wide acceptance as the \"replacement\" for the Delta-7 and Delta-7B, TransGalMeg developed the larger Syliure-45 hyperdrive module. Though this advanced model was in common usage as of the Battle of Coruscant, several Syliure-31s were still in operation, held in orbit above the Jedi Temple."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At least one Syluire-31 was still operational in orbit around Geonosis by the time of the Galactic Civil War, which Wedge Antilles later used alongside a Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor recovered from Geonosis to leave the system after an ambush."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
