The people of Aleen later adopted a policy of self-imposed separation from the rest of the galaxy a few millennia before the Imperial Era. Consequently, most Aleena found on worlds away from Aleen proper, such as Coruscant or Tatooine, hailed from Aleen Minor rather than the Aleena's original homeworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
