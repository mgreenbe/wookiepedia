The species freed themselves with encouragement from the Tionese, enemies of the Hutts from the Tion Hegemony, and the parliament had been formed by the time of Second Battle of Vontor during the Hutt\u2013Xim conflict, a war between the Tionese and the Hutts. At the time of the battle the Tionese had forces present in the Moralan system where Moralan, the Moralan homeworld, was located but shortly afterwards they withdrew. With the Tionese gone a Hutt named Boonta Hestilic Shad'ruu attacked the republic and conquered it, driving the Moralans to extinction and so destroying the parliament. The battle lasted three days and was celebrated in the three-day holiday collectively known as Boonta's Eve, named after the hero of the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The parliament of Moralan was first mentioned in an article by Rich Handley and Abel G. Pe\u00f1a on the Star Wars Droids TV series in the 170th issue of the Polyhedron role-playing magazine released in June 2004. Daniel Wallace stated in the endnotes for the 2009 reference book The Essential Atlas that the Moralan species he and Jason Fry mentioned were a reference to the parliament.
