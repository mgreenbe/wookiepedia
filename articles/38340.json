In the beginning, Directive 7 was composed of sentient droids who wished to create a society free from the warmongering of organics. Overtime, Mentor became obsessed with dealing with the organics and slowly assimilated other droids into its collective consciousness. Based on the moon Zadd, the movement sought to incite a galaxy-wide uprising by droids, but C5-M3 recruited individuals to thwart Mentor's plans. Zadd was attacked by one of the galactic powers after the droid revolt came to their attention, and Mentor's destruction resulted in Zadd's destruction as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
