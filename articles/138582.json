It eventually resulted in the creation of a variant with flaps on the edges of the wings. It was also rumored that the last iteration also included solar-strakes onto the existing panels, courtesy of Vader, in an effort to draw enough power to support an experimental engine/booster combination. The experimental propulsion system was not available to any pilots, although the ships themselves were utilized by high-ranking starfighter pilots in the Imperial Navy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
