Palpatine's soul fell into this realm following his final death, where he would be a wandering, disembodied spirit residing in perpetual madness. Marka Ragnos's spirit was summoned from Chaos by Tavion Axmis and the Disciples of Ragnos, though Ragnos was summarily defeated and returned to the netherworld by Jaden Korr. It was believed that if a Force user's body perished after a failed attempt at transferring essence, the user's life energy was lost and dispersed in Chaos. Darth Plagueis once reported that, according to legend, those who failed to punish their enemies during their lifetime would be forced to harbor their ill feelings in Chaos forever. Plagueis, however, didn't believe Chaos was a real place, but only the perception of imminent dissolution some beings felt when they died. In his opinion, only stronger minds who refused the loss of their identity would perceive this pain. Chaos was also briefly referenced by House Palpatine Patriarch Cosinga Palpatine, citing that House Palpatine was one of the six gates separating Chaos. Chaos was not inescapable, however: Darth Sidious, after perishing during the Battle of Endor, had escaped Chaos with the help of Sith Spirits and Sate Pestage, and required several deceased Jedi to ensure he never escaped again after his final death at Onderon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Chaos in language"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Chaos take me\" was a mild expletive, sometimes used when one decided to do something he or she knew was not very wise. Saying \"Go to Hell\" or \"See you in Hell\" were similar expletives meant to insult or threaten whomever they were directed to. Another use was in the phrase \"There will be Hell to pay.\" They can also be used when either startled or expressing disbelief regarding someone's story, evidenced by the phrases \"What the hell is that?\" and \"Like hell you did!,\" respectively. A similar phrase, \"Where the hell are you going?!,\" can be used in the context of the former.
