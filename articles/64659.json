Each was as mysterious as the world itself. Iego was a hotbed of life and had both hot and temperate climates and was tropical, steamy, and humid. Its desert surface was covered in basaltic spires and canyons, where reeksa (enormous, ravenous carnivorous plants with sharpened spikes for teeth and deadly thorns along their length that were known to eat humans alive, and whose roots were used to create the only known antidote to the Blue Shadow Virus) grew. Iego was also inhabited by xandu, creatures who flew though Iego's skies on their four wings and used their giant ears to hear prey at great distances, after which they would snatch them up and smash them against rock walls using their two arms and two legs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems invaded Iego with hundreds of battle droids and stole Millius Prime from its inhabitants, the Diathim. There, they built a laser web security system to prevent the inhabitants from leaving the system. The Separatists then abandoned Iego and left battle droids and vulture droids behind at Cliffhold. There, they were reprogrammed by Jaybo Hood as his servants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fifty of the best pilots attempted to leave Iego, but failed. Among them was Taquito, whose death made the inhabitants believe the laser web was the work of Drol, the so-called \"phantom ruler\" of Iego. After this had been going on for some time, Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi ventured to the planet in the starship Twilight in search of reeksa root, the only known cure for the deadly Blue Shadow Virus, in order to save people on Naboo who had been infected with a re-engineered strain of the disease and were trapped in an underground bunker. Kenobi and Skywalker were assisted by a skeptical Hood, who was confident they would be as trapped on Iego as its inhabitants were. After venturing into a canyon to brave the reeksa, a carnivorous plant, and retrieve some root, Kenobi and Skywalker attempted to leave, but were stopped by the LaserWeb Defense Station, with Kenobi persuading his former apprentice to turn the ship around."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
