With the Declaration of a New Order, The Republic Journal of Law-Enforcement and Low-Intensity Conflict published analysis of events which undermined Imperial doctrine and, as a result, was forced underground. Nevertheless, it continued to publish the Threat Dossier newsletter, detailing individuals of interest to the Journal and distributing it freely to interested parties.
