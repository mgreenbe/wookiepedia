In 4 ABY, Vizam was present in the throne room of Jabba's Palace on the planet Tatooine when the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO delivered a message to the Hutt from the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, a member of the Rebel Alliance. As Vizam stood next to a Jawa beside Jabba's dais, a hologram of Skywalker stated his intention to see the smuggler Han Solo, who was imprisoned within a block of carbonite within the palace, set free. Skywalker then gifted the two droids to Jabba, and they were escorted by several of the Hutt's henchmen from the room."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vizam later viewed a musical performance by the Max Rebo Band in the throne room, which ended when the Twi'lek dancer Oola refused Jabba's advances. The Hutt dropped the dancer through a trap door into a pit containing his pet rancor, Pateesa. Vizam was among the members of the court who rushed forward to the grate above the pit to witness Oola's demise.

Vizam was seated on the floor of one of the throne room's alcoves amongst various other resting court members when Skywalker entered the throne room and demanded that Jabba free his friends. Vizam stood to witness the confrontation, which resulted in Skywalker being dropped into the rancor pit after threatening Jabba's life.

Vizam was also on the barge while Jabba's prisoners were transported on a Bantha-II cargo skiff escort. Once the skiff stopped above the pit, R2-D2 launched Skywalker's lightsaber from the barge to the Jedi, who took the blade to defeat Jabba's henchmen and free his friends aboard the skiff. Vizam witnessed the attack and quickly mounted a Gi/9 antipersonnel laser cannon on the sail barge's railing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nikto then opened fire on the skiff, which knocked Lando Calrissian\u2014an ally of Skywalker's who had been disguised as one of Jabba's men\u2014and the skiff's helmsman, Vedain, overboard. Calrissian took hold of the skiff and survived, but the helmsman tumbled into the maw of the sarlacc. Vizam continued firing on the skiff, allowing Skywalker to deflect one of the bolts from the Nikto's turret into the jetpack of bounty hunter Boba Fett, incapacitating Fett and contributing in no small part to the hunter's fall into the sarlacc below. Vizam's assault eventually caused the vehicle to drop on one side, after which Skywalker climbed aboard the sail barge and slashed Vizam with his lightsaber, killing him.

Vizam enjoyed grisly executions more than most. When the slave girl Oola was being eaten by the rancor, the Nikto chose to move closer to the rancor's pit and watch while bobbing up and down. The disruption of the execution at the Pit of Carkoon spoiled Vizam's day and he began firing from the deck enthusiastically in order try and bring things back under control and earn Jabba's respect. The Nikto was so intent on firing at the skiff that he did not notice Skywalker boarding the sail barge until it was too late."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vizam manned a laser cannon while aboard Jabba's sail barge.

The character was created for the film through the combined efforts of Phil Tippett's creature design team and Nilo Rodis-Jamero's costume design team. During production of the film, Vizam was known as \"Nikto #4\" and dressed in a costume designed to be similar to some of the other skiff guards. A sketch of Vizam's costume was drawn by Tippett."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vizam costume consisted of a navy undergarment covered by a brown kimono and then a quilted yellow tabard, as well as white pants, gray vambraces, and a soft hat made of brown-and-gray fabric. The costume's wrist guards were made of plastic, and the cotton jersey that served as the undergarment was dyed navy and smocked to give the clothing a loose, bunched appearance on the arms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the new Star Wars canon, the character was first identified by name in 2016 in the nineteenth issue of the Star Wars Helmet Collection magazine produced by De Agostini. That name originated in Star Wars Legends through Decipher, Inc.'s Star Wars Customizable Card Game, where it appeared on the \"Vizam\" card in the 1998 Jabba's Palace Limited set. The 2018 reference book Star Wars: Complete Vehicles uses Vizam's character design for the majority of guards on board the Khetanna."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
