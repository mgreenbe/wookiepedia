As BlasTech weapons increasingly showed up in Rebel hands during the Galactic Civil War, the corporation was quick to show its loyalty to the throne by offering the Empire a well-designed weapon. Imperial models were mired with defective prismatic crystals, however, which seriously impaired the finished KK-5's performance. Even though BlasTech continued to produce their own models, this blaster never gained popularity, and production was curtailed at the end of the war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
