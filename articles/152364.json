It housed the Nightmare Squadron of T-65B X-wing starfighters, as well as a resident Alliance Special Operations team\u2014assets which were primarily used to conduct missions in adjacent sectors in order to avoid drawing Imperial attention to the presence of the Rebel base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Titan Base Special Operations team was captured by the Empire at some point following the Battle of Yavin and detained aboard the Corva sector Imperial military space station HM7-R, also known as \"the Hammer.\" Approximately two weeks later, Alliance Intelligence learned of the existence of Project Shell-cracker, an Imperial weapons initiative developing a small-scale bomber starship that could circumvent the deflector shields of large-scale Rebel targets such as bases and capital ships before delivering a payload of high-yield hull-shattering bombs. The prototype of the experimental starship had also been moved to the Hammer for end stage testing."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Operation: Shell Game"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alliance was determined to either retrieve the prototype of the starship or destroy it if capture proved impossible. However, the brief period of time during which the vessel was scheduled to be tested at the Hammer severely limited the ability of Titan Base, one of the closest Rebel bases to the Hammer, to mobilize its top operatives. As a result, a relatively untested team, consisting of Lieutenant Jaxon Brand; Ambassador Gorbek Fask; the spy Lelsk; the pilot Dero Jin; the commando Doleth Arnoko; and RA-7-D, a droid serving as an engineer and a saboteur, was recruited for the mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A two-hour trip aboard an Alliance transport took the Rebel team from a minor world's starport to the planet housing Titan Base. While waiting for their briefing to begin, the agents visited several locations within the base and conversed with the Alliance personnel therein. Eventually, the team was summoned to the Titan Base's command center, where the agents were briefed on their mission by the base's commander Elemack and other members of Titan Base's command structure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The team was then provided with a captured Imperial Survey Corps shuttle, The Emperor's Vision, as well as forged credentials that would allow the agents to infiltrate the Hammer. In addition, the astromech droid R2-M5 accompanied the team in order to hide Titan Base's location in the shuttle's navicomputer as a precaution against Imperial inspection. Finally, the Rebel team traveled to the Hammer's system, the group's departure from Titan Base coinciding with that of Nightmare Squadron, which would serve as the team's escort during the mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The only inhabitants on the planet housing Titan Base were the military base's personnel, which consisted of its command staff, pilots, ground troops, mechanics, and droids.
