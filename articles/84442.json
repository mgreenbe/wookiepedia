He was in some way a mean and rude racer, not willing to give an autoprint and wouldn't give out information easily to anyone, he was looked down by Jonra Far because he only raced for credits. He was known to have the second best swoop track record on Onderon, behind Jonra Far. That was until Surik beat his time, after she had beaten Panar's twice. When Surik beat his time he still believed that he was better then her. When Surik defeated Jonra Far's new recent record, he had a strong belief that she was cheating."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
