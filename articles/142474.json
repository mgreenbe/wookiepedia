The theme features many different sections of the LSO and contains references to \"Across the Stars\" and \"Binary Sunset.\" The theme appears in the films Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, the video game expansion pack Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns, the video games Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, and Star Wars: Republic Commando, and the massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies. The theme is mainly polyphonic, is in the key of A minor before it modulates to C major, has a tempo of 88 bpm, and a duple meter with a time signature of 4/4. The sheet music for the piece was included in the Attack of the Clones music book.

It then rushes into a frantic percussion part with accented bursts by the brass. This leads into a fast-paced brass part accented in the background by short bursts of strings. Next the theme goes into a heavily accented phrase played mainly by brass instruments, which is followed by a descending low brass phrase. The main melody is played once again, this time going back and forth from the trumpets to the low brass and back to the trumpets. The low brass then plays two sets of two notes that are slurred together. This is complemented by a trumpet part consisting of a three note phrase that repeats twice. The main melody is then again played by the trumpets. The low brass then repeats the sets of slurs, this time to a much faster, more complicated trumpet part. The low brass then play a complicated rythym with trumpets and strings playing in short bursts. After this, the french horns plays the main melody once again, with brass, woodwinds, and strings playing bursts in the background. The trumpets and percussion play in between the phrases that compose the melody.

Then the low brass and low strings play a bass melody, while the keyboard, percussion, and woodwinds play quick bursts. This is followed by another reference to \"Across the Stars\" by the strings, and then the french horns.
