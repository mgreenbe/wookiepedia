lyrics are surprisingly accurate even though the song was released before the movie. According to Yankovic, everything was gleaned through Internet spoilers. Yankovic paid $500 to view an advance screening after writing the song, but most of his lyrics were correct, so he made minor changes; the only major change he had to make after the screening of The Phantom Menace was that Anakin did not tell Amidala that he was going to marry her, like Yankovic originally thought."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The main inaccuracy is that Obi-Wan stayed at the queen's royal starship after their arrival on Tatooine, rather than going with Qui-Gon and Padm\u00e9 to search for a new part for the ship. Thus, he didn't witness the podrace firsthand, and didn't meet Anakin until he arrived at the starship with the rest of the group."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Music video"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The video begins in a desert, supposedly on the planet Tatooine. Yankovic, dressed like Ewan McGregor's Kenobi, walks until he finds Darth Sidious playing the piano. Yankovic uses the Force to pick up a steel guitar, and in the second verse he reappears performing in a Mos Eisley cantina look-alike where he leads a band likewise dressed as Jedi. In the last verse, he returns to the desert, and in the last chorus, an entire crowd of \"Obi-Wans\" is shown singing, a possible reference to the Clone Wars that follow. Some Star Wars characters can be seen, like Yoda, Amidala and Mace Windu, dancing strangely. But Yoda does not move. The upper half of the pianist's face is always covered by the hood of the robe that he's wearing much like the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. When asked why, Al stated that \"They didn't want to scare small children,\" a reference to the playful bullying of Al's pianist, Rub\u00e9n Valtierra, commonly used in his live shows."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
