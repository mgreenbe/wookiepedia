Former smuggler Zeerid Korr owned twin BlasTech 4s that he carried in hip holsters, though he sometimes replaced them with an E-3 blaster worn in an ankle holster. While he was on his farm on the planet Dantooine in the year 3653 BBY, a BT7 Thunderstrike arrived at the farm. Korr thought that it was the criminal organization, the Exchange, coming to kill him for not completing obligations he had to them. He was carrying his E-3 blaster at the time, but wished that he was carrying his twin BlasTech 4s. However, it was in fact his friend and former Jedi Knight Aryn Leneer in the starship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The BlasTech 4 was mentioned in Paul S.
