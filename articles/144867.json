He offers her two golden, jewel-encrusted anklets, but Kneesaa declines, claiming that they are not hers. When Elbo recovers her real anklet, she accepts without inquiring about the other two, which touches Elbo.

Elbo then fished out a jewel-studded flute. When Latara asked what else was down there, Elbo fished out her wooden flute.

Seeking to rescue Latara, Teebo calls up a helpful fish. Kneesaa relates their plight to the helpful fish friend, who is aware of Elbo. He explains that Elbo tests creatures for greediness and honesty. If they fail, he takes them to his coral castle at the bottom of the sea. Teebo fears for Latara while Kneesaa says that they have got to save her.

As the crate dropped lower and lower, Wicket bluntly tells Teebo that he has no faith in Latara and suggests that he use their magic to escape.
