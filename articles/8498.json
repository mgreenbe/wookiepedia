While on the run in the jungle, the two Rebels found an aged clone trooper known as Able, who had survived on the planet for years after his ship crashed there during the Clone Wars. In order to secure Able's help, Narra encouraged Skywalker to use his lightsaber to convince the clone that the young Rebel was a Jedi Knight, and referred to him as \"General Skywalker\".
