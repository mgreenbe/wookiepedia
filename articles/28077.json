With the credits won from that, Clyngunn bought himself a star yacht and toured a variety of resort planets, but he soon found the life of a sports-star, with its never-ending parade of fans, to be boring, and he turned his back on that life."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The smuggler's life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Traveling to the Outer Rim, Clyngunn met the aging smuggler Billey, himself something of a legend amongst his fellows. It was through Billey that Clyngunn finally found something that offered the thrills and excitement the ZeHethbra was looking for: the life of a smuggler. Trading his yacht for a freighter, Clyngunn set about customizing it for speed, cargo concealment, and most importantly, combat readiness. He smuggled spice and guns. At one point, he was stopped by Imperial Customs forces, but was released due to his sports fame."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Primarily due to the fact that he preferred to work alone, Clyngunn did well for himself. Clyngunn didn't really like most other smugglers, as shown in his interview with the Imperial Security Bureau regarding BoShek.

Clyngunn joined Talon Karrde's Smugglers' Alliance to fight against Grand Admiral Thrawn. He did ensure to get Karrde's personal guarantee that he wouldn't be expected to change his attitude towards working on his own."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
