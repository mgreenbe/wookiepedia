But early in the reign of the new Empire the Imperial Navy blocked all the available routes to the Kel Dor world. The Sith then ordered that the best and brightest of Kel Dor offer their service to the Empire, or their people would suffer. As a result many Kel Dor entered the Imperial service, though the blockade remained in place. An alternate route, the Dorin Run, was eventually discovered by the smugglers, though it lay so close to the black holes, that all but the most reckless considered it too dangerous to use."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
