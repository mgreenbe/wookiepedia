Run by a woman named Mariana, the main clientele were wealthy Ussans. However, when the Galactic Empire took over the planet after the Clone Wars, the shop fell on hard times and the owner agreed to take in sewing work from the Empire. Most of the Bellassan customers boycotted the shop, which remained nearly empty on most days. However, it was receiving plenty of business doing sewing and tailoring of uniforms for the Imperial garrison and Imperial Prison on Ussa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The shop was located across the street from the Olin and Lands agency and Dorma's Cafe.
