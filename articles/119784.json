What he did not know was that the real Osh Scal was not present with him, but a disguised Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was trying to hide the information of the Skywalker twins' birth from the Sith. But Kenobi's disguise didn't work for long, and Sancor pulled a blaster on him. He ran out of the records office with a crucial record disk and led Kenobi into a large, dimly lit medical theater. In the theater, Sancor attacked the Jedi with a wrist rocket, but it missed and hit the operating platform he was standing on. The platform collapsed and Sancor fell off onto a table covered with sharp medical instruments, killing himself. It was because of this that Vader did not become aware of his son and daughter, who had both been hidden from him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sancor was a small humanoid with beady eyes, long fingers, and a pair of antennae that twitched whenever he was irritated.
