He was the brigadier of the mercenary group Rusher's Brigade which operated in the Grumani sector during the New Sith Wars. During his youth, he had worked as a mercenary under the banner of Beld Yulan, a respected independent military operator who adhered to a military code developed by the Sith Lord Mandragall which emphasized autonomy and mutual cooperation. After Yulan joined the Sith Lord Odion's nihilistic death cult following the death of his children and began to send his men on suicide missions, Rusher parted company with his mentor. Jarrow Rusher gradually assumed the rank of Brigadier and then started his own independent mercenary operation, which became known as Rusher's Brigade and operated from the modified starliner Diligence. Rusher would work for several different Sith Lords throughout his career and earned a reputation for his efficiency and reliability."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1032 BBY, Rusher became caught up in a scheme by the Sith Lord Daiman to lure his estranged older brother Odion into a trap on Gazzari. Rusher agreed to take part in the operation and planted an ambush on the volcanic planet. During the subsequent battle, Rusher's forces sustained heavy casualties after Odion deployed his mobile siege weapon known as the Death Spiral. While on Gazzari, Rusher also crossed paths with the Jedi Knight Kerra Holt, who was operating as a \"Knight Errant\" in Sith Space. After much cajoling, she convinced him to take a thousand student refugees that she had rescued on Gazzari. These refugees had been sent to the planet by Daiman as bait, under the pretext that he wanted to purchased an arxeum\u2014a mobile war museum\u2014from the Quermian Sith Lord Ayanos Bactra, the ruler of the Bactranate which had substantial corporate holdings. Daiman had offered in return to provide these students for the arxeum. In reality, this had only been a ruse to lure Odion to Gazzari where Daiman planned to kill him in retaliation for the destruction of the Black Fang research facility on Darkknell."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the end, Rusher reluctantly took Kerra's students and fled into hyperspace on the Diligence. Meanwhile, Odion and Daiman turned on Bactra and invaded the Bactranate, after receiving orders from their grandmother and Calimondra family matriarch Vilia Calimondra, who felt that Bactra had outlived his usefulness. Following an acrimonious and strenuous journey, the Diligence finally arrived at Byllura, an apparently pleasant world where Rusher had hoped to drop the students. However, the planet was part of the Dyarchy, a Sith dynasty ruled by the twin Sith Lords Quillan and Dromika. The true power behind the throne was their Regent Saaj Calician who had used their Force powers to mentally enthrall his subjects. Kerra and Rusher successfully resisted attempts by the Dyarchy to assimilate them, setting the stage for a climatic confrontation at the Loft, the nerve center of the Dyarchy. In the end, Kerra kidnapped Quillan and escaped aboard the Diligence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Dyarchy was then conquered by the female Sith Lord Arkadia Calimondra, the twin's older sister and the ruler of the Arkadianate. Arkadia was warm and hospitable towards Rusher and Kerra, offering to give the crew and passengers aboard the Diligence shelter within her realm. After traveling to her capital world of Syned, Arkadia took Rusher and Kerra on a tour of her city Calimondretta as part of a propaganda effort to convince them that she was a benevolent Sith ruler who had forged an enlightened society built on rotating people through different jobs through their lives. She initially won Rusher over through her charismatic personality and offer to take the student refugees aboard the Diligence. Since she did not need the services of mercenaries, Arkadia had also promised to give Rusher safe passage out of her territory. While Rusher was open to such a deal, the Jedi Kerra was suspicious of Arkadia, suspecting rightfully that she had ulterior motives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kerra's suspicions were proven right when Arkadia tried to recruit the Jedi to assassinate her grandmother Vilia. When Kerra refused, Arkadia had her imprisoned. She then reiterated her demand that Rusher bring the refugees over to her in return for being given hyperspace coordinates leading out of the Arkadianate. In reality, Arkadia had planned to kill Rusher and his mercenaries by sending them to the Nakrikal Singularity, a black hole. However, Rusher and Kerra were saved by the Bothan spy Narsk Ka'hane, who was secretly working for Vilia. In return for being given hyperspace coordinates into neutral space, Ka'hane convinced Rusher to work against Arkadia in order to create a diversion that would allow him to escape the Arkadianate with Quillan. As agreed, Rusher hijacked an icecrawler and used it to infiltrate Calimondretta, before attacking the fortress from within."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Ka'hane rescued Kerra from her prison and then escaped to Vilia's planet with Quillan. After using the Diligence to destroy Arkadia's massed fleet and tractor beam emitters by dropping its massive cargo assembly arms on them, Rusher rescued Kerra, who was engaged in a lightsaber duel against Arkadia. He used one of his artillery cannons to fire a precision shot at Arkadia's museum, creating a hole in the dome which allowed the Jedi woman to escape. After rescuing Kerra and bringing her aboard the Diligence, Rusher also evacuated 500 defecting Arkadianate citizens. Having escaped the Arkadianate into hyperspace, Rusher reconciled his earlier differences with Kerra and developed a closer friendship with the young Jedi woman, promising to help her out in the future by giving discounted trips.

During that period in galactic history, large areas of the galaxy were controlled by various Sith warlords while the Galactic Republic had been reduced to a rump state around the Galactic Core. Rusher grew up in one of the systems ruled by the Sith Lord Mandragall. Unlike his contemporaries, Mandragall had extensive knowledge of ancient Sith history and used this knowledge to devise a new military model. Citing Elcho Kressh's historic precedent of recruiting armies by absorbing individuals with different skills from outside cultures, Mandragall forged a polyglot army consisting of pirates, mercenaries, and alien species that held a grudge against the Republic and his Sith rivals. By the height of his rule, more than three-fourths of Mandragall's armed forces consisted of independent operators, who had fled enslavement by other Sith Lords. Most of these were willing to fight under Mandragall's banner in exchange for autonomy and getting access to recruits and resources."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1052 BBY, the female Sith Lord Xelian\u2014the mother of Lords Odion and Daiman\u2014conspired against Mandragall by seducing him and then killing him. However, Mandragall's vaunted army proved ephemeral due to its unique composition and none of his rivals were able to seize control of his armed forces. Rusher lived during the Mandragall era and was greatly influence by Mandragall's military strategies and tactics. At some point, Rusher became a mercenary under the Tarro mercenary commander Beld Yulan, who operated from the starship Perspicacity. Beld Yulan had previously served under the Mandragall's banner and was strongly influenced by his ideals. Besides developing a reputation as an effective commander, Yulan also became known for taking good care of his men. Under Yulan's tutelage, Rusher developed an interest in military history and came to respect the older man as a mentor. However, Yulan descended into a great depression following the deaths of his children, who had succumbed to the Candorian plague on Fostin Nine. Following an encounter with a female Claimer, Yulan subsequently underwent a secret \"religious conversion\" and became an Odionite, a follower of the nihilistic Sith Lord Odion who glorified death and destruction as a solution to the pain of existence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yulan's conversion led him to cease caring for his men and sending them on suicide missions with more soldiers being left behind each time. Rusher left Yulan's mercenary group after the latter announced that the brigade would be taking an assignment from Odion. For Rusher, this confirmed his suspicions that his formerly beloved mentor had embraced Odion's nihilistic doctrine. Rusher then established his own mercenary group called Rusher's Brigade, which would be employed by several different Sith warlords in the Grumani sector. As the leader of Rusher's Brigade, Rusher held the position of brigadier and operated from the modified troopship Diligence. The Diligence had previously been the Devaronian cruiser liner Vichary Telk which had been modified into a troopship. It was mounted on top of a superstructure that bridged two massive cargo pod clusters. Each of these modules faced outwards in four directions, allowing them to hold several cannons. Ryland Dackett served as the shipmaster of the Diligence. By the time of the Chelloan affair in 1032 BBY, Rusher's Brigade had grown to approximately three thousand personnel."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Daimanate"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The new recruit"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1032 BBY, Jarrow Rusher visited Darkknell, the capital of the Daimanate\u2014the fiefdom of the Sith Lord Daiman. Daiman was one of the Sith warlords that emerged in the Grumani sector following the death of the Sith Lord Chagras in 1040 BBY. His death marked the collapse of the short\u2013lived Chagras Hegemony and led to a series of family feuds known as the Second Charge Matrica. The Calimondra family matriarch Vilia Calimondra did nothing to mediate these conflicts between her grandchildren but instead encouraged them as a means of preserving her own rule."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Daiman carved up an autocratic fiefdom that was run according to his own personal philosophy. The narcissistic Sith Lord saw himself as the Creator of the universe and believed that all other sentient beings were soulless automatons created to carry out his bidding. Daiman had an acrimonious relationship with his Sith neighbors particularly his estranged older brother Odion, who had styled himself as the Destroyer of the Universe. Throughout the Republic Dark Age, the Grumani sector remained in a constant state of warfare and borders frequently changed hands. During these years, Rusher's Brigade would take jobs as mercenaries from several of these Sith warlords. Despite profiteering from the Sith's endless wars, Rusher was careful to make sure that his Brigade remained independent of Sith control."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rusher's Brigade had visited the planet because they needed to purchase six new hydraulic drives for the Diligence's offloading lift assemblies. These massive hydraulic accumulators enabled starships to lift-off planetary locations prior to embarking on their travels. Rusher and his helmsman Ryland Dackett visited Lubboon's Plasteelworks in Xakrea, Darkknell's largest city and Daiman's capital. Lubboon's Plasteelworks was a key supplier of starship components to the Daimanate. Lubboon was a Duros administrator and was the first Duros to manage the factory's operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During that meeting, Lubboon and his wife took that opportunity to recruit and train his son Beadle Lubboon as a mercenary. Like many Daimanites, they had become dissatisfied with Daiman's autocratic rule and wanted a better life for their son outside his job as a laborer.

Rusher also claimed that his operation had no shipboard fatalities due to a policy banning any Sith from his troopship Diligence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the meeting, Beadle himself entered the room having finished his work shift. To the embarrassment of his parents, Beadle leaned against a cart carrying several pails of dirty water which toppled over. During the ensuing mess, Beadle ended up with a barrel stuck to his head. For Rusher and Dackett, Beadle's clumsiness gave them a poor first impression of the Duros youth's capabilities. Dackett silently whispered to Rusher that it would be best for the Duros youth to be assigned to the headquarters unit, which was considered to be a soft posting. Rusher concluded that Beadle would probably be lucky not to take out an entire ammo magazine. After Beadle had extricated himself from the mess, Rusher explained to Beadle that war was not a \"talent show.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After receiving assurances that his son's well being would be looked after, Lubboon Senior allowed Rusher to enlist his son as a new recruit in Rusher's Brigade. Rusher then returned to his task of purchasing new hydraulic accumulator units from Lubboon Senior's plasteelworks. However, Administrator Lubboon was unable to sell the technology to Rusher since all produce at his factory was only sold to Daiman. Rusher was able to negotiate their purchase by claiming that as a mercenary he was indeed working for Daiman.

Despite the Duros' assurances that he was familiar with operating such machinery, Beadle did not fasten the heavy unit properly which caused one accumulator unit to break lose. After apologizing, the Duros youth went to a refresher unit to attend to his own needs.

However, Daiman's enemies\u2014his estranged older brother and Sith Lord Odion and the lone Jedi Knight Kerra Holt obtained intelligence on the Convergence project and sought to sabotage it.

Despite Narsk's denials, Daiman rightfully suspected that Odion had a role in the bombing and concocted a scheme to lure Odion into another trap on Gazzari. Daiman approached the Bactranate Quermian Sith Lord Ayanos Bactra with an offer to buy an arxeum\u2014a mobile university dedicated to war research\u2014from Industrial Heuristics.

Bactra agreed to deliver the arxeum and the students to the volcanic world of Gazzari, on the frontier of Daiman's border with the Odionate\u2014Odion's territory.

Besides Rusher, other militia leaders who were summoned to this brief included Mak Medagazy, Kr'saang the Togorian, and a Nosaurian mercenary. Due to the nature of their work, many of these mercenaries had fought against each other at different times. Since Daiman was still meeting with Bactra, the militia leaders waited in the palace's lobby. While waiting for Daiman, the mercenaries chatted about Daiman's rivalry with Odion and his decision to employ their services rather than fighting Odion's forces one on one. Rusher also witnessed Narsk being wheeled out in his torture wheel but took no interest initially since he felt that this matter did not concern him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his second meeting, Daiman outlined his plans to trap Odion on Gazzari. As part of the plan, the mercenary battalions would depart Darkknell at sunset, each making hyperspace jumps to different destinations. In four standard days, they would reassemble on Gazzari. On Gazzari, the mercenaries would assemble their forces including several large artillery cannons around a massive caldera and await Odion's arrival. As planned, Bactra's arxeum and the student transports would land within the caldera. Odion's forces would then invade Gazzari and the mercenaries would use their firepower hold them at bay until Daiman's regular forces arrived from hyperspace.

He then ordered his aide Uleeta to send several Correctors to appropriate Kr'saang's shock troopers and his ship, the Dar'oosh, making them a part of his slave army. Rusher was the second dissenting voice and objected to Daiman's idea of using the young students on ethical grounds. When Daiman demanded to know his identity, Rusher complied but also reiterated that he was an independent operator. Enraged, Daiman began Force-choking the brigadier.

Kerra agreed but added that she usually saved planets. Rusher personally thought that Kerra's remarks confirmed his initial suspicions that she was crazy. Seeing reason in Kerra's stance, Rusher complied with her wishes and ordered the navigator to ignore Daiman's orders and plot a way out of the Gazzari system. Since they lacked any access to reliable hyperspace routes due to the disruption of hyperspace relays in much of the wider galaxy, they had to travel to the nearest terrestrial planet: Byllura. They needed to fly to another location where the Diligence could receive repairs and their ammunition and munitions stocks could be replenished. Due to the heavy losses on Gazzari, Rusher also needed to recruit more mercenaries. Following the battle, Vilia arranged for a bequest and assigned Narsk to work for another one of her grandchildren: the female Sith Lord Arkadia Calimondra. She knew about Kerra's movements since Narsk's stolen stealth suit automatically connected to her information system whenever it was disconnected."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The voyage to Byllura would last several days and would be remembered by Rusher as a stressful and hectic experience throughout his career. To cope with the increased stress, Rusher took to drinking lum ale, an alcoholic beverage.

Rusher was too exhausted by the battle to deal with these problems and fell asleep, leaving Kerra and the Duros recruit Beadle Lubboon to manage the problem. Most of the crew were hostile and indifferent to the newcomers. Meanwhile, the grievously-wound shipmaster Dackett underwent surgery to removed his infected left arm and to replace it with a set of prosthetics. Thus, Kerra was forced to recruit some of the older students to help attend to the younger refugees' needs. Kerra's problems were compounded by the lack of adequate numbers of refreshers since the former liner had been designed for male Devaronians. The diverse interspecies mix of the student body also proved volatile due to the vast physiological and cultural differences between certain species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After recovering from his earlier battle experiences, Rusher began compiling an inventory of the casualties that Rusher's Brigade had sustained during the Gazzari trap.

The laser-equipped Team Ripper was re-equipped and re-staffed with personnel from Coyn'skar while Team Zhaboka would serve as the missile battalion. This marked a historic precedent since Rusher had not commanded such few numbers throughout his entire career. Ripper and Zhaboka each had one side of the ship's two main extension cargo ramps to themselves.

While the Diligence still had enough food stocks, supplies were running low and Dackett stressed that even rationing would not work due to the large number of refugees. Unlike other mercenaries, the students had nothing to give to augment the existing stocks aboard the ship. Both men agreed that they needed to find a place to dump the refugees, with Rusher toying with the ideas of releasing them through the airlock or poisoning them. Dackett also expressed his bitterness towards the new Duros recruit Lubboon for accidentally crushing his foot during the rescue attempt on Gazzari. Rusher defended the Duros by stressing that he had saved Dackett's life. As shipmaster, Dackett then emphasized the growing tensions between the members of Rusher's Brigade and the newcomers.

Annoyed at the Jedi's requests, Rusher excused himself to the refresher in the adjacent room on the pretext that he needed to relieve himself. However, the refresher was actually a service access-way leading to a ladder which eventually led to a wardroom. For the next three hours, Rusher entertained his own men by re-telling a story about an old battle. When Kerra found out about his ruse, she confronted him while wielding his walking stick. During a walk in the corridors, Rusher asked her about her business in Sith Space and she talked about her work under her Jedi Master Vannar Treece.

Rusher also revealed that the Diligence had made six hyperspace jumps since their departure from Gazzari but still had not found a single suitable port.

Since the Republic had shut down all subspace communications relays in Sith Space, there was a lack of reliable information on safe hyperspace routes throughout much of the galaxy. After reading through a list of hyperspace routes listed in a holographic display, Rusher found one leading to Byllura, a purportedly unaligned planet.

Byllura was the main territory of the Dyarchy, a Sith realm that was the home of Quillan and Dromika, the younger children of the late Chagras, the former ruler of the Chagras Hegemony. These two Sith twins had a powerful affinity with the Force; with Quillan having a powerful farsight ability while Dromika could send out strong hypnotic commands that would compel other sentients to do her bidding.

Calician suspected that this was a Daimanate trick and quickly dispatched a contingent of Unifiers to investigate the Diligence under direct orders from Dromika, who was in turn being telepathically controlled by her twin brother Quillan.

In response, Jarrow dropped an anchor on the Trandoshan, sparking a vicious battle in the spaceport. When Rusher tried to have the Diligence lift off, the Unifiers attacked by trying to jump onto the vessel and slash at its hull with their lightsaber-batons.

After stealing Arkadia's lightsaber, Kerra then managed escaped to Syned's surface but fell unconscious due to fatigue and the thin amount of oxygen in the atmosphere."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While scouting the battlefield, Rusher found an unconscious Kerra and personally carried her to the Diligence and brought her into the medical bay. The Diligence's mercenary crew and passengers were also joined by around five hundred Arkadianite laborers wanting to defect to the Republic. One of these refugees was the Twi'lek Warmalo, the supply clerk who had earlier helped Rusher restock the Diligence's food supplies before being promoted to a metallurgist. However, Warmalo did not regard this as a promotion. He and the other refugees resented Arkadia's policy of continually rotating her subjects through different jobs to preserve her grip on power."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Parting as friends"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Kerra regained consciousness, Rusher explained that the Jedi woman had gone on a long walk without her spacesuit. He then explained how he had destroyed Arkadia's museum with a precision shot in order to enable Kerra to escape. Rusher then recounted the details of their escape from Calimondretta including how he had used a hijacked icecrawler as a trojan horse. For Rusher, the assault on Calimondretta marked the first time that his forces had ever been deployed inside a building. He also explained that the attack had been used to coerce Arkadia into giving up Kerra or enabling her to escape. Rusher then recounted how he had personally carried Kerra back to his ship, adding the comment that she was heavier than she looked due to her muscular frame. Due to his bad leg, Rusher had to use Arkadia's stolen twin-bladed lightsaber as a makeshift walking stick in order to maintain a perfect lurch ratio for that mission. During an earlier argument, Kerra had broken his original walking stick."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jarrow Rusher also mentioned to Kerra that her student refugees had been rejoined by several hundred Arkadianate defectors. Rusher also related how their attack had destroyed part of Arkadia's neurotoxin operation, sabotaging her efforts to launch an expansionist campaign in the event that her grandmother was assassinated. Since Rusher's Brigade had used up all their ammunition and left behind their cannons, there was now enough space to accommodate approximately 2,200 refugees. Since Rusher had shed the cargo pod clusters, the Diligence was back to being a spaceliner again for the moment. While Rusher's engineer was unhappy with damage wrought on the starship during the fighting, Rusher was happy that they had managed to escape with the rest of the ship still intact."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finally, Rusher revealed that they were now using hyperspace coordinates given to them by Narsk to travel back to the Galactic Republic. Earlier, the Bothan spy had scrawled half of these coordinates on Rusher's arm and the other half on Kerra's arm. Unlike Arkadia's coordinates, Narsk's ones led to a jump-point in neutral space which led to a hyperspace route which led directly to the Republic. Upon reaching the Republic, Rusher planned to disembark the refugees who would then be resettled in \"greener pastures.\" Rusher also planned to embark on a spending spree in the Republic in order to upgrade the ship's systems and to recruit more mercenaries and materiel in order to rebuild his mercenary operation. In return, Kerra shared with Rusher the top-secret information she had learned from Arkadia about the Calimondra family and the Second Charge Matrica. Kerra got Rusher to provide her with a recorder in return for using her connections to arrange for the Brigadier to have an audience with Supreme Chancellor Genarra."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rusher also joked that he hoped that he could barter the information for enough funds to refit the Diligence with four new cargo clusters instead of two. The mood among the refugees had cheered after news of their final journey to the Republic was announced. Kerra reported that the Sullustan Tan was so excited that she had been unable to sleep. Rusher also shared with Kerra that the Duros recruit Lubboon along with several of the former student refugees were keen to remain aboard the Diligence as members of Rusher's Brigade. Many wanted to join the mercenary force as a means of liberating their families from Sith rule in the future. Kerra also shared with Rusher on how she had evacuated 63,000 refugees during the Chelloan affair. As a gesture of goodwill, Rusher finally offered to drop Kerra off on Tramanos on their way to the Republic so that she could continue her mission. He also remarked that should the Jedi woman ever choose to hire the Diligence, he might cut her a reduced rate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For Lord Arkadia, Rusher's attack on Calimondretta had dealt a death blow to her ambitions of killing her grandmother and exploiting the crisis to further her own ambitions. Due to the extensive damage to her capital city, Arkadia had also been forced to recall significant forces from Byllura to rebuild and garrison Calimondretta. As a final insult, the Sith Lord had also lost her prized double-bladed lightsaber. Meanwhile, Narsk made it back safely to Vilia's planet where he received treatment for his ears which had been damaged by the acceleration of the shuttle's engines. The failure of Arkadia's assassination conspiracy preserved the status quo in the Grumani Sector with Vilia remaining in her managerial role as the Sith family matriarch. Vilia also assumed custody of both Quillan and Dromika, with the latter being spirited away from Byllura by two of Vilia's other agents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jarrow Rusher had a fiercely independent streak and lacked any true allegiances to any of the major powers during the Republic Dark Age. As brigadier, he was an effective commander who was well respected by his crew. Despite his willingness to work for any party, Rusher also adhered to some basic moral standards. He objected to the Sith Lord Daiman using children as bait during the Battle of Gazzari. During the fighting, he warned his mercenaries not to target the children on pain of death. Despite these positive traits, Rusher had a fierce temper and was also prone to alcoholism in times of stress."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout his career as a mercenary, Rusher saw himself as an independent military operator. While he worked for several Sith warlords in the Grumani sector, Rusher did not see himself as a Sith. In fact, Rusher personally detested any Sith due to their volatile and aggressive nature. While Rusher was willing to work for the Sith in return for being paid, he was unwilling to allow any Sith adepts on his troopship Diligence in order to protect the safety of his crew. He was a firm adherent of Telettoh's maxim, an ancient Republic Navy protocol dating back to the Jedi Civil War which prohibited any Republic naval personnel from carrying Sith passengers aboard their vessels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Initially, Rusher also disliked the Jedi for their idealism and dualistic worldview which clashed with his relativist outlook. Rusher had a difficult and volatile relationship with the Jedi Knight Kerra Holt, and the two often argued on several different occasions. Rusher initially resented Kerra for bringing a thousand student refugees aboard his ship which created a serious logistical problem for his crew. Rusher was also annoyed by Kerra's demands that the student refugees be evacuated to the Republic due to the difficulties of navigating through Sith Space. Rusher and Kerra also disagreed on the former's decision to accept the \"enlightened\" Sith Lord Arkadia's offer to shelter the student refugees. Despite Rusher's dislike of the Sith, he did not share the Jedi view that all Sith were malevolent and destructive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his initial animosity towards Kerra, Rusher came to grudgingly respect the Jedi woman for her perseverance and uncompromising dedication to her cause and values. When Kerra was imprisoned by Arkadia, he was concerned enough to help the Bothan spy Narsk Ka'hane break her out of prison. His decision to cooperate with Ka'hane and turn against Arkadia ultimately saved the lives of both Rusher and his crew since Arkadia had provided them with rogue hyperspace coordinates leading to a black hole.
