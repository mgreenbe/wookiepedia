Vehicle operators not wishing to guide their vehicles themselves had the option to relinquish control to the Traffic Central computers by selecting the \"autocontrol\" feature on the vehicle's guidance panel. Traffic Central employed and monitored multiple automatic safety systems throughout the city's travel corridors. In problematic traffic situations, the agency could cease the movement of all computer-automated vehicles, along with vehicles operating in \"autocontrol\" mode by initiating the Traffic Central Override command."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
