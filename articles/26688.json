Lacking the Jedi Order to guide them, Force-sensitives wander the galaxy, persecuted by the Empire and vulnerable to the lure of the dark side, searching for the remnants of Jedi teaching that are scattered across the stars. In Chronicles of the Gatekeeper, the holocron of a mysterious, vanished Jedi Knight surfaces. Its Gatekeeper offers to instruct you in an incredible Force power, if you're willing to follow where the holocron leads. But great power is always a double-edged blade, and this power is great enough to corrupt even the most stalwart soul."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This 96-page, beautifully illustrated book introduces locations throughout the Star Wars galaxy, a new playable species, and a wide range of adversaries from local matriarchs and Clone Wars-era droids to sadistic criminals and vicious wild beasts.
