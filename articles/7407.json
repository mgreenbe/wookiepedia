Despite a Roshu Sune terrorist bombing campaign in the final months before the eruption of the Clone Wars, Gotal loyalists, shored up by the Republic, managed to retain power. However, shortly after the First Battle of Geonosis in the year 22 BBY, the moon fell to Separatist forces, and for a brief period, became a headquarters for its leader, Count Dooku. As a result, Antar 4 became a political imbroglio that spawned one of the first resistance groups, made up of loyalist Koorivar and Gotals whom the Republic supported with tactical advisers and secret shipments of arms and materiel. Though the resistance was successful in carrying out hundreds of acts of sabotage, the moon remained under Separatist control for the conflict's duration."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the war, in 18 BBY, Moff Wilhuff Tarkin of the Galactic Empire, the Republic's successor, was ordered to make an example of Antar 4 for supporting the Confederacy of Independent Systems as a warning to former Separatists. No attempt was to be made at repatriation, nor was he to waste time sorting Separatists from resistance fighters and intelligence operatives waiting to be exfiltrated to safety. Instead, many Koorivar and Gotal loyalists were swept up in the ensuing arrests, executions, and massacres that came to be known as the Antar Atrocity. As a result of its actions on Antar 4, former Republic Intelligence captain Berch Teller, who lost many operatives in the Imperial reprisal, created a rebel cell to combat the Empire within a year of the attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Antar 4 was the homeworld of the sentient Gotal species.
