After the rival trading concerns the Corsignis Property Alliance and the Jon-Tow Economic Development Group blockaded Pinett as a result of a dispute, Taakses became the leader of the Pinett Freedom Force, a protest group that campaigned against the blockade. The Freedom Force attempted to prevent Corsignis and Jon-Tow from landing on Pinett and Taakses went on a hunger strike, as an act of protest.
