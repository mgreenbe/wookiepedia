Most organisms could not survive in the vacuum of space, although there were exceptions, such as the neebray and purrgil. The Givin were also able to survive for a short while in vacuum. Some equipment could allow other organisms to survive in a vacuum, including vacuum-sealed armors like stormtrooper armor, phase I clone trooper armor, and Vader's armor, or breathing apparatus like the A99 aquata breather. One form of execution was to jettison an individual into the vacuum of space, which Admiral Jhared Montferrat used to kill a group of captives he suspected of being Rebel spies. The archaeologist Doctor Aphra asked to veto being jettisoned into a vacuum as a method of execution if the Sith Lord Darth Vader chose to kill her. The power of the Force could allow one to survive for a time in a vacuum, though they might still need serious medical attention afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
