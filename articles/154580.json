The man attended the First Republic Medical Academy of Coruscant, the University of Coruscant's medical program, alongside a xenopathology student named Archiban Kimble, and the man's medical skills and intelligence were notoriously poor. However, the individual was able to graduate from the University despite barely passing his final exams and remained on the Republic's capital planet of Coruscant, eventually developing a cure for a minor flesh-eating virus known as Zabrak Scalp Necrosis. The fame that the achievement brought him saw the doctor appointed as acting head of the Republic Health Administration, something that Kimble believed was only possible because the man had bribed his way to the position."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The doctor was first mentioned in the conversation \"Opportunity Knocks\" with the Jedi Knight class' companion character Kimble, who goes by the name \"Doc\" in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.
