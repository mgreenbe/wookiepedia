It had a large, broad head, with its front mostly taken up by a pair of bright orange photoreceptors and a cluster of aerials on top, further augmented by two sensor arrays rising behind from the back of the shoulders. It also boasted more dexterous hands than standard super battle droids, with three long, slender fingers and an opposable thumb, and its twin blasters were mounted on the right shoulder rather than the wrist."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Separatists deployed these droids in the testing of swamp gas on Ohma-D'un.
