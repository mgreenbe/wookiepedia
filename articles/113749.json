In the war's final year, Remy accompanied the two Jedi to the Outer Rim world Ragmar V, which was considered a vital staging planet for a planned Republic attack on a Confederate base. After arriving in Ragmar V's orbit, Remy, Sah, and a squad of clone troopers traveled down to the planet's surface in order to capture a settlement for use as a base. As Remy, Sah, and their soldiers confronted the nearby settlement's leader, Remy received a directive from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine commanding him to execute Order 66, which labeled the Jedi Knights as traitors of the Republic. Remy and his forces immediately attacked Sah, but both he and his troops were killed in the ensuing skirmish with the settlement's villagers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A clone of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett, one clone trooper sergeant received the nickname \"Remy\" at some point during his life. Remy served in the Galactic Republic's Grand Army during the Clone Wars, which began on Geonosis in 22 BBY. He was eventually placed under the command of Jedi General Sev and his Padawan, Joc Sah. In 19 BBY, Remy traveled with Sev and Sah to the Outer Rim planet Ragmar V, which was viewed as an essential staging planet that the Republic needed for a planned assault on a Confederate base. Remy accompanied Sah and a squad of clone troopers aboard a Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunship, landing on a cliff near a settlement. After disembarking the ship, Remy informed Sah that the village was populated. When the gunship was destroyed by a rocket coming from the village soon thereafter, Sah ordered Remy to prepare to confront the villagers and descended the cliff in order to make it to the settlement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the soldiers arrived at the village, Sah ordered Remy to split up his troops and secure the village's flanks. However, during the subsequent exchange between Sah and the settlement's leader, Gaan, Remy was commanded by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to execute Order 66, directing him to treat Sah as an enemy of the Republic and to ensure his death. Remy immediately ordered the clones to direct their fire at the Jedi, who took cover in a nearby building. When Gaan, who wanted to kill the Jedi himself, shot one of the soldiers, Remy and his troops came under attack from the villagers. Sah and Gaan allied with each other to eliminate the clones, and Remy was shot and killed by the settlement's leader, ending the skirmish."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like most clone troopers, Remy was bred to be utterly loyal to the Republic and to follow his orders from superior officers.
