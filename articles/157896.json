It consisted of a holographic display of children from across the Galactic Republic, recorded performing a song over a twelve month period, and then combined into a single choir on a revolving stage. The song itself received a mixed reception due to its saccharine yet catchy lyrics, which proved to be an earworm to Republic Fair attendees such as Porter Engle. Children tended to respond better to the exhibit than their parents. When the Nihil attacked Valo and inflicted significant damage, United in Song continued to operate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
