They would handle various tasks ranging from ship security to planetary assistance and guarding planetary bases. They wore gray uniforms and black vests and characteristic helmets. There were variations on the basic uniform though. They would typically carry side arms, such as the DH-17 blaster pistol. When Tantive IV was captured by Vader's forces, most of the Alliance Fleet Regiment troops stationed aboard the ship were killed or captured defending it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
