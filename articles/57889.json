Gubacher specialized in artificial intelligence, and maintained a research and development lab within the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant, home of the Jedi Order and capital of the Republic. Gubacher worked closely with the Jedi, receiving the task of outfitting droids associated with the Order with modifications for certain missions after the start of the Clone Wars. As such, he designed droids for use in espionage and surveillance and ensured the Order's droids were kept in peak condition. The emergence of the Separatist threat saw the creation of the Republic's Strategic Advisory Cell, as well as the Cell's Special Weapons Group, which was tasked with developing advanced weapons for use in the Clone Wars. As a member of the Special Weapons Group, Gubacher signed the Official Secrets Oath, forbidding him from discussing the Group's projects with others, even the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Second Battle of Geonosis, which saw the Republic's capture of Geonosian archduke Poggle the Lesser, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine of the Republic presented schematics for a mobile battle station to the Strategic Advisory Cell during their second meeting. Poggle informed the Republic that Separatist leader Count Dooku had supplied his hive with the plans, who then went on to further refine them. Though the Geonosian claimed to have no knowledge of any Separatist battle station currently in development, most Advisory Cell members refused to believe this assertion, as intelligence believed the Separatists were indeed in the process of constructing their own battle station. Facing the threat of a potentially devastating Separatist weapon, the Republic set to work constructing their own, making use of the Separatist's schematics. To aid in the development of the station, Gubacher formed an artificial intelligence team which designed augmented overseer droids to manage the labor force working on the battle station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gubacher was one of 150 individuals to attend a Strategic Advisory Cell meeting in the Strategic Planning Amphitheater of the Republic Center for Military Operations on Coruscant.

Prior to their mission, the droid team, that was dubbed D Squad and placed under the command of Republic Colonel Meebur Gascon, visited Gubacher at his laboratory on Coruscant. The droids, R2-D2, M5-BZ, QT-KT, and U9-C4 were all taken in to recive generous upgrades to assist them on their mission, however the Pit droid WAC-47 was not to receive a single upgrade, as Gascon had made him the role of pilot. R2-D2 was given drastic improvements to his rocket thrusters, that would allow him to be more mobile in the air, and remain airborne for longer periods of time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gubacher gave QT-KT a deployable magnet, which could draw in potentially hazardous objects and nullify them. U9-C4 was given an energy weapon to use for defensive purposes. Finally, M5-BZ's memory bank was removed to make room for a mobile command center for the tiny Colonel Gascon, to allow him to remain undercover on his mission. Their upgrades complete, Gubacher sent D-Sqaud on it's way, but not before expressing giddy enthusiasm over each upgrade he gave, as well as sympathy for BZ's loss."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gubacher was still a member of the cell working on the Republic's battle station project when the Republic was swiftly transformed into the Galactic Empire by the once Supreme Chancellor turned Emperor Sheev Palpatine.
