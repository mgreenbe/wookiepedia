Following the Battle of Endor, when inmates overthrew their masters and took control of the planet, he voluntarily remained on the moon, believing that he still could make a difference in the lives of the criminals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He was a modest man who often described himself and his accomplishments in a self-deprecating fashion.
