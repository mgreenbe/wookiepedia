In 33 BBY, Choi volunteered to go as part of one of three Jedi task forces being sent to investigate Yinchorri aggression in the star systems neighboring their homeworld of Yinchorr. Choi was sent to the oceanic world of Yitheeth alongside a team consisting of himself, Fida, Tholothian Adi Gallia and Zabrak Eeth Koth; specifically to locate a Yinchorri compound on the planet. While on board a Consular-class cruiser, the four Jedi crash-landed on that world, to find that there was no such base on the planet. There was only a force of Yinchorri warriors there to ambush them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Choi and the other Jedi fought their way through the Yinchorri and find transport off the planet. The four Jedi then traveled to a nearby planet, Yibikkoror, where another of the task forces was carrying out a similar mission. The two groups of Jedi met and set a course to Yinchorr, where Jedi Masters Mace Windu, Qui-Gon Jinn, and Saesee Tiin, along with Jinn's Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi; were busy holding off a massive Yinchorri attack. Choi and the other Jedi joined the fight and, during the ensuing multi-planetary battle, Theen Fida was killed. Choi was greatly disturbed by the death of his Padawan. Because of this, when he caught a Devaronian associate of the Yinchorri army whom the Jedi had captured, smuggler Holmar Grahrk, trying to steal a Consular-class cruiser to escape Yinchorr, Choi approached him angrily and took him into custody. Choi later attended the funeral of his Padawan on the planet Coruscant\u2014where Fida was cremated alongside Micah Giiett and Lilit Twoseas, other Jedi who were killed during the excursion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly afterwards, Choi became a candidate for a seat within the Jedi High Council for his actions in the Yinchorri Uprising; he never got the chance to accept or refuse it, however, allowing him to maintain a lower profile in the first weeks of the Great Jedi Purge later on."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Choi went on to become a Jedi General in the newly-formed Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars between the Republic and a group of planets that wished to secede from the galactic government. He led a group of clone trooper pilots known as Red Squadron into battle alongside another Jedi, Aayla Secura, at the beginning of the war. Red Squadron fought in the First Battle of Kamino, when separatist forces attacked the Kaminoan cloning facility on the planet Kamino producing troops to bolster the Republic's army. The Jedi battle plan assigned Choi's squadron the task of taking on attacking Separatist starfighters in Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptors while Blue Squadron, under the command of now-Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, attacked incoming troop transports. During the battle, Jedi Master Kossex, a member of Choi's squadron, was shot down and was killed by the opposing force before the Republic forces could repel the invaders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the war, Master Choi was one of several Jedi who were on the Republic Troopship VCD987. While traveling to the planet Drongar, VCD987 came under attack by a large Separatist force and sustained massive damage to its engines. With the engines no longer functioning, Separatist troops under the leadership of a Sith Lord, Count Dooku, boarded the ship and cornered Choi and his companions, Knights Sian Jeisel and Kai Justiss. In an attempt to appear merciful and sway the Jedi team to the Separatist cause, Dooku allowed the captives to go free, opting to only kill the clone troopers accompanying them instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the fight to rebuff Separatist invaders of the planet Kashyyyk three years later, Tsui Choi and a team of Aleenan scouts performed reconnaissance missions for the Republic, riding can-cells through the forests of the planet.

Immediately afterwards, he was reunited with fellow Jedi survivor Bultar Swan, who told Choi of the imminent rendezvous on Kessel with six other living Jedi. The other Jedi, particularly Koffi Arana, wanted to strike back at Darths Sidious and Vader, the perpetrators of the Purge and the masterminds of Order 66 as well as the deaths of almost every Jedi at the Jedi Temple. Choi disagreed with them, refusing to take cold-blooded revenge on the duo, as he felt doing so would accomplish nothing while leading them all to the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Choi was shocked to learn that Shadday Potkin, an attendee of the meeting, had leaked information of the secret conference to Vader because she thought that, if all the Jedi there worked together, they could eliminate him. The Sith Lord attacked the group shortly after the meeting commenced; and though Choi was initially opposed to fighting Vader, his position changed after the Sith killed Knight Sia-Lan Wezz. Choi joined the fray, severing Vader's robotic hand with his lightsaber, though this would not stop Vader, who then killed several more of the Jedi, including Potkin. Choi, with Masters Roblio Dart\u00e9 and Jastus Farr, then used the Force to launch a barrage of boulders at the Dark Lord, incapacitating him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Vader outmaneuvered, Choi felt there was no other choice than to strike down the Dark Lord. However, before he could do so, Imperial stormtroopers arrived. While the three could stave off their blaster fire for a time, Farr was killed in the barrage. Choi then leapt up to the balcony where the troopers were standing in order to give Dart\u00e9, the only other survivor, a chance to escape, Vader held him in place with the Force so his troops could shoot him. Choi, knowing that he was close to death, threw his lightsaber at Vader, cutting a hole in his helmet. Immediately thereafter, Tsui Choi was gunned down by the stormtroopers, and Dart\u00e9 was felled while crying out Choi's name."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Galactic Empire was finalized as the replacement of the Galactic Republic, the government's official records of the Jedi Purge, compiled by Moff Marcellin Wessel and supplemented by Grand Vizier Sate Pestage, stated that many Jedi who'd been slaughtered during the initial stages of the Purge were executed for various false crimes from kidnapping children to plotting to poison the water supply of a planet.

He followed this philosophy to the point that he would not strike at Darth Vader, the man who killed many of his comrades during his assault on the Jedi Temple, until he had executed one of the Jedi who had attended the Conclave on Kessel. Choi was a brave and noble being, who would gladly give up his life to save the lives of others.
