It was similar in appearance and purpose to a neuronic whip, or the lightwhip favored by Force-sensitives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The shock whip was made of a metal grip from which extended metal wires roughly four meters in length, thickly woven into a single strand. When activated via a control on the handgrip, the internal power cell would send an intense electrical charge through the whip. Wielders were known to wrap their foes in the metal wire before activating the electric charge. Shock whips could be used to wrap around opponents' legs or limbs and grabbing or tripping them. The charge was strong enough to kill a being with but the slightest touch. Some models of shock whips featured retractable cords that would spool themselves into the whip's handle for easier carrying and use."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A bodyguard employed by Senator Bezz Drexx carried a shock whip during the Clone Wars.
