Other cities such as Mos Eisley on Tatooine could be simply large settlements with little to no infrastructure. Similarly, the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk boasted tree-cities, communities of artificial structures surrounding and built in harmony with multiple wroshyr trees. While most cities were built on a planet's surface, some cities were \"floating\" above the planet, such as Cloud City on Bespin, or on water such as Tipoca City on the aquatic world of Kamino. Cities could also be built below ground, such as on Utapau, where the cities were housed within large sinkholes that covered the planet's surface. During construction, builders would also sometimes make efforts to blend the city with its surrounding natural habitat. A prime example was the city of Theed on Naboo, a planet which was known for its beautiful river cities of classical architecture and greenery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Large cities could hold planetary spaceports, company headquarters, offices, and all services. To offer these services, cities were sometimes divided into different districts, public buildings, residential and industrial."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Capital cities were the political center of a planet, sometimes also the cultural center, and they held different buildings for those purposes. Lessu was the capital city of Ryloth, the homeworld of the Twi'lek species. As the cultural center of the galaxy and the capital of the Galactic Republic and the Galactic Empire, Coruscant was filled with government and business buildings, such as the Senate Building, as well as homes, theaters, clubs, and other entertainment centers for the enjoyment of the city's population."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
