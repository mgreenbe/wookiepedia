However, he was integrated in the Order's Exploration Corps at the request of Master Ekim Ryelli. During the later stages of the Clone Wars, around 19 BBY, Itincoovar accompanied Ryelli and Telloti Cillmam'n to Nicht Ka, where an ancient structure had been discovered. While the Givin was sent back to the starship in order to compare some inscriptions with the ship's database, Cillmam'n discovered an ancient armor that once belonged to the Dark Jedi Warb Null. While researching the philology database, Itincoovar received a transmission from Palpatine, the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, announcing that the Clone Wars had been won and that all Jedi were ordered to return to their main temple on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Givin tried to communicate with Master Ryelli via comlink, no answer came.
