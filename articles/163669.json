Hills and canyons such as Skyline River Pass and Gorge Hollow River Pass formed a barrier between the jungle and the nearby town of Raider's Cove to the east. The Nova Blades, a pirate gang, made their headquarters in the crashed starship Aggressor that lay in the western mountains of the island. Shaclaws, known locally as shore crabs, were common along the beaches, and the jungle was filled with tonitran lizards, jungle wampas, krak'jyas, and orobirds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
