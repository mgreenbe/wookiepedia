Under the control of the Gungans, this temple was used as a place to train elite Gungan warriors. The location was the site of various Gungan's, including at least one Boss general, and War Chief, as well as several Gungan bombers and guards. After the Battle of Yavin, the Royal Naboo Security Forces learnt the existence of the stronghold but some security guards remained skeptical about the Gungan warriors trained there. Around the same time, the biologist Ronin Lightrunner visited the place while studying veermoks and befriended with the Gungans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gungan Warrior Stronghold was a location in the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
