Circa 1 ABY, N.S.H. troops shut down an A.C.L.O. clinic and imprisoned the Wookiee medical officer Syirlabradawk. They also confiscated a shipment of medical supplies before its delivery to Rebel forces on Talus. Alliance Captain Quellium and the A.C.L.O. representative Trezya Nenei therefore sent a spacer to the N.S.H. base. The spacer assaulted the base and slayed many N.S.H. enforcers in the process. The spacer then found a number of prisoners held and tortured in holding cells within the underground bunker, including the Wookiee Syirlabradawk. The spacer also retrieved the medical supply crates, with the A.C.L.O emblems on the crates hastily covered by the N.S.H. logo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The N.S.H. base was a location in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
