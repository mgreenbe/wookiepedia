Corporal Jobin and his men manned this post during the rearguard action that was meant to stall the Imperial Army long enough for the Rebellion to evacuate the base. The post was eventually overrun by All Terrain Armored Transports and A5 Juggernauts, but not before Jobin took a squad back to the Rebels' planetary ion cannon in order to prevent its capture by Imperial forces. Echo Station 5-7 was also the site of three airbases and docked evacuation shuttles. The airbases were destroyed by the advancing Imperial forces at the order of Darth Vader. Rogue Squadron was supposed to supply aerial support, but they ultimately weren't able to arrive on time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Echo Station 5-7 first appeared in Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back.
