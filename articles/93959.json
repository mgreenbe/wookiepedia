He was a small man with pale skin from years of underground living. He had dark patches under his eyes and a sickly appearance. He made a meager living by performing with his trained bursa named Fierce, who was as stooped and sickly as her master, but able to perform simple tricks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
