In doing so, Gog hoped to remove the life-essence of a Jedi by posting legends of Jedi Knights onto the HoloNet under the name of ForceFlow to attract Force-sensitive individuals to the space station and lure them into the trap. One such individual was Tash Arranda, the niece of Mammon Hoole. She desired to become a Jedi Knight and searched for Jedi and artifacts that would lead her to them. After contacting the enigmatic \"ForceFlow\" she was persuaded to visit Nespis VIII. While running from what she perceived to be a Jedi 'ghost', Tash stumbled into the library. While browsing through the entries held on the shelves, she found a book titled The History of the Jedi Knights. However, when she tried to read the book, she was saved by the ghost of Aidan Bok."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
