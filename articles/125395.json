She was possessed of unwavering loyalty to Fel and an icy demeanor that saw her rigidly believe that an Imperial Knight's duty was to obey the Emperor's commands above all else, even the will of the Force. Dare was trained as an Imperial Knight by Master Treis Sinde prior to 137 ABY, and in that year, she accompanied the Emperor as he retook the fortress world of Bastion from the Sith Lord Darth Krayt's Imperial forces. She and Sinde were later sent by Fel to the planet Dac to sabotage the construction of a new Star Destroyer belonging to Krayt's Empire, and they planted three sets of explosives on the nearly-completed Imperious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Destroyer was seized by Admiral Gar Stazi of the Galactic Alliance Remnant, Dare and Sinde infiltrated Sith\u2013Imperial-occupied Dac and rescued several Alliance pilots from the clutches of Krayt's forces in an attempt to warn Stazi of the explosives they had planted. Sinde was stranded on the world, but their actions paved the way toward an eventual alliance between Stazi's fleet and Fel's Empire. Dare was later sent back to Dac to retrieve Sinde, and was accompanied by the Jedi Master Asaak Dan at both Dan's and Stazi's behest. When Sinde informed Dare that he would be staying on-planet to continue aiding the Mon Calamari Rangers in their fight against Krayt's forces, she angrily engaged her former Master in a duel that was quickly halted by Dan's intervention; Dan then took Sinde's place with the rangers and allowed both Knights to return to Bastion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dare and Sinde soon after joined a contingent of Imperial Knights that accompanied the Emperor to Agamar in order to conduct peace talks with the Jedi Order. The meeting was interrupted by forces of the One Sith, but the Emperor and most of the Imperial Knights were able to evacuate the planet. The solidified three-way alliance between the Empire-in-exile, Galactic Alliance, and the Jedi later attacked Krayt's throneworld of Coruscant, and Dare was part of an advanced strike team that infiltrated the planet and sabotaged its orbital defenses. She was non-fatally stabbed by a Sith during the battle, and Krayt was slain, an event which fractured his Sith Order and won the war for the allies. The Emperor was also killed after falling to the dark side of the Force, and Dare attended his funeral in the battle's aftermath."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early service"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Human female Sigel Dare was trained as an Imperial Knight by Master Treis Sinde and, after reaching Knighthood, became fully qualified to serve Emperor Roan Fel as a bodyguard and agent. At some point prior to 137 ABY, Dare attained the rank of Master, a title reserved only for the highest ranking Imperial Knights. During sparring sessions with Sinde, she came to surpass her teacher's skills with a lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Second Imperial Civil War"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Sabotaging the Imperious"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After seven years of conducting hit-and-run tactics on the fleets of the Sith Lord Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire, Roan Fel, whom Krayt had deposed as Emperor of the Galactic Empire, returned in 137 ABY to the Imperial stronghold of Bastion, which Krayt had claimed shortly after the conclusion of the Sith\u2013Imperial War seven years prior. Dare accompanied Fel as he arrived on-planet, along with fellow Imperial Knights Antares Draco and Ganner Krieg. After securing the loyalty of the Imperial forces stationed on the fortress world, Fel believed that his Empire could now become a more potent threat to Krayt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Weeks later, Fel sent Dare and Sinde on a mission to sabotage the Advanced Star Destroyer Imperious, which was nearing completion at the Mon Calamari Shipyards, as destroying the vessel would mean denying its usage to Darth Krayt's Empire. Undercover and in plainclothes, Sinde and Dare were dispatched to Dac to infiltrate and destroy the ship. The pair planted three sets of explosives, the first two of which they expected to be found; the third they anticipated to remain undiscovered. The explosives were primed to go off when the Imperious's weapon systems came online during its shakedown cruise. The hope was that the ship would be far enough away from Dac so that the planet's native Mon Calamari would not be blamed for its destruction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The plan hit a snag, however, when Admiral Gar Stazi of the Galactic Alliance Remnant executed his own mission to steal the Imperious from Krayt's Empire, hoping to add the ship to his fleet's arsenal. Stazi's plan succeeded, and Sinde realized that the explosives would not be discovered by the Alliance. Although he decided that he and Dare needed to warn Stazi of the sabotage, Dare did not share her former instructor's views, feeling that the Duros admiral was as much an enemy of Roan Fel's Empire as Darth Krayt was. However, Sinde felt that Fel hoped to ally with Stazi against Krayt and felt that he and Dare could convince him of their good intentions by warning him of the threat posed by the explosives."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Escape from Dac"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Angered at the loss of the Imperious, Darth Krayt brought a legion of Sith and stormtroopers to Dac, and ordered the execution of ten percent of the Mon Calamari population, beginning with the members of the Mon Calamari Council. As Sith and stormtroopers swarmed New Coral City, Dare and Sinde, still in plainclothes, ignited their lightsabers and fought their way through Krayt's forces in order to locate Monia Gahan, a member of Rogue Squadron and the niece of former senator and Galactic Alliance Triumvirate member Gial Gahan. The two Imperial Knights anticipated that she could help them locate Stazi. Finding Gahan, Dare and Sinde saved her from execution at the hands of a squad of stormtroopers. Sinde then informed her of the situation and told her that she would be taken off-planet in order to enable himself and Dare to reach the admiral. Still wary of their plan, Dare taunted Gahan, telling her that Stazi had been outsmarted, but was in turn reprimanded by Sinde."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gahan agreed to help them, on the condition that they assisted in the rescue of Alliance pilots that had been captured during the battle. Dare saw it as an unnecessary risk but was willing to defer to Sinde's wisdom. With Gahan at their side, Dare and Sinde cut their way through legions of stormtroopers as the Mon Calamari rescued her fellow pilots from a prison cell. Sinde quickly laid out a plan: everyone who could fit into stormtrooper armor would wear it as a disguise, and Dare would pose as an Imperial lieutenant. With the plan put into motion, the ensemble made their way to the hangar levels. Dare used a mind trick to convince the captain on-duty that they were authorized to load prisoners aboard the personal shuttle of Darth Azard, a Quarren Sith Lord. Boarding the shuttle, Sinde and Dare incapacitated the crew. Before they could take off, Sinde saw Azard approaching; the Sith Lord had sensed a disturbance in the Force. Sinde ordered Dare to take the shuttle to a rendezvous with Stazi, then leaped down into the hangar to engage Azard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unfazed by Gahan's horror that she would leave her partner behind, Dare prepared to follow Sinde's instructions. As her former Master dueled Azard in a delaying action, Dare used the Force to jettison a fuel tank into the path of the shuttle's rear guns, and instructed one of the pilots to fire on it. A massive explosion engulfed the hangar, covering the shuttle's escape and distracting Azard long enough for Sinde to dive off the hangar level and flee himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After taking the shuttle to the Imperious, now in the hands of Stazi and rechristened the Alliance, the pilots brought Dare to an audience with the Duros admiral. Dare informed him of the third set of explosives, which were swiftly disarmed. Tension mounted between Stazi and a disrespectful Dare, but Gahan cut through the strained relations and asserted that Master Sinde had been correct: the Sith were the common enemies of both Stazi and Emperor Fel, and it would be beneficial for the two to become allies. Dare and Gahan agreed that Sinde had been willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good, and Stazi realized the necessity of bringing down Krayt. He instructed Dare to contact Roan Fel and inform him of his willingness to create an alliance, and Dare respectfully bowed to his wishes."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Retrieving Sinde"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The resulting alliance between the Empire-in-exile and the Galactic Alliance Remnant went on to decimate Krayt's Coruscant Third Fleet at Ralltiir, while on Dac, Sinde fought alongside the Mon Calamari Rangers in an effort to protect Mon Calamari refugees stranded on the planet. After finally being able to make contact with Sinde, Fel summoned Dare to an audience along with Antares Draco and Ganner Krieg, who had just reported back from a mission that saw the apparent death of Darth Krayt. In the wake of the Sith Lord's demise, the Emperor handed out orders to all three Knights; Dare was to go to Dac and retrieve Sinde, who was needed to train more Imperial Knights."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dare traveled to the Arkanis sector and once again met with Admiral Gar Stazi aboard the Alliance. During Dare's visit, the admiral was also host to four Jedi Masters, all of whom had been dispatched by the Jedi Council in order to aid Stazi's alliance with Roan Fel. When Dare asked Stazi for the use of one of the Alliance's Imperial shuttles to allow her to covertly slip into Dac, Jedi Master Asaak Dan asked to come along. Dan was fascinated by what he had heard about Sinde's work with the Mon Calamari Rangers, but his request was met with steadfast refusal. However, Dare's conviction was overridden by the admiral, who reminded her that the shuttle, and consequently the decision, was his."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "En route to Dac, Dare hatched a plan that saw her dress as an Imperial Intelligence officer and Dan as one of her agents. Bothered by Master Dan's presence, she repeatedly informed him of the plan and its details, creating a hostility between the two of them, albeit one that was reciprocated in a largely mock-serious manner. After landing on Dac, they were able to bypass security with the aid of a mind trick on Dare's part, and then rendezvoused with Sinde and the Mon Calamari Ranger Tanquar. Hoping to leave the planet quickly, Dare informed her former Master of the awaiting ship, and was shocked to hear that he intended to remain on Dac. Sinde believed that the Force was telling him to remain with the Rangers, but Dare, angrily igniting her lightsaber, insisted that an Imperial Knight's personal loyalty to the Emperor transcended what the Force told them. Sinde didn't wish to fight, but Dare was adamant: he would return with her, or he would die on Dac. Dismayed that Dare, and younger Imperial Knights in general, were losing sight of the true purposes of their organization, Sinde reluctantly engaged his former student in a lightsaber duel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the two fought, Master Dan ignited his own lightsaber and intervened, enraging Dare in the process. Halting the duel by Force-pushing Dare into Sinde, he suggested to Sinde that it was his duty to return to Bastion and train young Imperial Knights correctly, and offered to stay on Dac and help the Rangers in Sinde's place. After the elder Imperial Knight accepted, he and Dare prepared to depart the planet, and Dare grudgingly admitted that the Jedi Master was skilled and brave."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Peace talks on Agamar"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back on Bastion, Dare, along with Masters Draco, Hogrum Chalk, and Emperor Fel, observed a sparring match between Masters Krieg and Azlyn Rae that was happening under Master Sinde's direction. During the session, Dare took notes as she watched. She later joined a contingent of Imperial Knights in accompanying the Emperor and his daughter, Princess Marasiah Fel, to Agamar in order to conduct peace talks with the Jedi Order. On the planet's surface, the Imperial Knights made camp for the night on Agamar's grassy plains. The following morning, they met with representatives from the Jedi, led by Master K'Kruhk. Everyone present disguised themselves as Agamarian farmers, and several of the Imperial Knights positioned themselves away from the meeting, pretending to work on a nearby field."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A formal alliance was struck, and Fel declared Bastion a safe haven for both the Jedi and the Galactic Alliance. Yet, the parleying was interrupted by an approaching intruder riding a local animal. Master Sinde ordered Dare and Master Krieg to open fire, and the two hit the beast with shots from blaster rifles until Fel recognized the rider as Nyna Calixte, the Director of Imperial Intelligence for Krayt's Empire who had held the same title under Fel's leadership prior to the conclusion of the Sith\u2013Imperial War. Calixte hurriedly told the assembled party that the Sith were aware of the meeting and had sent a task force under the command of Moff Rulf Yage to capture or kill the Emperor. As the task force, led by the Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer War Hammer, engaged Fel's Dauntless in orbit, she suggested that the Imperial Knights and Jedi run if they wanted to survive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Knights and Jedi were quickly advanced upon by a group of Sith that emerged from nearby swamps. Dare lit her lightsaber when Draco and K'Kruhk called on their respective parties to defend Emperor Fel, and all disguises were shed as a battle ensued. At least ten Sith fell to the blades of the Imperial Knights and Jedi, as well as to Calixte's blaster, although several Imperial Knights and Jedi died as well. Draco hailed the Imperial Knights' escape shuttle, Defender One, which landed near the site of the melee in order to evacuate the Emperor. As Sinde and K'Kruhk began clearing a path toward the shuttle, the surviving Imperial Knights and Jedi boarded, save for Marasiah, Rae, and the Jedi Rasi Tuum, who were too far away. Draco gave the order for the shuttle to lift off, and Defender One escaped the planet as the Dauntless held a corridor of space open for them, taking the brunt of the War Hammer's attack and being destroyed in the process."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Into the fire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Emperor, as well as the surviving Imperial Knights and Jedi who escaped, returned to Bastion to recuperate. Rae and Tuum arrived several days later, having escaped Agamar in a stolen Sith\u2013Imperial attack ship, but Fel's spy on Krayt's throneworld of Coruscant reported that Marasiah had been taken to the Sith world of Korriban. Draco led a successful extraction mission and rescued her, but he himself was taken prisoner in the process. Draco revealed the location of the Jedi Order's Hidden Temple under torture, and both Fel and Gar Stazi dispatched fleets to aid their allies in the temple's defense when Krayt's Empire attacked. The battle saw Krayt, alive and well, unveil his ruthless Sith trooper army and cause significant damage to the allied forces; the Jedi were nevertheless evacuated and the allies retreated to Bastion. An immediate counterstrike at Coruscant was planned, and Dare joined an advanced strike team that was set to infiltrate the planet and sabotage its orbital defenses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aboard the Mynock, a starship belonging to the former Jedi Cade Skywalker, the strike team covertly landed at a hidden location on Coruscant and made their way to the central computers that controlled the orbital defenses. Dare was accompanied by Masters Krieg and Rae, as well as Skywalker, Tuum, the Jedi Wolf Sazen and Shado Vao, and Morrigan Corde, a recent defector from Krayt's Empire who had formerly been known as Nyna Calixte, the Director of Imperial Intelligence. Corde led the way to their target, where they arrived two minutes before the allied fleets were set to arrive in-system. After Tuum and Rae used telekinesis to blast several technicians out of their way, Dare and the others began to battle stormtroopers and Sith troopers. Dare and Vao were both able to cut off the hands of Sith troopers during the melee. Krieg, Sazen, and Skywalker meanwhile destroyed the computers, and the planet's defenses were brought down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The strike team then made their way to the Temple of the Sith in an effort to locate Krayt and force him into a showdown with Skywalker, his sworn enemy, and entered the building using hidden tunnels that Skywalker and Vao has discovered years before when it was still the Jedi Temple. A group of Sith were waiting for them, and in the resulting skirmish, Dare was non-fatally stabbed in the chest. Sazen and the Sith Lord Darth Stryfe were killed after cutting each other down, and as those still standing fought on, Skywalker departed to locate Krayt. He found and killed him, and the Sith troopers, whose wills were linked to Krayt through the dark side of the Force, went insane. The strike team cut down their remaining opponents, and the Sith troopers who were flying Annihilator-class starfighters in the space battle above plummeted their craft toward Coruscant's surface. Krayt's fleet fled into hyperspace; with the Dark Lord dead and the galactic capital won, the war was over, and victory belonged to the allies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the battle's casualties was Emperor Fel, who had been slain by Draco after attempting to unleash a Sith-created pathogen onto Coruscant that would wipe out all life on the planet. As every Imperial Knight had vowed to kill the Emperor if he were ever to fall to the dark side, Draco had performed his duty. A funeral was held for Fel in the battle's aftermath, and Dare was among the attendees as Master Chalk delivered a eulogy.

While with Sinde on Dac, Dare was very reluctant to warn Admiral Gar Stazi of the explosives planted aboard his new flagship, as she felt that he was as much an enemy to her Emperor as the Sith were. Even while working to warn Stazi, Dare was smug in her actions, taunting several Galactic Alliance pilots and insisting that she and Sinde had outsmarted the admiral. In Stazi's presence, she sarcastically reminded him that her actions had played a large part in the disarming of the explosives; if the decision had been hers and not Sinde's, Dare would have left the Galactic Alliance pilots on Dac to die and allowed Stazi to perish aboard the Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dare maintained that an Imperial Knight's duty was ultimately to the Emperor, rather than the Force as embodied by the Emperor.
