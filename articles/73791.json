It was inhabited by the Kaminoans\u2014a race of tall, elegant beings with long necks who were regarded as a mysterious species that tended to keep to themselves. They were also known for their cloning technology which ultimately led to the creation of a clone army for the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kamino was a remote water planet outside the main galaxy. The world's oceans held an abundance of life. Kamino was renowned for its science and production of clone armies and often contracted with private security forces and other clients. Receiving minimal trade, Kamino's imports were only enough to support the planet's population of one billion. There were many cities scattered across the surface that were built on stilts and many of them were devoted to cloning.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kamino often experienced heavy rain and during some parts of the year was covered with heavy electrical storms.

This behavior could be traced back to the great flood that changed their homeworld, as they decided it was less risky to adapt their genetic code and planet than to ask for aid from the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nearing the beginning of the Clone Wars, Kamino was governed by Prime Minister Lama Su. The bounty hunter Jango Fett was tasked with the assassination of Naboo senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Fett had a fellow bounty hunter, Zam Wesell, attempt to murder her. After a failed attempt, the Clawdite was pursued by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan, Anakin Skywalker. The Jedi soon captured her, but Fett shot the bounty hunter with a Kamino saberdart before she could reveal any information. Kenobi, using the dart as a means of finding Fett, was informed by Dexter Jettster that the dart originated from Kamino. Soon, Kenobi found Kamino and discovered the clone army that was being produced."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A galactic war"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Kamino was one of the main operational areas of the Galactic Republic. It served as the main training grounds for clone cadets as well as the location for the clone army's creation. To protect the planet and the cloning facilities from a possible Separatist attack, the Republic established a 13-shipped blockade of ten Venator-class Star Destroyers, one Acclamator-class assault ship, and two Arquitens-class light cruisers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one point during the Clone Wars, somewhere between 22 and 21 BBY, a Separatist assault led by Asajj Ventress and cyborg General Grievous hit Kamino in an attempt to end clone creation for the Republic. Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi with the 501st Legion and the 212th Attack Battalion were sent to assist in the planet's defense alongside Jedi General Shaak Ti. The two pronged assault saw Ventress lead Trident-class assault ships beneath the planet's oceans to sneak up on Tipoca City. Many AQ-series battle droids invaded the cloning facilities, killing many clone troopers, including Clone ARC Commanders Colt and Havoc and malformed clone 99. Ventress successfully stole the prime sample of the clone trooper DNA template, but she was attacked by Skywalker, who, with the assistance of a force of clones, reclaimed the DNA. Republic forces managed to defeat the Separatists and cloning continued on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another battle of Kamino involved Jedi General Kit Fisto, who fought against Separatist droids deployed in the battle. Late in the war, the Sith's plan to destroy the Jedi using the clones troopers was almost revealed. During the Battle of Ringo Vinda, the clone trooper CT-5385, nicknamed Tup, executed the Jedi Master Tiplar during the confrontation due to a defect in his inhibitor chip. Wanting answers, it was decided that the clone would be sent to Kamino."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kaminoan leadership did everything possible to prevent the truth about the chips from being revealed, that they would guarantee the clones' obedience when the order to destroy the Jedi was given. Although Tup died during a procedure carried out without permission to remove the chip by his clone friend Fives and the medical android AZI-3, the threat to the Sith plan did not end while Fives continued to investigate. Fives found that all clones had chips and decided to remove his, and he and the two chips were sent to Coruscant for analysis. Fives was eventually killed on Coruscant and the truth about the chips was kept secret."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Age of the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the creation of the Galactic Empire, rumors spread throughout the Imperial ranks that the cloning facilities in Kamino were closed down, concerning the clones who heard them. Shortly after the creation of the Imperial state, Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin arrived on Kamino to discuss the state of the new Imperial Army with Lama Su, informing the Prime Minister the Empire was reluctant to continuing using clones. Upon seeing a group of enhanced clones\u2014Clone Force 99, also known as \"the Bad Batch\"\u2014cause a disturbance in the mess hall, Tarkin requested they undergo a battle simulation before sending them on a mission to Onderon, claiming they would encounter Separatist insurgents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Onderon, the Bad Batch encountered civilians instead of rebels, with Tarkin using a probe droid to watch as all of the clone commandos\u2014with the exception of team sniper CT-9904 \"Crosshair\"\u2014chose to disobey their orders. Upon the Bad Batch's return to Kamino to rescue the young enhanced clone Omega, they were captured, and Crosshair was taken away to a medical chamber. Learning that the commando's inhibitor chip had, unlike the other members of his squad, responded to Order 66, Tarkin had it increased in power, turning Crosshair to the side of the Empire. Donning new Imperial gear, Crosshair and a force of shock troopers encountered Omega and his fellow commandos in the hangar, only for Nala Se to secretly override the door controls. Thus, the Bad Batch and Omega escaped from Crosshair and the other Imperial forces on Kamino, jumping into hyperspace to go to the Suolriep sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tarkin would come to have his wish to avoid clones; the troops that made up the Imperial Army were gradually replaced by non-clone recruits and the Kaminoan cloning facilities were decommissioned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kamino was created for the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, the second installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally, George Lucas promised to explain the mystery behind the erasure of Kamino from the Jedi Archives in 2005's Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.
