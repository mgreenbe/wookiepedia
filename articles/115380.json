They created a community on a single, small part of Rhamalai, and set up a society focused on living in harmony with their new world. A hundred years later, corporate scouts happened upon Rhamalai, and attempted to take the planet as their own. Only the intervention of a native Jedi Knight \u2014 a member of the original group of colonists \u2014 kept Rhamalai under Cherishite control. The Jedi Knight continued to protect Rhamalai during his long lifespan, until his death during the rise of the New Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Jedi gone, the Cherishites began working towards establishing a planetary government. Much of Rhamalai's economy relied on agriculture, and this was something the Empire used to its advantage.

One male from each Cherishite family was taken by the Empire and conscripted into Imperial service."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The average day on Rhamalai lasted for thirty standard hours, while a year lasted two hundred and forty-six days."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
