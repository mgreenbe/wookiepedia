These scopes offered better magnification, meaning that even the humblest of blaster pistols could theoretically be made into a sniping weapon. The Mark I, II, & III scopes in turn allowed for increasingly significant boosts in accuracy over longer ranges."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
