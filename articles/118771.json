Following a attack on the Inyusu Tor mineral processing facility by the Sullustan resistance, 156 was assigned on guard duty at a tram station in the nearby city Pinyumb. With him was fellow stormtrooper SP-475, whom he had worked with before. He asked her if anybody had died in the attack and if she though any of the enemy had been killed. Although it was out of regulations, 475 replied to his first question, but found it best not to answer the second."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fifteen days later, 156 and 475 were part of a squad of stormtroopers assigned to board the VCX-150 freighter Keepsake, a suspected rebel starship docked in the Pinyumb spaceport. As they searched the freighter, the stormtrooper in charge, SP-113, ordered the cargo to be locked down when 156 separated himself from the squad, investigating a conduit access panel in the corridor. He bashed it off with his rifle and discovered a Chadra-Fan hiding inside the cramped space. SP-113 briefly questioned it and had the other troopers take it away. However, the Chadra-Fan then set off a detonator which killed several troopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SP-156 first appeared in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
