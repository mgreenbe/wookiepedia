The Qieg's language utilized body language to communicate, along with verbal chirps and clicks. As a result, Barellian Humans did not express emotions through normal means, such as on their faces, but with their hands. This made Barellian Humans hard to read, but did make them excellent Sabacc players."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
