Jedi General Aayla Secura, whose forces were being pummeled, requested aid from General Anakin Skywalker, who arrived in his flagship Resolute with his Padawan Ahsoka Tano. Skywalker, Tano, Clone Captain Rex and their forces boarded Secura's flagship to rescue her, with Skywalker arranging for a frigate to dock in the lower hangar for everyone to escape on. However, Skywalker was severely injured holding back an explosion as Secura, Tano, Rex and Clone Commander Bly boarded, so Secura and Tano dragged the Jedi Knight onboard. As the frigate headed back to the Resolute, Separatist fire damaged it and caused its hyperdrive to activate, sending the ship hurtling into hyperspace on a random trajectory. Admiral Wullf Yularen ordered the ship's trajectory be calculated so it could be located after the battle was finished."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three Venator-class Star Destroyers under the command of Jedi General Aayla Secura engaged with several Munificent-class star frigates, lead by T-series tactical droid TF-1726, at Quell. After some time of fighting, Secura's forces were taking heavy casualties, and thus requested assistance from Jedi General Anakin Skywalker in a nearby system. As Skywalker was racing to the aid of Secura, two of her Venator-class Star Destroyers were destroyed, and the Separatist commander deployed B2-RP super battle droids to board Secura's remaining ship, intending to speed up its destruction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around that time, Skywalker emerged from hyperspace with the Resolute and arrived at the battle, quickly deploying several LAAT/i gunships to board Secura's ship, with one gunship carrying Skywalker and his Jedi Padawan, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, as well as Clone Captain Rex and several other clone troopers. During their descent, rocket droids attacked the gunship's pilots, with one being forced to evacuate into the passenger compartment, placing the vessel on a plummet towards Secura's flagship. Skywalker leapt onto one of the rocket droids and rode it down to the crippled Jedi Cruiser, to Tano's exasperation. The gunship eventually crashed into a breach in the hull of Secura's ship, with Tano, Rex and the troopers quickly rejoining Skywalker. As Skywalker and his forces pushed forward to join with Secura and Clone Commander Bly, a Republic frigate was docking in the lower hangar bay to evacuate the survivors. Separatist warships continued to fire on Secura's ship, which ignited a large internal explosion as the survivors were evacuating onto the cruiser."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to save his comrades, Skywalker Force-pushed them into the cruiser, and held back the explosion as much as he could before eventually being wounded. Skywalker was rescued, and the cruiser departed the doomed Republic vessel just as it was being destroyed. Due to Skywalker's wounded condition, Secura sought to dock with the Resolute, which was engaging Separatist forces. Admiral Wullf Yularen warned about docking in the middle of the battle, but reluctantly allowed Secura and the cruiser to dock. However, during the docking procedure, the cruiser was attacked by vulture droids, which accidentally activated the ship's hyperdrive, forcing the cruiser into evasive action to avoid a catastrophic collision with the Resolute as it jumped into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yularen ordered the last known trajectory of the cruiser to be plotted so the missing ship could be located after the battle had been finished. Ultimately, the battle was a Separatist victory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The out-of-control ship nearly collided with a star in hyperspace, but after it was forced out, the ship crashed on the planet Maridun. The stranded Jedi and clones found medical assistance for Skywalker at a village of Lurmen colonists. However, not long after their arrival, Separatist forces led by General Lok Durd arrived at Maridun, plotting to destroy the village as part of a test for Durd's experimental weapon, the Defoliator. The Republic group, including a mostly-recovered Skywalker, successfully defended the village from Durd's forces, before capturing him just before the Resolute arrived at Maridun in search of them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
