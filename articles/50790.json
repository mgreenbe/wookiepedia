Jorek could not pronounce Frizz's Defel name correctly, so gave him the new name \"Frizz,\" which the Defel eventually became accustomed to. Frizz became Jorek's right-hand man and once, while working for the Hutt Cartel, they traveled to the planet Naboo, where they sold illegal weaponry from a warehouse on the edge of the capital city Theed.
