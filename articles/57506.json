When the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Grohto took up the rank of General in the Grand Army of the Republic. When the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Maul resurfaced during the war, Grohto was assigned to a strike team tasked with hunting down Maul and his brother, Savage Opress. Along with Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi, Bruu Jun-Fan and Ko Solok, Grohto journeyed across the Republic following reports of the two Zabraks' deeds. Confronting the dark-siders on Yellowblade's Landing, Grohto was killed by Maul's lightsaber, sustaining a fatal blow to the abdomen after the Zabrak distracted the Jedi by using a Human woman as a living shield."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
