When the Jedi managed to escape with the help of a squad led by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, this droid and a number of other commando droids accompanied the Phindian Osi Sobeck to the dungeon where Piell's naval fleet officers and their captain, Wilhuff Tarkin had been held. The commando reported to Sobeck that Piell and Piell's officers had escaped, and the angered Phindian responded by ordering another BX-series commando to execute the droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
