Stored in levels known as cortexes, the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth cortex were available to viewing by any member of the shaper caste. Only Master Shapers were allowed access to the sixth and seventh cortex. The highest of them was the eighth cortex, believed to be the most perfect information the gods gave to the Yuuzhan Vong. In truth, the eighth cortex was near empty. Violation of the protocols was deemed heresy, and was grounds for automatic death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "List of known protocols"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
