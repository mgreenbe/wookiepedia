In 0 ABY, a few months after the Battle of Yavin, Grunta encountered the Rebels Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, who were accompanied by Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Tobin Elad, on the outskirts of the city of Pilaan. As the Rebels were trying to find a way to meet with the Muun Nal Kenuun, Grunta offered to arrange a meeting with Kenuun for a payment of 100 credits. Instead, Grunta led the group into an ambush by four of his Dug companions armed with blasters and riding swoops.

Like most of his species, Grunta was barely a meter high, though Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker thought that Grunta was even shorter than most Dugs when he first met him in 0 ABY, a few months after the Battle of Yavin. Along with Skywalker were fellow Rebels Princess Leia Organa, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and X-7, the latter of whom the Rebels were unaware was actually an Imperial assassin secretly using the alias Tobin Elad. Inside a local cantina, the Rebels were trying to find information on how to contact the Muun gambler Nal Kenuun but were unsuccessful, as the locals refused to cooperate. Grunta offered to arrange a high-stakes game\u2014with a 10,000-credit buy-in\u2014with Kenuun for a hundred-credit fee. Solo agreed to the proposition, and the group began to follow Grunta deep into the city's outskirts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grunta, however, led the group into an ambush by four of his fellow Dugs flying swoops and armed with blasters. When Grunta demanded that they hand over all of their credits, the Rebels decided to fight back.

Knowing Grunta's penchant for trouble, Kenuun had a homing droid shadowing him as a precaution, which enabled Kenuun's stormtroopers to capture the Rebels. Kenuun offered the Rebels a deal in which one of them would take Grunta's place in an upcoming podracing event in exchange for a datacard that Kenuun took from Mak Luunim, a Rebel Alliance contact on the planet. The datacard contained a set of secret financial accounts that the Rebellion badly needed, as most of their funds had been lost when the planet Alderaan was destroyed. As retrieving the datacard was their mission in the first place, Skywalker agreed to take Grunta's spot, eventually winning the race."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nal Kenuun described Grunta as someone possessing a talent for trouble, which was why he had a homing droid keeping track of the Dug.

When Han Solo admitted to having a part in Grunta's death, a gathered crowd of podracing pilots and crewmen inside a large tent near the racetrack, where they passed time before the race, cheered the news.
