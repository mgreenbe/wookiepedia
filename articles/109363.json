The skyhook consisted of a station section with docking hangars and a space elevator shaft. The shaft would deliver beings to and from the underground caverns of the planet in order to avoid exposure to the intense atmospheric pressure of Quarzite, and was presumably operated by the planet's government under Blank."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
