A victim infected with the plague only had 48 hours to live before the virus became fatal. It was notorious for being supposedly incurable, with a 96% success rate in killing carbon-based life-forms. An antidote was able to be synthesized with reeksa root, a rare plant only found on the planet Iego."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several thousand years before the Clone Wars, the Blue Shadow Virus encompassed the galaxy, killing millions who drank the infected water. The virus was eventually eradicated, only to be reintroduced by Doctor Nuvo Vindi during the Clone Wars as part of the research effort of Jedi-proof biological weapons. Vindi created several bombs that held an airborne version of the virus, which he planned to release on several key systems that were involved in creating galaxy-wide war. Though the release of Vindi's bombs across the galaxy was stopped by the Jedi, some of the virus was released inside of Vindi's laboratory on the planet Naboo. This small amount of virus infected senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, and several clone troopers, but fortunately never left the confines of the lab. Two Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, eventually discovered a way to make an antidote to the virus from the reeksa root, which they found on the planet Iego. After the Jedi obtained the root from Iego, an antidote was created and all who had been infected who were still alive were cured."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a rebellion against the Galactic Empire conducted by the Rebel Alliance decades later, the virus was stated to have been weaponized multiple times in past wars. Major Capin Harinar of Rebel Alliance Intelligence Service's technology division wrote an analysis to General Davits Draven about Imperial weapons projects. The analysis detailed the Electro-Proton Bomb/Defoliator, the mega-ion cannon, and the Blue Shadow Virus. In regards to the virus, Harinar stated that the Alliance would be severely ill-prepared to guard against such a targeted pandemic. The analysis was part of a larger report from Draven to Commander-in-Chief Mon Mothma, summarizing Harinar's report and Colonel Haxen Delto's report."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one point, schematics for harnessing the virus' deadly power were leaked.
