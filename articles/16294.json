Members of this cell came from several species including humans, Koorivar, and Gotals. Several dissidents including Teller himself, journalist Anora Fair, the film director Hask Taff, the Koorivar Cala, the Gotal Salikk, and the information broker Knotts were present on Antar 4 during the Antar Atrocity. Due to their experiences, they bore a deep hatred of the Empire particularly Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, the architect of the Antar Atrocity. In 14 BBY, the dissidents launched an insurgency against the Empire with the help of the Naval Intelligence Agency's Director Dodd Rancit, a rival of Tarkin, who supplied them with former Separatist weaponry, communications equipment, and intelligence on the Galactic Empire. After stealing Tarkin's personal corvette Carrion Spike, the insurgents attacked several Imperial facilities before being defeated by Tarkin during a battle near the Gulf of Tatooine. The surviving insurgents were secretly executed by the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Origins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The roots of Berch Teller's rebel cell can be traced back to the Antar Atrocity in 18 BBY. During the Clone Wars, the moon Antar 4 sided with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. However, a significant number of the indigenous Gotals and immigrant Koorivar remained loyal to the Galactic Republic. The Republic Intelligence operatives Captain Berch Teller and Knotts trained and channeled supplies to Gotal and Koorivar loyalist fighters, who waged a guerrilla war against the governing Separatists. Following the Great Jedi Purge, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine transformed the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the end of the Clone Wars, the new Empire took harsh action against Separatist supporters and sympathizers. In an effort to force former Separatist worlds such as Raxus Secundus, Kooriva, and Murkhana to surrender all former Separatists, Imperial forces under Admiral and adjutant general Wilhuff Tarkin launched a violent crackdown on Antar 4. In the process, many Gotal and Koorivar loyalists were rounded up and executed. The Antar Atrocity received widespread media coverage in the Core Worlds due to the efforts of several journalists including Anora Fair and the Zygerrian film-maker Hask Taff."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the disappearances of many journalists, media coverage generated a public outcry that forced the Emperor to reassign Tarkin to pacification operations in the Western Reaches. Tarkin was later promoted to Moff and installed as the commander of a chain of bases servicing the secret Death Star project. Tarkin's role in the Antar Atrocity earned him the enmity of Teller along with several survivors and witnesses of the mass killings."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Formation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teller abandoned his job as chief of security at the Desolation Station, one of the stations servicing the Death Star. Teller used his intelligence connections to spirit Anora, Hask, the Gotal pilot Salikk, and the Koorivar munitions and surveillance expert Cala into hiding. Another important member of the group was former Republic Intelligence operative Knotts, who used his job as an information broker on Lantillies to aid the group."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teller's cell was also aided by Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit, a rival of Moff Tarkin. Another former Republic Intelligence official, Rancit despised the rival Imperial Security Bureau for impeding the extraction of loyalist operatives on Antar 4. He was also bitter at being relieved of his command of the supply station Sentinel Base in favor of Tarkin, a close friend of the Emperor. As Director of the Naval Intelligence Agency, Rancit diverted funds from the agency's black budget to supply Teller's cell with proscribed armaments, confiscated Separatist war materiel, and communications jammers. Knowing that Teller and Knotts were former Republic Intelligence operatives, he also facilitated their access to Imperial depots and armories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition, Teller's cell was helped by scientists and technicians who held high-priority security clearances. Several of these individuals harbored grievances against the Empire and joined Teller's cell. One of these recruits was the Mon Calamari systems engineer Dr. Artoz, a former Mon Calamari Knight who had fought during the Battle of Mon Cala. Artoz was especially valuable to the dissident group due to his expertise in stealth technology."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 14 BBY, Teller's group consisted of individuals from a range of species including humans, Koorivar, Gotals, and at least one Mon Calamari. Their military resources included a heavily modified Providence-class Dreadnought which served as Berch Teller's warship, a EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate, a handful of Z-95 Headhunters and Tikiar starfighters, and a large number of vulture droids and droid tri-fighters.

Ever since the Antar Atrocity, Teller and his fellow insurgents had harbored a vendetta against Tarkin, a renown proponent of the Emperor's New Order. Using their communications equipment, the dissidents created a fake holo-transmission claiming that Rampart Station was under attack. As part of the ruse, the insurgents impersonated Lieutenant Thon, the commander of the base. Their plan was to attack Sentinel Base, Moff Tarkin's headquarters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Moff Tarkin realized the transmission was a fake and ordered the Venator-class Star Destroyer Electrum to do a microjump to the edge of the Sentinel Base's system. When the insurgents' Providence-class Dreadnought emerged from hyperspace and began bombarding Sentinel Base, Tarkin had the Electrum ambush the intruders from their rear. Though the insurgents fled into hyperspace, the Imperials were able to capture several Vulture droids and droid-tri fighters, which were examined to determine their origins.

Teller planned to turn Tarkin's corvette from a symbol of Imperial power to that of resistance against the Empire. Their plan was to raid Imperial targets across the galaxy and broadcast their holovids of their attacks on the HoloNet, mimicking the successful Separatist Shadowfeed broadcasts during the Clone Wars. Teller assigned Anora and Hask with creating and streaming these holovids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vice Admiral Rancit aided the dissidents by planting a cache of communications jammers at a former medcenter on the former Separatist world of Murkhana. As a diversion, he arranged for Naval Intelligence to leak information of the communications cache to the Imperial Security Bureau. Acting on this information, ISB case officer Stellan sent the Koorivar ISB asset Bracchia to \"confirm\" this discovery. In response to the discovery of the Murkhana communications cache, the Emperor dispatched Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader on a mission to Murkhana to investigate the cache, which the ISB feared was a prelude to an insurgency campaign."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In anticipation of Tarkin's journey to Murkhana, the information broker Knotts negotiated a deal with Crymorah syndicate to supply fuel cells to the Sugi crime lord Faazah. The insurgents then lured Sergeant Crest and the stormtroopers guarding the Carrion Spike with a fake transmission purporting to be from Tarkin. Teller along with the insurgents Salikk, Dr. Artoz, Cala, Anora, and Hask then captured Tarkin's corvette, killing the ship's captain, communications officer, and two stormtroopers.

After traveling through the Fial system, Teller's insurgents traveled to the Galidraan system to attack Galidraan Station, which orbited the planet Galidraan III.

After jettisoning Vader's meditation sphere, the insurgents destroyed the system's hyperspace buoy before fleeing into hyperspace. The dissidents then raided the TaggeCo mining facilities on Lucazec. The insurgents also broadcast their attack on HoloNet, drawing the attention of the Emperor and the Imperial Ruling Council.

Teller posed as the Imperial Commander Abel LaSal and convinced the Phindian administrator of the orbiting tanker to allow his ship to refuel. However, the Phindian administrator alerted Tarkin and Vader to the presence of the Carrion Spike. Backed by Imperial reinforcements, Tarkin and Vader traveled to the Phindar system to intercept the insurgents. A dogfight broke out between the stolen Carrion Spike and the Imperial forces. Teller's insurgents flew the Carrion Spike around the tanker to frustrate Tarkin's Yellow Squadron of V-wings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the Imperial escort carrier Goliath could fire its proton torpedoes at the Carrion Spike, the insurgents jumped into hyperspace. Before leaving, they detonated an explosive device that had been planted in a used fuel cell left aboard the tanker. Three hours later, the insurgents transmitted another holovid of the incident in the Phindar system. In response to this attack, Vice Admiral Rancit convinced the Emperor to deploy Imperial forces to protect Imperial installations across the Perlemian Trade Route and the Hydian Way. In addition, the Empire deployed several interdictor vessels from the Deep Core Security Zone to assist in the hunt for the Carrion Spike."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Phindar dogfight, the insurgents headed to the Expansion Region near Thustra and Aquaris. During the journey, Cala discovered that the Empire was still tracking them with a paralight tracker. After Dr. Artoz destroyed the paralight tracker, Teller transmitted coordinates claiming that the insurgents were traveling aboard the Carrion Spike to the Obroa-skai system. Teller arranged with Knotts to send the YT-1000 light freighter Reticent as a decoy. The Reticent's Koorivar captain was transporting Sephi flyers to the medcenter on Obroa-skai. Acting on this disinformation, Tarkin and Vader deployed three interdictor vessels and several Imperial warships to Obroa-skai. However, one of the interdictors, a prototype Immobilizer 418 cruiser, malfunctioned and yanked out a large number of starships out of hyperspace.

After consulting with the HoloNet database, Tarkin discovered that Knotts, Teller, and the other insurgents were connected to the Antar Atrocity. He also realized that Teller had been impersonating Imperial officers. Tarkin also deduced that the insurgents were being aided by Vice Admiral Rancit, who had contact with Teller while stationed at Sentinel Base.

They set an empty Carrion Spike to travel on autopilot to Carida. In fact, Rancit had planned to destroy them and the Carrion Spike above Carida to achieve the two-fold goal of destroying evidence of his collusion with insurgents and gaining credit for destroying the insurgents.
