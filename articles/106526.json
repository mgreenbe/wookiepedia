After the Battle of Yavin, the farmer got into serious trouble because of wild creatures and bandits that plagued his farm. Handerin thus went to seek help from the Corellian Security Force. Around 1 ABY, CorSec Lieutenant Mack Jasper dispatched a recruit to help the farmer. Pol Handerin first tasked the CorSec agent to hunt and eliminate a pack of enraged carrion spats that did a lot of damage. The CorSec agent succeed and even killed the pack leader Gravefeather. Handerin then asked the CorSec agent to deal with a group of criminals, the Nedgarr Bandits, who damaged crops and stole grain. The mission was once again successful. The CorSec agent managed to recover the stolen grain and eliminate several bandits, including their leader Trae Nedgarr, during an assault on the Nedgarr Bandits Hideout. Handerin was really thankful for the help he received and that solved all his problems. When the CorSec agent mentioned his will to work for the government, Pol Handerin eagerly proposed to introduce the CorSec agent to his cousin, Gallura Handerin, a government aide in the Coronet Capitol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pol Handerin was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pol Handerin was added to the game with the expansion Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan, released on November 1, 2005.
