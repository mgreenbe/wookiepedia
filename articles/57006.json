It was built by the Green Jedi who had built it after learning the lessons that befell the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. In order to avoid such a similar fate, the site was built with powerful shields that were fuelled by internal reactors that protected the structure from attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Cold War, the reconstituted Sith Empire invaded Corellia and made the Green Jedi Enclave its top priority target but initial attempts at destroying it utterly failed. The site's shields protected the structure from the first assault and allowed the Jedi inhabitants to set up offensive cannons. This led to a Sith warship that was sent to destroy the Enclave being shot to pieces over the sector. A large part of the vessel managed to crash into the Enclave, however this failed to inflict heavy casualties or even substantially weaken the structure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result, the Green Jedi Enclave remained as the one failure of the Empire despite a nearly flawless invasion of the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Empire built CorSec's Imperial liaison building atop the enclave's remains."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
