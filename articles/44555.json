A suite generally consisted of various audio and visual sensors which would be added to the helmet of an armor set. The sensors were capable of sophisticated passive light amplification, thermal signature reading, ultrasound pickup, millimeter wave emission, video capture, and common optical enhancement. The overall effect of the sensors was to provide the wearer with increased awareness of their surroundings during battle, and to allow them to see in conditions such as fog, darkness or smoke. Several models of suite were available, all costing about  1750; these included the MULTI enhanced vision system by BioTech Industries, the Full-spectrum optical enhancer by Atlas Corp and the Anq-Y enhanced optics suite by Neuro-Saav Corporation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Enhanced optics suites were first mentioned in the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2013.
