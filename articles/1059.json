There were ten lights on the inside; three on each non-door wall and one large light on the ceiling. The same type of ceiling light was on the top and bottom of the elevator's exterior. 31174 was the middle elevator of its group of five sharing the same shaft. 31174 was secured to the shaft by two railings that ran along the left and right sides of the elevator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Coruscant, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker used this elevator while rescuing Chancellor Palpatine. While the duo was ascending up to the top of the tower, the lift had been shut down. Obi-Wan Kenobi sent R2-D2 to remedy this, but Anakin impatiently cut a hole in the roof of the lift. Meanwhile, R2-D2 managed to reactivate it, first sending it down and forcing Anakin to hang off a ledge, but then correcting its direction to up. Two OOM security battle droids held Anakin at gunpoint, but the Jedi leaped onto 31174 as it ascended by, and the two droids were destroyed. 31174 was later lost when the rear half of the Invisible Hand broke in two above Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
