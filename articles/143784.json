Wanting to settle scores with Solo once and for all, Greedo decides to collect Jabba Desilijic Tiure's bounty on Solo and enters Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina in Mos Eisley. As he enters the cantina, Greedo witnesses Wuher telling Luke Skywalker that his \"droids\" C-3PO and R2-D2 are not welcome at the establishment. While Greedo steels himself mentally for the encounter, he thinks about how his former lover Uncelta fell for Solo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside the cantina, Greedo glimpses Obi-Wan Kenobi slicing off Ponda Baba's hand and Solo chatting with Kenobi and Skywalker. After Solo's Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca exits the cantina, Greedo makes his move and confronts Solo. Solo tells him to tell Jabba that he has got the money. Greedo responds that is too late and boasts of collecting the bounty on Solo's head. When Solo reiterates that he has the money, Greedo dismisses it as a bribe. When Solo admits that he doesn't have the money with him, Greedo responds that Jabba has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at first sign of an Imperial cruiser. Solo responds that he jettisoned the cargo due to the arrival of an Imperial boarding party."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Greedo responds that Jabba might only take his ship, the Millennium Falcon, and tightens the trigger on his blaster.

His last memory was that of bitter injustice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This segment clearly shows Han shooting first, just like in the original version of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope before the release of the Special Edition in 1997. However, in asking a fan question whether Episode IV's theatrical version or its Special Edition version is the canon one, Lucasfilm Story Group's Matt Martin reiterated that the latter is the most accurate, as the nature of From a Certain Point of View included making various contradictions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
