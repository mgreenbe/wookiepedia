Its operating functions could make it near silent, and its spin-stabilized ferroceramic darts could puncture even the strongest armor plating and could even ignore energy shields. The darts were often coated in any of a variety of different substances that were designed with the intent to kill, subdue, or otherwise affect a target. Standard darts were loaded with no such substances and relied on armor penetration and the razor-sharp needle to inflict harm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
