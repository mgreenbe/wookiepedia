He would often incorporate Vec-Tech technology during speeder modifications. He was also a crime lord using his garage as a cover for his operations. He hired actors to pretend to be mechanics while the real operation took place in an underground garage. There he employed slaves like Sil Vaturha to fix broken swoops. In addition almost every part and vehicle he sold was stolen. He employed the Razer swoop gang, who acquired most of his stolen merchandise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one time he sponsored Team NaKuda, a swoop racing team, but as he never gambled on swoop races he quickly became bored with the endeavor and disbanded the team despite their early success. When one of his racers, Chugg, was badly injured in a crash, Kaylo helped nurse him back to health, resulting in Chugg pledging his loyalty to Kaylo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point his criminal operations became known to agents of the Sector Rangers, a law-enforcement agency, and officer Narra Mesyne, under the alias \"Miraj,\" infiltrated the racing circuit of the Pits in order to observe Kaylo's operation and gather evidence.
