Each network covered a number of systems, and maintained offices on the planet Findris. Colonial News Nets was pro-Imperial, and supported law and order. However, the agency believed that the Empire should adhere to its own laws, which caused friction between the agency and Imperial political offices. Colonial News Nets staff included Pertaal Shenvehr, an assistant features editor who was responsible for several features such as \"Art Galaxy Roundup,\" \"Personalities in the News,\" and \"Ask Argothil Anything\"; Fionna Flannis, a journalist who reported on social events, personalities and celebrities; and Alandra Mipsy, who covered the political and social scene on the planet Procopia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
