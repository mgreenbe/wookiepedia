Transfer registers recorded transactions throughout the galaxy, by the use of an electro-optical device, which recorded the prints of buyers and sellers. Instead of inputting the required print into a transfer register, an anti-register duplicated the requested print contained within any security or registration system. Paxxi Derida invented the anti-register, which proved invaluable in the Phindian's rebellion against the Syndicat. During the rebellion, Paxxi's anti-register was destroyed by blaster fire when he threw it to protect Kaadi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
