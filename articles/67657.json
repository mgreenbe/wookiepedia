In 3631 BBY he resided on Nar Shaddaa, where a failed Jedi trainee Languss Tuno has been pestering Isaac to take him on as a Padawan and teach him the ways of the Force. Isaac instead used Guss as his errand boy, teaching him how to use the Force to get discount on his drinks such as Tarisian ale. When Guss brought a visitor, the Outlander, to his apartment, Isaac made with the Outlander a wager: if the Outlander could teach Guss to perform a mind trick, Isaac would owe a favor to him, otherwise the Outlander would owe a favor to Isaac. After the Outlander took Guss to try out this challenge, the two met Isaac in the Promenade cantina, where Isaac allowed the Outlander to take Guss with him to join the Anti-Zakuul Alliance. Isaac admits that he never completed his Padawan training himself during his youth and asked the Outlander to treat Guss well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isaac appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire during the Guss Tuno Alliance alert mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
