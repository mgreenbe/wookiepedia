One was used on the Towani family's starcruiser when it crashed on Endor. It was later stolen by Terak, King of the Sanyassan Marauders. A similar device had been employed by Salak Weet and Noa Briqualon in their starship around 26 BBY; that crystal had been shattered during the crash, stranding the two scouts on the moon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
