She was perhaps best known for her \"Save the Stohl\" campaign. Ree owned a specially-trained attack stohl named Needla, which bit an overzealous fan during an autograph session.

The result of the media coverage was that attack stohls were hunted for the fun of it, until Shantee Ree launched her campaign to save the species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
