It was the lush, wroshyr tree-filled homeworld of the Wookiees. It was a member of the Galactic Republic, endured enslavement under the Galactic Empire, and later joined the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Natural features"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Geography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With no axial tilt and a perfectly circular orbit, Kashyyyk experienced one continuous season. It was composed of a molten metallic core, rocky mantle, and a silicate rock crust. The planet had four continents, making up 40% of the surface, which were mostly covered in lush, wroshyr tree-filled forests, which were several kilometers high. The planet did have a small amount of desert region in the rain-shadow of its small mountain ranges as well as large plains including the Woolwarricca region. A tropical ocean belt contained archipelagos and long coral reefs. In addition, a few sandy beaches could be found along the shores of its oceans. The Kashyyyk coastlines were lined with a brownish-white sand and thick grasses. Kashyyyk's highest peak was Korrokrrayyo Mountain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Much of the planet could be compared to a giant swamp\u2014filled with wildlife and covered with wet soil and large amounts of water. The prevalent ecology could be politely described as a \"layered deathtrap,\" as the dangers presented by local wildlife increased as one descended toward the forest floor. According to Wookiee culture, this vertical environment consisted of seven levels. The bulk of Wookiee civilization was located on the uppermost seventh level, and even the bravest Wookiees rarely ventured below the fourth level. Unlike most, Chewbacca was known to travel below this marking point for most Wookiees. The ground level was known as the Shadowlands and, sometimes, the \"notherworld.\""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Flora"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As previously stated, the wroshyr trees were the dominant flora. Wroshyr trees may have actually been one large connected organism, as when limbs of two tree limbs ran into each other, they would fuse together. The Wookiees inferred great symbolism in this. Jolee Bindo theorized that the species of wroshyr tree was in fact alien to the planet and was planted there by the Infinite Empire. This was based on information given by a Rakata computer left near one of their ancient Star Maps."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The forests of Kashyyyk were filled with a tremendous variety of plant life, many with some form of consciousness. The Wookiees learned to communicate with these plants and often came to an understanding about their use. One example of this was with the Orga plants, who allowed the Wookiees to harvest their older roots to use in Life Day ceremonies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most other flora was parasitic to the wroshyr trees, grew in dirt pockets in crevices of the trees, or was carnivorous. Chyntuck was a species of onion-like vegetable used by the Wookiees as food. The Kthysh was a vined plant used by the Wookiees to make bowcaster strings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were at least two types of large carnivorous plants in the lower levels. These included a carnivorous, spiked vine plant, and the infamous Syren plant, which played a crucial role in the coming of age rituals for various Wookiee tribes. Both of these plants were capable of consuming adolescent Wookiees or fully grown Humans."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fauna"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Besides the primary sentient Wookiees, Kashyyyk was home to various species of banthas, a small population of terentateks, and a host of other species. Usually, the deeper into the jungle one went, the more dangerous the animals became. For instance, the tenacious and intelligent wyyyschokk\u2014a giant red-pigmented spiderlike creature\u2014could track prey for over a kilometer and coordinate with other weavers to organize an ambush. Additionally, many of the species that inhabited the deeper parts of the jungle were capable of bio-phosphorescence, since the deeper layers of the forest were in perpetual darkness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Tho Yor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 36,453 BBY, a group of the native Wookiees entered a Tho Yor which visited the planet. This Tho Yor and those which visited other planets traveled to Tython, where the Je'daii Order, the earliest incarnation of the Jedi Order, was soon founded by the beings brought there by the Tho Yor. The Wookiees eventually moved off of Tython and settled the forest world of Ska Gora."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Infinite Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point after the departure of the Tho Yor, Kashyyyk was taken over by the Rakatan Infinite Empire.

They recognized the Wookiees' strength and began to enslave them. In 3993 BBY during the Great Hunt, the Jedi Guun Han Saresh died on the planet fighting a terentatek."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Mandalorian Wars, the Mandalorians considered conquering Kashyyyk, although they eventually decided against it; their plans for assault included burning down huge sections of forest and glassing entire continents in order to actually create a place to fight. Sometime after the Mandalorian Wars began, self-exiled Jedi Jolee Bindo made his home on the forest floor of Kashyyyk. In 3976 BBY, Zaalbar, a Wookiee who later aided Jedi Revan, had been banished from Kashyyyk and his brother, Chuundar, usurped the position of Chieftain from his father, Freyyr. Chuundar allowed the Czerka to take Wookiees as slaves in exchange for weapons. Freyyr went into self-exile to the Shadowlands of Kashyyyk. Czerka's control of \"Edean\" was disrupted when, in 3956 BBY, the enslaved Wookiee populace, led by Freyyr and Revan, overthrew the local corporate headquarters and drove all outsiders off the planet, save for the Ebon Hawk crew."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Old Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was presumably some time after this that Kashyyyk decided to join the Galactic Republic. The Wookiees reverse-engineered the hyperdrive from a Trandoshan vessel. They were welcomed into the Republic through dealings with the Corellians, Verpine, and Alderaanians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Cold War, a proxy conflict between the Sith Empire and Galactic Republic, one of the oldest wroshyr trees on Kashyyyk\u2014reportedly millennia old\u2014was dying, and eventually someone was sent to examine its rings and learn more about the planet's history. Around the same time, an eccentric hermit that lived on Kashyyyk gave up his isolation and rewarded those that managed to solve his old riddles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1,003 BBY during the New Sith Wars, the planet was conquered by the Brotherhood of Darkness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Kashyyyk was represented in the Galactic Senate, with Senator Yarua being the last Kashyyyk representative prior to the outbreak of the Clone Wars.

During the Dark Reaper Project of 22 BBY, the Force Harvester found by Count Dooku on Raxus Prime was tested on the neighboring world of Alaris Prime, but all of the Separatists were forced off the moon afterward, ending the immediate Separatist threat to the system. A small attack on Kashyyyk itself occurred some time later, but this too was repelled, and Kashyyyk retained its non-aligned posture eighteen months into the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The decision on what role the planet would play in the conflict was left in the hands of a number of Wookiee Royal Families, acting through a council dominated by King Grakchawwaa. He initially advocated neutrality, engaging in limited negotiations with both the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, which wished to control hyperspace route planning and to use the Wookiees' secret trade routes to disrupt Republic trade and communication, giving them the advantage in the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, in 21 BBY, General Grievous grew tired of waiting and ordered the Trade Federation officials to launch several probe droids to help 'persuade' Grakchawwaa to make the right decision. He was on the verge of agreeing to join the Confederacy out of self-preservation, when news came that his son, Prince Rikummee, had accidentally been killed by the droids. In anger he allied himself with the Republic, ultimately forcing the Separatists to mount a massive invasion in the closing stages of the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, a rescue mission led by Jedi General Etain Tur-Mukan and RC-1138, was in the process to rescue Chieftain Tarfful held captive by Trandoshans. The mission was carried out by Commandos of the Delta Squad, who increasingly found more separatist collaborationist among the neighboring Trandoshans than they thought, including General Grievous. In response, the Republic dispatched a task force led by Master Yoda and Clone Commander Gree to defend Kashyyyk. At the coastal city of Kachirho, a combined force of clone troopers and Wookiees fought against the Separatist droid invaders, with Yoda himself participating in the battle. Despite the overwhelming Separatist forces, the Republic and the Wookiees emerged victorious from the Battle of Kashyyyk, though taking very heavy casualties. Not long afterward, the secretly married Jedi couple of Kento and Mallie Marek took refuge on Kashyyyk, and the pregnant Mallie gave birth to Galen on Kashyyyk."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Empire and slavery"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, victory was short-lived for the Wookiees. With the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Jedi were branded enemies of the Republic/Empire as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, secretly Darth Sidious, made himself Emperor and initiated Order 66. The clone troopers then took control of Kashyyyk, killing Luminara Unduli, sending Quinlan Vos into hiding, and forcing Yoda to kill Gree and discreetly escape from the battle on a Can-cell. Later Yoda escaped the planet, with the help of Tarfful and Chewbacca via a former Republic escape pod. The Empire was quick to suppress Kashyyyk by renaming it \"Wookiee Planet C\" (as it was the third orbit in its system) and placed it under martial law."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several months later, a group of Jedi including Olee Starstone went to Kashyyyk to search for the other Jedi who had been there. The Empire, led by Darth Vader, tracked them and attacked the planet. In response, the Wookiees rebelled against their oppressors, but were ultimately unsuccessful. Clone troopers attempted to land, but many were shot down by abandoned Confederate weaponry utilized by the Wookiees. Darth Vader landed and killed two Jedi before being stopped by Master Roan Shryne, who also died at Vader's hand. The orbital fleet bombarded the planet, causing severe damage on the surface. Wookiees either escaped into the undergrowth or into space, where they were stopped by a Detainer CC-2200 interdictor cruiser. Starstone had slicer Filli Bitters slice into an abandoned CIS ship and crash it into the interdictor cruiser. Many refugees escaped, including Starstone and her Jedi friends, Filli and his smuggling group, and Chewbacca. The Empire occupied the planet, allowing then-Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, one of the Imperial commanders that participated in the battle, to capture and export Wookiees as slave labor to Despayre, in order to help construct the First Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 18 BBY, Mallie Marek was killed by the remnant of the droids and Trandoshans from the battle a year prior. Almost immediately, her death caused Palpatine to sense Kento's presence on Kashyyyk, thus he sent Vader to eliminate him. Vader and his troops met heavy resistance from the local Wookiee population, but ultimately the 501st Legion succeeded in crushing the uprising. During the battle, Vader bested and killed Kento Marek. Upon discovering his opponent's son Galen Marek, whom he found to be extremely powerful in the Force, Vader exterminated all witnesses, including the stormtrooper commander, and went on to train the boy as his secret apprentice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the occupation, Kashyyyk was opened by the Imperial authorities to slavers from neighboring Trandosha and Mytaranor. At the advice of the Trandoshans, the Empire began using the powerful Wookiees to carry out slave labor. Wookiee captives were used for countless Imperial projects, including the Maw Installation. However, because of their devotion to their homeworld, many Wookiees would evade the Imperial garrison there to revisit their beloved forests for important Wookiee holidays such as Life Day."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 BBY, Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan was secretly sent by Emperor Palpatine to be held as a hostage on the planet, in order to keep her adoptive father from speaking out against the Empire. Leia was placed under custody of the local commander, Captain Ozzik Sturn, who used to hunt Wookiees for sport, and confined in her private quarters. Eventually, she was rescued by Galen Marek, himself on a mission by Jedi Master Rahm Kota to track down Bail Organa. Leia promised to reveal the location of her father, but only if Galen was able to destroy a skyhook, which was designed to transfer Wookiees offworld for slave labor. Galen headed to the construction site, slaying Captain Sturn and destroying the skyhook.
