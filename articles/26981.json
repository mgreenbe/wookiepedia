Following the Great Calamity which occurred after the Hundred-Year Darkness, the Jedi ancestors of the Doomed hid their last remaining starship Last Hope within the Keshiri catacombs beneath the Circle Eternal. By 5000 BBY, it served as the gathering place for the Neshtovar council and was used for public meetings and trials. The Keshiri geologist Adari Vaal was tried for heresy there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Human Sith Tribe took over Keshtah Minor, they built a cluster of buildings on the site of the Circle Eternal in 4975 BBY. The Tribe's founder and first Grand Lord had ordered the construction of this complex to commemorate the twenty-fifth arrival of the Tribe, who had become regarded by the native Keshiri as the legendary Protectors, mythical deities in Keshiri religion. At the center of this complex was the capitol building which became the official residence of the Grand Lord."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Circle became used for hosting celebrations like Testament Day, the Festival of Nida's Rise and the Founding of the Tribe. It later fell into ruins and disrepair during the Time of the Rot, a 960-year period of civil war and instability within the Sith Tribe. During the Hilts Restoration, the new Grand Lord Varner Hilts oversaw the rebuilding of the Circle Eternal. During the Siege of Tahv in 2974 BBY, the plaza was damaged when the Sith anarchist Parlan Spinner's Jedi Starship departed from its underground base. Later, the plaza sustained further damage when the Sith Lord Remulus Dreypa's Leviathans attacked the city."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
