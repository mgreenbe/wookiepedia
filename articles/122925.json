In response the Empire sent Admiral Adar Tallon and General Jan Dodonna to deal with the holdout. After a string of losses for Toora, she was finally cornered over the planet Trasemene and a bloody battle ensued in which Toora died aboard her flagship Defiance's Banner.

After this loss the Muun leadership dug in on the planet Binquaros and sent their fleet to Bimmiel. Romodi began to grind down the holdouts on Binquaros while Screed shredded the Separatist fleet at Bimmiel. While all this was going on, a group of pirates and Mandalorians who had been pushed from the Salin Corridor broke through Screed's rear guard and beat Romodi on Binquaros, freeing the Muun.

The invasion began with an AT-TE, five AT-RTs, and 246 Stormtroopers. The two armies squared-off at a cliffside. The Separatists held a banner which read in part \"General Rohn is a\". The Imperial general ordered his forces to advance and take the banner down. Taking casualties, the Separatists slowly fell back. Clone commander noticed something strange about the retreat, and tried to get Rohn to call off the pursuit. He ran to the transport, and Rohn ordered him to stand down. He then boarded the transport, avoiding getting hit by two of the AT-RTs which had been ordered to take him into custody, one of which hit the transport, and Commander Malsuum killed him as the general tried to forbid anyone from retreating. Malsuum was unable to stop the advance, and all the stormtroopers were killed within fifteen minutes by an ambush by Farstar, who had planted two armies on either side of the canyon.

Malsuum then went to sabotage their operation in order to quickly end the fighting. He was able to disengage the shield, allowing the Imperial fighters to attack the city. Vader then led the ground forces into the city. Kaddak personally engaged Malsuum in personal combat. The army slaughtered all resistance in an hour as the city was left in ruins from the aerial strikes.

The engineers of the 501st destroyed the experimental droid schematics and planted an orbital beacon in the droid factory while engaging the enemies they had thought they would never see again.

Even with this setback, Blox flew a privateer vessel in support bearing a Rebel letter of marque and reprisal. The Rebels managed to get their hands on Separatist war material, such as Lucrehulk-class battleships, Recusant-class light destroyers, Providence-class carrier/destroyers and Munificent-class star frigates.
