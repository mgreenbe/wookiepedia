They had a unique spiritual connection with technology, and were capable of controlling droids or sending information directly into their memory banks. The Sight Voltaic was headquartered in a monolithic structure in the forest of an unknown world. Traditionally, Sight Voltaic members did not interfere with the affairs of the galaxy, and kept a very low profile during the reign of the Galactic Empire. However, the creation of the Death Star, a battlestation capable of destroying entire planets, prompted Sister Lony Coleema to disobey the counsel of Signal-father Cuulomb and join the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
