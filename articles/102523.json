Unlike the 3PO-series protocol droid, the PD-series enclosed its torso wires under plasteel plating, and all joints were treated with weather-resistant industrial sealant. The outer casing was fully shock-proof. The head was designed with stylized features familiar to the Lurrians, and a jutting brow ridge was added to prevent falling snow from obscuring the droid's twin photoreceptors. The PD-series was powered by an AA-1 VerboBrain, with extensive information on genetics and DNA programmed in place of sixty percent of standard language programming."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because Lur was infamous for its gale-force winds and steep terrain, the PD droid's hands were replaced with heavy servogrips, and could be launched from the wrists to find purchase on any terrain. A line of thin but strong cable connected to the forearm, and could easily pull the droid up the steepest of cliff faces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lurrians were impressed by the protocol droid, and thousands of PD-series droids were produced. However, the entire line went unsold when the Galactic Empire quarantined the entire Lurrian homeworld, to keep Lur's genetic scientists under Emperor Palpatine's watch.
