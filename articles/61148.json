During the Great Hyperspace Disaster, when debris from the freighter Legacy Run was sent hurtling into the star system at great speeds, a large tank of supercooled liquid tibanna was set on a direct course for the star. As the star was R-class, a collision would result in a rapid chain reaction that would cause the star to surge outward and flare up to nearly double its original size, emitting radiation that would fry the entire system. The disaster was averted, however, when Jedi Master Avar Kriss led an enormous effort, connecting Jedi from across the galaxy through the Force to change the course of the tank at the last minute, with it only grazing the star's photosphere. As the effort was broadcast galaxy-wide, Kriss became renowned as a hero."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
