The heavily modified glider was covered in reflec panels that baffled standard sensors, allowing for infiltrating behind enemy lines. Its augmented repulsorlift generator could carry a much heavier load in addition to the pilot, and an added pull-down display visor granted the user night-vision, terrain-following and directional modes. It was also equipped with low power transponders to allow troops to locate each other after landing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gunman, a member of the paramilitary unit Churhee's Riflemen, had experience with the gliders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
