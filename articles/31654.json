When the Jedi Master Gnost-Dural and the Republic spy Theron Shan were looking for a Twi'lek smuggler named Teff'ith, they were directed to the Crooked Finger. Upon their arrival, it was populated by criminals and armed thugs. Two large Nikto were standing by the door and tried to extort the pair for a fifty credit cover fee, but Master Dural convinced the Nikto, using a mind trick, that he and Shan were friends of the bar's owner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
