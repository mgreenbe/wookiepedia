The Republic Defense Coalition maintained a small peacekeeping fleet, which included the Emissary-class Republic Cruiser Third Horizon, commanded by Admiral Pevel Kronara. The RDC was governed by the Republic Defense Coalition treaties."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Great Hyperspace Disaster in 232 BBY, the Republic did not require a standing military force, as both the expanding Hutts remained quiet and the Mandalorians had not caused trouble for some time. Instead, the RDC relied on its Emissary-class cruisers as well as smaller craft for support. However, should a serious threat emerge, the RDC could activate the treaties it had signed with Republic worlds such as Alderaan and Chandrila, asking for ships and personnel which would be returned once the emergency had passed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 232 BBY, the Hetzal system was threatened when a freighter ship called the Legacy Run was torn apart in hyperspace, causing anomalies to shoot towards the system's three inhabited bodies. Ships of the RDC had been present in the Outer Rim for a conclave between the Jedi Order and the Republic on the Starlight Beacon space station and, as such, the Third Horizon was sent to save the star system, with Jedi Master Avar Kriss in charge of the operation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
