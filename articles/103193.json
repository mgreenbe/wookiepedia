The squat weapon fired a high-caliber round, but the barrel could barely extend past most species' knuckles. This made it easy to wield in close-quarters combat, but wildly inaccurate. Further, the extractor required constant tension adjustments, which made jammings and misfires common."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Easy to find and commonly available throughout the Western Reaches and Wild Space, the Panic Pistol was popular with those that lived on frontier worlds, such as Cerea, Jakku, and Rattatak. It was also popular with some of Rebel Alliance cells stationed in the Outer Rim Territories."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
