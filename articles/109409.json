Molto was a skilled swoop racer, but he could not keep up with the other racers due to expensive modifications to their swoops. Revan gave him five hundred credits to buy the upgrades. Sometime later, Revan returned to the Manaan swoop track to find that Queedle had become the Sector Champion, and repaid Revan the full amount he loaned him. But Molto's fame was short-lived when Revan himself beat his time and became Sector Champion. Regardless, he was always grateful to Revan for helping him achieve a better place among the swoop racer community."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even though he is shown as an Ithorian, he is referred to as an Aqualish by the two Sith troopers who talk outside of the swoop racer administration who also state that his homeworld is Ando.
