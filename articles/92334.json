When organic material, such as grass, was fed into the rear of the unit, the device destabilized the bonds of the materials' molecular structure. The resultant energy release allowed the device to reconstitute the material into another form. The resulting material was dependent on the material that was fed into the device; for instance, the grass from Karra could be used to produce a celluloid cloth or rope."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
