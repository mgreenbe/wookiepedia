The sentry droids were over two meters tall, with matte-black plating. Their faceplates had no features aside from a glowing blue-white insignia of the Nihil, three lightning bolts. The droid sentries had limbs and bodies that were studded with spikes, and their hands were made of heavy alloys that could crush bone and tissue. As such, the droids had no need to carry weapons. The droids were part of the safeguards set up by Asgar Ro when he reorganized the marauder organization, becoming Eye of the Nihil. His son, Marchion, inherited the droids along with Ro's other safeguards after he died. Two droid sentries guarded a small structure on the platform that was the Great Hall of the Nihil, which held the entry airlock and docking mechanisms and a small complex of private rooms. When Marchion Ro met with the Nihil's three Tempest Runners following the Great Hyperspace Disaster, they entered the complex past the droid sentries, who bowed as they passed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
