The cave was located in the Tusken March region of Tatooine, near Fort Tusken. The cave was where a tribe of Tusken Raiders kept their most sacred relics. These relics included a ghastly gaderffii baton, a chieftain's skull, and a krayt dragon head. Sometime after the Battle of Yavin, during the Galactic Civil War\u2014a series of conflicts between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic\u2014, the relics were stolen from the cave by a spacer hired by the scholar Srimaur. This provoked the Tuskens to attack the city of Mos Espa in retribution."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tusken Relic Cave appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. The Tusken Relic Cave was added to the game on November 1, 2007 as part of the \"Chapter 7: A Collection of Heroes\" game update. It was part of the quest known as \"Tusken Relics\" that the player was required to complete before they could access the \"Tusken Army\" heroic encounter, which depicted an attack on Mos Espa by the aforementioned Tusken army. The player had to reach the combat level of 70 before they could acquire the quest, though it was recommended to be level ninety, the level cap, before attempting it alone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
