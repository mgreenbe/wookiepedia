Namely, they possessed a black chest-plate and gauntlets, their helmets' front was colored black while the rest was red, and they wore a black cape. In some cases, they wore ornate armor with hoods and a scythe-like force pike.

They endured years of selection procedures and training aimed at achieving perfection in soldiering. Extreme standards were set for combat fitness, stamina, strength, dexterity, mental acuity, reaction time, loyalty and intelligence. Their combat training included the use of heavy blaster pistols and the deadly double vibroblade. They also had access to Emperor's Royal Guard TIE/IN starfighters, and were often sent on extremely vital missions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finally, several of the Sovereign Protector would receive rudimentary training from Senior Dark Side Adepts (such as Arden Lyn) to wield the dark side of the Force\u2014although not enough to provide independence or stoke ambition.
