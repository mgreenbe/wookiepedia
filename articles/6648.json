It was considered the site of naval power, tradition and prestige by both the Galactic Republic and the Galactic Empire. Anaxes shared its sun, Solis Axum, with Selgon, Grastes, Axum, Urfon, Phlors Rex, Phlors Regina, and Ichium."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Azure Imperium"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Discovered by early space-faring Humans before the foundation of the Galactic Republic, colonists from Coruscant settled the world after arriving in the Axum system on sleeper ships. For tens of thousands of years the Anaxsi inhabited the world, and Anaxes became the chief shipyard and fortress world of the Azure Imperium, which ruled the surrounding systems from Anaxes' sister world Axum."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Defender of the Core"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25,000 BBY, Anaxes and Axum were among the Core Founders of the Galactic Republic, and the Azure Imperium peacefully assimilated into the new government. Anaxes continued to serve as the Republic's primary fleet base and shipyard, guarding the approach to Coruscant along the Perlemian Trade Route. Flourishing over the next several centuries, Anaxes was home to the Republic Navy War College, the primary naval strategy facility in the galaxy, housed in the massive Anaxes Citadel, which was established with Republic funding to consecrate the power and prestige of the Republic Navy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 5000 BBY the Great Hyperspace War erupted with the Sith Empire's invasion of Coruscant under the command of Naga Sadow. Rallying at Anaxes, the Republic Navy counterattacked and drove the Sith from Coruscant. Following the Ruusan Reformations and the dismantling of much of the Republic's armed forces, the Naval College was largely moribund, but was reestablished as the College of Planetary Security Forces to train officers for local defense forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Republic's Golden Age, Anaxes produced many notable Admirals and navy personnel.

The Republic was eventually victorious after killing the CIS Commander and utterly destroying the fleet. A pivotal battle in the war, the outcome decided who would control the Core Worlds and as such, the victors were hailed as heroes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Galactic Empire rose to power in 19 BBY, many career officers from \"Generational\" families were cast aside for devotees of the Empire. However, they also made sure the wellsprings of the Navy's tradition continued. Anaxes soon became the command center for the Imperial Center Oversector, a move by Emperor Palpatine to smooth over any misgivings the world's populace might have towards his ascension to power and restructuring of the Imperial Navy. Upon the creation of Azure Hammer Command, whose Super Star Destroyer Whelm and fifty-seven other capital ships defended Sector Zero, Anaxes was chosen as its command base. A separate command called Azure Shield was created to protect the Azure sector and its neighbors. Azure Hammer Command was led by Grand Admiral Osvald Teshik until the Battle of Yavin."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Azure Hammer Command, Anaxes Citadel, and all forces in Sector Zero were constantly changed hands as warlords attempted to take the throne after Palpatine's death at the Battle of Endor. While Admiral Osted Wermis held out for nearly five years, the death of Warlord Zsinj pushed Wermis towards signing a treaty with the New Republic. Wermis' hand was forced when Admiral Feyet Kiez absconded from the Axum system in 9 ABY with the Star Dreadnought Whelm, having been summoned by the resurrected Emperor Palpatine to his growing empire in the Deep Core. The linchpin of his defense gone, Wermis surrendered Anaxes to the New Republic shortly afterwards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A sign of stability and comfort to New Republic citizens, the world held out through the Yuuzhan Vong War, though its involvement was unremarkable.

It was home to Azure Motorworks, a major producer of luxury vehicles. Considered an ecumenopolis, in that it was a planet-wide city, it was more reminiscent of a Green Coruscant, though, in that it was sprinkled with beautiful parks and green areas in and around the city like the Great Plain of Anaxes. Anaxes' industrial output was considered impressive relative to other systems, but it was much smaller than neighboring Axum's."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anaxes was also home to Keffis, which the resident Anaxsi bred for not only riding, but prestige.

The arc, though initially unproduced, would have focused on a clone commando unit called The Bad Batch. Jason Fry admitted he was disappointed that the planet he created seemingly didn't make it into the series, but his luck would end up changing for the better, as the arc was eventually completed and aired February 21, 2020 on Disney+ after the series was revived two years earlier."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
