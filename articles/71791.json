Following the death of Jabba in 4 ABY, Idrall formed a small criminal organization, with about 20 people working for him. They carried out a number of illegal activities, including extortion, smuggling and stealing supplies from the Galactic Empire, which they sold on to other criminals. Idrall tried to make his organization seem bigger than it actually was, by having his men spread stories about him and by moving with his men from system to system, performing operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on Tatooine, Idrall sent a number of his operatives to attack some spies of the rival crime lord Rethorn. The attack was reported to the New Republic by Commander Janson Edgewood and it helped to convince them that Idrall posed a serious threat, so they posted a bounty of 15,000 credits on him. Around this time, Idrall's organization began to lose control of some of its operations to the rival criminal Talon Karrde."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
