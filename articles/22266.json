He served in the Mission to Kynachi. He hardly talked at all, which led to one trooper to say that Chatterbox would beat Knuckles in a quiet contest, as he didn't even snore. Along with fellow troopers Breaker, Sharp and Knuckles, he formed the famed Breakout Squad, led by Jedi Padawan Nuru Kungurama. On a diplomatic mission into Chiss space, freighter pilot Lalo Gunn developed a liking for him. They then became trapped by a black hole but escaped using an ancient artifact. Breakout Squad and Chatterbox then went to Vaced, and an imagecaster led them to Bilbringi Depot. There, he was shot by a B1-Series battle droid and wounded. Breakout Squad then returned to Coruscant. Their next mission was to escort a freighter to Fondor, and then rescued younglings from pirates on Foless."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Breakout Squad's formation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "CT-5177, known as \"Chatterbox,\" was a Galactic Republic clone trooper, a soldier of the Grand Army of the Republic and a clone of the Human bounty hunter Jango Fett. At the time of the Clone Wars, he stood 1.83 meters tall. In 21 BBY, Chatterbox served on the mission to Kynachi, under the command of Jedi Master Ring-Sol Ambase and Captain Lock. Their transport was ambushed, leading to the death of Lock and the disappearance of Ambase. Chatterbox and his fellow clones, along with the Jedi Padawan Nuru Kungurama, rallied and liberated the planet from its occupation by the Techno Union and Overseer Umbrag. The clones became known as the Breakout Squad.

They got onboard Gunn's ship and clashed with the sniper's transport, which ended with both ships crashing and the apparent death of the sniper. Gunn and Breakout Squad parted ways, but not before she shared a kiss with Chatterbox. Kungurama found an imagecaster which led Breakout Squad to take Sommilor's freighter to Bilbringi Depot, where they clashed with Umbrag again. They freed the depot from the droid forces, but the last battle droid shot Chatterbox in the back."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Confrontation on Coruscant"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Breakout Squad finished the investigation of the Depot, and discovered that the Sommilor who had been killed on Vaced was an impostor; the real Sommilor was freed from his captivity in the freighter's hold.

They then returned to Coruscant, where they planned on taking Chatterbox to the Jedi Temple for treatment. Jedi Master Harro Kelpura, though, ordered the freighter to change course to his lab in Dacho District, which had been broken into. The ship was then damaged by an impact with another dropship, which crashed but was able to take off and escape. After Kungurama confronted his missing master, Ambase, Chatterbox was returned to the Temple for care.
