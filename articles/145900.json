These families consisted of groups led by Broga Masrii, Jeelta and Portho Kaltemmic following the discovery of Venenit queshaaga. The properties of the compound proved to be a vital attraction to the Galactic Republic who had difficult in refining the substance and turned to the Hutt Cartel.

The Three Families ran the Quesh refineries and processing plants while the Republic controlled the mines. This arrangement allowed the families to guard the secret of adrenal creation which made them incredibly wealthy. However, a problem with this arrangement was that their split from the Hutt Cartel meant that the reconstituted Sith Empire could strike at the Republic's adrenal production without fear of Hutt reprisal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
