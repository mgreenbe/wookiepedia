Sometime before the start of the Clone Wars, Jmmaar and fellow Jedi Master T'chooka D'oon were sent to the planet Kalee to put an end to the Huk War, a conflict that began after the Huk species invaded Kalee to enslave the native Kaleesh. Through the persuasion of the Galactic Republic Senate, both Jmmaar and D'oon decided to aid and pledge support for the Huks, which drove the Kaleesh into a state of depression and starvation.
