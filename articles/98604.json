Its boarding hatch was at the very front of the shuttle, unlike later variants, which had the cockpit jutting over the hatch. The pilots' chairs lowered into the boarding area for them to enter and exit the cockpit. It also had a magnetic clamp on its ventral side capable of attaching to smaller payloads such as escape pods."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was primarily used by the Grand Army of the Republic for missions which required them to operate far away from bases and capital ships.
