Zannah had to find passage to Onderon to meet her master, Darth Bane. After the Star-Wake took off, Zannah was pulling a blaster out of a trunk when she was confronted by Tallo. There was a scuffle and Tallo was shot. Bordon walked in on the murder and he was killed next. Zannah went into the cockpit and killed Irtanna after she attempted to defuse the situation. Wend begged for his life, but the Sith shot him anyway. She dragged the bodies into the hold, set the ship on autopilot, and headed for Onderon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
