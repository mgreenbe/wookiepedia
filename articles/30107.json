When the Empire invaded Corellia, Corgan and his troops were stationed in the Labor Valley of the Coronet City. When it became apparent that the Corellian StarDrive corporation was behind many of the rebels, Sturm and his men took it upon themselves to destroy their assets. Explosives were placed in their headquarters and were ready to be detonated, when the signal from Corgan's detonator got jammed.
