One room was dedicated to the Battle of Yavin and contained a cutaway model of the Death Star, including a list of personnel. The purpose of the display was to illustrate the devastation of war, regardless of the outcome. Luke Skywalker once saw this display, and was shocked by the number of lives he had taken at Yavin. It made such an impression that even twenty years later, he could still repeat the statistics."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
