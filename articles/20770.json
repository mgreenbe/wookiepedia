Brochure droids were equipped with repulsorlifts for travel and conversed in an enthusiastic, cheerful, mechanical voice. They were programmed to recognize various body types, atmosphere requirements, and languages. This helped brochure droids to recommend various nearby attractions, help a tourist find lodgings and eating establishments, and instruct tourists on how to arrange tours."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
