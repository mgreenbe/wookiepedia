An Imperial general, Bast was stationed on the first Death Star, the Galactic Empire's planet-destroying superweapon, where he served as the chief personal aide to Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and the subordinate to High General Cassio Tagge. In 0 BBY, Bast was present for a meeting in the battlestation's conference room, discussing the lost Death Star plans, which had been stolen by the Rebel Alliance. After the Battle of Yavin began, Bast received information that the Rebels had found a small vulnerable thermal exhaust port in the Death Star's superstructure. Since the exhaust port was a danger to the battlestation, Bast wanted Tarkin to evacuate the Death Star, although the Grand Moff believed that the Imperial forces would thwart the Rebels' attack. However, after the Rebel Luke Skywalker successfully launched a proton torpedo into the Death Star's thermal exhaust port, the Death Star exploded, killing Bast and everyone else on board."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Service aboard the Death Star"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moradmin Bast, a Human male, hailed from the planet Dura-Kahn. At a young age, Bast learned patience and cunning abilities by hunting big-game on his homeworld.

Prior to the start of the Galactic Civil War, which began in 2 BBY, the general was assigned to serve as the subordinate to High General Cassio Tagge, the head of Army Operations aboard the first Death Star battlestation. In this capacity, Bast frequently acted as the chief personal aide to Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, the battlestation's lead commander. Admiral Conan Antonio Motti, the head of Navy Operations aboard the Death Star, feared Bast and Tagge, due to their loyalty and respect toward Tarkin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the destruction of Alderaan in 0 BBY, Bast attended a staff conference on the battlestation. The Death Star's command staff\u2014which included Tarkin, Tagge, and Motti\u2014discussed the Rebel Alliance and its possession of the Death Star's technical schematics, which had been stolen by the Rebels during the Battle of Toprawa. Believing that the Death Star was \"the ultimate power in the universe,\" Motti wanted to use the station to threaten the Rebels, although the Dark Lord Darth Vader reassured Motti that the Death Star's destructive capability was insignificant next to the power of the Force.

Tracking the starship to the Yavin system, the Death Star approached its target\u2014Yavin 4, home of the Rebel base. Before the Death Star could fire on Yavin 4, the station had to orbit around the planet Yavin Prime.

As the battle raged, military analysts informed Bast that the vulnerability of the thermal exhaust port in the face of the Rebel starfighter attack posed a real danger to everyone aboard the battlestation. Wary of the Rebels' cunning, Bast immediately brought this information to Tarkin in the Death Star's overbridge and inquired whether the Grand Moff wished to have his ship ready for evacuation, but Tarkin contemptuously brushed his recommendations aside. Despite his reservations, Bast remained with his superior officer and watched as the battlestation approached Yavin 4."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the Death Star cleared the planet, Tarkin, without hesitation, ordered a nearby engineer to fire the superlaser on Yavin 4 to end the Rebel Alliance. However, Tenn Graneet, the master chief petty officer responsible for firing the superlaser, momentarily hesitated. Graneet's delay allowed Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker to successfully fire a pair of proton torpedoes into the thermal exhaust port before the superlaser was fired.

A confident man who rarely underestimated his enemies, Bast often praised the work that Tarkin had done on the Death Star. During the meeting aboard the Death Star prior to the Battle of Yavin, Bast remained quiet throughout. As Tarkin's chief personal aide, Bast became concerned for Tarkin's well being during the ensuing battle and delivered the Grand Moff information regarding the Rebel attack on the battlestation, including an offer to evacuate. However, Tarkin dismissed Bast's report as an overestimation of the Rebels' chances at victory, which ultimately cost the Grand Moff his life, as the Death Star was soon obliterated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bast had brown hair, lightly-colored eyes, and light skin.
