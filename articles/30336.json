While working in old chemical pipes, the team was ambushed by Rakghouls. Only two people survived the attack, a Human named Cera and a Sullustan named Garthe. They asked a traveling hero to go and investigate the chemical pipes to see if any of the group survived. None did; but a holo-recording was found of a dying member and it was reveled that he and Garthe had been stealing goods off of the very same bodies they were supposed to be counting. Garthe was later turned in by Cera."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cera, Garthe, and the group known as the corpse counters appeared in the 2011 MMORPG game Star Wars: The Old Republic produced by BioWare in the mission titled the same name; \"The Corpse Counters\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
