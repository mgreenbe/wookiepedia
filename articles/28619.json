Alliance doctrine dictated that CAVs were deployed to harry Imperial forces and were never used to directly assault enemy strongpoints or garrisons. They were used in heavily mobile engagements and were generally not deployed against Imperial armor units unless they had a three-to-one advantage in numbers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
