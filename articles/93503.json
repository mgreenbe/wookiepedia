Although no scenes were filmed there, it was digitally scouted to capture plate photography for backdrops in the Obi-Wan Kenobi vs. Anakin Skywalker fight on Mustafar in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. Conveniently, Etna erupted while filming was in progress, so Lucas sent a team to film lava flows to be used as moving backgrounds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
