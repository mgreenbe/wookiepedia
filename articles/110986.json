The SIS agents were able to recover a significant number of classified data files from the base, and upon discovering that one of the files included information on a scientist who had worked on the space station of the Sith Emperor, the SIS forwarded the file to Jedi Master Tol Braga. Braga dispatched the Jedi Knight Leeha Narezz to the planet Hoth in order to recover the scientist's shuttle and the station's technical readouts as part of his plan to capture the Emperor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The raid was first mentioned in the mission \"Suicide Squads\" for the Jedi Knight class in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
