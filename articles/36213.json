Like its base model, it employed a dual-engine configuration and a forward-swept-wing body for improved maneuverability and atmospheric handling. For the Deep-X, the engine compartment had been enhanced for maximum performance, including two hyperdrives, which made the ship one of the fastest and most reliable long-range vessels in the galaxy. The sublight engines were on par with those found in starfighters, and it was armed with two blaster cannons. However, in order to use the weapons, passengers had to act as gunners."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Deep-X Explorer was a long-range, deep space scout vessel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Deep-X Explorer was a variant of the DPx yacht.
