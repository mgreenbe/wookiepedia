Due to the nature of many older quests in Star Wars Galaxies, the appearance of Thark changed each time a player performed this quest. Under his spawn template, he would either appear as a green-skinned, brown haired male Aqualish, or as a green-skinned, brown haired female Aqualish. The quest dialogue given by Bren Kingal established Thark as a male. Furthermore, although not mentioned in the quest dialogue, examining him revealed him to be a scout. However, it should be noted that this was primarily due to game mechanics, as a result of Thark being placed under the randomized Aqualish scout spawn template appearance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
