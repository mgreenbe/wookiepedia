A Jedi using this power would reach out with the Force to determine the safest path from the myriad possibilities available. With sufficient practice, this ability could be learned without formal training. The navigator for the pirate Drek Drednar, Tron Nixx, was unwittingly Force-sensitive and developed this ability through practice, believing it to be merely phenomenal luck. The children of Jedi Knight Axton Tredway, Dena and Erling, were also adept at this ability, as were Saesee Tiin and Kyp Durron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several alien species were also capable of astrogation without computers or the aid of the Force, including the Siniteen, Lucent, and Givin. The famous star dragons could not only calculate hyperspace jumps without a navicomputer, they could make the jump without a ship, as could the Oswaft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A more complex and esoteric version, Instinctive Astrogation Control, also existed. It was a Control-based Force power rather than a Sense-based power. Instead of feeling out the correct path and related equations, Jedi would use the Force to enhance their mental abilities, allowing them to calculate the incredibly complex mathematical equations of hyperspace navigation in their heads."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
