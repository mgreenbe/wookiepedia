The Imperial soldiers assigned to the post were caught unaware and were eliminated within ten minutes after a brief skirmish. Immediately after the battle, the rebel soldiers destroyed the remaining equipment at the outpost with detonators. Although Zab requested that the speeder bikes assigned to the base would be utilized by Twilight Company, Namir declined the request, reasoning that the speeder bikes were equipped with homing beacons that would lead to the rebels' capture. Shortly thereafter, Twilight Company fled into the jungle, aiming to escape the inevitable TIE/sa bomber sorties that would respond to the attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial scout post first appeared in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
