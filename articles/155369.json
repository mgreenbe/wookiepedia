Once inside the ship's hangar, he put up a fight in order to make his capture look convincing. He was defeated and taken to the brig."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi later infiltrated the ship to release Anakin in order to help apprehend the Count. When the two arrived at Dooku's quarters, they confronted the Count but he managed to escape through a hatch to the warship's hangar, where he promptly boarded a Punworcca 116-class interstellar sloop. He then departed the warship and was escorted by a squadron of Vulture droids, including this one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obi-Wan then raced aboard a Sheathipede-class transport shuttle, and was quickly joined by Anakin. The ungainly transport pulled away from the frigate, and started chasing down the fleeing Sith Lord with Anakin taking over the controls while Obi-Wan manned the shuttle's cannons. A blast from the cannons winged Dooku's sailer, and its flight path began to curve toward the nearby planet of Vanqor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vulture droid escorts then turned around to harry the shuttle.
