Featuring a large cockpit that allowed the pilot to move around during long missions, the RC-2 was able to carry up to two extra passengers, who could operate sensor stations within the ship's cockpit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Operationally the RC-2 relied on its stealth and speed to compensate for its low armor, shielding, and weaponry, with the RC-2 making use of several active and passive technologies in order to survive in the field. Notably, the RC-2 made use of a dispersive coating that reduced the ship's sensor reflectivity as well as dampened its heat signature; this coating was further painted a mottled pattern of dark gray and black hues, lightly speckled with white dots, which enabled the RC-2 to blend into the starfield of open space. Further, the RC-2's ion engines were tailor made for the craft, and were similar to that of a TIE/ln space superiority starfighters - small, with minimal engine glow to betray position."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Altogether, when it had its engines shut down and the sensors in passive mode, the RC-2 was considered extremely difficult to detect. Should the craft be detected, the RC-2 could make use of a limited jamming field that could disrupt enemy sensors and targeting computers, while a pair of powerful torpedoes enabled it to make effective surprise attacks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
