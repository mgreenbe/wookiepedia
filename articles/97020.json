A sluglike scavenger which moved about on a thousand tiny cilia, ngdins were tongue-shaped which absorbed nutrients from substances such as blood. The Yuuzhan Vong utilized ngdins as a cleaning tool, sending them to consume blood from sacrifices, as well as excess bits of flesh not thrown to the maw luurs. The cilia on their underside caused a stinging sensation on living flesh, which had a numbing effect on contact with the toxins it excreted. Like all of the Yuuzhan Vong tools, ngdins were immune to the effects of the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
