The pair had proximity bombs implanted into them by Evazan and had discovered Nuss after snooping through the data banks in Posla's ship. Nuss agreed to their offer of a sash of Milvayne credits and got to work. He scanned them and sat them down at his auto-surgeon. While they were sedated, he attempted to remove the proximity bombs. However, he hit their fail-safes and they set to explode in ten hours. Fearful of breaking the bad news, Nuss prompted the pair to leave when they woke up. 0-0-0, though, stayed behind and asked him to track Evazan, who was watching through the droids eyes. Nuss said he could not do that, and 0-0-0 killed him, as he was no use to the droid. Simultaneously, Aphra discovered that Nuss had failed to remove the proximity bombs and walked in on the murder scene when breaking the news to 0-0-0."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rajam Nuss was a human male with light skin, red hair, and brown eyes.
