The barrel was suitable only for blaster rifles, measuring two meters in length and constructed of lightweight material. Upgraded static pulse adapters and a denser galven circuitry pattern mean that the barrel gives increased accuracy and range to weapons it is incorporated into. The downside to the barrel was that its length made it unwieldy and impossible to conceal. The barrel was popular along assassins and bounty hunters as well as fringers who had need of long range, the audience it was intended for."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "KX756 marksman barrels were first mentioned in the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2014."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
