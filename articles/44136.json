During that time, she continually filibustered any attempts to bring about Republic intervention in the Kaikielius system, to stop pirate activity there. Kaikielius was home to the House Vahali, a rival family of the Prajii, and Praji-Barck watched as the planet's problems cost the Vahali most of their money. In 4225 BBY, Republic troops were finally sent to Kaikielius and Praji-Barck's great nephew Derrica Praji accompanied them, although he worried that his actions would anger his aunt. Praji-Barck secretly manipulated the Odominic kajidic into supplying both sides in the conflict, but Derrica discovered some datatapes that proved what she had done."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
