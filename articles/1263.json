After Revan led the Jedi Order and Galactic Republic in victory over Darth Malak and the Sith Empire, the Sith remnants fractured and began to war amongst themselves. Amidst the power vacuum, Sith members became warlords, claiming small territories on the fringes of the Republic and fought for supremacy against each other in an opportunistic attempt at reviving the former glory of the Empire. At the same time, the Republic began to recover from the Jedi Civil War. In response to the destruction of Telos IV, Supreme Chancellor Cressa commenced the planet-wide Telosian Restoration Project, a terraforming project aimed at making the planet habitable once again. To assist in this effort and other redevelopment projects, Aratech launched the G0-T0 droid series. At the same time, the Kanz Disorders, a secessionist movement in the Kanz sector, was still ongoing. Consumed by the recent wars and recovery, the Republic had not intervened in the conflict."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Proem"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Civil War was a galaxy-wide conflict that followed in the wake of the also devastating Mandalorian Wars. The combination of two wars left the Galactic Republic reeling in commercially, politically, and militarily. Even though the Republic had defeated Darth Malak's Sith Empire at the Battle of Rakata Prime in 3956 BBY, the effects were far-flung. Worlds, such as Telos and Taris, had been destroyed through orbital bombardment; trade routes and infrastructure had been disrupted or destroyed which allowed for various Hutt Cartels or criminal organizations such as the Exchange to manipulate markets and hoard goods; in addition, the military which defended the Republic was on the verge of collapse. Similarly, the Jedi Order was in disarray from having lost many members through defection and battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hero of the war was Revan, the former Dark Lord who ruled the empire until being captured in 3957 BBY.

One such was the Telosian Restoration Project, a terraforming program designed to make the world habitable following its destruction in 3958 BBY. For the Telos venture and other reconstruction efforts, the company Aratech launched the G0-T0 droid series. Round black droids, they were designed to carry out tasks of planetary administration within the confines of both Republic law and what would only benefit the project. While a G0-T0 droid was used in the administration of Telos, the responsible party for the Restoration Project was the Ithorian herd of Chodo Habat. The herd divided the planet into different zones, gradually healing the planet one portion at a time. Above Telos, the large Citadel Station was constructed to house all the operations along with the necessary business needed to accommodate the large number of employees. Moreover, the project as a whole was a test pilot to see if such an undertaking was possible on other devastated worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this year, a daughter was born to Gelesi, a soldier serving in the Onderonian military.

The defeat of Darth Malak had left a vacuum, and power struggles ensued resulting in the quickly escalating Sith Civil War. The Sith remnant fractured the remaining strongholds of the Sith Empire into smaller territories. Declaring themselves sovereign warlords, they began to make war on each other with the goal of gaining or retaining whatever power they had. On Korriban, however, the destruction of the Sith Academy resulted in an insurrection there. The warring Sith massacred each other and the planet was left barren and lifeless. About this time, an expedition to the planet by Republic forces to root out any remaining Sith found it void of sentient life."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Kanz sector"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Along the fringes of Republic space, in the Kanz sector, the secessionist Myrialites had created an independent government during the height of the Mandalorian Wars. The secessionist movement, called the Argazdan Redoubt, continued to conquer the Kanz sector abated and subjugate the peoples of the worlds, putting many into slavery. Following the Jedi Civil War, the Republic still had not intervened in the conflict.

Within four years, Czerka Corporation, a weapons manufacturer and commodities supplier, began trying to usurp control over the project from the Ithorian herd using bribery and other less-than legal means. Underworld criminal organizations, such as the Exchange, also began operations on Telos in an attempt to capitalize on the inflow of materials for the project. The G0-T0 droid assigned to the project confronted a paradox in its programming. The droid calculated that it was unable to benefit the project and the Republic without breaking the law. It eventually broke through its programming, becoming fully autonomous, and began to act illegally to bring about what it calculated as the best course for the Republic's efforts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Elsewhere, the Sith continued to war against each other. Darth Traya, formerly known as Kreia, eventually began to train Darth Nihilus and Darth Sion at her academy on Malachor V.

In 3954 BBY, Sion unleashed a wave of agents throughout the galaxy to begin eliminating the remaining Jedi. At the same time, the Kanz Disorders continued unabated.

The events depicted in The Sith Lords and the Essential Guides were largely confirmed to have taken place in 3955 BBY with the publication of the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide by Wizards of the Coast.
