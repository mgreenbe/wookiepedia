He was a junk dealer living on Celanon who had past dealings with Captain Bortrek. Occasionally, he would sell them for high prices to willing buyers with a large amount of money. If the person who wished to purchase something from Sandro pulled out of a deal while a transaction was under way, he would hire a bounty hunter to finish the job. At one point, Sandro was dealing with a bounty hunter who killed three of his hired bounty hunters before finally being murdered on Raxus Prime, while looking for parts for his ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
