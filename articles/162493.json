In 24 ABY, he sold fake art to Gebbu the Hutt who, in retaliation, sent the bounty hunter Boba Fett after him. Fett tracked Bur down on the Core world of Coruscant. After leading Fett in a mad chase through a network of alleyways, Bur hid in a pile of crates and fruitlessly attempted to plead for his life. He was killed by Fett when he refused to surrender."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unusually overweight for a Rodian, Wac Bur was a cowardly individual.
