Created when the Jedi influenced the native Gormak by teaching some of them to use the Force, Sel-Makor began to gorge itself on the suffering and anger that resulted from the Gormak rising up against Sith invaders, and soon spread its corruption to form the region known as the Nightmare Lands. Influencing the Gormak into waging war on the newly created Voss, Sel-Makor's power and influence spread outward, aided by the various avatars and minions he used as physical forms. When the Gormak king Jokull entered the Nightmare Lands, Sel-Makor gave him the power to see the future as the Voss did, and influenced Jokull to build a starship to escape to the stars and a cannon to destroy the Voss in their mountain city."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, when the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire began to aid the Voss in their fight against the Gormak, the Voss discovered the existence of Sel-Makor and the truth about their species. Sel-Makor's avatars were destroyed at the hands of outsiders, and he was left without a host until the Sith Emperor was lured into a trap by the Sith Lord Darth Baras. The Emperor was imprisoned in the heart of Sel-Makor's domain, unable to escape as he battled the entity for control of his host body.

When Fulminiss fell in battle with the Knight, Sel-Makor's attempts to bribe the Jedi with unimaginable power failed, and the entity was destroyed once and for all when Tala-Reh sacrificed her life to end Sel-Makor's own."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Beginnings"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sel-Makor's origins could be traced to ancient times, when the Sith first invaded the planet Voss.

However, the planet and the Gormak were irrevocably changed when the Jedi attempted to drive the Sith off of Voss. Seeking allies among the natives, the Jedi agreed to teach some of the Gormak tribes how to use the Force, but the Gormak were unprepared for the knowledge. Those tribes underwent radical evolutionary changes in the course of a few generations, becoming a new species named the Voss. The Jedi attempted to teach the Voss how to control their emotions and new powers, but the Voss instead attacked the Sith on the planet, bringing the new species in contact with the dark side of the Force. This caused the dark side to manifest in a Sith structure on the planet, and this entity came to take the name Sel-Makor as it gained intelligence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sel-Makor began to feed on violence and suffering, fueling its dark side powers and spreading corruption across the surrounding area. The entity, which developed a masculine personality, twisted the minds of the animals and beings within his reach, and they became his crazed servants. The area under Sel-Makor's control became known as the Nightmare Lands, and the ancient Sith complex that the entity inhabited was known as the Dark Heart. Not long after his creation, Sel-Makor captured the spirits of two of the Gormak who had been taught by the Jedi, Damek-Ol and Nemok-Ta, and imprisoned their spirits in slave bodies. Damek-Ol was imprisoned in the body of a Dashade, while Nemok-Ta was placed in the body of an Abyssin, and the two became avatars of Sel-Makor's power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the extermination of the Sith, the Voss founded the city of Voss-Ka atop the planet's highest peak, and the Jedi eventually died out or departed.

Learning of Sel-Makor's existence, Baras met with the entity and promised the Emperor's powers if Sel-Makor would imprison the Emperor when Baras managed to draw the Sith ruler there.

But instead of consuming the Gormak's mind like he had done to so many Voss, Sel-Makor instead chose to awaken within Jokull his species' natural ability\u2014the power to see visions as the Voss did. Horrified that he had been corrupted and seeing all Voss as being marked with evil because of their powers, Jokull returned to the Gormak Lands and became king of his people in order to wage war upon the Voss\u2014so that the Gormak would never be corrupted like he was."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In an effort to gain an alliance with the Voss, both the Republic and the Empire lent aid to the Voss in their fight against the Gormak.

However, in the process, the Voss discovered Jokull's ability to see the future, and they enlisted the aid of outsiders in retracing the Gormak king's steps in the Nightmare Lands.

While Baras began preparations to declare himself the Voice of the Emperor and therefore the supreme ruler of the Empire, the Emperor was forced to battle Sel-Makor for control of the Voss body he was inhabiting.

The Emperor ordered his Wrath to kill the Voice and free his essence, but Sel-Makor refused to allow his prize to escape and seized full control of the Voice's body.

However, the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython was attempting to foil the Emperor's ritual, and the Jedi tracked Fulminiss to the Dark Heart with the help of the Voss Commando Tala-Reh.
