At some point before the end of Manderon period, an outside species chose the system to implement Project Iokath. Every orbital body in the system, down to the last asteroid, was demolished and salvaged for core elements to create a massive self-sustaining ecosphere that completely engulfed its star, using 100% of its energy output. The massive habitat was named Iokath and since once completed it allowed no light from its star outside, the entire system became undetectable to the rest of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Iokath system appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne.
