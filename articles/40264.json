During his time on Kamino, Priest earned the ire of some of his fellow Mandalorian Cuy'val Dars. Kal Skirata and Walon Vau abhorred his Death Watch leanings, believing wholeheartedly that Mandalorians ought to restore their old glory by conquering the galaxy. Another Mandalorian training sergeant, Mij Gilamar, loathed Priest because of his formation of a Battle Circle, where his clone trainees engaged in deadly fights.

Upon confirming his belief that Priest was still intent in having the Mandalorians rebuild their old empire, Gilamar stabbed Priest with a knife above his thigh, slashing through Priest's femoral artery and causing massive blood loss.

Upon realizing that Priest had not changed and was still firm in his belief of establishing a Mandalorian empire with the Death Watch, Gilamar stabbed him in the leg with his knife, severing his femoral artery and swiftly killing Priest from severe blood loss.
