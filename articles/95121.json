Forces under her command captured a prototype of the new TIE/D Defender starfighter produced by the Galactic Empire, and very nearly precipitated an arms race by attempting to sell that technology to the Rebels. Under her leadership, the Nami proved a serious new threat to the balance of power in the Empire, having acquired one its most advanced starfighters and assembled their own facilities to pursue independent production of these starfighters. The Nami also proved a highly tenacious foe in battle, wreaking havoc on TIE Defender facilities loyal to the Empire during Tarrak's reign. Eventually she was captured and sent to Coruscant, where she would be trained to serve the Emperor. Deprived of their production centers and their leader, the Nami species sank back into obscurity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nami were Human-sized, if not Humans themselves, as they could comfortably fly TIE Defenders produced to Human pilot standards.

They also maintained a small fleet of combat ships, several of them Strike-class medium cruisers, such as the Bognog, . They maintained numerous facilities for manufacturing the TIE Defender upon their capture of such ships, but these were eventually destroyed by the Empire, depriving the Nami of their brief spaceflight advantage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
