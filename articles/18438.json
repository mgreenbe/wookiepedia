The term was particularly common amongst Humans as a reference to the simplicity of obtaining a bottle of the popular blue milk. For example, during the Battle of Rendili, General Obi-Wan Kenobi commented that his investigation of an exploration vessel would likely be \"nothing more than a blue milk run.\" Missions described as blue milk runs had an unfortunate tendency to be more difficult than initially thought. Regardless, Kyle Katarn liked to use this phrase."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
