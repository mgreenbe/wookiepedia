Like most animals native to Castilon, the birds have four eyes, which allows them to hunt for food and keep watch for predators at the same time. Speagulls have blue-and-white plumage that keeps them camouflaged on their homeworld. They were skilled swimmers, and their natural diet consisted of fish, crustaceans, and other aquatic creatures. On the Colossus platform, the birds would occasionally attempt to steal uncovered food if it was outside."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
