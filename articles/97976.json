Born prior to the year 6 ABY, Anor was dispatched as an agent and saboteur to a galaxy other than the Yuuzhan Vong's own to prepare the way for an extra-galactic invasion. Working behind the scenes, Anor scouted out the battlefield ahead of schedule, gathering information, and destabilized the galaxy where he could by inciting conflicts that would make the Yuuzhan Vong's task easier when they went to war. He manipulated the Imperial Ruling Council and contributed to its downfall, and helped create numerous flashpoints of trouble over his years working in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25 ABY, Anor\u2014ranked as an Executor by this time\u2014sided with the Intendant caste's Praetorite Vong, and aided them in being the initial strike force of the invasion, though they would fail against the forces of the New Republic despite Anor's efforts; at the same time, his destabilization work culminated in starting a full-scale war between the planets of Osarian and Rhommamool. Anor also helped found the Peace Brigade organization, a group who would go on to aid the Yuuzhan Vong in their conquest over the course of the war. Later changing allegiances slightly to aid the warrior caste as they took up the invasion, the Executor helped plan an assassination attempt against members of the New Jedi Order, with the help of other Yuuzhan Vong, though their plot fell apart in the Bilbringi system. Later that year, Anor went on to establish relations between the Hutt species and the Yuuzhan Vong, and was instrumental in using the double-dealing Hutts to convince the New Republic that an imminent Yuuzhan Vong attack would occur at the world of Corellia, instead of at the actual target: the shipyards in the Fondor system.

The agent was only partly successful in his mission, detaining only Jacen Solo while the queen was slain, and Anor was further undermined in the eyes of his superiors after he inadvertently let Solo escape from Yuuzhan Vong custody with Vergere."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In seeking to provide a culminating victory for his people, Anor was tricked into following a trial of false information dropped by New Republic operatives, and led Warmaster Tsavong Lah into a massive defeat in the Treskov system, where the Warmaster perished against the forces arrayed there. Anor fled to the underworld of the Alliance capital Coruscant, now occupied by the Yuuzhan Vong and renamed Yuuzhan'tar, throwing his lot in with the Shamed Ones who believed in the Jeedai heresy to escape retribution for his failure. The disgraced agent eventually chose to lead the heretics as the prophet Yu'shaa in a bid to regain more power. Discovering evidence that the legendary living world of Zonama Sekot was in fact real, Anor briefly teamed up with Jedi Knights and rogue Yuuzhan Vong to find the planet, though he ultimately betrayed them and the world to win back the graces of Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane. However, although promoted to prefect, Anor soon became disillusioned with Jamaane's rule, and once again took up the role of the Prophet to lead the heretics against the Supreme Overlord as the Jedi and the Galactic Alliance attempted to retake Coruscant. In the end, Anor was captured by the Jedi, while the Yuuzhan Vong surrendered after the death of Jamaane.

At that time, the Yuuzhan Vong were preparing to invade a galaxy other then their own to establish a new home. That same day, Anor gouged out his left eye with a burning stick in a show of devotion.

In 11 ABY, in order to secure a potential alliance with the Sith, Anor met with aspiring Galactic Emperor Carnor Jax, who notified his master, Lumiya, about the agent. However, before anything could come of it, Jax was slain by the former Emperor's Royal Guard Kir Kanos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anor turned his sights on the Imperial Ruling Council, which led the remains of the Galactic Empire that year.

On the planet of Ord Cantrell, Anor assassinated the current Head of the Council Burr Nolyds by planting in the Human's chambers an explosive device, which was decorated with the designation of Kanos, a plan devised to place the blame on the former Guardsman. Like Anor planned, Carivus was appointed the Head of the Council following Nolyd's demise, and the Yuuzhan Vong agent met briefly with Carivus following the event after slipping through the high security around the man's rooms.

Anor was true to his word, and General Immodet was later found dead. In response to this, Carivus used the excuse to bring in his personal guards. However, as Immodet was one of Carivus's supporters, the man was confused when he met Anor again, who once again did not reveal any more of his plans to the Imperial. Over the next while, Carivus took matters into his own plans, ignoring Anor's plans, as he cemented his leadership of the Imperial Ruling Council with might. Anor confronted the man once about his lack of obedience, but did not interfere as Carivus made enemies with the D'Asta family and drew the attention of Kanos himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before Carivus was killed by Kanos during an attack on Ord Cantrell by Ex-Imperial Baron Ragez D'Asta's forces, Anor informed the self-proclaimed Emperor Carivus that his and his leaders' plans no longer included the Imperial.

Anor later paid a group of individuals to raid a Class-3 toxic weapons dump on the world of Nyara and obtain a chunk of zinethium material, which had explosive capabilities. While on the planet Adumar stirring up anti\u2013New Republic sentiments, Anor met up with an individual who gave him the zinethium. That zinethium found its way into the hands of the Restored Empire, an organization plotting the destruction of the New Republic and the Imperial Remnant, the successor state to the Galactic Empire. They used it in an attempt to blow up the Imperial Palace on the New Republic controlled capital of Coruscant. However, due to the intervention of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, the plan failed.

Anor also seeded several different worlds with a range of illnesses carried by spores that the Yuuzhan Vong agent had created himself, and, thirteen years after Carivus' death, Nom Anor placed coomb spores, which were a poisonous airborne microorganism, in the breath masks of one hundred New Republic diplomats on the world of Monor II, including Jade Skywalker, at the event that marked the ascension of the Priest-Prince Agapos the Tenth to the throne. All of them became infected and many died within a period ranging from several days to weeks of the initial exposure, though the time frame differed depending on the species of the infected individual.

The Executor also recruited many agents from the native populations of the galaxy to further his goals. A member of the Praetorite Vong, Anor conspired with them to ensure they would be the ones to lead the initial attack on the galaxy, instead of members of the warrior caste.

He traveled to the moon of Nar Shaddaa disguised as a man named Udelen in the fifth month of that year, and went searching in the Bar Jaraniz tapcafe for Mandalorian assistance in his plans. There, Anor met with the Mandalorian Goran Beviin, and although the mercenary momentarily drew a blaster on Anor after Beviin mistook one of his movements for a threat, Anor hired Beviin to assassinate Tholote B'Leph, a politician from the industrial world of Ter Abbes. Anor agreed to pay Beviin a hundred thousand credits to kill B'Leph a few days before an election that may have seen him become a governmental leader.

Around two weeks before the scheduled arrival of the Praetorite Vong, Anor traveled to the city of Keldabe on the world of Mandalore in a starship to meet personally with Fett. Speaking to the bounty hunter at the base of Anor's ship's ramp, the Executor informed Fett that a war was coming, and requested that he take a few warriors to a specified rendezvous in two weeks time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25 ABY, two days before the scheduled arrival of the vanguard, Anor rendezvoused in space with the Mandalorians, accompanied by a sizable fleet of Yuuzhan Vong battleships, ensuring that the Mandalorians were the first to witness the arrival of their new masters.

Anor also invited Fett to come dock with the miid ro'ik battleship Anor was aboard to learn more. After Fett, alongside Beviin, docked aboard the living ship, Anor proceeded to give them a grand tour of both the ship and the living technologies within. Wearing no disguising masquer, Anor led them deep into the heart of the miid ro'ik, pointing out to the pair amphistaffs and Vonduun crab armor, and explaining to Fett that the role that the Mandalorians would play would be related to intelligence gathering and covert operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Informing the Mandalorians that the Yuuzhan Vong intended to cleanse the galaxy of machines, which they viewed as abominations, Anor showed the pair a prisoner from Ter Abbes that had been fitted with a Yorik-Kul slave implant.

With Fett acknowledging the threat of the Yuuzhan Vong race to the Mandalorians, he tried to get Anor to leave the Mandalore sector alone if the Mandalorians continued to aid them. While Anor and the two watched a Yuuzhan Vong remove the implant, killing the prisoner in the process in order to use it on a new Twi'lek prisoner, the Executor considered the offer, and eventually agreed to Fett's terms. Anor then tasked Fett with assembling a team to secure a landing zone for a Yuuzhan Vong assault on the world of Birgis in five days time, and handed the bounty hunter a datachip filled with the necessary information before the pair departed in the miid ro'ik.

In this capacity, Anor kept advisers at hand, but those that voiced their doubts about Anor's abilities soon ended up dead. As a direct result of Anor inflaming the two sides, the New Republic sent a Mon Calamari capital ship Mediator to the Osarian system by 25 ABY in order to prevent the tension between the two planets from breaking out into a full war. Around that time, the two planets were nearing the point in their orbits where they would be the closest to each other for many years, enabling both sides to potentially launch rockets at each other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By that time, Anor had gotten his Red Knights of Life to frequently purge Rhommamoolian cities like Redhaven of all mechanical things, such as landspeeders and droids.

In 25 ABY, Anor, wearing an ooglith masquer to disguise his true form, attended a huge gathering at the Square of Hopeful Redemption. There, as he stood on a platform above the gathered, the ten thousand gathered Rhommamoolians stoned the droids in the pit for the entire afternoon after Anor commanded it. Soon after the event, Anor was contacted via communicating villip by Yomin Carr, who was a Yuuzhan Vong agent disguised as a member of the team that serviced the ExGal-4 outpost on the planet of Belkadan.

The Jade Sabre was in the Osarian system so the occupants could meet with Anor, an event arranged between the Executor and New Republic Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya to try to reach an agreement that benefited both planets. Before sending Tinoktin off to escort the group from the Jade Sabre, Anor made sure that his aide had a shlecho newt with him, and instructed Tinoktin to bring the lizard near the mouth of Jade Sabre during the meeting.

Anor's only suggestion to stop the looming war between the two planets was have the Mediator destroy the weapons systems of the Osarians. This possibility was quickly ruled out by Organa Solo and Jade Skywalker, and they left, disgusted at Anor's unwillingness to do anything to stop the war. After the short meeting, Tamaktis Breetha, the former mayor of Redhaven, questioned why Anor had refused New Republic assistance in stopping a war, though Anor reassured him that the Rhommamoolians were fighting for a cause greater than just their homeworld's freedom; in truth, the Executor did not care about the fate of the two worlds, and was merely trying to destabilize the New Republic by creating another flashpoint.

Launched from places where the liftoff of the rockets would be difficult to detect, the rockets turned off their fuel once they reached the edge of Rhommamool's atmosphere and drifted, unnoticeable by the Mediator, to the edge of Osarian's atmosphere.

The booster contained a concealed A-wing starfighter with an enlarged cockpit, in which Anor and Tinoktin placed themselves. When the rocket left the orbit of Rhommamool, the second-stage booster was detached, taking with it the Yuuzhan Vong and his aide. Tinoktin remotely opened the comm channel on the capsule that was headed for the Mediator, and Anor greeted Ackdool, through the use of the twin of the villip he placed on the body.

One of the proton torpedoes fired at the capsule however detonated near it, due to intervening X-wing starfighter fire, and the explosion sent the capsule into an uncontrolled spin, which prompted Anor to become panicked to keep up his charade. Though the booster and the A-wing within it began to bounce across the atmosphere of Rhommamool, Tinoktin managed to keep a line of sight to the Mediator, allowing Anor to see the capsule enter the docking bay of the war cruiser after the Mediator guided it in with a tractor beam."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There, nuclear fission explosives crammed inside the capsule detonated, and the resulting explosion blew a massive section of the Mediator to bits, temporarily lifting the rear of the cruiser by ninety degrees; as Anor had been presumed to be on the capsule when it detonated, the Executor managed to fake his death as a martyr above Rhommamool. After the booster drifted far enough away, the A-wing that Anor and his aide resided in disengaged itself from the booster, and streaked away unnoticed.

Da'Gara and Anor agreed that the biggest current threat to the discovery of the Praetorite Vong, who were holed up on a base on the Outer Rim ice planet of Helska IV, would be the world of Sernpidal and its inhabitants. Because of this, the pair decided to use a tactic known as Yo'gand's Core\u2014where a gravity manipulating dovin basal was used to crash a planet's moon into itself\u2014to destroy the threat it posed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Da'Gara later communicated with the Executor once again via villip, and the Praetorite Vong leader informed Anor that their forces had encountered a starfighter squadron allied with the New Republic.

Although Da'Gara insisted that neither of the starfighter pilots had managed to escape alive, as ravenous grutchin creatures had latched onto both craft, Anor was skeptical. He was unsure whether or not the Praetorite Vong would be discovered sooner than they wished, as either one of the pilots might survive to relate the tale, and there was potential for the grutchins to be sighted.

However, the Praetorite Vong force was later defeated at Helska IV after the invaders had fully engaged the people of the galaxy and made themselves known. Anor found out about the fall of the Praetorite Vong through rumors, and his inability to contact either Da'Gara or Carr, who both had died.

Attacking in places where the Praetorite Vong had failed in order to redeem the honor of the race, Shai led the warriors on an invasion path that was situated at the border of Imperial Remnant and New Republic space. This path had been advised earlier by Anor, because the relations between the two would prevent them from aiding each other. Anor was slightly wrong in this regard, as an Imperial and New Republic joint-effort at the world of Ithor resulted in the death of Shai, though the Imperial Remnant would regress to its insular nature for a long time after the incident.

There, Harrar and Anor briefed the Priestess Elan, who was accompanied by her familiar Vergere, on the plan, which was to fatally infect as many Jedi as they could in order to weaken the moral of the New Republic. Shortly afterwards, twenty living captives from Obroa-skai were brought into the command room and placed inside an inhibition field so that they could not escape.

With a bo'tous bug as an aid in explaining, Anor informed Elan that the effects of the toxin were brief, and the deliverer of the bo'tous had to be close to her targets.

At the end of the briefing, Elan took the bo'tous specimen, and clenched it in her palm so that it could migrate to her lungs and begin to develop. After Elan and Vergere had left, Anor briefly discussed with the priest the plan, and Elan's role, which would almost certainly bring about her death. As a part of the plot, Elan and Vergere were allowed to fall into the hands of the enemy at the world of Exodo II after the New Republic light cruiser Soothfast destroyed the Yuuzhan Vong vessel Elan was being held on; the priestess and her pet were then placed into protective custody after Elan told her captors that she was a defector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Elan's capture, Commander Tla confronted Harrar and Anor, as he was angered that a Yuuzhan Vong ship had had to be destroyed for the initial stage of the plot to succeed.

In an effort to make it appear that Yuuzhan Vong did not want Elan in the hands of the enemy where she could give them important information, Anor led a small raid on Wayland, targeting Elan's position in particular. After a single assassin attacked the safe house the priestess was being held in, Anor sent half a dozen coralskippers to conduct strafing runs on the city of New Nystao, the location of the safe house. Located in a gunship out of the action on the edge of the Wayland system, Anor instructed his fighters to only try hard enough to convince the New Republic that the invaders wanted the priestess dead and buried.

During that meeting, a herald approached the group carrying a villip, and Anor used one of his dedicated villips to help receive a message from one of his underlings.

After pinning the failure on Anor, and hearing from Anor that the agent was the only survivor of the boarding party, Qurang promised that the warmaster would hear about the incident in detail."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Working with Vergere"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "A trip to Bilbringi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 27 ABY, Anor was sent as an emissary by Warmaster Lah to the shipyards of the Bilbringi system, where Yuuzhan Vong forces had correctly guessed Organa Solo would be. Anor sent a message anonymously to the staff at the shipyards claiming that he wished to discuss the fate of some refugees. Although Anor refused to reveal how he knew Organa Sol was at Bilbringi, the New Republic personnel accepted, and the agent arrived at the shipyards in a picket ship; in preparation for the arrival of the Yuuzhan Vong emissary, the New Republic had made it look like the facilities were decrepit and thus an unworthy target to assault. Upon arrival, Anor allowed the chilab organism in his nose, which used his optical nerves to record images, to get a good view of the shipyards at Bilbringi. At the shipyards, Anor was made to wear a watchcloak with a hood, and his artificial eye was confiscated.

Giving no finite answers as to how the Yuuzhan Vong had known that Organa Solo and her husband would be at Bilbringi, the agent proceeded to show those looking through the transparisteel a live feed of the cruiser Nebula Chaser via his villip. Anor offered to trade the ship for information that would help the Yuuzhan Vong, but when Organa Solo flatly refused to negotiate with the likes of Lah, Anor specified the information required: the location of the secret Jedi base. However, when Organa Solo denied the existence of it, the villip depicted the live destruction of the Nebula Chaser, killing those on board."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Explaining that those on board had died because of the presence of Jedi on the Nebula Chaser, the agent threatened that more lives would be lost unless the Jedi surrendered to the Yuuzhan Vong. Anor further elaborated that his race had put in place a blockade around the world of Talfaglio, and if the Jedi did not surrender, the refugee convoys being held there would be destroyed. Additionally, if Anor did not return from his mission, the refugees would meet the same fate. However, both Organa Solo and her husband did not take kindly to the offer, and they allowed a small amount of vacuum into the room to the surprise of Anor, who yelled that they would kill millions due to their actions. Though they resealed the room, allowing Anor to readjust to the pressure inside, the pair told him that they would not be responsible for deaths of those they did not kill, and that further emissaries would not return to Lah.

Although Anor did not believe that holographic devices were a danger, Lah asserted that a coralskipper pilot could easily be fooled by a similar illusionary X-wing.

During the briefing Anor tried to make it seem as if the agent was in control of the interrogation at the shipyards, though Vergere was quick to point out examples of Organa Solo's control over the situation. When asked why the Princess of the world Alderaan had spared his life, Anor lied that it was because she was sending him off with a warning, and not because she had promised to let him go. Despite how the Jedi were proving to be cunning foes, the warmaster believed that the refugees would be able to drive the New Republic and the New Jedi Order apart.

After momentarily ceasing his conversation with Shesh, the warmaster gave the agent a thorn seat to sit on, so that the Executor could finish the devotions that Lah's summoning had seemingly interrupted. With the thorns of the seat biting into his back and buttocks, Anor listened to a briefing by Shesh, who had quickly bypassed Anor as a contact and taken her services straight to Lah as soon as she could. Shesh reported how Jacen had proposed a plan to ambush the blockade of Talfaglio, and how she had persuaded Bothan Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya to permit a military study into the matter, in order to give the Yuuzhan Vong time to prepare a counterattack. She also informed them Fey'lya had also asked for an envoy of the Yuuzhan Vong to come speak with them, purely to give more time for the military study to run its course. When the conversation with Shesh had ended, Lah tasked Anor with being the envoy that would go to Coruscant, as he did not trust the accuracy of Shesh's report, despite Vergere's attempts to get herself assigned as the envoy.

Because of the disagreement, they came to a compromise to meet in the Grand Convocation Chamber of the Senate Building, where all the citizens of the galaxy could watch as the two conversed in an unscripted event. Wearing a hooded cloak and a set of red vonduun crab armor, Anor traversed the stairs that led to the chamber's center, unescorted by bodyguards and wielding an amphistaff, all the while ignoring the senators that jeered at him, and those that offered private meetings with the emissary, as well as a barrage of cag mugs from the Togorian delegates that were intercepted by security droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the floor of the chamber, Anor was met by Fey'lya, alongside Shesh and Fyor Rodan, both members of the New Republic Advisory Council, and it was then that Anor threw off his hood, revealing himself as the emissary to all the senators present, and all those watching via the HoloNet. Fey'lya and Anor discussed the interdiction of the world of Talfaglio, and the Yuuzhan Vong's ultimatum in front of the occupants of the chamber. During the conversation, Anor used his tactics to divide the entire Senate between those the Yuuzhan Vong could intimidate, and those who would not be. Questioning why the Yuuzhan Vong valued the Jedi so high, the Bothan insulted the Yuuzhan Vong for not engaging the Jedi head on by hiding behind the lives of refugees, leaving Anor hard pressed to defend against Fey'lya's point. The Chief of State proceeded to side with the Jedi, though the Bothan had a history of not liking them, and suggested that the Jedi Order were well loved in Bothan space. As Anor was supplied with possible planets where the Jedi might reside, most of which had no populations present on them, the Bothan prevented the Executor from leaving the chamber to relay the places to his masters, forcing Anor to use a villip instead; Fey'lya wanted Anor to stay on Coruscant until he had explained the millions of hostages taken at Talfaglio."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later, and still on Coruscant, Anor addressed those present in the Grand Convocation Chamber, and the speech was streamed on the holonetworks all over the galaxy.

From the speaker's podium, Anor had a public audience with Fey'lya, who demanded that the Executor explain the taking of the hostages. However, Anor only wanted to inform them that the deadline had been increased, and further shocked the audience by revealing the reason for this: seventeen young Jedi had been turned over to the Yuuzhan Vong by a citizen of the New Republic.

Despite Shesh's attack at Anor, she later aided him in the debate, when the Bothan vainly sought to hide the time in which seventeen more Jedi would have to be turned over to the Yuuzhan Vong to save the hostages. For this, the Chief of State publicly defeated a political challenge by Shesh, before sending the Calibop security member Mif Kumas and three security droids to arrest Anor for the attempt on the Bothan's life that had occurred before Anor's address, though the agent had had nothing to do with as Shesh has planned it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Kumas neared Anor with a pair a stun cuffs, the agent ripped off one of his little fingers, prompting a black cloud of vapor to quickly spread out from the base of the finger to engulf the droids, Anor, and the Calibop.

However, Lah stopped the bickering of the two just before Vergere insulted Anor, which would have mandated that Anor kill her. Lah soon became angry that he had not been informed that the two Solos were twins, forcing Anor to risk much by claiming that it was good that Jacen had escaped Lah on Duro, for the sacrifice of both of the twins would be a great gift to the god Yun-Yuuzhan. This idea fixated Lah, and he agreed that the two Solos should fight each other in ritual combat to the death, an idea that Anor had further suggested.

Lah tasked Anor with traveling to Myrkr aboard the frigate Ksstarr and eliminating the seventeen Jedi, save for the twins whom he was ordered be brought back alive.

The surviving warriors of One Scourge hid behind the trees in the swamp, and began to fire back at the Jedi with their own weapons, but Jacen drew over a half dozen voxyn to their position by opening himself to the Force.

However, the Jedi force outwitted Anor, hiding in a short access tunnel that led to an enormous feral voxyn den. Anor's forces from Two Scourge passed right by, partially because the pack of voxyn they had had initially with them had all been slain earlier by the Jedi, and thus no beasts alerted the warriors to the presence of the Jedi. Because of this, the Jedi force was never hammered between Two Scourge and Three Scourge. Over an hour after the Jedi escaped Anor's trap, Anor's frigate the Ksstarr pursued a serviceable YV-888 freighter as it left the atmosphere of the Baanu Rass, after a small part of the Jedi team utilized the freighter that they had found to try to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was then, after the YV-888 left the worldship, that the remaining Jedi launched their attack on a grashal in which the voxyn queen was located.

When the lights in that room went on, Jacen saw Vergere betray him by consulting with the Executor, and the combination between this act and the dark side energy close at hand caused the Jedi to unleash his anger. Jacen hit Vergere with a blast of Force lightning, and when he could not do that to Anor and the other Yuuzhan Vong warriors, as they could not be reached by the Force, Jacen channeled the power of a storm that was raging on the surface of Yuuzhan'tar.

Anor was placed under Jacen's control, and the plan of having Jacen slay his sister in battle was moved foreword, with Jacen setting about trying to capture his sister. A rumor was spread that Jacen had been spotted, and the Yuuzhan Vong hoped that Jacen's sister would track down the origin of that source. However, it was the Jedi Knight Ganner Rhysode who instead tracked the rumor to its source weeks after it had been spread, and was captured by Jacen and a group of warriors waiting there.

In the story, Rapuung was betrayed by his lover, the Shaper Mezhan Kwaad, who caused his implants to not take, thus Shaming him. Because of this, Rapuung set out for revenge on Yavin 4 with the help of Jedi Anakin Solo, who taught him the ways of the Jeedai heresy. In the end, Rapuung got Kwaad to admit in front of witnesses that she had Shamed him, and not the gods, but he was killed by Kwaad shortly after, though Kwaad herself perished to Solo and his allies.

Anor did this by accompanying I'pan on missions to the levels near the surface of Coruscant, where he used his knowledge of certain codes and how resources were managed by the Yuuzhan Vong to find and take them. Soon, the former Executor supplied the group with lambents, arksh, and h'merrig, which eased living in the lower levels for the Shamed Ones; despite this, Kunra still distrusted Anor and his motives.

Then, after first silencing Kunra's enthusiastic support for the plan, Anor surprised his audience by proclaiming that though the prophecy was nearing completion, Anor would need to step foot onto Zonama Sekot with a Jedi.

However, Horn did not like how the plan risked the lives of so many Shamed Ones if something went wrong, so he advocated for some of the Shamed Ones to dress up in brown robes and wield long glowing plants that were found underground to appear like Jedi. These Shamed Ones, the Jedi hoped, would serve to distract the warriors. Anor and the two Jedi used secret tunnels to get themselves close to the shaper damutek, and once there, Anor took leave of the two Jedi after pointing them in the direction of the damutek; Anor planned to wait for the Jedi to seize the ship and pick him up at a shrine to the god Yun-Harla nearby."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pair of Jedi succeeded in their mission with the help of the heretics, and the Prophet, along with Harrar the priest, was picked up at the shrine by the vessel of Zonama Sekot origin.

This caused considerable reaction from the three, with Anor and the others pointing out that they were risking much to journey to the living planet. Horn, however, citing the addition of two Yuuzhan Vong to the party as a main reason, declared that they were instead heading to Mon Calamari to get a decision from the Jedi Council to see if the voyage should continue.

Both Anor and Veila sat by idly for hours as Yim examined certain objects and documented notes in a portable qahsa. While waiting for Yim, Anor came to realize that Jamaane had been right to fear the world, as the Yuuzhan Vong were obviously connected to it. Shortly afterwards, Yim discovered a lim tree in her exploring, prompting her to get Anor to explain the nature of his visions. Yim needed to know because the lim tree had originally existed on the original Yuuzhan'tar, and since it had not been planted by a spacefaring race, this indicated that Zonama Sekot was directly related to their homeworld somehow. However, Yim refused to make any assumptions about Zonama Sekot's origin until she had more data.

Still in thought, Anor made it to the top of a hill, and was truly shocked to see what he recognized as hyperdrive field guides rising from the surface of the world, large enough to indicate that the planet itself could jump to hyperspace. This discovery prompted him to take off the masquer disguising him as the Prophet, as no one was around, and activate a small dedicated villip that he had brought with him to the living world. Anor contacted a surprised former subordinate Phaa Anor on the villip, and convinced the other to tell Jamaane that Anor was on Zonama Sekot and that he had found Yim by informing Phaa that he would be rewarded for bringing the information; Anor also had his former subordinate take the villip to Jamaane, so that he could contact the Supreme Overlord personally.

Hours later, after Anor had taken watch-duty from Veila and was certain that she was asleep, he used his villip to contact its twin. At first accosted by Onimi on the other side, the Prophet soon faced Jamaane again.

Jamaane promised to reward him, if Anor managed to pull off his plot. In the days after his talk with Jamaane, Anor stole all of the components that he believed he would need for sabotaging the living world, save for Yim's qahsa which contained protocols that would help him with this task.

Anor used Yim's qahsa to install a soldier virus on an incubator of his, and the former Prophet inserted the living organism into the pillar behind the neural strands, so that the incubator was unnoticeable.

The Supreme Commander explained that living vessels similar to coral skippers had risen from Zonama Sekot to engage the Yuuzhan Vong fighters that were guarding the ship infected with Alpha Red. With even Jamaane stricken by the news, Anor witnessed as the Supreme Overlord had his quartet of seers killed for uttering heresy that the gods had aligned themselves with the Jedi. Shortly afterwards, Anor was forced by Jamaane to explain where the living ships came from, as the Prefect had been to the living world, and Anor failed to convince them that the ships were merely the results of mind tricks played by the Jedi. Ever erratic, Jamaane, ignoring the fact that Galactic Alliance forces were breaching the defenses of Yuuzhan'tar, placed half of the Citadel's garrison of warriors at Anor's hands so that he might eradicate the heretics once and for all. When the Supreme Overlord ordered Jakan, Qelah Kwaad, and Drathul to go to the Well of the World Brain before dismissing them all, Drathul pulled Anor aside as he prepared to leave, and confronted Anor for not siding with the elite caste members against Jamaane.

It was then, viewing the slaughter, that Anor saw fires rising up on the surface of Yuuzhan'tar. Realizing that the Galactic Alliance's starfighters were not responsible, the Prefect was horrified to see Yuuzhan Vong Fire Breather creatures as the cause of the conflagrations. Comprehending that Jamaane had convinced the World Brain to devastate Yuuzhan'tar to spite the gods, Anor cursed Jamaane's name, for the Supreme Overlord was destroying all that they had worked for. Slaying a warrior to grab his amphistaff, Anor disguised himself as a Shamed One with the robe of a dead Yuuzhan Vong and fought his way to the top of a rubble pile in the center of the Place of Hierarchy.

Slashing apart the knot of robes that Veila held on to him with, Anor scurried away from Veila, and made his way to the edge of the fighting after navigating the combatants, though Veila alerted Jade Skywalker to Anor's presence. Pursued by Jade Skywalker as he ran from the battle, Anor led her on a twisting route as he made his way down deeper and deeper into the depths of Yuuzhan'tar in his attempt to escape her.

Trying to hit the Jedi with only his bare hands, Anor fell numerous times for openings in Jade Skywalker's defense that she had purposely created to allow her to further harm the Prefect. Jade Skywalker eventually inflicted enough harm on Anor that he had trouble getting up, and it was then that she held her lightsaber to his throat.

Following that, Anor and Jade Skywalker made their way to the surface of Yuuzhan'tar, and linked up with approximately fifty of the heretics, as well as Veila and Hamner, and made their way to the Well of the World Brain.

Anor entered into the Citadel and made his way to the Hall of Confluence with the others, to find it filled with the bodies of warriors who had fallen against Galactic Alliance troops. Reasoning that Jamaane was most likely at the summit of the Citadel when Skywalker and the two others engaged him, Anor led the others up to the summit, and entered the room after the door to it opened upon detecting Anor's scent.

In truth, Anor only served himself, and the chance of promotion to a higher rank. Prior to the start of the war, Anor made a bid for power by supporting the Praetorite Vong of the intendant caste as the initial assault force in the Yuuzhan Vong War by secretly acquiring for them an immature yammosk; Anor enjoyed the power that came with rank and command, and on Rhommamool, he loved the adulation he received as the leader of the people there, though he did not care about fate of the planet or its inhabitants in any way.

Because he had power on Yuuzhan'tar, Anor wished to save the world from Jamaane's irrational commands.

During the bo'tous plan, which was important to Anor because it could help him regain the esteem he had lost from siding with the failed Praetorite Vong, Anor was willing to sacrifice the lives of his Peace Brigade allies to salvage the mission, and while he was looking into spreading the word of the heresy, Anor would have killed both Kunra and Shoon-mi if they had refused to aid him in his mission. In his stint as the Prophet, the agent did not care how many heretic spies died as long as he gained intelligence on what Jamaane was up to. Later, when on Zonama Sekot, Anor slew Yim to move his plans foreword even though he knew her death would be a great lose to the Yuuzhan Vong.

Although his world was crumbling apart with Zonama Sekot in the sky at the end of the war, Anor still relished the small victory he took over Drathul after he surprised the High Prefect. However, despite the agent's great ambition and intellect, many of Anor's carefully laid plans for escalation ended badly during the war, such as the one in Bilbringi, and especially the disaster in the Treskov system.

During his time as an Executor, Anor was never able to speak honestly or openly in case the priests or the Supreme Overlord\u2014or the gods\u2014 were offended by his comments.

Anor acknowledged the fact that he had many enemies among the Yuuzhan Vong, but refused to increase the number of his guard as he believed that doing so only told others that you were afraid. Anor was paranoid at times, particularly when he acted as the Prophet, and his lack of intelligence on what Jamaane was up to made him feel exposed, so the agent sought to find out whether the Supreme Overlord was after him or not. Following the failed assassination attempt upon him, Anor\u2014tainted by Shoon-mi's betrayal\u2014was filled with raged and suspicion, evening doubting the loyalties of Kunra and Ngaaluh. When he later lost his female spy, Anor began to seriously wonder how long it was before Jamaane added him to the body pile that Ngaaluh had been thrown upon. In addition to his occasional paranoia, Anor was also cautious, advising a safe attack to Da'Gara when he helped him plan the Praetorite Vong assault."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his need to survive, at the end of the war in a nearly inescapable position above Coruscant, Anor chose to open the hatch to the lander that required a Yuuzhan Vong's hand to access it, instead of forcing the Solos to use his severed hand to open the lock, and in doing so deciding to die with dignity."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Wavering Loyalties"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Initially supporting the Yuuzhan Vong, Anor's loyalties would change multiple times in the latter half of the war, though he would always look out for himself first and foremost.

Later on, Anor was shocked to learn that the eighth cortex of shaper knowledge was empty. As he did not want the New Republic to win because the Yuuzhan Vong could not deploy new creations, he vowed to end the war quickly before this could affect the Yuuzhan Vong war effort. Even after he fled to the underworld of Yuuzhan'tar following the failure that led to Lah's death, Anor was loyal to the Yuuzhan Vong cause, and he strove to find the source of the heresy, as it was his duty to eradicate it lest it toppled all that he had worked for."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After his stint as the Prophet, Anor was completely confident that he had done the right thing in sabotaging Zonama Sekot.

However, shortly after his return to the Yuuzhan Vong capital, Anor began to grow fearful for the Yuuzhan Vong cause when Jamaane started to ignore the heretics and the others who doubted him to strike at Mon Calamari. The now-Prefect found his task of quelling the rising fear and anger in the lower classes impossible, further disillusioning himself with the Yuuzhan Vong way, and when Zonama Sekot arrived in the skies of Yuuzhan'tar, Anor felt defeated because his predictions had come true despite all he had done to stop them from happening."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anor believed in the Yuuzhan Vong and their ability to win until he saw Jamaane trying to turn the gods against one another, which made him realize that the Supreme Overlord was truly deranged.

At the end, knowing that the war was lost for the Yuuzhan Vong, Anor felt despair at what he had wrought against the Yuuzhan Vong cause.

Niiriit's death affected Anor the most, and he stopped thinking of her merely as a warrior, but instead as a Shamed One who fought for her friends. Later, Anor kept the end of the Rapuung story like I'pan had first taught it in order to remember the tale's origins, and I'pan himself, and one of the reasons that Anor did not kill Shoon-mi initially was because he felt that he owed Niiriit.

As he believed that masquers could not hide everything about the user, Anor knew that he had no place in a galaxy ruled by the Galactic Alliance, and did not fit with the Yuuzhan Vong because he did not believe in their gods.

Considered by himself a professional dissembler, Anor admired how the heretics were playing on the fears of Zonama Sekot in the elite at the end of the war, and was skilled enough in his role as an agent to recognize someone wearing a masquer.

During his reconnaissance time, the Executor became a fair hand at the game of dejarik, and knew enough to recognize a master such as Vergere.

The agent was also a skilled liar, and when Veila saw that he was wearing a masquer on Yuuzhan'tar, Anor was able to lie to Veila and Horn and give them an excuse that satisfied them. Later, when caught in the act of trying to send the Solo family down the disposal shoot, Anor tried to appear confused to look blameless, though this failed. Anor thought up contingency plans when he plotted, and during his time as the Prophet, Anor wanted to free Yim with the help of the Jedi so that if it failed, they would be blamed or killed without risking himself. If it was a success, he could bring his own prophecy about. However, he did not quite like the fact that the two Jedi sent to help him were Horn and Veila, as they could potentially reveal him as their old enemy.

Due to his long time among the infidels, Anor believed that he understood them more than any other Yuuzhan Vong did, and learned to look beyond appearances. At first, although Anor found the Mandalorians worthless as an army, he saw them good in the capacity of infiltrators and assassins. However, after a while, the agent decided that they were overrated, and saw them as weak and corrupt for switching sides to save their race. Anor in particular found it ironic that the Mandalorians feared slavery, as they had often pillaged and enslaved others in their long history. At the start of the war, Anor initially admired the Noghri more than he did the Jedi, until the latter began to affect his plans.

Trusting his own information about the Final Redoubt so much, Anor even offered his life if he was wrong, and was confident that Lah would be victorious in the battle until he realized it was a trap.

Following Jacen's escape and Vergere's betrayal, the Supreme Overlord's very presence hurt Anor's mind during the Executor's meeting with Jamaane in the Hall of Confluence. This caused his verbal attempt to shrug off the blame for the incident to break down as Anor panicked. Jamaane's powers would later influence Anor to be angry at Hool after the worldshaping of Coruscant was botched, though Anor realized that he was manipulated to feel that way after the fact.
