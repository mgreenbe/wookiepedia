They were primarily used in operating machinery and conducting repairs. They were not armored as such, though their toughened suits could absorb mild blast damage, and were armed with a DH-17 blaster for personal protection. Many of them were slain by Kyle Katarn when he encountered them on his adventures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although, as the name suggests, the workers were often allied with the Empire, some were known to work with various other groups, as Jaden Korr discovered when he encountered a small group of Imperial workers in the employ of a Hutt crimelord on Nar Kreeta and found corpses on Bakura during his mission there, apparently of Bakuran workers who had resisted the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial worker is available as a multiplayer character in both the Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast and Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy video games."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
