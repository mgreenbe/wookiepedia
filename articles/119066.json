Both organic beings and droids were capable of performing acts of sabotage. They were skilled at subtle manipulations designed for simple operation failure or the complete destruction of a target.

There, they took remote control of one of the orbiting solar mirrors. focusing a light beam from the mirror directly onto one of the planet's reservoirs.
