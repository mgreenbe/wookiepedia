They had a tail made out of cartilage, strong joints in pillar-like limbs to handle heavy loads and broad feet with wide toes to increase their stability and stop them sinking into marshes. Biologists surmised that both the fambaas and the falumpasets of Onderon were originally brought there by Naboo merchants, but there was little fossil evidence to back up that hypothesis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gungans used faambas to carry deflector shield generators, a saddle and leather girth around their torso to hold the device and a bridle to control the creature's direction. During a fight on Great Grass Plains, faamba with shield generators were deployed with kaadu and falumpasets to support the Gungan Grand Army."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Original concept sketches of the fambaa depicted them as two-legged dinosaur-like creatures.
