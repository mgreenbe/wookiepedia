When a squad of B1-Series battle droids, R2-D2s droid squadron, arrived on the Citadel's landing bay with a group of prisoners, including Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and Even Piell, this droid asked the leader of the squad where they were taking the prisoners. The battle droid replied that the prisoners were to be taken to Point Tarron, which made this droid suspicious as there were no outposts on Tarron. In the end, after the OOM-class droid insisted that they have orders, this droid let them go. After a few seconds however, this droid was informed by K2-B4 that the prisoners were actually lead by reprogrammed battle droids and that they were escaping. Before having time to react, this droid was cut in half by Obi-Wan's lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This B1 battle droid, like every battle droid in The Clone Wars movie and The Clone Wars TV series, was voiced by Matthew Wood.
