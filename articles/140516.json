Lareka, designated \"TK-4601,\" served as a junior member of Vader's personal legion, known as Vader's Fist.

The plans were taken aboard the CR90 corvette Tantive IV, which fled the site of the battle. After the Devastator intercepted the corvette in above the planet Tatooine, Vader's Fist, Lareka among them, boarded the Tantive IV in search of the plans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the fighting aboard the Tantive IV, Vader's forces captured the vessel's captain, Raymus Antilles, with Vader personally interrogating the man. Lareka witness the short exchange, stood at attention just a meter away as Vader questioned the captain before choking the man to death in his anger. Hearing the snapping of Antilles' back bone, Lareka took a hard swallow. The Sith Lord then gave commands to TK-9091, telling the commander and his men to search the corvette for the plans, taking any passengers alive.

During their sweep, the conversation between Vader and Antilles resounded in Lareka's mind, as well as rumors of the Alderaanian Princeess Leia Organa being aboard the starship, which he considered asking 3338 about. 4247 asked the other troopers if they would find any passengers, to which 9091 mentioned how pleased Vader would be with them if they did.

That was until during a later sweep when 9091 spotted a passenger looking around a corner holding a blaster. The commander pointed the straggler out, turning to Lareka and reminding him to set his blaster to stun. In the following moment, which lasted slowly for Lareka, he studied the traits of the passenger, becoming impressed by the confidence in her expression and deducing her to be Organa. In this passing moment, the princess raised her blaster and shot 9091 while the commander hesitated to react. Organa attempted to flee immediately after, but Lareka stunned her before she could get away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lareka rushed to the princess, worried that she may have died. After confirming otherwise, he told his comrades that Organa would be alright, advising his comrades to inform Vader of their new prisoner. As he then thought of the princess's fate to come, he was informed by 4247 that 9091 had died from Organa's blaster shot. Lareka was surprised at the failure of 9091's armor and his new role as commander of the patrol group by default. He approached the unconscious Organa, who soon began to stir. When the princess attempted to raise her blaster again, Lareka kicked it away, bringing her attention to him. He pulled Organa up by her wrists, with 3338 pressing a blaster against her to oppose her struggling. Bounding her arms together with stun cuffs, Lareka informed the princess that Vader wanted to see her, giving her the options of travelling on foot or being carried."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Organa chose Lareka's latter option, and Lareka reported her capture and 9091's death through his comm, asking for two more troopers after. As 3338 and 4247 questioned his last appeal, he then requested a transfer to active duty, which the individual over the comm granted and informed him that troopers may be sent to the surface of Tatooine. Lareka subsequently decided in his mind that he wanted to fight rebels in the air where he would not witness their faces, like he did with Organa. After the two requested troopers, TK-7624 and TK-8332, arrived, the princess was escorted away by the pair and Lareka's two remaining comrades to be brought to Vader.

At that time, the Alliance, having taken the Death Star plans to their hierarchy, took advantage of a weakness in the superweapon and was able to destroy it, but not before the battle station obliterated the planet Alderaan, Organa's homeworld. After, Commander Udrai took Lareka's squadron aside and informed them that if they could ask for help if they had any troubling thoughts over the recent events."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 ABY, Captain Iden Versio, a survivor from the battle which saw the destruction of the Death Star, transferred to the Determination.

Lareka, having watched the captain fly her TIE, concluded that the reason was down to her skills as a pilot, comparing her flying to an air performance.

Lareka concluded that something was wrong with the Versio and went to catch up with her after the debrief. The captain ignored him at first, but when he fell into step beside her, Versio insisted that she was fine.

Once the droid had returned and was sent on it's way, Versio began, saying that she should have not expressed her feelings on Alderaan to him. Lareka assured her that it was okay and that she was not the only one shaken by the Death Star's destruction. Versio then expressed her distaste in the Empire's obliteration of Alderaan, citing the deaths of innocent civilians who did not sympathize with the Alliance as why the destruction at the hands of a superweapon was unnecessary.

After stating that the Empire only knew violence, the captain turn to the rest of the bar, which had heard her final few lines. Lareka, having recorded their conversation the whole time, sent the recording to Commander Udrai, who messaged the lieutenant that he was on his way.
