However, after overhearing a woman named Mahjo Reeloo pleading with the ship's owner, the smuggler Han Solo, to aid in her quest to find Novian rubies, he decided to reveal himself, surprising Solo. He described the ship as very unusual, asking for its name, and was told it. In response, he playfully referred to the vessel he had stolen as the Centennial Peregrine. Solo objected, but Ohnaka replied that he could not prove otherwise. He went on to state that having stolen and crashed it in the same day, it was a small thing to name it as well, asking if Solo wanted it to have died without a name. Solo retorted that whoever Ohnaka stole it from likely had their own name for it, which he replied was a good point."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Centennial Peregrine appeared briefly in Pirate's Price, a junior novel written by Lou Anders, published in 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
