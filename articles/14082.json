Once there he had to call on a bomber strike to destroy it. However, his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano sneaked aboard the mission when she wasn't supposed to. Together, and with help from Obi-Wan Kenobi, they not not only had the bombers destroy the shipyards, but they freed a number of experienced ship builders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After suffering a major defeat at Nexus Ortai, the Republic decided to attack the shipyards at Gwori, under the command of the Muun overseer, Juhm. However, the planet was protected by a blockade of Munificent-class star frigates. The droids had also developed a machine that scanned all ships and eradicated any biological lifeforms on-board, meaning only droids could pass through harmlessly. To get round this Anakin Skywalker proposed that he, Obi-Wan Kenobi and a small squad of Clone troopers freeze themselves in carbonite in order to bypass the Separatist blockade and survive the eradication beam, as they would not register as life-forms on the droids' scanners. Skywalker's Astromech unit, R2-D2, would pilot a transport ship containing the frozen team. Against Skywalker's instructions his Padawan Ahsoka Tano also had herself frozen in carbonite to join him on the mission. Once there, Anakin and the attack group would deliver the shipyard coordinates to Jedi Masters Plo Koon and Saesee Tiin so they could lead a bombing run on the shipyards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving at Gwori R2-D2 piloted the Freighter VX-391, via a hacked battle droid and joined a convoy of other transport ships approaching the shipyards. Using the battle droid as a puppet to communicate with the scanning gate, R2 successfully piloted the ship through. Unfortunately at that moment Juhm contacted the scanning gate about an irregularity in the convoy. The droids had just assumed that they extra ship was just a miscount by a Plunk Droid, despite being warned of a Jedi attack. The droids suggested destroying all of the freighters as they could not identify which ship was the extra one. However this would cost too much and instead all the transport ships were ordered to change course to platform A-61, which all of the freighters did, expect R2-D2's as he did not know the way. Soon the freighter was attacked by Vulture Droids, luckily R2 was able to eject the frozen clones and Jedi and escape himself before the ship was destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to bypass the Separatist blockade, the 2 Jedi masters and the Republic bombers would have to perform a Precision hyperspace jump. Little did they know that the shipyards were full of slaves. In the meantime, Skywalker, Kenobi, Tano, and Rex were captured. However, with the help of R2-D2, they escaped. Once the bombers arrived, the Jedi decided to escape on a Separatist frigate. However, the bombs took out their shields. Moments after Skywalker led the stolen frigate away from the shipyards, Tiin was about to blast it until Kenobi contacted him and told him not to. Plo Koon then ordered the bombers to strike the construction supports. Once they were done, the shipyards collapsed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The stolen frigate reached the blockade, but it was too big for an immediate hyperspace jump, and it was unable to fight its way out because it hadn't been fitted with armaments when it was stolen. Because their shields were disabled, Skywalker and Kenobi couldn't risk attracting the attention of the Vulture droids that were patrolling the area, and they had to obey the orders of the traffic controllers. The frigate was directed into the scanning station, but Juhm found out where it was and ordered the station to activate the radiation beam. However, Koon and Tiin opened fire on the station, putting the beam out of action. The frigate accelerated through just before the station exploded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi had escaped, the shipyards were destroyed, and Count Dooku ordered Asajj Ventress to kill Overseeer Juhm. Darth Sidious said that it was no major loss however. Back on Coruscant, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine had once again been impressed by Anakin's work. The ex-slaves now could build warships with fair pay and happiness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Note that Rex's armor lost its blue touch as Juhm tries to kill him and Ahsoka"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
