The vessels used by the Imperial Navy were designed to be self-sufficient: Star Destroyers could go several years without resupply, and smaller cruisers could similarly operate unsupported for a year or more\u2014up to two years in the case of a Dreadnaught Cruiser or an escort frigate. In contrast, none of the New Class designs were capable of more than a few months' operation before needing resupplied, and in practice, the New Republic's fleets were constantly being replenished with new supplies by a stream of Hajen-class ships traveling between their patrol areas and bases far to the rear."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This strategy, however, made New Republic military supply-lines vulnerable, and this may, in part, account for the reversion to older, more self-sufficient Imperial-style capital ship designs during and after the Yuuzhan Vong invasion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
