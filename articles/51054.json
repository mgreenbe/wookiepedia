Funeral customs varied widely based on the culture and beliefs of the deceased individual. Groups such as the Jedi also had their own special funeral customs. Funerals were held usually just before the final disposition of a person's remains, which was often burial or cremation. In most cases the person's body was present at the funeral, unless their body was destroyed, could not be retrieved, or in the case of the Jedi became discorporeal after death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Cultures"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The people of Naboo believed that the body of a deceased must be cremated within two days time in order to return the deceased's spirit to the planet.
