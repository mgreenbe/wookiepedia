Their pure white skin distinguished them from a gendered Sabetue. In 13 BBY, they accompanied a male being named Kilmo to meet with one of Lady Proxima's White Worms, a human male named Han Solo, with the intent of purchasing seven vials of coaxium. The Sabetue was quick to realize that Solo was attempting to withhold some of the agreed-upon vials, and flexed their claws to intimidate Solo. However, he continued to offer a lesser number of vials. After Kilmo punched Solo, the Sabetue failed to prevent Solo from fleeing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hiding under Kilmo's M-68 landspeeder, Solo observed the Sabetue walk past and noticed they were in need of a pedicure to address a split claw. It oozed as if they had recently torn it by attacking someone, and given the likely cause, he could not sympathize with the pain it must have caused them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
