Apprenticed to Jedi Master Mierme Unill at the start of the Clone Wars, he was reassigned to Temple Battlemaster Cin Drallig following Unill's death. Jukassa was stationed at the Coruscant Jedi Temple with Drallig when the ancient edifice was invaded by the Grand Army of the Republic under the orders of the Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Fleeing the Temple, Jukassa was shot and killed by Clone Sergeant Fox in front of Senator Bail Organa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Born to Sembric and Ashielle Skamini on the Mid Rim world of Mon Gazza, the young boy named Warpoc Skamini was identified as a newborn to be Force-sensitive and sent by his parents to the Coruscant Jedi Temple for training in the ways of the Force. While studying at the Temple academy, a seven year old Jukassa began to receive visions of his parents' brutal murder on his homeworld. Unaware of his heritage per Order policy, Jukassa's plight reached the ears of the Jedi investigating the murders, Jedi Knight Mierme Unill. With the permission of the Jedi High Council, Unill and Chief Librarian Jocasta Nu related the facts of the murders to Jukassa in hopes that he could ease the boy's suffering, and discover clues to the murderer's identity. Unill's intuition proved correct in this case, leading him to uncover ties to Black Sun in his investigation thanks to Jukassa's assistance. Following the arrests, Unill was so impressed with Jukassa's maturity and strength that he selected him to be his Padawan apprentice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Jukassa seemed to show a propensity for the ability known as Farsight, Unill did not have time to expand on this ability as the tensions between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems interrupted regular training within the Order. Called into service within the Grand Army of the Republic, Jukassa was given the rank of Commander and aided his Master in campaigns outside the Temple walls. While on the battlefield, Unill was slain by the Separatist Droid Army, leaving Jukassa an orphaned Padawan and confined to the Temple on Coruscant. Continuing his studies at the academy, he was temporarily assigned to Temple Battlemaster Cin Drallig."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the deaths of Count Dooku and General Grievous, the High Council moved against the Supreme Chancellor who was in fact the elusive Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious. Still stationed at the Temple, Master Shaak Ti armed him and other Padawan and Knights as the Temple went on high alert. Under the leadership of Darth Vader, the Grand Army that the Jedi had served side-by-side with invaded the Temple, slaying all within. Fleeing to the upper levels, Jukassa fought his way through one of the hangars and onto the landing platform. Out in the night air, Jukassa raced for the recently landed speeder that belonged to Senator Bail Organa, a long time supporter and friend of the Jedi who had come to investigate the smoke rising from the ancient edifice. On his way to freedom, Jukassa cut through eight troopers wounding the assault's leader, Commander Appo, in the process. However, before he could make it to the speeder, Jukassa was shot dead by the accurate blaster-handling of Sergeant Fox. Fleeing the scene after Jukassa's death, Senator Organa departed Coruscant in search of any surviving Jedi."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the fighting at the Temple came to a close, the clone troopers cross-checked the names of the dead with the Temple Archives' records.
