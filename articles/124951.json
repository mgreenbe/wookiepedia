Ziro was wanted by the Hutt Grand Council because he knew damaging information about them and had hidden that information in a journal. This datapad, which he had once hidden on the planet Teth, contained information about the criminal activities of the Hutt Council. Bane brought Ziro to the palace of Gardulla Besadii the Elder on Nal Hutta, where the Hutt Council imprisoned him. The Pa'lowick singer Sy Snootles, on the orders of Ziro's nephew Jabba Desilijic Tiure, broke Ziro out of prison and the two escaped Gardulla's Palace to find a ship to bring them to Teth; Ziro hoped to recover his journal, while Snootles had orders to bring the datapad to Jabba."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Quinlan Vos were sent by the Jedi Council to locate Ziro and return him to Republic imprisonment. When they arrived on Nal Hutta, Gardulla denied knowledge of being involved in Ziro's escape, but the Jedi learned that the Hutt had indeed been in their custody and escaped. Kenobi and Vos set out into the swampy marshes of Nal Hutta to search for the escaped Hutt. Also on Ziro's trail was Bane, who was tasked by the Hutt Council with returning Ziro to their custody. Vos and Kenobi discovered a house that belonged to Mama, Ziro's mother, and learned that Ziro and Snootles had taken her starship, bound for Teth. Bane also learned this information and set out for Teth ahead of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The skirmish"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cad tried to sneak his way out of the situation by playing friendly but Obi-Wan reminded him of holding the entire senate hostage on Coruscant. The Jedi then attempted to apprehend Bane but Bane made his move by bringing out his blasters just as the Jedi ignited their lightsabers. Bane fired at them but the Jedi deflected all the blaster shots. Bane then attempted to flee by jumping on the large platforms while simultaneously firing at the Jedi as they followed. But as Quinlan jumped, Bane threw a cord at his legs, tangling them and tying them up. Using his lightsaber, Quinlan cut through the ropes and followed Kenobi in pursuing Bane."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane fired on the platform Kenobi was standing on, causing it to collapse. But Kenobi managed to grab on to a nearby platform.\nQuinlan confronted Bane but while he deflected Bane's shots, Todo appeared from behind him and pulled at his braids, distracting him. Bane then rolled under Quinlan and kicked him onto the lower platform. Bane aimed at him and was about to deliver the killing blow when Kenobi intervened, forcing Bane to accidentely fall over the edge, losing one of his blasters in the process.\nTodo, who had grabbed Quinlan's lightsaber while he was down, attempted to kill Kenobi but Kenobi eluded him and grabbed the lightsaber before Force pushing Todo away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane used his remaining blaster on Kenobi while Kenobi deflected them right back at him, striking his hand and causing him to lose his second blaster. Bane then attempted to run away but Kenobi caught up to him and kicked him but not before Bane grabbing Quinlan's lightsaber from Kenobi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short lightsaber duel erupted between them in which Kenobi quickly disarmed Bane, but the Bane ultimately ended up victorious as he grabbed Kenobi's arm and shocked him before kicking him down. However, Quinlan recovered and quickly caught up with Bane while he was in flight using his jet boots. Both began punching at each other in mid-air until they landed on a platform. During that time, Bane had lost his hat. Bane got up again and once again activated his jet boots and flew away. He then aimed at Quinlan and fired two rounds of flames at him though Quinlan dodged both of them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finally, Bane retreated to his ship, followed by Todo who had recovered his hat. Before the Jedi could stop them, the bounty hunter and his droid had fled although neither side had achieved their mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
