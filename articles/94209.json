Seeking compensation, Tofarain signed onto the CR90 corvette FarStar, which was assigned to search the Kathol sector for Moff Kentor Sarne. As part of the deal, he offered the use of the Muvon. Commonly used as a personnel transport, the ship carried no New Republic markings and could easily pass for a civilian transport hauler when a more subtle approach was needed. Used to deliver landing parties to the surface of planets the FarStar visited, Tofarain insisted on personally flying the ship himself."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Theft"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a mission to the planet Uukaablis, the Muvon was stolen by the FarStar's Rodian first officer, Gorak Khzam, and the Turazza, Nizzal.
