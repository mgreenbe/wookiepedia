She was the rancor trainer for the Raining Leaves Clan. In 43.5 ABY, Nuln was one of the nine Witches of the Raining Leaves Clan who attempted to stop Luke Skywalker and Ben Skywalker from approaching their territory during their upcoming conclave with the all-male Broken Columns Clan. However, the Skywalkers defeated the Witches, with the help of Han Solo, Leia Solo, the Force-sensitive Dyon Stadd, the Dathomiri Tribeless Sha, Carrack, and Yliri Consta. The Witches then allowed the Skywalkers, the Solos, Stadd, Sha, Carrack, and Consta to attend the Conclave. After suffering several attacks by Nightsisters, the conclave was moved to the newly-christened Jedi Hill Camp, where the two clans were merged into one clan, Bright Sun Clan. There, Nuln participated in the final battle with the Nightsisters, which the Bright Sun Clan won."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
