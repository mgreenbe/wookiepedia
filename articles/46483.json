Shortly before Battle of Starkiller Base, FN-9330 was stationed at the base. As the trooper was boarding the transport compartment, the doors opened, revealing Han Solo, Finn, and Chewbacca in front of him. He had just enough time to exclaim his surprise before being shot point-blank with the Wookiee's bowcaster, blasting the trooper several feet backwards and killing him. Chewbacca then moved his body out of sight to avoid detection at the base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "FN-9330 was played by Nigel Godrich in the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, the first installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy.
