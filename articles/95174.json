During their 99th day on sea, Nanda's Luck was attacked by the Majestic, the flagship of Pyash Yopayomba, the Pirate Queen of Ando. After a short skirmish, the pirates emerged victorious with Yopayomba killing Bogzider and appointing Sissalik as the new Captain of Nanda's Luck."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship's cargo of Andoan mineral-fish shells were replaced with explosives. Yopayomba's plan was to ram the Quantill City harbor terminal port, thereby possibly taking out a good portion of the city filled with revelers of the Portage Moon Festival. Pre-planted evidence would then place the blame on racist Aquala extremists, which would start a planetary civil war, benefiting the Galactic Empire. In exchange for her help in the plot, Yopayomba was to be given complete control of Ando's oceans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Sissalik took control of the ship through the manual bridge controls.
