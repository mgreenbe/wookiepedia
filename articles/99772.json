They fed on thistlebuzzers, gorpions, and other insects. The oki-poki had large, vibrating ears that could detect very distinct sounds, as well as sensitive vibrating eyes that allowed them to \"see\" sounds. The tufts of fur on top of their ears helped aid in sensing wind direction. Occasionally, oki-poki were domesticated by the Aki-Aki in order to rid crops of pests."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Oki-poki were created for the 2019 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker.
