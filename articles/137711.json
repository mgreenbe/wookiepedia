In 3 ABY, after the Rebel Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry captured the Inyusu Tor mineral processing facility near the city, Pinyumb was put on lockdown by the Galactic Empire. A number of residents who had run out of food were present in the Swift Market when they were found by Imperial stormtroopers, who informed the people that they should have remained at home. The residents were subsequently beaten, bruised and shot at. A number of them returned to a dormitory where the resistance fighter Nien Nunb was handing out supplies, accompanied by the 61st's tentative captain, Hazram Namir. One of the injured people told the pair of their encounter with the stormtroopers at the Swift Market."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Swift Market was mentioned in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
