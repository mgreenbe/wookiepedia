Throughout the battle, Bruck grew increasingly angrier, as did Obi-Wan, but Obi-Wan eventually emerged victorious, tiring his opponent to the point of defeat. Yoda dispensed sage advice, but neither apprentice paid attention. After their Master left, Bruck taunted Obi-Wan into another, unauthorized, battle. Both boys fought until they were exhausted. Obi-Wan left the training area and returned to his room, but Bruck traveled up to the infirmary, muttered Obi-Wan's name, and pretended to pass out: his plan all along was to discredit Obi-Wan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that evening, as Obi-Wan bandaged his wounds, his clan Master, Docent Vant, arrived with shocking news: Vant's datapad detailed Obi-Wan's orders to report to the freighter Monument for transfer to the Agricultural Corps. Obi-Wan protested the decision, claiming that he could still become a Jedi Knight, but Docent was firm, and finally Obi-Wan conceded. He packed his bags, and after a tearful encounter with his Mon Calamari friend Bant, he went to bed in a state of despondency, in a world that now lacked meaning for him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next morning, Obi-Wan prepared to leave. The medics healed his burns, and he traveled down to the refrectory for one last meal at the Temple. During breakfast, he said goodbye to his friends Garen Muln and Reeft, as well as Bant. All three tried to reassure him, but he was unaffected by their consolation. It was the taunts of Bruck Chun and his friend Aalto that struck closer to home. Although Reeft broke the mood with some timely, food-related humor, it was clear that Obi-Wan felt that there was no hope remaining."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, on top of one of the Temple's tallest towers, in the Room of a Thousand Fountains, Yoda was arguing on his behalf. Although Mace Windu was originally skeptical, the testimony of Advanced Jedi Training Droid 6, a witness to the fight, swayed him. Yoda said that both Bruck and Obi-Wan would be allowed to spar for Qui-Gon Jinn that afternoon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that afternoon, Obi-Wan and Bruck sparred. Obi-Wan was fighting well, but because this was his last chance to be claimed as a Padawan, he suddenly attacked furiously, defeating Bruck. He went to Qui-Gon Jinn, sure that now that he had proven himself, Qui-Gon would accept him as a Padawan. However, Qui-Gon disapproved of his aggressive fighting style, and rejected him, saying that Obi-Wan would be at too great a risk for the dark side. Obi-Wan silently left the Temple, sadder than ever before."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Qui-Gon entered the Map Room, upset by the memory of Obi-Wan's expression. Yoda approached and confronted him, saying that if he did not take Obi-Wan as a Padawan, Obi-Wan's dreams would die. Qui-Gon prevaricated, saying that perhaps he would choose a Padawan next year. Yoda chided him for his reluctance, and reminded Qui-Gon that he too fought angrily as a boy. But Qui-Gon still refused to take Obi-Wan. Yoda warned him that if he did not choose an apprentice, he might end up with one anyway. Qui-Gon enquired as to Obi-Wan's assignment. Yoda replied that he was to work with the Agricultural Corps on Bandomeer, a statement that surprised Qui-Gon, who was just assigned a mission on the same planet. Yoda responded that Bandomeer is a good place for young Jedi to learn, and left Qui-Gon with the advice that he too still had more to learn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Both Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan left for Bandomeer, however en route they were attacked by unknown criminals. After working together to defeat the criminals, the two continued to Bandomeer. When they arrived, Qui-Gon discovered that the planet didn't need Jedi assistance after all and that it was all a ruse, set up by Qui-Gon's former Padawan, Xanatos, the leader of the criminals who attacked the two before, the Offworld Mining Corporation, a criminal organization terrorizing all of Bandomeer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
