His family was killed by stormtroopers when he was very young, and it was during their executions that Durrei first used his latent Force abilities, using the dark side to kill the Imperials. Following his parents' murders, Durrei committed himself to the dark side of the Force, and joined a splinter faction of the Empire in their fight against the Imperials. Durrei eventually discovered clues about a rare Force artifact called the Kashi Mer talisman, and used his new contacts to pursue the relic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Human male Durrei was born in 13 BBY, during the reign of the Galactic Empire, and he grew up on the planet Elrood. When he was very young, a squad of stormtroopers tried to arrest Durrei's mother, who they suspected of treason against the Empire. When Durrei's father resisted, the soldiers opened fire, destroying all in front of them. Faced with such destruction, Durrei unleashed his latent Force ability, using the dark side to destroy the soldiers. However, despite his efforts, he was not able to save the lives of his parents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Durrei fled his home and began searching for other Force-sensitives that could teach him in any way. Driven by the death of his parents, he dedicated himself to the dark side, to avoid ever being helpless again. During this period, he acquired a red-bladed lightsaber, which he soon learned to use, and he became the lover of the Dark Jedi and Emperor's Hand Arden Lyn. After a number of years, at some point after the Battle of Endor of 4 ABY, Durrei was approached by the warlord Ennix Devian, who persuaded the young darksider to join him in fighting against the remnants of Empire\u2014Durrei readily agreed. Devian had stolen Imperial technology which he planned to turn against the Empire and though Durrei later learned that Devian was the leader of the restored Empire, an Imperial splinter faction, Durrei was content to serve him so long as other Imperials were killed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Relic hunting"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 9 ABY, at the age of twenty-two, Durrei heard of a mysterious Force artifact, a relic of the ancient Kashi Mer Dynasty that had previously been possessed by his lover Arden Lyn. A prism-shaped gray rock, approximately twenty by ten centimeters, the relic reportedly conveyed on its possessor the ability to tap directly into the dark side. The relic had been stolen by Reda Jalooz, a confused student of the Force, and had surfaced in the Corva sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Desperate for the device, Durrei convinced Devian to give him troops and former Imperial equipment to track it down. Devian had his own motivations for aiding Durrei and the warlord hoped to be able to harness the artifact's rumored power to cause stars to go supernova. The relic was acquired by a Gotal crime lord by the name of Mahk'khar. Durrei arranged to trade with the Gotal for the relic on the abandoned world of Jandoon. In exchange for the relic, Durrei was to give over Meela, the kidnapped daughter of a local professor, Oron, as well as 10,000 credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Traveling in a Lambda-class shuttle, he met Mahk'khar in some of the abandoned ruins on the planet. However, the two were ambushed by a group of New Republic operatives, trying to claim the relic. Accompanied by only four bodyguards, Durrei fought off some of the operatives before telekinetically retrieving the relic from Mahk'khar's hands and retreating with it, leaving his bodyguards to buy him time. The New Republic operatives soon after continued their pursuit of Durrei. Devian later reached the conclusion that Durrei was no longer of use to him and he betrayed Durrei and Lyn to Antinnis Tremayne, an Imperial Inquisitor and former sparring partner of Devian who was resentful of Lyn as a result of a past encounter between them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Durrei's life was dramatically affected by the murder of his parents, leading him to dedicate himself to the dark side, to avoid ever being helpless again. It also led him to being easily convinced to join the fight against the Empire.
