Around twenty years before 7 ABY, the medical droid accompanied its Wandering Star masters in the kidnapping of two medical students, one being a Pau'an named Fyzen Gor. Gor later went on to become the droid's master after a rival Utai gang ambushed the Wandering Star's transport speeder, causing an accident that killed most of the criminals.
