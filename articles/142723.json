While altering the appearance of his starfighter to make it appear heavily damaged, Skywalker notes to R2-D2 that the fighter's fake battle scars must look very realistic. Skywalker's former Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, congratulates Skywalker on his work, while Skywalker's apprentice, Ahsoka Tano, states that the Twilight is approaching their destination, an ice field. Although Tano is skeptical of their plan, Skywalker believes that the Confederate battle droids are so gullible that they will be tricked by anything. With his starfighter now appearing disabled, Skywalker boards it, and the Twilight releases both the fighter and a broken hyperspace docking ring into the ice field."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nearby, on a Confederate Munificent-class frigate, a B1-Series battle droid informs the ship's droid captain that they have found the remains of a Jedi starfighter with a single life-sign aboard.

In the frigate's hangar, Skywalker's fighter is brought in, with several armed battle droids ordering the Jedi to come out. Skywalker jumps out of the fighter, attacking and destroying several droids with his lightsaber. However, a B2 super battle droid manages to disarm the Jedi by shooting Skywalker's lightsaber out of his hand.
