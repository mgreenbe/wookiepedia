Blast doors could also be used to seal off a portion of a ship which has been breached from the vacuum of space. In 32 BBY, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn tried to melt through a blast door with his lightsaber to get to the Trade Federation's Viceroy. His efforts were met with initial success, but the droidekas on the ship drove him away before he could finish. In Neimoidian society, which focused heavily on one's status, this symbolism extended to the blast doors on the Saak'ak, with three blast doors indicating that the ones behind the room were of very high-level and were thus superior. Blast doors were also present on the Death Star I as large rectangular doors that slowly opened and closed. Han Solo and Chewbacca escaped from pursuing stormtroopers by leaping through a closing blast door during their rescue of Princess Leia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
