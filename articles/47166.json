During a raid on the Pilgrims' Kalikori village, Fashk abducted a young Twi'lek boy named Viyo Kobbeth to use as an interpreter. When a traveling Padawan from the nearby Jedi Temple came looking for Kobbeth, Fashk abandoned the Flesh Raiders and revealed his desires to join the Order instead since he wanted to control his Force abilities through training. Fashk wished to become a better hunter through fine control of the Force, and the Padawan believed it would be best if the Flesh Raider could at least be evaluated by the Jedi Masters at the Temple. The Padawan also knew that if Fashk was left to his own devices, there was always a chance he could fall to the dark side. The Padawan then met with Jedi Master Strayen to discuss the issue, in which they agreed on the matter that he had to be trained. When the Padawan delivered the news along with a token to ensure Fashk's safe entry into the temple, the Flesh Raider released Viyo to the Padawan and immediately headed for the Temple."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fashk is a non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011.
