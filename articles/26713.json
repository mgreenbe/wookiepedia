Whereas in this period, HKD were best known for the large capital ships used by the Trade Federation, the Chryya belonged to a design lineage of fast scouts that stretched back to the Delaya-class courier of four thousand years earlier, also embodied by the contemporary Tavya-class armored picket and Seltaya-class fast courier. Like those other ships, the Chryya took its class-name from a planet ending in -a, in this case Chryya, once visited by Darth Maul."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chryya could be flown by a single pilot, but the cockpit also contained a seat and console for a dedicated gunner to operate the turret-mounted laser cannon, and was large enough for entry and exit through a hatch in the forward hull, rather than simply an opening canopy. Six months before the fall of the Galactic Republic, Anakin Skywalker was using a modified Chryya as his personal starfighter, although it was stolen from him by Asajj Ventress on Vjun."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
