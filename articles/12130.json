In 8 ABY, Balkin attended a strategy session that was held by Grand Admiral Thrawn, the leader of the Empire of the Hand, aboard the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Admonitor, to discuss tactics for an upcoming attack on the planet Quethold, against the combined forces of the alien warlord Nuso Esva and the Quesoth species. After some discussion, Thrawn decided to send a Quesoth to make a holocam recording of an art collection that Esva possessed, to aide the Admiral in analyzing Esva's military strategies. Once the footage had been obtained, Thrawn, Balkin and some other senior Empire of the Hand figures convened to review the footage. Shortly afterward, the Imperials initiated an attack on Quethold and during the battle, Balkin directed three stormtrooper squads that landed on the planet and engaged the Quesoth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
