The bulk of his forces comprised the Kathol Sector Imperial Fleet, which Sarne commanded during his tenure as Moff of the Kathol sector. When he withdrew the sector from the Galactic Empire following the death of Emperor Palpatine at the Battle of Endor, the forces came under his sole command. Sarne used his military to enforce his will throughout the sector, until 8 ABY, when the New Republic liberated his capital of Kal'Shebbol. Taking the majority of his forces into the deepest regions of the sector, he plotted to destroy the New Republic regional fleet and reclaim the sector. However, his forces were defeated at the Battle of Kathol System."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Space forces"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Ground forces"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personnel"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Military"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Political"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Civilian"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
