The Drethi produced a venom which \"burns when the Force flows,\" making its lethality commensurate with the victim's contact with the Force. The Jedi Padawan, Niquon, fought a Drethi on Skalokor when facing a group of Dark Jedi who had rediscovered the ancient beasts. There was an audible sizzling sound when a Jedi's wounds were touched with Drethi venom. The poison was absolutely lethal to a Jedi unless an antidote made from the venom itself was administered immediately. When a Drethi was killed, it disintegrated into black ash."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
