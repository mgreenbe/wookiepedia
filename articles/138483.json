Standard equipment on the TDL was four arms covered with Synthflesh that mimicked the child's mother's scent and warmth and an internal 2L tank that could hold milk. The TDL/X1-Lioness variant had two concealed blaster cannons in their bottom arms. One such droid was combined with a YVH 1 battle droid to make Nanna, an effective nanny and bodyguard for Ben Skywalker while his parents were away. Years earlier, Anakin Solo was protected by a TDL/X1-Lioness while on Anoth. This droid was modified so that all four arms contained hidden blasters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known units"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
