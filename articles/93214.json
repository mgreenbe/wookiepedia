The Son later succeeded in turning Skywalker to the dark side by exposing him to the actions of his future self, although The Father later eliminated his memories of the event after discovering this to break the dark side's hold on him. The Father later sacrificed himself by stabbing himself with the Mortis Dagger to weaken The Son enough for Skywalker to finish him off. After the Father's body vanished, the Force energies that permeated and sustained Mortis dissipated causing floating rocks to fall and even the crystal hovering above the Father's monastery fell and shattered.
