Unfortunately, the loss of everything he had ever known in life coupled with his seclusion on Raxus Prime, drove him insane. In a desperate attempt to cling to the Jedi Order, Paratus constructed a crude yet accurate replica of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant out of waste refuse on the planet's surface. This Temple was guarded by Junk golems that Paratus also built himself, and included the four spires of the Jedi, complete with a Jedi Council chamber and robotic Jedi Masters. These all were destroyed by Darth Vader's secret apprentice, Starkiller. Paratus was also fatally injured by Starkiller, allowing the crazed Jedi to become one with the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
