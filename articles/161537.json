In 22 BBY, Bitas entered Blob 14 in the third blob race at the planet Umgul's Fondine Blob Raceways. Blob 14 was not expected to win, but Bitas introduced prohibited viscosity-enhancing substances into the creature's system, an offense that was punishable by death.

The character was named after Bob Vitas, creator of the fan-made The Completely Unofficial Star Wars Encyclopedia (CUSWE). Vitas considers it an honor to have been made into a Star Wars character, and has written fan fiction about Bitas in an issue of the fanzine Star Wars Outsider. Although Vitas is male, Bitas's sex was not established in the HoloNet News article, nor in Bitas's entry in 2008's The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia\u2014a work co-authored by Vitas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2005, author Abel G.

Pe\u00f1a also jokingly implied that Hidalgo had killed Bitas off due to the CUSWE having once been a rival of Hidalgo's own Star Wars Index in the realm of online fan depositories of Star Wars knowledge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
