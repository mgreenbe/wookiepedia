Aphra managed to override his restraining bolt in another escape attempt, but Dek-Nil was disassembled by the Force spirit.

Aphra made a decoy control circuit to prevent restraining bolts taking over the droid, hiding the real one behind beskar plating. Dek-Nil was chosen by 0-0-0 as part of a crew put together in order to carry out a mission to Skako Minor in hopes of locating his memories. Once the crew arrived on Skako, the Skakoan Hallio Bas revealed that he had betrayed them, leading them into an Imperial trap. Aphra killed Bas and the Imperials with Flufto, an explosive tooka that she had cloned."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Able to continue their mission, the crew broke into the workshop of Wat Tambor. Dek-Nil was able to sense Magna Tolvan's Delta-class T-3c shuttle moments before it crashed into the workshop, awakening a chthonic worm god. During the resulting fight that occurred, Dek-Nil fired a shot that caused a stormtrooper to misfire and collapse the ceiling on the worm god, killing it. The crew looted what was left of the workshop before leaving Skako Minor.

The Rebel officer Bini assumed the crew were recruits, showing them around the school. When Sister Six questioned where the Defel Glahst Ombra had gone, Dek-Nil cryptically predicted that Magna Tolvan was wearing Ombra's fur as a disguise, breaking a pipe that leaked onto the floor. The crew were then discovered by General Hera Syndulla, who realized they were mercenaries and imprisoned them. As Dek-Nil had predicted, Tolvan entered his and Aphra's cell wearing the fur of Ombra. As Tolvan questioned Aphra, threatening her, the pipe that Dek-Nil had broken leaked onto several wires, causing an electrical surge that knocked Tolvan unconscious and unlocked the prison's cells. The crew escaped the Lucrehulk-class Battleship, managing to capture General Syndulla as their prisoner."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arriving at Hivebase-1, Aphra used Syndulla to both trick the Imperials into allowing them to board and to allow the Lucrehulk Prime to pursue them, becoming trapped in a skirmish with the Imperial forces.

One of the prototypes shot Dek-Nil, seemingly destroying him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Dek-Nil was not destroyed, and had been merely playing dead. He sabotaged the station's registry, renaming its firing patterns, before shooting at the scaraphyte swarm that surrounded the station, causing it to behave erratically. Dek-Nil's sabotage of the registry led one of the Imperials into saying the codeword that activated Aphra's exploding tookas, who had been let free around the station.

The Galactic Empire attempted to reprogram Dek-Nil by placing a restraining bolt on him, but Aphra had his real control circuit hidden behind a solid beskar casing. After being assigned a squad, Dek-Nil arranged for the deaths of his squad members in what appeared to be improbable accidents. During an attack on a Rebel Alliance EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate, Dek-Nil encountered Aphra and her squad, who had sabotaged and destroyed their hubdroid moments earlier. Aphra, along with \"Lopset Yas\", the only survivor from their squad who was truly Cornelius Evazan in disguise, was saved by Dek-Nil, who transferred their proximity bombs to himself, preventing their detonation.

Before they could board the escape pod, however, Dek-Nil's restraining bolt was mysteriously moved into place by a Force spirit. With the restraining bolt in place, the Imperial programming was able to take over his actions. Dek-Nil destroyed the escape pod, forcing Aphra and Yas to return to Accresker Jail. Aphra was later taken in for interrogation, where Dek-Nil suggested several ideas to stop Aphra resisting the mind probe. On their way back to the prison, Aphra pleaded with Dek-Nil, hoping he was pretending to be under Imperial control, but the droideka silenced her, ordering her back to her quarters."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Destruction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the battle, Dek-Nil and another hubdroid detected a transmission being broadcasted from the prisoners' quarters, and went out searching for it.

The prison arrived at the scene of three Imperial-class Star Destroyers, which had disabled a pirate station as a part of the Empire's bandit purges. The prisoners were released to lay siege on the stranded pirates, with Dek-Nil leading Aphra and Yas into the engagement. As they charged into battle, Aphra used Imperial authority code 6690B1 on Dek-Nil, overriding his restraining bolt, and forced him to take them around to a meeting point where Magna Tolvan had arrived to pick up Aphra and Yas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aphra and Yas were about to escape aboard Tolvan's TIE fighter when their plan was foiled by the Force spirit, who destroyed the sensor disruptors before leading Aphra to the abandoned wreckage of a Penumbra-1 shattersprite. Aphra, distracted by the ancient Jedi craft, went to investigate, and Dek-Nil followed. However, as they reached the ship, the spirit disassembled Dek-Nil with the Force, leaving his components scattered. Aphra discovered that the spirit's existence was due to gundravian hookspores mutated with the Force, but Aphra and Yas were forced to retreat due to the receding airdome. Yas took Dek-Nil's central processor along with them to keep their proximity bombs safe, and continued to carry the piece of Dek-Nil as they were forced to return to the prison."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Aphra was forced to reveal the infestation of hookspores while being interrogated by a bor gullet, the Accresker command abandoned the prison, setting its course to crash into the Rebel Alliance-affiliated planet of Tiferep Major.

Once inside the cruiser, Aphra asked Yas to give her the piece of Dek-Nil, which she used to slice into the generator that controlled the gravity in the prison.

Yas continued to carry Dek-Nil on his back even as he stunned Aphra, taking her captive aboard Tam Posla's ship.

He was altered to have a decoy control circuit, with the real circuit hidden behind beskar plating, preventing restraining bolts from affecting him. He was made of several mismatched parts, including the head of an astromech droid. When taken to Accresker Jail, he was given a restraining bolt and became one of the prison's hubdroids, but his decoy control circuit protected him.
