Having been forced into a retreat at the First Battle of Felucia, the Republic re-established a presence there thanks to the efforts of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, who led their clone troopers on an offensive into Separatist-held territory. In retaliation, General Grievous supplied one of his outposts on Felucia with reinforcements to secure the system for the Confederacy. Responding to the arrival of the battle droid detachment, Skywalker, Tano, and Jedi Master Plo Koon targeted the enemy outpost with a three-pronged assault, each leading a squad to divide the Separatist defenses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Supported by heavy artillery tanks situated on an adjacent ridge, the Jedi and clones were able to secure the base from T-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid TZ-33, eliminating all of the droid forces there.
