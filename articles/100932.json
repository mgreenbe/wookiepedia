It was guarded by a statue of a great hero named Tet-Ami, the Time Guardian, who saved the armies of Carthas from a plague of insect-like beasts in an epic battle. This device was said to control the flow of time. Sometime after its construction, the orb was secretly taken by the Jedi Order, and knowledge of the temple was lost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
