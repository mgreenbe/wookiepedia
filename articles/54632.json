They resembled aggressive Geonosian air patrol skimmers and as a result, the Ginivex-class starfighters were informally dubbed \"Fanblades\" for their most distinctive feature. The slim, elegant vessel had an iridescent fan-like wing extending from its dorsal and ventral surface. The wing could fold inward to hide flush with the ship's body."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Fanblades were armed with four laser cannons, two primary and two secondary. The two secondary cannons could swivel to the correct position, regardless of whether the fan was open or closed. In combat mode, these laser cannons had an enlarged firing arc. When the boom arms were shut, these cannons still pointed forward due to a limited hinge joint that locked them into place."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though this combat mode greatly increased the fighter's target silhouette, the exotic material of the fan served as a transmission plane for deflector shield energy. With shields fully energized, the Fanblade was a tough target to hit. However, the energy output made the fighter stand out like a beacon on sensors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a manner similar to the sail found on Dooku's solar sailer, the fan also served as an alternate form of propulsion, though the ship was equipped with standard sublight and hyperspace drives. When not in combat mode, the starfighter lost the benefit of enhanced shields, but was difficult to target due to its tiny silhouette. Also, ion bafflers incorporated into its sublight engines made it very stealthy. At the head of the ship was the bulbous cockpit, designed only for use by humanoid occupants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Fanblades would land, their sails would retract so that the ship could rest on the ventral laser cannons, as well its front landing gear."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Asajj Ventress became a disciple of Count Dooku, she had the sextet of fighters moved to her headquarters on Rattatak. Through the course of the Clone Wars, Asajj would have two of these fighters stolen from her, one by Anakin Skywalker on Yavin 4 and the other by Obi-Wan Kenobi on Rattatak. Dooku later gave her a third, Last Call, though this was destroyed on Phindar by Palleus Chuff."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the battle at Sullust, Ventress used another fighter to led a strike force of tri-fighters to destroy Skywalker's flagship, the Resolute, which was successful. She then chased General Kenobi before she crashed in the hangar of her own flagship, where Ventress called Dooku for assistance. However, he called back her reinforcements and renounced her as his apprentice, then her flagship was destroyed under the command of TJ-912. Soon after, she was picked up in her damaged starfighter by scavengers aboard the Raider, which she hijacked and went to Dathomir for help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Separatist officer Vulpus also used one for his meetings with General Grievous. During the Battle of Coruscant, near the climax of the Clone Wars, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala heard a rumor of Fanblade fighters taking part in the attack, but it is unclear as to whether or not this was actually the case."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the Ginivex is first depicted in Star Wars: Clone Wars as well as its other comic appearances as having an actual solar sail extending from its wings, the ship's appearance in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars TV series has the sail depicted as an energy construct similar to a Ray shield rather than made of the sail material."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
