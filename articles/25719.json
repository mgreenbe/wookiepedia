Two known members of the resistance included the Jedi Knight Gorlan Palladane and the Rodian mechanic Skodo. Known actions during the Chelloan affair included assisting a Jedi strike force led by Vannar Treece during Operation Influx, sheltering the Jedi Knight Kerra Holt, and spearheading evacuation efforts during the Destruction of Chelloa. They also possessed a transmitter which was used to send a distress signal to the Jedi and to provide Odion with false intelligence about the end of baradium mining operations. They helped establish the Freedom Fleet which succeeded in evacuating the Chelloan population to Republic-controlled space in 1032 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known Members"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
