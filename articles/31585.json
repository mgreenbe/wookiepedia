He became a highly decorated officer, and obtained the military rank of general. However, he ended up defecting to the Rebel Alliance, a resistance group that opposed the tyranny of the Empire during the Galactic Civil War. Holding the rank of General, he specialized in covert actions that involved the theft of equipment from the Empire and infiltration of strike teams onto occupied worlds.

The Alliance decided to destroy the battle station before it was completed, but needed time to gather the Alliance Fleet near Sullust. Princess Leia Organa proposed leading a mission, dubbed Operation Yellow Moon, to distract the Empire's attention to the Corva sector on the opposite side of the galaxy from Sullust."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Madine and the other rebel commanders agreed with her plan, and Madine volunteered to serve on the mission as a commando. Admiral Ackbar rejected him, noting that he was needed to plan the assault on the second Death Star. Instead, Madine assigned one of his best commandos, Major Lokmarcha, to the mission. Leia succeeded in completing the operation, although Lokmarcha and another rebel operative died.

Thanks to Leia's theft of the Tydirium, the general planned on sneaking a strike team onto the Forest Moon of Endor, where the Empire had built a shield generator to protect the battle station. From the moon's surface, the Rebels could take down the shield generator, leaving the Death Star vulnerable to the Alliance Fleet's firepower. In order to accomplish that mission, Madine asked his fellow general Han Solo to assemble and lead the strike team."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the Battle of Endor, General Madine gave a hologram briefing to the various starfighter squadrons in the Alliance Fleet including Corona Squadron, which was based aboard the Mon Calamari cruiser Liberty. When Kendy Idele asked who would take care of the deflector shield generator on Endor, Madine reassured her that Solo's team would handle that matter. When several Corona pilots including Yendor chatted about Han, Madine interjected that Solo was one of their best assets. He then assigned Corona Squadron to escort General Lando Calrissian in the Millennium Falcon and the Gold, Red, Green, and Gray Squadrons as they penetrated the second Death Star. Madine's plan ultimately succeeded, which led to the Alliance's most crucial victory over the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the destruction of the second Death Star, Madine kept the fleet on alert over the moon of Endor as he was concerned about a possible Imperial counterattack. The next day, Madine conferred with General Solo about an Imperial outpost still operating on the other side of the moon from the shield generator.

After Admiral Ackbar received vital intelligence on Imperial fleet movements from a mysterious informant called the Operator, General Madine was part of a hologram conference that included Commander Kyrsta Agate, Captain Saff Melor, and Chancellor Mon Mothma. When Madine questioned the trustworthiness of this informant, Agate responded that the Operator had been reliable so far. However, Ackbar cautioned that the Empire was playing a long game. At the advice of Ackbar, Madine agreed to divert a small team of Special Forces soldiers led by Sergeant Jom Barell to investigate the Imperial presence on Akiva. While most of the unit was killed, Barell played a role in the successful rebellion on Akiva."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 5 ABY, Madine attended the Liberation Day celebrations held at Chandrila's Old Gather-House. Mothma had organized Liberation Day to celebrate the liberation of a hundred former rebel prisoners from Ashmead's Lock on the planet Kashyyyk.
