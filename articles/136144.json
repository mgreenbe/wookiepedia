Things go astray when a crippled Imperial shuttle crash-lands near the Karran village. They discover Darryn Edalm, the former governor of Karras, who has been arrested for treason. He surrenders to the Rebels and asks for asylum. This angers the Karrans and they turn on the players. After killing the Karran war party led by Tist, the players return to their ship and find it destroyed by millions of tiny insects. They must hike to the Imperial base and find another way off the planet. When they get to the Imperial base, they find it under attack by the Karran and their insects, including Karran beetles and Karran mantis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
