The operation required for the Alliance to use already obtained X-wings to pose as pirate starfighters as pirate cartels had a large abundance of X-wing starfighters. The Alliance X-wings were repainted into T-65B X-wing starfighter Exterior Variant /1 and T-65B X-wing starfighter Exterior Variant /2. The operation resulted in a success."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
