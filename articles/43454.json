He informed Kallig that the ghost was situated in the Jedi Enclave and has a connection to a Padawan named Ashara Zavros. He aided Kallig in finding holocron recordings of Ashara to determine her weaknesses, before meeting with her and convincing her to summon the ghost of her ancestor, Kalatosh Zavros. But upon summoning the ghost, Elios revealed himself, having betrayed Kallig to Darth Thanaton, who made him a Lord in exchange for the ghost. However, he did not live long enough to enjoy his new title, as Kallig killed him for his treachery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
