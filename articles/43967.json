Determined to squash this Rebel activity once and for all, he has contracted the most notorious bounty hunters in the galaxy to capture key Rebel officials, a task his own Imperial forces have been unable to accomplish. Most famous bounty hunters participated in the hunt, among them Snoova, Boushh, IG-88, Bossk, Zuckuss, 4-LOM, Dengar and Boba Fett. Many important Rebel figures were apprehended, among them Coret Bhan, Rachi Sitra, Talon Karrde, Corran Horn, Wedge Antilles and others. Despite the huge success of the bounty hunters, the Empire committed a critical, logistical mistake when most of the prisoners were temporarily gathered in one place at the Imperial prison facility just outside of Bestine on Tatooine. Rebel agents managed to learn the location of the Rebel leaders and launched a bold raid at the facility in an attempt to rescue the prisoners. Despite heavy resistance from the Imperial forces, the Rebels were able to gain the upper hand and managed to rescue the Rebel leaders. Following that, few bounty hunters attempted to claim bounties already claimed before."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The capture and following rescue of Rebel officials is the key event in both Light Side and Dark Side scenario campaigns of Galactic Hunters, the third expansion of the Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
