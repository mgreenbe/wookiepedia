The city was heavily criminal-infested. The buildings didn't have strong foundations, so they would sink into the mud. It is unknown how many lived there but it was said the population was dense due to the criminal activity. Another strange thing about the city was that Jenna Zan Arbor's Lab was somewhere in the city. There wasn't much of a police force in Sim-First. It was said that the Galactic Republic's Security Forces dwelt there for a short time, no one truly knows why they were there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
