Studying at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, Ettene eventually passed the Jedi Trials and was knighted by the Jedi High Council. Serving as part of a delegation of Jedi Knights to the planet Alderaan, Ettene served beneath Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth as the Jedi negotiated the Alderaan Ascendancy Contention between House Organa and House Antilles. Further pursuits of knowledge of the Force and lightsaber skill earned her the rank of Master. Years after meeting Bail Organa, Ettene agreed to discuss with the newly appointed Senator the possibilities of taking on his dear friend, Halagad Ventor as a Padawan. Having trained at the experimental Jedi academy on Almas since the age of seventeen, Ventor had been refued an apprenticeship by every Master he approached. Where all other Masters refused based on age and an uncontrolled mind, Ettene was intrigued by the challenge presented by the teenager that reminded her of herself at that age and agreed to take him on as a Padawan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under her tutelage, Ettene showed Ventor compassion while chastising him and castigating the young Jedi in order to tame his brash personality. Nurturing him as a mother would tend to her son, the pair formed a strong bond that enable Ventor to grow in the Force. In the wake of the failed Outbound Flight Project, the Galactic Senate dispatched Ettene and her apprentice to investigate the reasons behind the disaster and the two grilled Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker in their involvement in the affair. Despite the unpleasantness of this original meeting, Ettene saw that Ventor and Skywalker became quick friends sometime after the investigation was concluded. In 23 BBY the High Council assigned Ettene to mediate the ongoing Virgillian Civil War between the Virgillian Free Alignment and the Aristocracy. Consisting of two Master-Padawan teams, the diplomatic envoy was made up of Ludwin Katarkus and Danyawarra, and Master Ettene and Padawan Ventor. As the shuttle carrying the Jedi envoy entered Virgillia 7's orbit and touched down on the planet's surface, it was attacked by terrorists and destroyed. After receiving no word from the diplomatic team for three months, the High Council announced that it presumed the Jedi dead and would be holding memorial services for them within the Temple's walls."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the official reports of their deaths, Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan had not given up on his old friend, Ventor. In the days following the start of the Clone Wars at Geonosis, Organa, his close friend Giles Durane, and the Jedi Master Ashka Boda traveled to Virgillia in search of the Master-Padawan pair. While Ettene and Katarkus perished before being rescued, both Padawans Danywarra and Ventor made it off the planet alive, going on to serve as commanders in the Grand Army of the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Described as bull-headed by her colleague, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, Everen Ettene saw herself in the reckless and proud Halagad Ventor.
