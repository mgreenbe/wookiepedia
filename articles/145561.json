The Thisspiasians, an ancient species of warriors, joined the Galactic Republic early in its history, becoming instrumental in averting both external and internal threats to that government.

The crown prince returned to reclaim the throne of Thisspias following the Battle of Endor; however, the desire of the populace for a more democratic government led to an extremely bloody civil war.

By 186 BBY, Rancisis' mother had died and the crown had passed to his younger sister. That year, agitators stormed the Thisspias alcazar on the astronomical object Ratamesh and killed Rancisis' sister, who was present at the structure at that time.

Subsequently, the new monarch took the first steps toward his homeworld joining the New Republic, and by 12 ABY, Thisspias fell within the borders of that government.
