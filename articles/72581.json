Eclipse enlisted in the Imperial Military after her mother's death, hoping to earn the respect of her father who was a staunch supporter of Emperor Palpatine and the New Order. She was first enrolled as the youngest cadet at the Corulag Academy before leaving her homeworld to embark on a career in the Imperial Navy. Rising to the rank of Captain, her skills in the cockpit attracted the attention of the Sith Lord Darth Vader, who promoted Eclipse to lead his Black Eight Squadron.

The loss of her mother left the young Juno in the care of her father, who increasingly became cold and distant after the death of his wife. Nevertheless, Eclipse desperately desired to win the approval of her only remaining parent. As a result, she developed into a loyal supporter of the Galactic Empire, mainly due to the fact that her father was an uncompromising Imperialist who was enamored with those that enlisted into Imperial Military service."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to being indoctrinated into Emperor Palpatine's New Order, Juno Eclipse's father attempted to impart his Anti-Jedi sentiments to his daughter.

Through quick promotions that led to the rank of captain, she eventually gained command of Black Eight Squadron, Darth Vader's elite unit of eight TIE Fighter pilots. Owing to this, she also was one of several Imperial TIE pilots to act as a test pilot for the then-in-development TIE Advanced x1 prototype next-generation starfighter. Though she originally considered serving under the second most powerful man in the Empire as the highlight of her career, Eclipse's quick discovery of the Dark Lord's brutal tactics would weigh heavily on her conscience.

In addition to Eclipse and Starkiller, the third member of the vessel's crew was PROXY, Starkiller's droid companion. Although mistakenly believing that the young man was one of Vader's spies, she soon discovered that Starkiller was actually tasked with the responsibility of exterminating the last of the Jedi Order. Eclipse assisted Starkiller by flying him to Nar Shaddaa, Raxus Prime, and Felucia all the while trying to get to know and understand Darth Vader's enigmatic enforcer. Aside from hunting Jedi, Eclipse transported Starkiller to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant multiple times, in order for the apprentice to undergo metaphysical training at the behest of Darth Vader. During his second trial inside the Temple, Starkiller fought an apparition of the long-dead Darth Phobos. During the test, Phobos disguised herself in the form of Juno Eclipse, knowing that the young woman's death was among the fears of the aspiring Sith.

After defeating Jedi Master Shaak Ti on Felucia, Starkiller returned to his Master, only to discover that the Emperor had learned of his existence. Starkiller was betrayed, and seemingly killed, by Lord Vader at the behest of the Emperor. Afterward, Eclipse was arrested and declared a traitor to the Empire by Vader.

In addition to his new assignment, Starkiller was required to sever all connections to his past, with the exception of PROXY.

Ironically, their new mission to recruit others to the Rebel cause led them right back to their first target, the disillusioned General Rahm Kota. After searching Nar Shaddaa, the site of the fateful battle where Kota lost his sight, the crew of the Rogue Shadow were able to track the missing Jedi to Bespin.

In the apparent privacy of his ship, however, he contacted Darth Vader and received instructions to attack a Star Destroyer shipyard above Raxus Prime. During the conversation, Eclipse discovered eavesdropped on Starkiller and was genuinely shocked to discover the apprentice's true allegiance. Though she angrily confronted Starkiller over his deceptions and continued existence as Vader's slave, Starkiller remained firmly attached to his Master's cause, albeit with a sense of regret at having emotionally hurt Eclipse. Although she chose to stay with him, Eclipse implored Starkiller to consider the fact that the rebellion's fate would ultimately be decided by him, rather than Darth Vader.

Just before the Alliance could be formalized, however, Darth Vader arrived with the Imperial Military at his back and had the Alliance leaders completely surrounded. After ordering his soldiers to take the Rebels' alive so that the Emperor could personally kill them, Vader revealed that the rebellion and his plot to murder the Emperor had all been a ruse, just to get the Empire's major enemies in one place in order to wipe them out.

On-board the vessel once more, Starkiller bitterly lamented to Eclipse about how he had been deceived since waking up on the Empirical; how he had been used as an instrument of the Dark Lord's will throughout his entire life before ultimately being discarded. Eclipse helped to console the former apprentice by reminding him that the fate of the Alliance still rested in Starkiller's hands. It was at that moment that Starkiller renounced his past ties to his former Master, deciding to rescue the Alliance leaders and truly oppose the Sith Lords.

Kota admitted that he had his suspicions; Eclipse inquired the reason behind Kota's decision to help Marek, despite his allegiance to Vader.

To ensure that Marek's death would not be in vain, Eclipse dedicated her life to serving in the Alliance's Rebel Fleet, becoming an officer in its ranks and retaining the rank of captain that she previously earned in the Imperial Navy.

While she admitted that the Salvation did not provide them with the largest ship, the most powerful weapons or the most starfighters, she assured the crew-members that their greatest asset was faith\u2014in themselves, in each other and especially in the righteousness of the Alliance's just cause.

While Eclipse agreed with Kota's opinion that the Rebellion would never accomplish anything significant if it didn't achieve a major or symbolic victory against the Empire, and often urged the Alliance leadership to consider attacking a valuable target, she was considerably far more patient with her superiors than Kota was. Not wanting to see Kota break off from the Alliance if he ever lost his patience with its leadership, Eclipse often aided the Jedi General and his squad on certain missions that were not sanctioned by their superiors. Eclipse eventually received orders to take the Salvation to an Imperial-controlled planet called Cato Neimoidia, both to check out the planet's defenses and to test her own crew's ability in combat.

After arriving at their intended destination, Eclipse began testing Cato Neimoidia's defenses by dispatching a squadron of BTL Y-wing starfighters to engage the Empire's TIE/LN starfighters.

Before Eclipse could further persuade the general to retreat, a major explosion near Tarko-se caused the Rogue Shadow to vanish from the Salvation's sensors. Believing that Galen Marek's starship had been destroyed, along with Kota and his squad, Eclipse ordered her own ship to flee from Cato Neimoidia via hyperspace.

While Senator Iblis favored Kota's direct approach, Senator Mothma argued for caution and patience; Senator Organa preferred to consult with her adoptive father before voicing her opinion. Eclipse tried to convince her superiors that the Alliance needed a suitable replacement for Kota, someone who balanced the line between action and caution. Her choice fell on Gial Ackbar, a Mon Calamarian redeemed by the Alliance from slavery in the Eriadu system. She believed that with Ackbar serving Alliance, as well as a major victory over the Empire, would galvanize the Mon Calamari's resistance and lead them into joining the Alliance to accomplish their mutual goal\u2014the downfall of the Galactic Empire.

However, she was initially unsure on how to proceed, acknowledging the fact that she was not a lone agent who operated outside of an organizational hierarchy as Starkiller did. On the contrary, she thrived on knowing her place and performing her duty to the letter, not thinking outside of the box. To that end, she welcomed the discreet assistance of Bail Organa upon her arrival on Dac's moon.

Thus, they staged a false attack on Heurkea by planting explosions throughout the city in order to trick the Imperials into thinking that the city was under an unauthorized attack by their own TIE fighter squadron, the 181st Imperial Fighter Wing. The Imperials were easily fooled and retreated from the city. Knowing that the Empire would quickly discover the deception, Eclipse knew that her mission was a success. By humiliating the Empire, the oppressed world of Dac would bolster its defiance against the Empire.

During this time, she encountered Berkelium Shyre, a mechanic from Malastare and a loyal supporter of the Rebellion. During their conversation, Shyre revealed his feelings for Eclipse and tried to convince her to stay with him. For her part, Eclipse was somewhat attracted to Shyre, and also partially felt as though it was time to move on from the memory of Starkiller.

Fed up with Mothma's constant preaching of caution, Bel Iblis pointed out that no war was without risks. He also scolded the fugitive senator for constantly trying to force the Alliance not to fight, even when it clearly wanted to, and likened her actions to tyranny\u2014in its own way.

She slyly implied how a mere mercenary was no match against a Force-wielder who was strong enough to rip Star Destroyers out of the sky. Fett retorted against Eclipse's statements by revealing the truth about Starkiller. The apprentice that Eclipse knew, the original Starkiller, was dead and the \"Starkiller\" that she saw on the Salvation was a clone created by Darth Vader. Eclipse became filled with doubt as Fett described the clone as nothing more than a \"half-mad copy who only thought he was in love with her.\" Although she did not yet believe that Fett was telling her the truth, she tried to reason with him on a more personal level.

Believing that Vader did not go through so much trouble just to kill her right away, she took her chances and taunted Vader\u2014reminding him of how he was defeated by his former apprentice. She continued mocking Vader, voicing her opinion of him as nothing more than the Emperor's slave with nothing but a minuscule piece of the Empire to maintain his obedience. Eclipse accused Vader of being a coward who was acting out of desperation by kidnapping her. She also told Vader that she did not believe he was responsible for Starkiller's \"return,\" implying her belief that Starkiller somehow managed that accomplishment on his own.

After persuading herself to not judge the clone's feelings as counterfeit, she desperately hoped that Darth Vader would fail in his efforts to mold the clone into a monster, just as he failed to do so with Marek."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone of Starkiller"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While held captive by Vader in a tower at the top of the cloning facility, Eclipse took notice of the Salvation, broken into two large fragments, falling out of Kamino's orbit and set on a collision course with Timira City.

When the first half of the ship smashed into the facility, Eclipse felt that she would not survive, nor was she lost on the irony of a captain being killed by her own ship. Before reaching its destination, however, Starkiller destroyed the last solid fragment of the Salvation to avoid causing damage that could have either harmed or killed Eclipse.

Vader threatened to strangle Eclipse to death with the Force unless Starkiller returned to the Sith Lord's side and submitted completely to the dark side. Despite being on the verge of suffocating to death, Eclipse tried to warn the clone not to give in to Vader's demands. But it was no use since Starkiller couldn't hear her, and Eclipse knew that even if he could have, he wouldn't have done as she said. While she didn't want to be responsible for his return to the dark side, she understood his decision, believing that she would also have done anything to save Starkiller just to be with him.

But at last second, Vader's senses warned him and he just barely dodged the attack, only for Eclipse to damage his chest panel. In retaliation, Vader pushed her in the same exact way Starkiller pushed the stormtroopers. Vader's counterattack was so fast and powerful, Eclipse was barely able to register in her mind what had happened. She could not tell how far he had pushed her, but only knew that she was \"forced\" out of the tower and that the impact of her fall would hurt.
