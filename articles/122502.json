The SBI was separate from its counterpart, Republic Intelligence, which was a military intelligence organization. The SBI was given expanded powers by the Loyalist Committee during the Separatist Crisis, and by Palpatine during the Clone Wars. Before the War, corruption did exist in the SBI. Low-level agents were known to aid corrupt senators in their schemes by passing on misinformation for the right price. Wullf Yularen was a member of the SBI, but the mass-corruption of the agency led him to resign in disgust."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dyne, Vyn Narcassan, Travale, and Inglemenn Barezz were all SBI agents during the Clone Wars.
