Its four stars made entry into the star system difficult. Two Paccosh refugee starships that escaped the Nikardun Destiny's blockade of Rapacc rendezvoused in the quadruple star system. One of the vessels' hyperdrives failed, and the other ventured into the Chiss Ascendancy. The ship was destroyed by the Nikardun in the Dioya system, while the passengers of the derelict ship eventually died of asphyxiation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
