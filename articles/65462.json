This establishment gave students the opportunity to study all range of topics under, of course, the tight observation of Imperial professors. This control of academic education was just one aspect of the basis of Imperial mind conditioning. Pro-Imperial attitudes were supported and rewarded during these studies and any anti-regime ideas were observed, controlled, and, if necessary, wiped out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
