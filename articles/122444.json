However, Selvaris's hot climate took its toll on some of the inmates and a persistent salty wind from a nearby estuary did little to improve the situation. However, Selvaris was also rich in life and there was often food available to both prisoner and conqueror. The planet's oceans also teemed with marine life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 29 ABY, an escape plan was formed after secret information was relayed to the camp from offworld. A Jenet named Thorsh was able to flee the prison world in the Millennium Falcon, carrying with him the vital data. The remaining prisoners\u2014among them Judder Page and Pash Cracken\u2014were soon transferred to transports destined for Yuuzhan'tar\u2014formerly Coruscant. Though scheduled for sacrifice, many of the Selvaris prisoners were rescued in a daring strike by the Galactic Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
