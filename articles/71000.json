Another Jillsarian, Golben, appeared the following year in that company's Platt's Starport Guide."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, two previously existing four-armed characters were long suspected of being Jillsarian. An unidentified four-armed background character appeared in an illustration in Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley in 1993. More prominently, the four-armed chef Doodnik first appeared as the owner of Doodnik's Caf\u00e9 in \"The Lost Prince,\" a 1985 episode of the Star Wars Droids animated television series. While Gregory Walker's 2009 work \"Dining at Dex's\" hinted at Doodnik being a Besalisk by making him hail from their homeworld of Ojom, Walker acknowledged that the explicit identification was not actually made. This left the door open for the second part of Abel G. Pe\u00f1a and Rich Handley's Official Star Wars Blog post, \"The Droids Re-Animated,\" to address the uncertainty in 2013, making Doodnik a Jillsarian who had grown up on Ojom."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
