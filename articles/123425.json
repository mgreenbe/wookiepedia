At some point, he lost both his eyes. Since his body rejected ocular implants, he found a way to splice into his protocol droid I-7, who became his \"eyes.\" Fearing the Galactic Empire and the rebellion, Sevox and his droid hid in an underground bunker near the Andelm IV spaceport. His bunker also contained a store room full of old droid parts. Around the time of the Battle of Yavin, Sevox was acquainted with a young girl named Zarro, who ran errands for him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After escaping Jaum's beetle caverns, Zarro and her new Wookiee ally Chewbacca visited his bunker, seeking parts they could use to sabotage Jaum's plan to sell dedlanite to the Empire. Sevox was annoyed because he feared that Zarro's presence could expose his work. He was further alarmed when Chewbacca entered the room. Sevox reluctantly allowed Zarro and Chewbacca to access his store room for gear and to share his food. The reclusive Sevox feared that Chewbacca's presence would expose his bunker's existence to outsiders and regarded Zarro's decision to bring Chewie as a violation of trust."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his misgivings about Zarro and Chewie's enterprise, Sevox and his droid I-7 accompanied them to the local spaceport. He allowed Zarro to drive his landspeeder. During the journey, Sevox received news from his friend Lageose that an Imperial Star Destroyer had entered the Andelm system. Lageose advised Sevox to leave Andelm IV. While Sevox was pessimistic, I-7 suggested that the Empire could bring optic implants that his master's body would not reject; setting him free.

After arriving at the spaceport, Sevox told Zarro of his plans to move out of his lab. He offered the lab to Zarro and Chewie as a hiding place but warned them not to mention his name if he was captured by the Empire.
