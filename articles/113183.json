Most people just saw him as the head of a local garbage hauling company, but this was not the case. He worked very hard to keep his criminal activity under the radar. His thugs were of many different alien species, and were considered some of the worst scum in the Galaxy. He became one of the most respected crimelords in Hutt Space, but kept his business covered up enough that even New Republic Intelligence believed him to be legitimate."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Last stand"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his final years, in 12 ABY, he made a deal with the Dark Jedi Desann, supplying the Empire Reborn with thugs for a takeover of the carbonite freezing chambers on Bespin. While looking for him in Nar Shaddaa, Kyle Katarn discovered Lando Calrissian in Baruk's hold and eventually found the crime lord. Baruk managed to entrap him in a room full of autoturrets, but the Jedi escaped and freed Lando."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Katarn and Calrissian were about to make their escape from Nar Shaddaa, Baruk attacked the two men with a handful of mercenaries.
