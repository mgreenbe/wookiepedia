Although the spaceport was compact it had some extremely advanced facilities and was quite exclusive. Only the upper echelons of government, a member of the noble houses, the Empire or another favored group were granted permission to land at the Tapani Royal Spaceport. Those that lacked the clearance to land were diverted to the major commercial spaceport on Destato Island. It was a thriving, busy spaceport that operated for 27 hours a day."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
