With Grogu in tow, Djarin traveled to Sorgan hoping to find a safe, temporary home for the child. Shortly after arriving, Djarin had a brief confrontation with ex-New Republic shock trooper Carasynthia Dune outside of a common house where the duo had been eating.

After some convincing, Djarin agreed and approached Dune once again, asking for her assistance. The two mercenaries accompanied the villagers, along with Grogu, to the village. While scouting out the area surrounding the village, Dune and Djarin discovered All Terrain Scout Transport tracks. They attempted to encourage the villagers to leave, but the natives elected to stay in their ancestral home. Instead of leaving, Dune and Djarin began teaching the villagers to use blasters to defend themselves and provide support against the raiders. After developing a plan to defeat the AT-ST Raider walker, the two mercenaries drilled with the villagers in order to prepare for the next raid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once Dune and Djarin felt that the villagers were sufficiently prepared, the duo stealthily attacked the raiders' outpost, thinning enemy numbers and drawing the Klatooinians towards the village. As expected, the raiders pursued the mercenaries with their AT-ST, and engaged with the villagers, resulting in casualties on both sides. Dune and Djarin attempted to lure the AT-ST to the pre-dug hole they had ordered to be made, but the walker stopped just short of it. The villagers rushed out to defend the pinned mercenaries, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the raiders. While still taking fire, Dune used Djarin's Amban sniper rifle to draw the walker closer, taking potshots until it fell into their trap and was destroyed, causing the retreat of the raiders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Djarin intended to stay on Sorgan with Grogu, but the appearance of a bounty hunter in possession of a tracking fob for Grogu forced his hand.

After this close call, Djarin decided to leave the planet for Grogu's safety, as well as the villages'.

After one mission to the planet Quintil, in which the cell rescued Tomasso, Dameron returned the smugglers to Sorgan aboard the Ragged Claw by hyperspace skipping in order to evade members of the rival Zualjinn Syndicate.
