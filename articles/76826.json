Klik-Klak's droid force was made up of B1 battle droids, at least one OOM command battle droid, and droidekas. In addition to maintaining the droids, Klik-Klak maintained a deflector shield generator and kept a sonic blaster in his nest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 BBY, the battle droids engaged the team of Partisans who had arrived to investigate Geonosis. Their leader, Saw Gerrera, survived and helped the members of the Phoenix Cell who arrived to find him in the Geonosis catacombs, allowing them to outflank the battle droids. Additionally, two other members of the Phoenix Cell, Sabine Wren and Garazeb Orrelios, encountered a force of droidekas on the surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearance"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
