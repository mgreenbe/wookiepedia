A Dark Lord of the Sith in the Order of the Sith Lords, recorded by history as the most successful who had ever lived, his deeds resulted in overthrow the ancient Republic and the noble Jedi Order from within. Noted for his sadistic and self-serving intentions just as well as his ability to conceal them, Palpatine impacted the galaxy perhaps more than any other single individual, and it is likely that his impact on history, for good or ill, was immeasurable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Born in 82 BBY on the planet Naboo to the aristocratic House Palpatine, Palpatine discovered the Sith at a young age as a collector of dark side artifacts. In 65 BBY, he met Hego Damask, a Muun businessman who was in reality the Sith Lord Darth Plagueis. Under Plagueis's manipulation, Palpatine killed his father and pledged himself to his new Master's dark side teachings as Darth Sidious. Palpatine lived a double life for many years, serving an untarnished career as Naboo's ambassador in the Galactic Senate while learning from his master and training a young Zabrak as the Sith assassin Darth Maul. Plagueis and Sidious, both exceptionally skilled and powerful in the Force, were able to conceal their identities from the Jedi for decades. As Plagueis privately searched for the key to eternal life, Sidious manipulated galactic politics, culminating in the blockade of Naboo by the Trade Federation. In the wake of the political crisis, the Galactic Senate voted to elect him as Supreme Chancellor, and around the same time, in accordance with Bane's Rule of Two, Sidious murdered Plagueis and usurped the role of Sith Master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Chancellor of the Republic and Dark Lord of the Sith, Palpatine orchestrated the outbreak of the devastating Clone Wars ten years after the Naboo Crisis. He himself headed both the Galactic Republic and, secretly, the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The public leader of this splinter faction was former Jedi Master Count Dooku, Sidious's second apprentice as Darth Tyranus in the wake of Maul's presumed death on Naboo. As billions perished in the war, the vast majority of Republic citizens rallied behind Chancellor Palpatine, giving him enough support to amend the Galactic Constitution in the name of security and transfer most of the Senate's executive authority to his own office. In 19 BBY, following Tyranus's demise, Palpatine revealed his identity as Darth Sidious to the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, telling that the dark side teachings that Plagueis had pursued could help Skywalker to save his wife, whom Skywalker had foreseen dying untimely. A failed attempt by the Jedi High Council to arrest Palpatine ensued, and Skywalker pledged himself to Sidious' teachings as Darth Vader. All members of the Jedi Order were accused of treason and betrayed by their clone troopers to the point of virtual extermination. Without the Jedi to oppose him, Sidious declared himself Emperor of the first Galactic Empire, bringing an end to the Republic that had stood for over 25,000 years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Emperor, Sidious effectively wielded absolute control over the entire galaxy and virtually everyone who lived within it. During his tenure, he built one of the most powerful military forces the galaxy had ever seen and ruled unopposed for nearly two decades. Although Sidious suffered a near death experience when he was infected by a deadly virus in a plot orchestrated by Headmaster Gentis who saw that Emperor Palpatine was needlessly wasting the lives of young Imperial officers, he orchestrated a coup, seeking to gain control of the Empire in order to end such warmongering the coup failed and Gentis was killed by Sidious. Sidious progressively abandoned his facade of being an enlightened leader and began to rule through terror symbolized by the Death Star, a superweapon that could annihilate entire planets. However, he later discovered that Vader was training Galen Marek, an exceptionally powerful Force adept as a secret apprentice \"Starkiller.\" When Sidious discovered Starkiller's existence in 3 BBY, he ordered Vader to fake Starkiller's death and then request that Starkiller assemble the most influential traitors in the Empire in a rebellion in order to highlight and destroy them all. Sidious's plan backfired when Starkiller, healed from his near-fatal injuries and espousing the teachings of the light side, vowed revenge against Sidious and confronted him on the Death Star, ultimately sacrificing himself in an act that inspired the dissident senators to create the Alliance to Restore the Republic. As the Galactic Civil War broke out, Emperor Palpatine ironically fought against a rebellion that he started in secret. After the Empire suffered a devastating defeat in 0 BBY, in which the Alliance destroyed the Death Star, the Emperor steadily began to lose his absolute control over the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, Sidious gambled his chances in order to annihilate the Rebel Alliance once and for all, allowing Rebel spies to learn of the existence of a second Death Star and its secret location near Endor. As expected, the Alliance fell for the bait and dispatched its fleet to destroy the Emperor, Vader, and the incomplete Death Star. With the Alliance soon falling for his trap, Sidious brought Luke Skywalker, the son of Darth Vader, before him in order to turn him over to the dark side and replace Vader with an apprentice who was younger and more powerful. After goading Skywalker to give into his frustrations with thoughts of the Alliance's defeat and the death of his friends, the Dark Lord eagerly watched as father and son fought one another. However, Skywalker refused to submit to the dark side and spared his father, prompting Sidious to unleash all of his rage and hatred on Skywalker. Unwilling to stand by and watch his son die from the agonizing effects of Sidious' Force lightning, Anakin Skywalker finally redeemed himself, throwing his astonished Master down the Death Star's shaft, a sacrifice that fulfilled the prophecy of the Chosen One and brought about the end of the Order of the Sith Lords."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout the rest of the Galactic Civil War, the remnants of the Empire experienced a sharp decline while the Alliance reformed itself into the New Republic. However, Sidious did not stay dead, and eventually used a rare and ancient Force technique to transfer his spirit into one of many clone bodies stored on the Deep Core world of Byss. In 10 ABY, Darth Sidious resurfaced in the galaxy in a bid to rebuild his Empire, temporarily converting Luke Skywalker to the dark side and installing him as his apprentice. Sidious's efforts to live forever, however, were undermined by subversives within his own inner circle, including his Royal Guard Carnor Jax. With the last supplies of healthy clone bodies sabotaged and their genetic source material contaminated by his allies, Sidious desperately tried to take over the body of Darth Vader's youngest grandchild, the infant Anakin Solo, in 11 ABY. Sidious's spirit, however, was intercepted by the dying Jedi Knight Empatojayos Brand, who dragged the Dark Lord down into the depths of the Force forever, though his legacy lived for countless years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Palpatine was born on Naboo, the eldest son of House Palpatine's patriarch Cosinga and his wife.

His father also perceived his eldest son as different, and would later claim to have divined his murderous nature from the time the latter was an infant. At some point early in Palpatine's life, Cosinga had his son tested to make certain that they were related. Until the end of his life, however, Palpatine's true nature remained a mystery to his father."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Intelligent and highly ambitious, Palpatine desired his family to take on a more active role in Naboo's politics, both to increase their own wealth and power, and also to help their homeworld make the transition into the modern galaxy. He was soon disappointed to learn that he was alone in this ambition, and that his father not only lacked the ability to improve his family's standing, but also arrogantly believed he had all the power there was to be gained. Cosinga's political ambitions never exceeded provincial Naboo\u2014father and son attended two coronations in the capital city of Theed, and for years to come Palpatine would remember Cosinga's envy for the power the monarch wielded. Although Palpatine longed to kill his father, he grudgingly concealed his patricidal desires for years, hiding his true feelings under a mask of simple reactionary rebelliousness. Disgusted by his father's incompetence, and infuriated by his mother's willingness to tolerate the situation of their family, it was not long before Palpatine discontinued the use of his given name as an act of spite. From then on, he demanded to be referred to exclusively by the name of his aristocratic family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Palpatine recorded, in his preface to the Book of Sith (c 19 BBY), that he took a vested interest in forbidden Sith lore as a child. Employing his family's vast wealth, the youth took to the black market, resolving to collect as many inscrutable runes and ancient texts as possible. Enraptured by the secrets revealed with each tome, Palpatine at once recognized the key to realizing his true ambition: the acquisition of absolute power.

Sure enough, whatever his son's crime, Cosinga was there, ready and willing to use his influence and credits to make it \"disappear.\" Having been raised to believe that money could solve anything, Palpatine quickly dispensed with traditional notions of morality, instead forging a unique code of ethics for himself; a pedestal on which he placed himself, to be raised above all others."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although he despised his father, more than any other member of his family, the two were not without their similarities. Aside from an inherited violent streak, both father and son shared an insatiable passion for speeder racing. Palpatine once fondly recounted an occasion from his youth when his father had bought him a state-of-the-art, prototype speeder, more as a bribe than a gift, but one he accepted, nonetheless. Indeed, the only time Palpatine thought well of the man who raised him was when they shared a cockpit together. This was not to last, however, as Palpatine soon crashed the machine, tragically killing two pedestrians in the process. As always, Cosinga bought his son a reprieve, and Palpatine himself never showed the slightest bit of remorse for the incident. Quite the opposite, in fact, if anything, the lack of punishment from the law only served to reinforce the boy's belief in his own invulnerability, and Palpatine insensitively chose this moment to announce his desire to become a professional racer. Cosinga initially banned his son from riding again, but even this feeble attempt at punishment did not last long.

The Dark Lord panicked and abandoned Plagueis's body. The mysterious apprentice in Tenebrous's vision was invisible to his Force sense, and he only perceived him as the shadow. On Naboo, the young Palpatine was waiting for a chance to join the Sith, and this turn of events was the first step towards bringing Plagueis to Naboo, and, 35 years later, realizing Tenebrous's vision."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "First encounter"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As an adolescent, Palpatine studied at Theed University, and also enrolled in the Legislative Youth Program in accordance with Naboo's mandatory public service curricula. His family's social status provided him with high profile contacts, such as other aristocrats and even government officials. One such acquaintance was Vidar Kim, who was at the time an aide to the Republic Senator of Naboo. Although Palpatine regarded Kim as a political mentor, he secretly harbored certain views that conflicted with Kim's opinions. Palpatine's own father shared Kim's conservative beliefs and lobbied for Naboo's government to maintain an isolationist policy in order to protect their homeworld from interplanetary corporations that wanted to take advantage of Naboo. Bon Tapalo, a candidate for the Naboo throne in the 65 BBY monarchical elections eager to open Naboo to outside influences, was their main opponent in the political arena."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Palpatine, motivated by pride and a desire to see his homeworld become a part of the greater galaxy, sought to quietly undermine his father's political agenda during the 65 BBY election season. More importantly, however, it was the rift with his father that indirectly led to his future as a Sith. Palpatine released confidential information pertaining to the shady role certain royal houses (including, presumably, his own) in the Tapalo opposition had allegedly played during the mercenary conflict, despite the fact that he was well aware he could be disinherited for it. In aiding Tapalo's campaign, Palpatine brought himself to the attention of Darth Plagueis, Dark Lord of the Sith. The young man had craved for the power of the Sith since becoming a collector of Sith artifacts, and soon he would have his chance to join their order. Plagueis was publicly known as Hego Damask, the Muun Magister of Damask Holdings, one of the galaxy's most powerful and influential financiers and political lobbyists.

Through a small effort of persuasion on Plagueis' part, however, Palpatine reluctantly agreed to give him a tour of Theed. Plagueis was able to learn much about the young aristocrat in their first encounter; Palpatine had an interest in politics, but was shy to admit it; he enjoyed art, yet his modest tastes made him disinterested in Naboo's grandiose architecture style; the estrangement with his father was augmented by their different political opinions. Aside from art and politics, Plagueis also learned that Palpatine had a passion for expensive landspeeders and competitive racing. But he was unable to peer into the young man with the Force, which intrigued him. At the end of the day, Plagueis offered to recruit Palpatine as a spy in order to advance the interests of Damask Holdings by ensuring the election of Tapalo as king of Naboo.

After Cosinga failed to coerce Damask with veiled threats, the Muun contacted Palpatine, who had been away on Chandrila with his class at the time. Palpatine, enraged by the revelation of his father's attempt to interfere in his affairs, desperately implored Damask for advice.

Palpatine did not accept the arrangement, and verbally attacked Cosinga. The altercation brought out their long-standing yet barely concealed hatred for each other, until Cosinga revealed to his son that he had wanted to kill him from the start. Overcome by years of repressed anger and frustration, Palpatine instinctively drew upon the power of the dark side and slaughtered his entire family and their security guards. When the deed was done, he contacted Damask and was assured by his mentor that none would ever learn of his role in the slaughter of House Palpatine. Damask arranged for all evidence of the crime to be purged, and for Palpatine to return to Chandrila. In addition, Palpatine later sold Convergence and moved to a modest apartment in Theed. One standard week later, they met in a luxury cabin aboard the Quantum Collosus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having judged the young Palpatine worthy of joining the Sith after he murdered his family, Darth Plagueis formally initiated him into the cult. From the time of Darth Bane onward, it was common for Sith names to begin with the forename Darth, a moniker that was as much a title as it was a name. Many factors went into deciding on the second name. At least one, based on observed ceremonies, is that Sith masters would enter a kind of communion with the dark side of the Force, question it, and within it find inspiration, an answer. In Palpatine, Plagueis saw a being completely lacking in empathy, ambitious, arrogant, and insidious.

In the first decade of his role as an apprentice, Sidious accompanied his Master to Mygeeto, where he was subjected to intense cold and nearly froze to death. Darth Plagueis, unaffected by the planet's freezing temperature, forced Sidious to relate the slaughter of his family in exacting detail, as he did many times, with the goal of extinguishing any lingering feeling of personal connection. The Sith Lord's overall goal was to use his disciple's hate, anger and desperation for survival as a tool to destroy any vestiges of Palpatine the young noble from Naboo, and in his place create Darth Sidious, a true Sith. Were Palpatine to give up, he would prove himself unworthy of the mantle; the young Human endured, asking only when the trials would be over.

But like many of his Sith predecessors, Plagueis was appalled by Darth Bane's Rule of Two, more specifically its tenet that commanded each Master to train his or her own eventual killer. Plagueis had no intention of dying by his apprentice's hand, or anyone else's for that matter. Instead, he intended to break the cycle started by Bane and Zannah a millennium ago. In order to do so, Plagueis wished for no secrets or feelings of jealousy and mistrust to exist between Sidious and himself. In the long run of the Sith Grand Plan, Plagueis envisioned himself as the \"power behind the throne\" while Sidious\u2014in his public guise as Palpatine\u2014carried out the Sith's interests in the political domain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sidious, ever the academic with a desire for knowledge, yearned to learn more of the Sith lore.

Long after the Sith culture died out, the influence of the Sith remained a part of Zabrak culture.

He had, in fact, been at something of a loss regarding what he was going to do with Maul after Plagueis was dead; the Zabrak had never been trained with the intent of making a true Sith Lord out of him, and Sidious had realized that trying to ease him into a less covert role would have been very difficult. Though he had been somewhat surprised by Maul's defeat, he had long known his apprentice to be overconfident, and had little difficulty imagining how Maul's pride could have led to his downfall.

If the Jedi or the Republic were to discover that a corporate power-broker like his alter ego, Hego Damask, had commissioned an army, it could lead to questions that might expose the Sith. He would have to find a proxy to act through, preferably a Jedi in order to give the project an additional smokescreen. That proxy would ultimately present itself in the form of Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sifo-Dyas and Plagueis had met seemingly by chance at a negotiation on Serenno. Plagueis had learned that Jedi Master Dooku would be acting as arbiter between the two opposing parties, and had gone to Serenno to evaluate Dooku's potential usefulness to the Sith. While analyzing Dooku, he took note of the fact that Sifo-Dyas, who had accompanied Dooku, was extremely concerned about the political climate of the galaxy at large. Citing the dangerous levels of civil unrest of the Outer Rim systems, Plagueis initiated a conversation with Sifo-Dyas about the fact that the Republic was completely unprepared to go to war if it became necessary. He saw that Sifo-Dyas was just as aware of the Senate's corruption as Dooku, but was far more afraid for the Republic's future than Dooku was. Plagueis realized that he could use Sifo-Dyas's fear to manipulate the Jedi Master into helping create the army the Sith required.

Once again, Plagueis approached Sifo-Dyas, and began a discussion with him concerning the fact that many of the disenfranchised Outer Rim systems were a hair's breadth away from declaring independence. To make matters worse, Plagueis \"revealed\" that many of his wealthy clients were pushing to further militarize their corporate enterprises in order to capitalize on the situation. Plagueis argued that, in light of this increasing instability and corruption, a military capable of defending the Republic needed to be created now, while there was still a chance. Sifo-Dyas agreed with Plagueis's analysis, but believed that there existed no practically available course of action by which to either create or secure a military. However, Plagueis informed him that there existed a group of cloners on Kamino who would be able to grow an army and hold it in reserve until it was needed. He proposed that, if Sifo-Dyas was willing to place the order for the army in his name, Plagueis, as Hego Damask, would provide the funds necessary for the creation and training of said army. He also made it clear to Sifo-Dyas that, due to the continued existence of the Ruusan Reformations, neither the Senate nor the Jedi Council could be informed of the order lest the project be terminated.

However, to make absolutely sure that the existence of the clone army never came to the attention of the Jedi or the Republic, Sifo-Dyas had to die, a task that would fall to Dooku. Dooku carried out the murder, killing his old friend and cementing his allegiance to the dark side. By killing Sifo-Dyas, he had also fulfilled the ancient covenant that prescribed the murder of one who was close as a measure of commitment to the Sith cause.

To ensure that it stayed one, Dooku erased all records of the planet Kamino from the Jedi Archives, along with thirty-seven additional systems, including Dagobah and Dromund, that Sidious had judged to be of potential value to the Sith.

Tyranus offered Fett a generous payment for serving as the Kaminoans' prime clone. Fett accepted, on the condition that, in addition to the credits, he received an unaltered clone of himself, whom he would make his own son and apprentice.

Gaining the upper hand, Sidious drove his opponents back, and the duel ended in the plaza outside the palace. After using the Force to temporarily incapacitate Maul, Sidious then toyed with Opress, dodging all of his blows without having his lightsabers ignited, before he started to duel Opress. Completely outclassing him, he impaled the larger Zabrak in the chest with his two lightsabers within just a minute, fatally wounding him.

As such, he used all of his energy to create a massive Force explosion that all but destroyed the throne room, as well as nearly killing both Sith Lords. Marek's sacrifice had cost him his own life, but had also turned him into a martyr.

He initially took his personal C-3 passenger liner, the Excalibur, to enter hyperspace and rendezvous with his Super Star Destroyer to take him the rest of the way, although an ambush from two Alpha-class Xg-1 Star Wings and the Assassin-class corvette Ram, which Stele quelled, forced him to return to Coruscant. In addition, it became clear that Zaarin had his forces deep within the Imperial hierarchy when Imperial Intelligence confirmed that the two Assault Gunboats that ambushed the Excalibur were formerly part of the Emperor's special reserve forces.

She even resented the clones and was not entirely convinced that they could be counted amongst the Sith.

Just prior to Mara Jade's death, however, she compared her nephew to Palpatine in terms of sheer vileness.

He was instinctively treacherous, betraying and killing numerous beings who trusted him, such as Vidar Kim, Darth Plagueis and nearly Darth Vader. Since his youth, Palpatine's main goal had always been nothing less than the acquisition of absolute power. In this personal quest, he showed that he was patient, arrogant, vastly intelligent, and an incredible actor. Despite his innate nature, he was able to play the part of a good and honest politician for decades; even the Jedi Council was taken in by his facade. His skill at subterfuge was sufficient to even convince Darth Plagueis, upon the latter's revelation that he was a Sith, that he knew little of that Order, when he in fact had sought to join the Sith long before he met the Dark Lord. As both Senator of Naboo and Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, he appeared as an unassuming, tea-drinking old man, almost grandfatherly, with elegant robes. With his cheery demeanor, trademark smile, and a reputation for being a kind and modest man from Naboo, he won the hearts of billions during the Clone Wars, promising to bring justice to a government mired in corruption and chaos. This served to hide his true motives behind a perfect disguise in order to gain acceptance from his new Empire. Even after the Clone Wars, and during the Battle of Endor, the Emperor's popularity was such that Vader, before killing Palpatine to save Skywalker, even pondered the possibility that the Empire would be horrified at the Emperor's impending death, with several citizens of the Empire even considering him to be a demigod."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although he was from the Mid Rim instead of the Core Worlds, Palpatine primarily spoke Galactic Basic Standard with a Coruscanti accent during his time as Senator representing Naboo and as Supreme Chancellor.

He had been left after the attack with the appearance of a gnarled, ancient man with pale skin, and searing, sickly yellow eyes. He wore a heavy dark cloak, which gave him the appearance of being a simple individual to hide his Force abilities, and carried a glossy black cane, leaning heavily on it to create an illusion of weakness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His acts as a loving politician and later a helpless victim served only to bolster his true persona, that of Sidious. The Dark Lord was a highly manipulative, Machiavellian, exploitative and seductive megalomaniac, easily bending others to his will in his quest for Sith supremacy and ultimate power. A megalomaniac, Sidious identified his own essence with the very blackness of space, even going so far as to declare himself the ultimate personification of the dark side. His desire for absolute power was such that he may have even had Extra-galactic aims regarding his rule, seeking to dominate the entire universe, at least after his first resurrection. Sidious also displayed traits of psychopathy, including extreme sadism and cruelty, taking considerable pleasure in the suffering and deaths of others. One of his more prominent demonstrations of this trait was when he ordered Vader to execute Galen Marek, breaking into a fit of hysterical laughter as Marek was telekinetically pummeled by Vader, and continuing to chuckle quietly for several moments after Vader apparently killed Marek. In fact, he was known to cultivate life-forms for the sole purpose of eventually killing them. His sadism was such that, when murdering his Master, Darth Plagueis in his sleep, he paused occasionally to mock Plagueis for being manipulated by him and revel in Plagueis's pain before continuing. He later demonstrated similar behavior immediately before his death at the hands of Vader while torturing Luke Skywalker, smiling at the young Jedi as he prepared to kill him. His sadistic inclinations may have had roots from his father, Cosinga Palpatine\u2014a penchant for violence was one of the few things the two men had in common. Regarding his views on failure, he was once noted by Darth Vader to be \"not as forgiving as [Vader was]\" when telling Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod that Palpatine was arriving at the Second Death Star to inspect it; the implied warning was that Jerjerrod might be executed by the Emperor due to the project being behind schedule. He once claimed himself to be the \"King of Beasts\" to his father, after the latter accused Palpatine of having murder on his mind, if he even needed permission to do so. Likewise, he also had absolutely no qualms with destroying his own forces in order to defeat his enemies. This trait was especially evident during the Battle of Endor, where he ordered Moff Jerjerrod to fire the Death Star's superlaser at Endor in the event that the Endor Task Force somehow managed to capture or destroy the shield generator, making it very clear that he did not care how many of his own troops were killed as a result. Vader also mentioned on one occasion, while comparing himself to the Emperor, that while he himself killed only when necessary, Sidious killed for amusement. Enough of his psychopathic nature had been unveiled to the subjects of the Empire that several members of the Imperial hierarchy viewed him as having delusions of grandeur. Some of his officers, such as Stormtrooper Corps Commander Nahdonnis Praji, dismissed these claims as figures of speech, although in Praji's case, he reassessed his original views on the matter when meeting the reborn Emperor face-to-face in 10 ABY.

As articulated in The Weakness of Inferiors, Sidious considered the wise and powerful\u2014specifically Force-sensitives\u2014as responsible for providing guidance for such lesser entities in order to allow for a thriving civilization. Seeing no one wiser nor more powerful than himself save for possibly Vader, he deemed only himself as worthy of realizing this philosophy, and thus endeavored to control the galaxy forever."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his megalomaniacal nature, Sidious was capable of acknowledging his mistakes: shortly after he was revived from his first death, he stated in his entry of the Telos Holocron that Anakin's redemption and turning against him, resulting in his first death, was largely his own fault rather than Vader's.

This willingness to be killed was especially evident in his interactions with Anakin Skywalker, Luke Skywalker, and Galen Marek (the first when openly revealing his true identity as Darth Sidious, the second when taunting him about the Rebel Alliance's impending failure at Endor, and the last after being \"beaten\"). In the case of Marek, when Rahm Kota proceeded to convince him to spare Sidious to avoid \"being back where he started,\" Sidious proceeded to attack Kota in a rage due to interfering with his attempt at corrupting Marek. He also demonstrated similar behavior when Leia managed to topple the bed he was on in apparent rage after his revelation that he intended to transfer himself into Anakin Solo once he was born, feeling satisfaction that he made her angry, and in addition, he deliberately allowed the Heinsnake Cult to make an assassination attempt specifically to test Vader's loyalty, putting himself at grave risk for such a gamble.

However, he had left the work unfinished when he died above Endor, and he failed to finish the third volume after his resurrection, leaving the work incomplete in 11 ABY.

The latter reason was especially evident in the aftermath of Occupation of Bespin, where his modified use of his hologram all but ensured that Vader did not see that Prince Xizor was in the same room as Palpatine.

After spending years preparing for Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side, and finally having him as his own, Sidious was robbed of his perfect apprentice when Skywalker's power was severely diminished due to his extensive injuries on Mustafar. Both his attempts to replace the hobbled Vader were failures, Galen Marek opting to sacrifice himself to save the Rebel Alliance, and Luke Skywalker devoting his efforts to redeeming Vader rather than killing and replacing him. Sidious ultimately considered any other candidates invalid, as, while powerful in their own right, they simply were not in his league. In addition, regarding his own apprentices, he usually betrayed them and engineered their deaths when they either proved weaker than another candidate or failed him: he considered Maul dead, but tortured him after discovering his survival and subsequently defeating him and his brother Savage Opress on Mandalore. Later, he had Anakin Skywalker kill Darth Tyranus in order to ensure Skywalker's replacement of him as Sidious' apprentice.

The new Emperor briefly considered leaving Vader to die on Mustafar due to his injuries and failure, but soon thought better of it. In fact, the closest Sidious ever came to actually valuing any of his apprentices was with Vader, having saved him largely because, despite his injuries, he was still powerful, and also because Vader was effectively his creation.

As an apprentice under Darth Plagueis' tutelage, he learned all the known dark side powers of his predecessors and quickly excelled to the point that he soon came to consider himself the Sith'ari. Sidious' mastery of the Force was so immense, having spent decades immersing himself in the many facets of the Force and researching it, which reportedly granted him full mastery over all known Force powers and he also managed to discover and master previously unknown techniques, allowing him to create new powers at whim, that even he at times wondered if the Force had been so strong in anyone before him, feeling a monster rising from the core of himself, impatient to unleash itself. Shortly after the death of his master, Sidious received a most powerful vision from voices that proclaimed his reign. He himself considered that the simple act of glancing at him was tantamount to glimpsing the dark energy that bound and drove the galaxy. Even prior to his induction into the Sith, his Force potential was powerful enough to block out Darth Plagueis' (while adopting the public identity of Hego Damask) mind reading abilities when they first met, and later able to effortlessly and telekinetically murder his parents, siblings, and their personal guards. Even as Sidious continued to age, he was still extremely powerful and skilled in the usage of the Force, with his power allowing him to sustain himself beyond his natural lifespan. At full power, Sidious's Force abilities proved so great that it required a large amount of highly powerful and skilled Force adepts to defeat him, as shown by how he was captured by Zaarin's forces with the aid of Lyn and her students aboard the Majestic and when he was defeated over Pinnacle Base by the combined efforts of Luke Skywalker, Leia Skywalker, and then-unborn Anakin Solo. Vader himself, being greatly weakened from his injuries as he was, would not dare challenge Sidious without aid from another powerful Force adept, resulting in him searching for a powerful apprentice. By his death, Sidious had became a nexus of the Dark Side of such power he could tear apart the fabric of space. Even after his death, Sidious's power proved too great to be contained by Chaos and it required every single deceased Jedi Knight to keep Sidious from escaping Chaos and wreaking havoc on the Galaxy. It seems that only Yoda had the Force abilities required to single-handedly duel Sidious to a standstill, although even that was not enough to defeat the Dark Lord. Another single individual who was able to match Sidious was Galen Marek, but only through the Dark Side boosting him was he able to best Sidious. Although Sidious ultimately got overpowered by Marek in their final altercation, he managed to kill off Marek (albeit as a result of Marek holding off Sidious' attempt at attacking Kota, his intended target, with Sidious not being happy about this afterward). In addition, he could also obscure his presence and ties to his public persona and vice versa, as especially evident by how he managed to elude even well-trained Jedi Masters from realizing that Palpatine and Sidious were one and the same. Despite his ability to conceal his own presence with the Force and his ability to sense others with the Force, there are two examples of his Force sense capabilities failing him . The first time was when encountering Anakin Skywalker, where he provided him with a room and didn't even sense Anakin's Force potential, let alone realize he had a very high midi-chlorian count until then-Jedi Master Dooku informed him of such when meeting with him at a diner. The second time was regarding Anakin Skywalker's son, Luke, just before the Battle of Endor, where he was unable to sense Luke's presence on the Tydirium until Vader, breaking protocol, went over to his throne room to notify him of this development personally."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sidious was incredibly skilled in Force lightning and was known to use this both as a lethal attack, and as a way of torturing his enemies. If used to its full potency, he could instantly reduce one or more people into charred husks. Although his Force lightning was generally blue in color, it also emerged as purple. Despite his formidable skill in many other aspects of the Force, Force lightning was arguably his trademark ability and one that served him well against extremely dangerous opponents many times either resulting in their defeat or near defeat. When cornered by Mace Windu, Sidious viciously attacked him with lightning that not only nearly overwhelmed Mace Windu but also nearly caused Windu's saber to bend to Sidious's will when locked in combat with the latter's lightning. It turned out that Sidious was deliberately holding back so as to manipulate Anakin Skywalker into joining him; once that was accomplished, he fired the full strength of his lightning at Windu, torturing the Jedi for a few moments before using his lightning to throw Mace out of the window to his death. Sidious's potency with Force lightning was so powerful that he was even able to catch Yoda off guard with it, throwing the Jedi Master into the wall and later on in their duel was able to disarm him of his lightsaber with a powerful blast of it, despite the Grand Master's attempts to ground it, and subsequently nearly overwhelmed Yoda's efforts to absorb it. However, it should be noted that Sidious used his height to his advantage by elevating his body in order to target the lightning above Yoda's tutaminis defense and Yoda ultimately succeeded in absorbing the attack. The resulting explosion not only overwhelmed and blasted Sidious aside but also separated Yoda from Sidious, allowing the Jedi to flee. If it hadn't been for Darth Vader's shocking intervention and his own hubris, he would have succeeded in using his lightning to torture Luke Skywalker to death, who had demonstrated that despite his natural talent in the Force at the time, even he was utterly powerless against its strength which ended up killing Vader due to the latter's repeated exposure to it. He could also use this power in conjunction with telekinesis to electrify objects while levitating them before hurling them at his opponents, thus increasing the damage potency of the attack, called lightning grenade. Sidious's mastery of Force Lightning allowed him to also generate a shield made of lightning, which he utilized during his fight with Marek in conjunction with Force Flight to temporarily retreat from the battle in order to have his red guards and senate guards attack Marek, which proved to be impenetrable to Marek with either the Force or his lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sidious was also extremely skilled with telekinesis; during his battle with Yoda, he levitated several Senate pods simultaneously, including the one he was standing on, with incredible dexterity and precision. Likewise, he was skilled enough with telekinesis that he was also able to remove Luke Skywalker's restraints while barely even lifting his finger when meeting face to face on the second Death Star. He could also easily overpower and fling both Maul and Opress to the window of Mandalore's Castle and keep them firmly pinned until he released them. He was incredibly proficient in Force Choke to the point that he can perform it to deadly effect without needing to see the target even when in large distances away, as shown by how he was able to completely subdue Tyranus in a chokehold with a single hand gesture and later levitated and choked two Mandalorians to death even before arriving in their location. Sidious was a master of Force speed, implementing it into his fighting style and allowing him to move so quickly that his opponents would often find themselves unable to react in time. Darth Sidious also had the power of Force Flight, able to hover above the ground in standard gravity. as well as being capable of surrounding himself with a miniature storm of malevolent force energy that slowed the movements of, and tortured all caught in it. After the first decade of his apprenticeship under Darth Plagueis, Sidious possessed an exceedingly feral usage of Force rage, demonstrated when he assassinated the members of the Gran Protectorate that organized his and his master's failed assassination attempt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sidious was also the only known being capable of producing a Force storm of his own power, a dark side technique which he himself discovered, and that had enough power to kill an entire world. Using his anger and his will, he was able to rip the space-time continuum and create a hyperspace wormhole. However, even though he claimed to have quickly achieved the mastery needed to conjure a storm simply by willing it, he openly admitted that at the early stages of his discovery and subsequent learning of the power, even he was not able to fully control it but had full confidence he would ultimately acquire the ability to achieve complete control over the storms he created with more practice. By 10 ABY, indeed, the Emperor appeared to have mastered the technique to the level needed to be fully capable of controlling a Force storm, to the point that he was able to send out several storms at whim and a singularly fully powered storm required the combined efforts of Luke, Leia, and the unborn Anakin Solo through the light side to turn his dark side creation against him. He also was proficient in pyrokinesis, as evidenced by how he was able to murder Senator Teem while the latter hid behind a curtain by easily coaxing a gentle flame from a gas powered fireplace into a raging inferno . His proficiency in pyrokinesis was also implied in what turned out to be the first dream Vader had since he became Vader, where Sidious, who was implied to have somehow survived being killed in that dream, conjured a wall of fire separating Vader from his son."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another very dangerous and advanced Force technique utilized by the Emperor was the ability to use the Force to transfer his essence, as well as the essences of others, which he used to survive death on at least two occasions. He had a supply of clone bodies ready to house his spirit until the last one succumbed to his own corrupting power and the sabotage of his subordinates. He also, when taking over a host's body, overwrote the soul and personality of the being to fully dominate over it. He used this power not only as a pathway to immortality, but also as a particularly cruel and sadistic form of torture; it is known that he killed and resurrected Imperial engineer Bevel Lemelisk seven times as punishment for the destruction of the first Death Star. Sidious was also able to transfer his spirit into the bodies of individuals who were biologically unrelated to him. After his first death, his spirit was able to possess the body of Jeng Droga, though Sidious's power drove Droga completely insane for a time. He also intended to possess the body of Anakin Solo after the genetic material for his clone bodies was sabotaged, though he never got the chance to do so. He also possessed some knowledge on the manipulation of midi-chlorians, having done so with Darth Plagueis in a Grand Experiment taking place in 42 BBY that indirectly and unwittingly resulted in the birth of the Chosen One, Anakin Skywalker. He was unable to fully master the technique prior to murdering Plagueis, though he claimed to have a level of competence with the technique that would have enabled him to save Plagueis while he was suffocating."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among the Emperor's powers was the ability to channel the collective life essences of billions to sustain himself and his Dark Side Adepts; his victims would live in a dream-like state while his own power grew. The entire population of Byss lived under this spell until the planet's destruction by the Galaxy Gun. It was mentioned by Luke Skywalker that the Emperor's very voice had a hypnotic lull to it whenever he was outwardly projecting his dark side Force powers. Darth Sidious was highly adept at foreseeing the future, often utilizing the power to see his plots to fruition, ensuring that all would proceed as he had envisioned. Furthermore, Sidious was extremely proficient in Force stealth, able to hide his dark nature from the Jedi Order for many years before allowing himself to be discovered. Sidious was so powerful in the dark side that he was able to cloud the Jedi's vision, making it exceedingly difficult to predict future events.

He also created Shadow Droids, hybrid mechanic/organic starfighters controlled by his own will, used against the Republic after his return in a clone body. He may have also used alchemy to hide his true face from the Jedi and the rest of the galaxy as a senator and Chancellor of the Republic. The Dark Lord also was knowledgeable and proficient in Sith magic, as he was aware of and able to perform an ancient ritual that casted a powerful and convincing dark illusion capable of fooling even Yoda, and he is also able to use arcane rituals to detect poisons and drugs in food and drink.

The name \"Sheev,\" however, was reportedly conceived by George Lucas for Star Wars: Underworld, a proposed live-action Star Wars television series which ultimately went unrealized."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The real-world origin of the name \"Palpatine\" is not known, but the in-universe origins of the name were revealed to be obscure in Luceno's novel Plagueis\u2014in Palpatine's own time, it was considered to be either an ancient name of state among noble families of Naboo, in accordance with the previously established Naboo custom of noms de r\u00e8gne (like \"Amidala\"), or perhaps borrowed from one of the ancient regions of the planet.
