The council of the nearby Jedi Enclave sent Jedi Knight Bolook to the scene. To assist with the case, Bolook brought an information droid, and the two examined the body and obtained blood samples and evidence for analysis. The evidence was sent to Dantooine's capital city, Garang. Bolook began investigating the murder and held two suspects, Handon Guld and Rickard Lusoff, at the scene for questioning."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several hours later, former Sith Lord Revan, who had lost his memories and was training as a Jedi, passed through the grove during his final initiate trial. Bolook saw a chance to give Revan experience, and stopped him to ask for assistance with the case. Revan agreed to help and the two began investigating. The droid connected to the archives in the capital and the lab at the enclave in order to assist. It was able to retrieve information on blood samples, weapons, police reports, and business transactions and would relay the information to Revan when asked."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After examining the evidence and interviewing each suspect, Revan came to the unorthodox conclusion that both men were guilty. Revan had discovered that Nettic had an affair with Guld's wife, and cheated Lusoff in a business deal. Thus, they both had motive to commit the crime. After noticing that Guld was bleeding from his side, Bolook weighed in. He believed that Guld had confronted Nettic and murdered him, while Lusoff, mistaking Guld for Nettic, fired from the bushes and hit Guld in the side. With this, Bolook formally arrested the two men and escorted them to the Enclave's holding facilities to await trial. The droid went with Bolook and left the scene, while Revan continued his trial."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid had reflective metal plating and crude metal limbs.
