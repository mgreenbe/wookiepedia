Its name refers to the durni, whose soft fur coat may have reminded someone of the soft nature of dust. Circa 1 ABY, a spacer who was visiting the Tansarii Point Station searched the station for all the dust durnis on the station, cleaning them up as they went. For removing them all, they were rewarded with a feather duster. Another spacer later performed a similar task on Nova Orion Station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dust durnis are an interactive object in the video game Star Wars Galaxies that players can collect.
