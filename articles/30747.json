The smuggler was unknowingly Force-sensitive, and was a descendant of Lady Corvax, an ancient resident of the planet Mustafar. Seeking out the descendants of Corvax, Darth Vader had Imperial Admiral Gable Karius use an Interdictor vessel to pull the Windfall out of hyperspace above Mustafar and capture the smugglers, taking them to his fortress. With the help of the Mustafarian Vylip F'alma, the smuggler and ZO-E3 escaped, discovering Corvax's sanctum in the caverns of the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually taking command of The Marching Horde, the smuggler helped lead an attack on Fortress Vader.
