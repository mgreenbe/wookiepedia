During the yearly festival known as Hallowe'en, many Ewoks dressed up as ghosts as part of the festivities. A ghost costume consisted of a white bolt of cloth pulled over the Ewok's head with round circles serving as eye holes. In 3 ABY, for instance, the Ewoks Teebo and Wicket W. Warrick chose to wear ghost costumes for the holiday. In this guise, Teebo scared Warrick as a prank."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In real life, ghosts appear in most belief systems.
