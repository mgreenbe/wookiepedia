The convenience of their smaller size came at a price, however, as the boots could not be operated for extended periods due to their limited cooling capacity - while simultaneously suffering from slightly diminished fuel capacity. Additionally, as they were worn further from a user's center of gravity, they were much more difficult to control."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cad Bane, a bounty hunter in operation during the Clone Wars, owned a pair of rocket boots equipped with Mitrinomon jetpack thrusters and made use of them on many occasions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
