Although the Hellcaster cannon was considered highly effective in its role, the weapon used heavy elements that insured its ammunition was expensive and difficult to produce. Prolonged fire from the cannon demonstrated an ability to shred duracrete barriers. Two gunships attempted to kill a rogue clone of Galen Marek on Cato Neimoidia by utilizing the Hellcaster cannon in concert with concussion missiles. Both gunships failed and were destroyed by the clone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
