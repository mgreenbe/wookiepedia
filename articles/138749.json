In 14 BBY, after evading capture from a pair of Inquisitors, Second Sister and Ninth Sister, on Bracca, the Order 66 survivor Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis fell down through the roof of a moving train where TK-8190 was on duty. TK-8190 and another trooper investigated the disturbance, finding Kestis recovering from his fall. The Jedi proceeded to try to talk the stormtroopers down when TK-8190 mistook him for a simple stowaway, leading to Kestis imploring the pair of soldiers not to report the incident. The short-lived ceasefire ended, however, when TK-8190 decided to report Kestis's intrusion and was told that stowaway was actually a Jedi. This lead to TK-8190 and his companion being swiftly killed by Kestis in self-defense with the Jedi's lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
