It had several sharp turns and many fire obstacles. Inferno was famous as most of the track was located inside an active volcano. This allowed the more fearless racers to attempt to shortcut over the various magma flows. This tactic was incredibly risky as a single error would almost certainly spell the end of the racer and therefore was usually only intentionally attempted by the very skilled or the very desperate. This course was the fourth and final race in the Invitational Podracing Circuit tournament. Ben Quadinaros was the track favorite at this course, despite Quadinaros favoring safe courses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
