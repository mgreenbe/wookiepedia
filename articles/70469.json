It was a unique and dangerous weapon designed by the Jengardin Millennial Warriors. Its cleaved edges enabled the user to literally disembowel their enemies. The size, shape and most likely weight of this weapon would make it difficult to utilize by an untrained individual, making it an iconic weapon for the Jengardin Millennial Warriors. The size also made it hard to conceal, making it a symbol of the Jengardin Millennial Warriors as well as a weapon they used in combat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
