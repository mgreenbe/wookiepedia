The second was the deluxe nutmeat and jelly sandwich, which was a recreation of a dish favored in some patrons' childhoods and consisted of ground ettel nuts and a gourmet make of the jelly spread on bleached pseudograin bread. The sandwich was sold as a lunch dish for 4.5 and both it and the breakfast side were served at Dex's prior to its destruction in around 18 BBY.
