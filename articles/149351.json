During the waning years of the Galactic Republic, Untaire joined the Jedi Order and became a friend of Jedi Master Darrus Jeht. At some point during the Clone Wars, Jeht was sent a number of crates containing the parts of an ancient starship, and he and Untaire investigated the deliveries in an attempt to find out who was sending the crates. However, despite her efforts, Untaire was unable trace the cargo manifests of the shipments. Jeht eventually assembled the starship and at Untaire's suggestion, he named the completed vessel the Legacy. Around this time, Jeht obtained tickets to a performance of the band Sien'Soro and he planned to take Untaire and the Twi'lek Jedi Aayla Secura to the concert with him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the declaration of Order 66 in 19 BBY, the ARC trooper Mar'ek marooned Untaire on a remote world against her will, to keep her safe during the upheaval. However, Mar'ek later lied to Darrus Jeht and claimed that he had killed Untaire, so as to prevent Jeht from having the satisfaction of knowing that his friend was still alive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
