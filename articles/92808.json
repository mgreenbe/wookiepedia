Moons could vary in size, atmospheric conditions, climate, indigenous life, and other such categories. Some moons were barren rocks that existed in the vacuum of space, such as Folor, in orbit around Commenor, while others could be covered in lush, dense jungle, such as the fourth moon of Yavin. The number of moons a planet had could also vary greatly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In some cases, moons were called worlds if they were developed and/or populated enough. Densely populated Nar Shaddaa, known as the Smugglers' Moon, orbited Nal Hutta and was covered in sprawling cityscape, not unlike the ecumenopolis Coruscant. The sentient world Zonama Sekot was considered a moon for a period of time because it masqueraded as one of 18 moons orbiting the gas giant Mobus. However, its status as a moon could vary due to its mobile nature, amongst other unique traits. Dxun orbited very closely around its parent planet, Onderon, to the point that during certain times of the year, they shared atmosphere, leading some to consider them to be like sister planets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some planets, such as Carida, used their moon as a mascot. Carida's Imperial Academy had its emblem carved upon the surface of Carida's moon. However, during Mako Spince's schooling at the academy, Spince used antimatter to attempt to remove the emblem. The moon was destroyed, instead, leading to Spince's expulsion from the academy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Superweapons, some producing effects similar to the Death Star in the destruction of Alderaan, were sometimes used on moons, but to the same devastating effect. During the start of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Sernpidal, an inhabited world in the Outer Rim, was rendered uninhabitable by the Yuuzhan Vong through the use of a powerful dovin basal pulling the moon Dobido towards and eventually impacting the surface, rendering the planet unsuitable to continue supporting life, in a technique known as Yo'gand's Core. Later in the same war, after the Battle of Coruscant, the Yuuzhan Vong attempted to recreate their lost homeworld of Yuuzhan'tar on Coruscant and used powerful dovin basals to move three of its smaller moons around while the largest was destroyed and the resulting rubble and debris was used to form the Rainbow Bridge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
