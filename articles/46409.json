Eight-Gee-Enn was tall and spindly. Originally, he was made from coppery-reddish metal, but had patches everywhere due to so many repairs. Some patches were gold, others steel, and one round silver one on the top of Eight-Gee-Enn's head. He had one green eye and one red lens scavenged from a scrapped droid. Eight-Gee-Enn's speakers were out of tune; his \"voice\" sounded either very deep, or very shrill."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The job of F8GN was to make sure the children Garris Shrike \"rescued\" learned to properly pick-pocket. The droid donned street clothes with credit chip-sized objects in the pockets and walked past the children. When they could successfully take the objects without F8GN detecting them, they were deemed ready. Also, F8GN made sure the children begged or stole the quota needed by the end of the day."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "F8GN first appeared in The Paradise Snare, a 1997 novel written by A.

The droid only appeared when Han Solo thought back on his youth when Garris Shrike used F8GN to oversee Solo and other children he used as beggars and pickpockets. In an interview, A. C. Crispin said that she modeled F8GN after Fagin, the adult leader and teacher of a group of young street thieves in Charles Dickens's novel Oliver Twist.
