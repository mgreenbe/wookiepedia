When used successfully this power would summon dark side strands of energy that would wrap around the target and ensnare it in an unbreakable mesh. The lattice of dark energy would then effectively sever the connection between the Force, and the trapped target, regardless of Force affiliation, and continuously sap the target's strength. After this, the energy lines would proceed to slice through anything they touched. The net was maintained through the recitation of certain words."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This technique was employed by Dark Jedi Lomi Plo to kill a Yuuzhan Vong shaper during the Mission to Myrkr and later during Swarm War in Battle of Sarm when she dueled with Grand Master Luke Skywalker. Once her victim had been ensnared, Lomi constricted the net, slicing up her victim. It was also used to torture and attempt to kill Ben Skywalker by Lost Tribe of the Sith High Lord Sarasu Taalon during the fight with Abeloth on Pydyr."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Force net first appeared in the Star Wars: The New Jedi Order series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
