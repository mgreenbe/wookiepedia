It mounted a single Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc. Mark 4e/S heavy laser cannon, one of the best laser cannons employed by the Imperial Army, as its main weapon. It had a Mark 3/S Medium Blaster Cannon as its secondary armament, as well as two side mounted weapons. The 1-H was crewed by five, including a driver, two gunners, and a commanding sergeant. There was room for single passengers in the tank. Like all Imperial-class repulsortanks, the 1-H was built on the same 20.5 meter-long chassis and could reach speeds of up to 300 kilometers an hour. It had a cargo capacity of 250 kilograms and a ground clearance of two meters. 1-Hs cost 50,000 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Out of the initial production run of 1,500 repulsortanks, 1,420 were assigned to the first Death Star, while the rest were given to the Imperial Hammers Elite Armor Unit.
