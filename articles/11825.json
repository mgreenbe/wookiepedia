Combining engine baffles, emergency shunts, and fuel tanks, they were invented by Rose Tico under the patronage of General Leia Organa during the First Order/Resistance War. Although bafflers looked \"weird,\" in the words of their inventor, they managed to keep the Resistance's bombers undetected during spy missions to the Atterra system. At the behest of Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, Tico later stayed aboard the Ninka and helped the resident boffins adapt her bafflers for use on other ships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
