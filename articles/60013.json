It was then targeted by a crew of 48 pirates from the criminal Fivaran Organization, who were unaware of its cargo. Two of the pirates, the Venithon Twins, discovered the cargo but, instead of warning their partners, they escaped. The other pirates began a raid on the Hauler and were eventually killed or captured. This skirmish led to the Venithon Twins losing the favor of the Fivaran Organization."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
