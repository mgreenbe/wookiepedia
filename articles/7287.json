Grievous attacked Gentes, the Ugnaught homeworld, eager to take the Ugnaughts as factory laborers.

During their battle with him, the thermal core of a geothermal plant went critical. The resultant explosions threatened the stability of the moon's surface. Nevertheless, Grievous survived. Around 20 BBY, Obi-Wan Kenobi proposed sending a Republic Navy fleet to the Anoat system and then to Saleucami, in order to counter a planned Separatist attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The three planets were abandoned sometime before the Galactic Civil War.
