To this end, the Barkhesh Resistance, based on the planet Barkhesh in the Seitia sector of the Outer Rim Territories, offered to transfer several transports worth of supplies to the Alliance, which they did on a semi-yearly basis. General Carlist Rieekan oversaw the operation, which would require the transports to traverse a series of canyons between their supply base and the predetermined landing zone. Aware that local Imperial forces would attempt to stop the operation, Rieekan assigned Rogue Squadron, led by Commander Luke Skywalker, to fly escort for the convoy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Commander Skywalker, leading a five-fighter formation of T-65 X-wing starfighters, arrived at the designated coordinates on Barkhesh to hook up with the Resistance's convoy and immediately encountered Viper probe droids near the supply base.

Six TIE bombers were also deployed to destroy the convoy. Rogue Squadron was forced to deal with each threat to ensure the safety of the convoy, employing both lasers and proton torpedoes. Successfully eliminating the immediate threat, Skywalker and the Rogues also engaged a small Imperial base not far from the landing zone. Although defended by two AT-STs, a turbolaser mounted on a tall turret, and six stormtroopers, the base was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With enemy forces in the region cleared, an Alliance Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, using Imperial identification so as not to attract suspicion, landed on the planet and effected the cargo transfer with the convoy from the Barkhesh Resistance.
