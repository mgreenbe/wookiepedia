Agreeing to have a neutral party hold the shipment until peace talks could reach a resolution, the Order silently took the vertex and locked it away within the Treasury Room. Because of this, the Council was on edge when a series of robberies broke out within the Temple. Assigning Jedi Masters Qui-Gon Jinn and Tahl to discover the culprit,"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two Masters quickly deduced that the Dark Jedi Xanatos was behind the attacks and that a greater plot was unfolding. Sabotaging the Temple Tech Center, Xanatos planned to break into the Treasury Room when the power in the Temple recycled. Foreseeing this line of action, Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, entered the room and waited in silence as the power shut off. When Xanatos sprung from the ventilation shaft with his accomplice Bruck Chun, Jinn and Kenobi attacked with their ignited lightsabers in hand. Xanatos quickly grabbed Chun and threatened to kill him if the Jedi approached. Kenobi feigned impatience to make Xanatos underestimate him, eventually leading to the release of Chun and a lightsaber duel between Dark Jedi and Jedi Master. Chun raced out of the chamber, followed by Kenobi as he charged down to the Room of a Thousand Fountains to complete Xanatos' plot. Meanwhile, Xanatos dueled with Jinn, eventually making their way up to the Council Chamber and eventually to the window ledge, where Xanatos escaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Layout"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located directly below the High Council Chamber, this circular room was only accessible to members of the High Council and secured by a blast door.
