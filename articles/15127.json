However, after scarring Maruk, she believed that he should have been made \"number seventeen\" in her list of dead Jedi. Dooku's plan was set in stone. Ventress watched from her ship, Last Call, as what seemed to look like Yoda entered a starship. She then followed him to Ithor and destroyed the escort pilots. But after realizing through the Force that \"Yoda\" was actually an actor named Palleus Chuff, playing as a decoy, she then decided that it would be best to capture him and destroy the ship to make it look like Yoda had perished."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The events on Ithor caused the Republic spirit to deteriorate, much to Ventress's liking. However, she was furious when news stated that she was known for killing eleven Jedi. Despite that, she continued her objective and hired a FIII Footman droid named Solis to give her the location of the real Yoda's whereabouts. Ventress took eighteen A-series assassin droids on the Last Call and unsuccessfully ambushed Grand Master Yoda on Phindar Station, but managed to slay Masters Maruk and Maks Leem. Unbeknownst to Ventress, Chuff escaped and helped Yoda destroy the Last Call."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
