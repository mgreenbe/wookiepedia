The Moogan smugglers, led by Tee Va, bribed an official of the New Mandalorians and established a facility in the spaceport, where they diluted the tea with slabin. The drinks were then sold to several schools through an employee of a shipping company called Siddiq and the corrupted superintendent of the school. However, the slabin caused an epidemic among pupils, so Galactic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Duchess Satine Kryze began to investigate the matter. After persuading the police captain to aid them, the two women, along with several policemen, stumbled across the Moogans' compound, and a firefight broke out, which resulted in the arrest of the smugglers and the corrupt police aiding them. The warehouse was eventually burned down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
