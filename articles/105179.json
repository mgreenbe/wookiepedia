When combined with pots and pans, the bright phospowder created such a commotion of sound and light that the danchaf were so stunned the Jenet warriors were able to slay them. Although the danchaf remained on the planet after this Great Conquest period, Jenet tales ascribed Felt's phospowder trap and other Jenet war stratagems with devolving the danchaf into more primitive creatures, thus opening up Garban to Jenet domination."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
