It was positioned at the terminus of the Falko Run hyperlane, in the Centrality region and the Slice portion of the Outer Rim Territories. Covered by landmasses and expanses of ocean, Douglas III was of very little interest to the galaxy at large. Nevertheless, as the home of the jackelope, a small horned creature, Douglas III became one of several Centrality planets notorious for its hostile wildlife."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Douglas III was part of the Centrality, a long, barren stretch of space in the distant Outer Rim that had traditionally opposed centralized galactic governments, such as the Old Republic. The Douglas system owed its name to the game hunter Mendel Douglas, who made Douglas III famous after traversing its surface in search of the elusive and rare jackelope, hoping to collect the creature's hide. While the jackelope ultimately made it back for his collection, Douglas himself did not."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 3 BBY, the working-class bar Poly Pyramid on the neighboring Centrality planet Rafa IV adorned its interior with incompetently taxidermized galactic fauna either nailed to the walls or hanging from the ceiling.

In popular culture, twentieth-century taxidermist Douglas Herrick is credited with creating the American jackalope\u2014a legendary creature with a jackrabbit's body and the antlers of a pronghorn antelope\u2014which developed into a tourist attraction in Herrick's hometown of Douglas, Wyoming."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Douglas III was later one of 200 playable worlds included in the 1998 PC game Star Wars: Rebellion, which provided the planet's only visual depiction, an image also used to illustrate eighteen other planets of similar composition in the game. Star Wars: Rebellion and its accompanying strategy guide placed Douglas III in the Jospro sector, but author Michael Kogge's 2001 roleplaying article \"A Campaign Guide to the Centrality\" from Star Wars Gamer 5 changed the planet's location to the Centrality, in accordance with Douglas III's original mention in The Lando Calrissian Adventures trilogy, which features the Centrality as its primary backdrop.
