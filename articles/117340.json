A trade dispute soon developed between the Republic and a megacorporation known as the Trade Federation, resulting in the blockade of Naboo. At an early point in the blockade, Rorworr and a few other students met with Raymas Daal, a small-time criminal, in the Naboo city of Kwilaan. Daal had a new backer, and offered the team 10,000 to temporarily deactivate a Naboo sensor array located just outside of the city. Daal told the students he simply wanted to evade taxes on a rare spice shipment in order to increase profits, and intended to land while the sensor was deactivated. In reality, Daal's unnamed backer was the Trade Federation, which wanted to move jamming satellites into Naboo space undetected in preparation for an invasion of the planet. The meeting was interrupted by plain-clothes members of the Royal Naboo Security Forces, who intended to apprehend Daal for questioning; Daal, however, escaped, as did Rorworr and his companions.

Eventually, they encountered one Chee Mobok, a frightened Twi'lek textiles merchant who spoke very little Basic.

All of the prisoners were skeptical of their rescuers, and only the Tane family initially agreed to escape. A patrol of four battle droids arrived at the scene, alerted by the Neimoidians, and the students were forced to defeat the patrol before the remaining prisoners were convinced that they could be kept safe during the escape.

A squad of Imperial stormtroopers also took refuge within the mechanic's bar. A local Pacithhip spice dealer tried to hide his stash on the Rebels, while Old Ezrim, a local moisture farmer, began to insist that the group were spice dealers. The argument was interrupted when Baht broke over the team's comlink and explained that, although he had escaped an Imperial Customs ship by entering the sandstorm, he had little control over his starship inside the maelstrom. Baht's transmission was cut short as his ship, the Singing Savrip, crashed into the desert. The stormtroopers moved to arrest the Rebels, but were defeated with the help of the lounge's mechanic, Fixer, a pilot by the name of Verzon Tennd, and his droid, Deenine.

The Wookiee found humor in the fact that, despite looking and smelling completely different, he was occasionally mistaken for Chewbacca, another famous Wookiee in the Rebellion. If it served to benefit him or the Rebellion, Rorworr would not correct the misidentification. Rorworr was a very expressive Wookiee and was capable of letting out a mournful hoot or a displeased roar. Rorworr disliked it when he was forced to leave behind temporary allies, but he cherished his friendships and was devastated whenever he lost any of his long-time companions.
