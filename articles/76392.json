A variety of kinrath could be found throughout the forests, including the viper kinrath, which carried a deadly poison and was tougher than standard kinrath. Another was the hive kinrath, which lived in the subsurface of Dantooine. From the moment they hatched Kinrath matured very quickly, with new hatchlings being seen as almost the same size a fully matured adult. Kinrath seemed to be hive creatures, and a single female kinrath matriarch was the leader of a hive of kinrath."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kinrath had four legs and a leg-like, poisonous appendage coming out of their faces that they used to attack prey or other perceived enemies. All kinrath were blind but could sense heat which allowed them to navigate their way around and identify potential threats. They identified members of their own hive using a specialized sweat gland in the abdomen which excreted a specific scent. If an adventurer could remove this gland intact from a Kinrath corpse and carry it about their person, many Kinrath would not perceive them as a threat, ensuring reduced hostility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Red lightsaber crystals could be naturally generated in unhatched kinrath eggs, instead of being artificially forged."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In approximately 3956 BBY the Jedi Revan encountered several Kinraths during his journey on the planets Kashyyyk and Dantooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kinrath were set to appear in an episode of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, but the show was cancelled before the episode could be completed.
