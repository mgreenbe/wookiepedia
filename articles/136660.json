It had been acquired by the Galactic Empire, who, under the leadership of Sergeant Magernon, converted it into a prison that covered its entire surface. Once the prison had been filled up, the Empire excavated the moon in order to expand the prison further. The digging was called off when the workers encountered a nest of bastaks, who massacred them. After the Battle of Endor, Substation Grimdock fell under jurisdiction of the New Republic. After the Battle of Jakku, Magernon was allowed to continue running the prison. He freed all the prisoners who had been friendly towards the Empire, who contacted pirates to pick them up. The New Republic brought in their fleet to blockade the pirate vessels from leaving, causing a standoff."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
