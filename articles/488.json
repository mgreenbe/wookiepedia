The Republic's boundaries had been expanding as Core-based and corporate interests pushed waves of expansion, settlement, and resource harvesting throughout the Slice. During this time, the planets of Alsakan and Coruscant had developed a heated rivalry, and Alsakan's desire for economic, political, and cultural superiority and independence had reached a breaking point. The conflict initially started as a blockade and armed colonial protection but quickly escalated to war. The conflict officially began with the First Battle of Virujansi, when the Republic seized control of the planet from Alsakani interests."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Proem"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Great Manifest Period of the Galactic Republic had been a time of expansion for the Galactic Republic. Lead by Alsakan, Corellia, and Coruscant, planetary governments and organizations began massive colonization and resource stockpiling efforts throughout the Slice. In the northern portion of this region, especially near the Perlemian Trade Route, the planet of Alsakan had greatest socio-political control. It had settled colonies and staked claim to numerous resource-rich worlds. Coruscant competed for worlds in the central portion of the Slice, with its efforts being fronted by Republic-backed mega-corporations. Hostilities brewed as the two planets fought for dominance not only economically, but also culturally. The Republic's bureaucracy and politicking grew with fervor, fueling the rivalry as sectors of the galaxy had become so large that they were ungovernable. The growing governmental structure included the creation of the Bureau of Ships and Services more than one thousand years prior to the conclusion of the Great Manifest Period. This organization was created to help regulate interstellar trade as well as to maintain records of starship transactions and movements. Such expanding government and loss of local control irked Alsakan and Corellia on philosophical and cultural levels. Alsakan began sending armed warships to protect its colonization interests, which caught the ire of the Coruscant-based corporate barons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The galaxy in 17,018 BBY"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic abruptly cascaded into open fighting with the sudden outbreak of the First Alsakan Conflict in 17,000 BBY. The intensifying strife between Alsakan and Coruscant had reached a boiling point with the use of Alsakani warships to advance colonization. The Grand Companies\u2014the major trading companies along the Core stretch of the Corellian Run and Metellos Trade Route\u2014objected to this move, and Duros freighters began clashing with Alsakani warships. The Republic backed the Duros merchants, sparking a war between the two factions when they assaulted and captured Virujansi in 17,018 BBY. Six years later, Alsakan forces liberated the planet. Corellia remained neutral by protecting its interests in the southern portions of the galaxy in spite of its sympathies and philosophical alignments toward Alsakan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Impact"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside the Republic, the conflict between Alsakan and Coruscant was the first of seventeen such skirmishes between the two planets. Battles took place for more than three hundred years, including the Battle of Kes in 16,921 BBY, the First Siege of Porus Vida in 16,820 BBY, and the Siege of Belasco, which began in 16,800 BBY. The First Alsakan Conflict was ultimately ended when the Bureau of Ships and Services in 16,700 BBY, which threatened to withhold access to the system of hyperspace beacons. The Senate also addressed issues regarding representation and bureaucratic control upon the conflict's conclusion. Tension remained high, however, and hostilities resumed 500 years later in 16,200 BBY. The seventeen conflicts occurred in all, destroying historical landmarks such as Belgoth's Beacon and the Alsakan Mosaics while and laying waste to portions of the Expansion Region.
