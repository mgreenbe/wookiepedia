Upon breaking through the Geonosian blockade, 6/298's ship headed towards the Petranaki arena to rescue the Jedi strike team sent there. Once they had reached the arena, Yoda ordered the gunship to form a perimeter around the few remaining Jedi who had survived the battle. 6/298 exited the LAAT/i, and provided covering fire for fleeing Jedi. While covering the Jedi's escape, 6/298 managed to destroy a droideka before re-entering his gunship.

After taking out the Separatist transport vessels with the help of Kenobi's LAAT/i, 6/298 travelled aboard his gunship until it passed the Im'g'twe Hills. Witnessing one of the other gunships getting destroyed by Separatist fire, Mace Windu ordered the pilot to land in a nearby Republic assembly area. Once all three rescued Jedi had left the ship to go fight in the ongoing battle, 6/298's gunship took off once again and headed towards the forward command center, under Grand Master Yoda's orders. Having dropped off the General, 6/298 headed skyward one last time, and went to assist the rest of the clone army."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Born as a clone of the bounty hunter known as Jango Fett, 6/298 stood at a height of 1.83 meters.
