Around 3643 BBY, he found out about a road ambush, that the Mantellian Separatist Movement was planning with a couple of bombs. He alerted the Republic forces for the eminent treat but was kicked out of their base as they didn't believe him. The Republic however reconsidered his intel and assigned a promising sergeant to retrieve it. Mirru was skeptical at first, but ended accepting to give his intel in exchange for a considerable amount of credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
