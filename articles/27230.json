Following the marriage of Goran Beviin and Medrit Vasur, the two male Mandalorians lived together at the Beviin-Vasur farm on Mandalore, ten kilometers outside of the Outer Rim world's capital city of Keldabe. Vasur worked as a blacksmith and Beviin as a bounty hunter, supplementing the living they made from working the farm together. During the war with the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong, Beviin fought with the Mandalorian Protectors under Mand'alor Boba Fett against the invaders, eventually adopting fellow Mandalorian Dinua Jeban after her mother Briika died in battle with the Yuuzhan Vong."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the war came to an end and the Yuuzhan Vong were defeated, Jeban continued to live with her adopted parents at their farm on Mandalore. Over time, she met and married the Mandalorian soldier Jintar, and the couple had two children, a boy named Shalk and a girl named Briila. By the start of the Second Galactic Civil War, a conflict that broke out between the Galactic Alliance and the Confederation, the Beviin clan had taken to allowing Mand'alor Fett to reside alongside their family at the Beviin-Vasur farm, while he attempted to get acquainted with the culture and people he had been estranged from for most of his life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clan Beviin was a Mandalorian clan living on the planet Mandalore. Following the marriage of Goran Beviin and Medrit Vasur, the two Mandalorian men settled down together on a farm both men jointly owned, located ten kilometers outside of Mandalore's capital city, Keldabe. The couple worked the farm together, though Vasur was an educated metallurgist who also worked as a blacksmith, and Beviin was a veteran soldier who took mercenary work to supplement their income."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 25 ABY, Beviin and Vasur's farm was burdened with a poor season, forcing Beviin to accept jobs he normally wouldn't, including an assassination contract on a politician from Ter Abbes, offered by an individual known as Udelen. In truth, Udelen turned out to be the Yuuzhan Vong scout Nom Anor, who through Beviin, came to contract the services of numerous Mandalorian mercenaries in the lead-up to the Yuuzhan Vong's invasion of the galaxy. During the war against the extra-galactic invaders, Beviin fought alongside the reigning Mand'alor Boba Fett; publicly, the Mandalorian soldiers had allied with the Yuuzhan Vong, while secretly, they sought to sabotage their efforts and covertly gather intelligence. During the attack on New Holgha, Beviin engaged a Yuuzhan Vong subaltern named Bur'lorr in order to rescue a Jedi New Republic Intelligence agent whom the Mandalorians could pass their acquired information to. Though he was able to kill the Yuuzhan Vong warrior with a pair of crushgaunts he owned, Beviin's Mandalorian comrade Briika Jeban was mortally wounded in the skirmish. Having made her a promise months earlier, upon her death Beviin adopted Jeban's orphaned daughter, Dinua, welcoming the young woman into his clan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Both Beviin and his adopted daughter continued to fight the Yuuzhan Vong during the war, and Beviin participated in the defense of Mandalore when the aliens attacked the Mandalorian homeworld. Following the war's end, Jeban came to live with Beviin and Vasur at their farm. She later met and married the Mandalorian soldier Jintar, and Clan Beviin soon grew as the couple had two children of their own, a daughter named Briila and a son named Shalk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 40 ABY, the Beviin clan had taken to allowing Mand'alor Boba Fett to stay with them on their farm. Fett, who counted Goran Beviin among his few friends in life, lived out of his starship, Slave I, though he occasionally joined the family for meals at their house. As the Second Galactic Civil War broke out between the Galactic Alliance and the Confederation, Jintar sought mercenary work in the war; he suffered an injury while away, and returned to the clan not long after. By 41 ABY, Clan Beviin continued to extend its hospitality not only to Fett, but Fett's estranged wife, Sintas Vel, who was recovering from blindness and amnesia following decades of being frozen in carbonite. Around the same time, the Jedi Knight Jaina Solo had come to Mandalore, seeking Fett's aid in capturing or killing her Sith Lord brother, Darth Caedus. As a favor to Fett, Beviin allowed Solo to stay with his clan at their farm, along with Vel. Beviin later took part in training Solo in Mandalorian fighting techniques, while his husband Medrit contributed to looking after the recovering Vel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first hints of Clan Beviin came in the 2006 e-novella Boba Fett: A Practical Man, by author Karen Traviss. In it, Traviss introduced the characters of Goran Beviin, his spouse Medrit, and their adopted daughter, Dinua Jeban, into Star Wars universe. Beviin appeared again in Traviss' first entry into the multi-author novel series, Star Wars: Legacy of the Force, entitled Bloodlines, but it was her second Legacy of the Force novel, Sacrifice, that featured Clan Beviin in full. Medrit was revealed to be Beviin's husband, establishing one of the first gay couples in the Star Wars franchise. Sacrifice also reintroduced an adult Dinua Jeban, her own husband Jintar, and their two young children, Briika and Shalk, to Clan Beviin. The entire clan again featured in Traviss' third Legacy of the Force novel, entitled Revelation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
