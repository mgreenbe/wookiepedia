They were used by the clone troopers of the Galactic Republic, with most operational CK-6s being used in the Grand Army's small number of cold-weather assault units. The freeco bikes featured a heated cockpit designed to insulate the pilot from freezing external temperatures.

Essentially militarized JR-4 swoops, the CK-6 was ordered by Bespin Motors for cold-weather testing on Orto Plutonia, an ice planet known for its savage storms and bitter cold. They were 5.8 meter-long, thin swoops with an insulted cockpit enclosing the pilot and two thrusters mounted aft in port and starboard nacelles. In their short time in service with the Grand Army of the Republic, these swoops gained a reputation for ruggedness and reliability, and their range and agility of 440 kilometers per hour for a maximum speed was nearly unmatched by militarized swoops. The cost of the CK-6 swoop bike was 4,500 credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most operational CK-6 swoops were in service with the handful of clone cold assault trooper units fielded by the GAR, which used them for reconnaissance, courier service, and basic battlefield mobility. For defense, the CK-6 was armed with a forward-mounted twin light laser cannon.

Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi used the bikes to travel to meet with the local Talz population. Later, Clone Captain Rex and a force of clones fled from the Talz after they were provoked by Chairman Chi Cho. Chased by the Talz and their narglatch mounts, the clones dismounted in front of a canyon and defended their position, using their bikes as cover. Several troopers were killed by spears until Senator Riyo Chuchi was able to settle the conflict, succeeding in diplomacy where Chairman Cho had failed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
