Sometime after the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, Viraxo Industries attempted to sabotage their rivals, the Azzameen-owned shipping company Twin Suns Transport Services. In retribution, Antan Azzameen, co-owner of Twin Suns Transport Services, instructed his niece Aeron Azzameen to install the YT-1300 light freighter Selu with fake transponder codes to pass off that freighter as the Venix. Aeron was to pilot the Selu, now renamed the Venix, to a Viraxo Industries facility in orbit over the planet Denbo. There, the supposed Venix was to drop a Class-L cargo container containing contraband spice retrieved from the Viraxo's sabotage of the Azzameen cargo fields. The plan failed, however, and Aeron's brother Ace was forced to destroy the masquerading Selu in order to hide the Azzameens' involvement in the raid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the video game Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance and its Prima Games guide, both released in 1999, the Venix was only mentioned to be a regular supplier to Viraxo Industries; neither source gives any description on the starship beyond this.
