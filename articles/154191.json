He was a subordinate of captain Mar Tuuk, and served in his flagship.

Emir Wat Tambor, the Foreman of the Techno Union and the leading commander of the invasion, tasked Neimoidian Captain Mar Tuuk with commanding the blockade over Ryloth. This OOM command battle droid was deployed as his adjutant, and was stationed on the Lucrehulk-class Droid Control Ship Procurer, which served as Tuuk's flagship. The blockade also contained two Munificent-class star frigates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the Galactic Republic launched an offensive to break through the Separatist starships and liberate Ryloth, Tambor contacted Tuuk via hologram, to ensure that Tuuk's forces could withstand the attack. The commander droid stanted next to the Neimoidian captain when Tuuk assured Tambor that the blockade was impenetrable. Moments later, three Republic Venator-class Star Destroyer entered the system. When a squadron of Republic V-19 Torrent starfighters, led by Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, started the assault, Tuuk ordered the command droid to launch all Vulture droids against them. The command droid obeyed, and soon the Vulture droids engaged the Republic fighters. During the fight, the commander droid stood behind Tuuk, discussing with a B1-Series battle droid. They watched as Tuuk examined one the Republic Venator-class Star Destroyers, the Defender, and realized that the ship was General Anakin Skywalker's flagship. The droid then moved to monitor the battle, and informed Tuuk that the Republic squadron was approaching the battleship. The Neimoidian launched his trap, ordering four more Munificent-class star frigates to join the blockade, and the commander soon told that the enemy fighters were surrounded by the frigates' Vulture Droids. Outnumbered and suffering heavy losses, the Republic forces chose to retreat. Noticing this, the command droid asked Tuuk should they pursue the fleeing enemy, but the captain denied it, not wanting to break the formation."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Destruction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the attack, Tuuk wanted to learn more about his enemy, and ordered the commander droid to bring him the archive data of Skywalker, which the droid quickly delivered. After he had read about the well-known Jedi General, Tuuk was more than certain that Skywalker wouldn't give up. He commanded the command droid to prepare the cannons and troops to battle. Droid commander wondered the decision, and asked were they under attack, which captain replied that Skywalker would definitely return. The droid then proceeded to fulfill the order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after, the command battle droid informed captain Tuuk that the Republic ship, the Defender, had just appeared from hyperspace, and was sending a transmission. It was sent by Skywalker, who, via monitor, offered himself and his cruiser, alongside its crew, to surrender, in exchange of the safe passage of food and medical supplies to the suffering Twi'leks of Ryloth. The commander droid watched the negotiation, which Tuuk showed substantial interest to the bargain, as the capturing of General Skywalker would make the Separatist Captain a celebrated hero. However, Skywalker's ship was scanned, and one of the B1 battle droids revealed the results: the ship was heavily damaged, with all power diverted to the forward shields, but there was only one life-form aboard. Skywalker then sent the Defender against Tuuk's flagship and evacuated, leaving the two ships to collide. Although Tuuk tried to save the situation by ordering all cannons to fire on the Defender, chaos and panic started to spread as some of the droids, including the OOM command battle droid, initiated to senselessly skitter along the command bridge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cannons were ultimately unable to stop the Defender, and the commander asked Tuuk's advices. Knowing that the Defender was now unstoppable, the Neimoidian relinquished command to the droid, and fled his doomed flagship with an escape pod.

He served as captain Mar Tuuk's personal assistant, dutifully fulfilling the orders he received.
