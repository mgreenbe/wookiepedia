It was the site of a Separatist factory, which was raided by the Galactic Republic in an attempt to steal an encrypted file held on a data chip, one crucial to the Separatists' war effort. Though the clone troopers first managed to steal the data chip, it was soon recovered by a B1 battle droid which fled the planet aboard a Sheathipede-class transport shuttle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The B1 battle droid then headed to a Separatist asteroid base to return the data chip to a Neimoidian councillor and Count Dooku. The encrypted file on the data chip was then revealed to be containing the plans of a new model of battle droid that was designed in an intent to replace the B1-Series battle droid in the Droid Army. However, in a surprising turn of events, the B1 battle droid fired on the data chip and destroyed it, when it realized that the new battle droid would render its companions obsolete, only to be used again as spare parts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
