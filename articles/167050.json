Pe\u00f1a, revealed that the character Ailyn Vel, daughter of Boba Fett, had been posing as her father, and that Fett himself does not actually appear in Star Wars: Young Jedi Knights. Pe\u00f1a gave several reasons for the retcon: First, he felt that Fett's actions in Young Jedi Knights: Shards of Alderaan did not match his characterization from previous appearances, most notably the 1996 short story \"The Last One Standing: The Tale of Boba Fett.\" Additionally, in Young Jedi Knights: Diversity Alliance, the character Nolaa Tarkona suggests that Fett could be female. These points, coupled with early fan speculation that Fett was female, led Pe\u00f1a to conceive the idea that Fett's previously unnamed child from the 2001 comic story \"Outbid But Never Outgunned\" was Vel, a daughter who at times masqueraded as her father."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
