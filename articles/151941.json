The battle droid operated under the tactical droid TX-20 during the Battle of Ryloth. On Ryloth, the battle droid was made to clean the gutkurr cages in the Separatist-occupied city of Nabat. The Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, leading a force of clone troopers to free Twi'lek prisoners, encountered the battle droid, destroying its companions.
