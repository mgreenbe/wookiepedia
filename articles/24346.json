They were very aggressive creatures and were prone to attack any other creature in range. During the reign of the Satabs, Cavern Monsters were used as tools of execution and punishment for their enemies. When Han Solo came to Ventooine some time during the Galactic Civil War, he was almost killed by a Cavern Monster that was released upon him in a mine, where it was secretly kept by the Satab. However, he was able to kill the creature when he caused a stalactite to fall from a cave and impale the monster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
