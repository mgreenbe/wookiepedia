Captain Hamo Blastwell and Lieutenant Keyan Farlander were scrambled to destroy the convoy, consisting of BFF-1 bulk freighters Arreis, Orcim, Esorp, Nigiro and Murtceps while Y-wings guarded Bixby. The transport Dagger docked with the corvette and transferred an Alliance team to secure the ship. The Imperial Nebulon-B escort frigate Gorgon arrived too late to prevent the now captured ship from returning with the Alliance team.
