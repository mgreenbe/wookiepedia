They wielded training lightsabers, and could be set at different levels of difficulty. Jaden Korr, when he was apprenticed under Kyle Katarn, was forced to fight one when Katarn's other apprentice, Rosh Penin, set it out in hopes of slowing Jaden down in a training course. Luckily, it was not operating at a high level, so Korr managed to defeat it. He later encountered Vader's leftover ASP-19 droids on a mission at Vader's castle on Vjun, and were more difficult to defeat (as Vader had them probably set at Master level for his own practices)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
