Around that year, while in Poloda Place, the Sullustan reporter Den Dhur thought about Metrisse and his composition when he recalled the number of artistic individuals who had stayed at the complex due to its low renting prices, large living areas, and perceived security."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Metrisse was first mentioned in Coruscant Nights II: Street of Shadows, a 2008 novel written by Michael Reaves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
