Around the time of the Galactic Civil War, the Sigus family lived in the building's unit 2-A, the Sharlson family in unit 2-B, and the Kinalos family in unit 2-C. \"Old Man\" Hamedaw was responsible for keeping the building clean. The building was located on an avenue lined with tchuspera bushes, and was near a cantina called Ploover's and a lyceum with a younglings' playground."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial Civil War that followed in the aftermath of the Second Battle of Coruscant in 10 ABY, the building and its environs were the site of significant fighting, and the ruins were occupied by Imperial Stormtroopers. It was later cleared of Imperial forces by New Republic soldiers, among them a former resident. To deny it to Imperial forces, the building was burned by the New Republic shortly after it was cleared."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
