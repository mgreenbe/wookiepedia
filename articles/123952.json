Because of that violent atmosphere, most pilots typically avoided Shantipole, with one regarding it as a \"one-way trip.\" This attribute, however, made it the perfect workplace for Quarrie, a Mon Calamari master engineer and starfighter designer, as it allowed him to toil on his creations far from the watchful eye of the Galactic Empire. He established a secret starfighter laboratory and, after years of work, he designed and built Prototype B6, an advanced starfighter armed with experimental weapons, with the assistance of his astromech droid, BG-81."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shantipole made its first canonical appearance in the Star Wars Rebels Season Two episode \"Wings of the Master,\" which premiered on Disney XD on November 11, 2015.
