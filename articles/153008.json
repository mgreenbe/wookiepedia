He would also on occasion carry a DL-44 heavy blaster pistol. He had fair skin, brown eyes, brown hair, and stood around two meters in height.

In 2008, Star Wars Miniatures: Legacy of the Force was released, and it contained this Human as a miniature called \"Human Scoundrel.\" He was also later included in a picture drawn by Chris Trevas for the 2009 book The Essential Atlas, written by Jason Fry and Daniel Wallace. The Human in this picture is, in fact, a self-portrait of Trevas. The editor of The Essential Atlas, Erich Schoeneweiss, came up with the idea of having the Human lose his starship as a joke on Trevas. The image in The Essential Atlas was used to illustrate the varying spacefaring species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
