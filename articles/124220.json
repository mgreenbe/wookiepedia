The store was owned and run by a Squib named Sheebareevadee (Sheeb). The building it was in was rundown, and its owner, unlike most members of his species, was a lackluster haggler. Life on Gamorr depressed him, but he had little initiative to sell of the store's stocks and move to another planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The emporium is described in Timothy S.
