Dhur also enjoyed a brief romance with fellow Sullustan entertainer Eyar Marath, and forged friendships with Galactic Republic Surgeons Jos Vondar, Zan Yant and Kornell Divini, as well as nurse Tolk le Trene and Padawan Barriss Offee. He planned to leave Drongar with the protocol droid I-5YQ on a mission to Coruscant, leaving the information that the bota on Drongar was losing its potency with Republic command when he departed, but was caught up in the Separatist attack on RMSU 7. Den Dhur however still opted to journey to Coruscant with I-5YQ after being transported to the orbiting MedStar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His only other known assignment was to Jabiim where he first met Filba.

During the mission, Den attempted to find parts for Jax to make a new lightsaber, his old one having been lost at the end of the battle with Darth Vader. When they finally finished the investigation, Dejah opted to stay on Coruscant and join Jax's team.
