Ten meters tall and thirty meters long, they were box-like in shape and moved on heavy-duty treaded wheels. They were equipped with a processing furnace, multiple lifting/repair appendages, a photoreceptor, and an audio receiver. They cost 1,700,000 credits new (975,000 used). The model was meant to replace the EVS Construction Droid, being less expensive, smaller, with more sophisticated programming, and greater independence and situation-assessment capability. The model was popular in the Outer Rim."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
