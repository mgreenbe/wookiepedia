Their helmet featured a boosted-range comlink for when they were operating separate from their walkers. Also, to aid in their patrol and scouting duties, they often carried a circular lifeform scanner attached to the strap of the large gun slung over their back. They carried weapons such as a DC-15A blaster rifle, a DC-15S, and a number of thermal detonators. AT-RT drivers of the 7th Sky Corps wore unique orange and white armor. Some AT-RT drivers were known to carry large weapons slung over their back in addition to their DC-15 rifles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "AT-RT drivers replaced ARF troopers shortly before the Battle of Coruscant.
