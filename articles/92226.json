At some point during the years of the New Order, it was assigned to Black Sword Command, with Davith Sconn serving as the bridge officer in charge of the second watch. About three years after the Empire established the Black Fifteen shipyard at N'zoth, the Weblin put in for repairs to a damaged number four power cell. It was in drydock when the Yevetha rose up against the Empire and took control of the facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
