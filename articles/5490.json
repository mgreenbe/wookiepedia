It was the precursor to both the All Terrain Defense Pod and the All Terrain Scout Transport.[source?] During the Galactic Civil War, these walkers were adopted by both the Galactic Empire, who used Scout troopers to man the vehicles, and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, who upgraded them to compete with the advancements of the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The AT-RT's were usually used for a variety of missions including ground support, police support, civil defense, and post-battle cleanup efforts.

Piloted by a single clone trooper, the AT-RT granted both high mobility and tactical flexibility to scout platoons. It featured a powerful encrypted communications system, a small, but sophisticated sensor package, and a sound baffling system to assist in stealth operations. The AT-RT costed between 8,000 to 20,000 credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For combat, the AT-RT mounted a heavy repeating blaster in its forward hull, which gave the vehicle anti-personnel and light-armor capabilities and provided the pilot with enough firepower for nearly any mission. However, the forward-mounted blaster could be switched out for a retrofitted chin-mounted flamethrower or a retrofitted Z-6 rotary blaster cannon, while also wielding a mortar launcher. The walker also boasted a maximum speed of 75 kilometers per hour and could carry up to 100 kilograms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "AT-RT walkers were used by the Grand Army of the Republic throughout the war.

During the Battle of Ryloth, Lightning Squadron rode AT-RTs alongside the Twi'lek Resistance, who rode their own blurrg mounts, to liberate the capital city of Lessu. During the Battle of Umbara, Republic gunships deployed the walkers, which were used by the 501st Legion to combat the Umbaran Militia. During the Battle of Kiros, 501st and 212th Attack Battalion clones rode throughout the city to attack the droids, and Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano rode them to chase after the Zygerrian slaver Darts D'Nar when he fled the city. Near the end of the Clone Wars, 41st Elite Corps clone troopers used them at the Battle of Kashyyyk."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "AT-RTs continued to be fielded by the Galactic Empire, being driven by scout troopers.
