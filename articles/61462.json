However, Vader survived and led the Empire to victory. Morit Astarte had killed his sister Aiolin Astarte, as she was a competitor to him, and he fled with Cylo and Tulon Voidgazer. After this, Vader would be sent by his master to hunt them down. Meanwhile Vader sent the two maniacal droids 0-0-0 and BT-1 to capture Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra and bring her to the Executor, as she knew about his plot against the Emperor. Vader took the Devastator to the Crushank Nebulae where he led TIE fighters in an attack on Cylo's fleet. Cylo escaped, but not before Vader got aboard his flagship. He went through the labs and eventually confronted by Voidgazer, who put him against her cyberanimate rancor. However, it was no match for Vader, who slew the beast before killing Voidgazer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Battle"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The hijacking"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Vader was fighting Voidgazer, Cylo's fleet emerged from hyperspace.

However, they found the weapons, doors, and controls offline and watched with horror as sleeping gas emerged from the vents and knocked them out. In the Emperor's throne room, a Royal Guard informed him they are operating on their own life-support system. In a last ditch effort, Cylo and Morit abandoned their flagship and set it on a collision course with the Executor. Vader reached the bridge of the flagship to stop the collision course, but found that it couldn't be altered."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aboard the ship, Cylo's forces found the crew knocked out and took the bridge.

She alongside the droids, and the Wookiee bounty hunter Black Krrsantan, who was there because she owed him a great deal of money, went to defend the Emperor from Cylo's troops. Morit met up with Vader on the hull where they dueled. Vader Force-pushed Morit onto a ledge where he regained balance, only for Vader to destroy it with the force, killing him.
