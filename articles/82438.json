Vareesa was very pleased with the creature and, at Furellas' suggestion, named it \"Little Kikow\" after his other escort, Kikow\u2014despite his fellow Ithorian's insistence that he didn't want the tiger to be named after him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the time came for Vareesa to depart Ralltiir, Furellas filled out paperwork that would allow the Ithorian to take his new pet aboard a starship. Citing the rarity of Ralltiir tigers, Furellas registered the cub as a different type of cat and warned Vareesa not to disclose much information about the creature, lest someone try to steal it. In reality, \"Little Kikow\" would quickly grow into a vicious killer, as Ralltiir tigers were dangerous even to their own handlers\u2014a fact Furellas kept Vareesa innocent of, in her role as a Kalmec subversive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
