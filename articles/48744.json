The clash took place in 3964 BBY, as Republic Navy Captain Saul Karath attempted to halt the Mandalorian advance at the Jebble-Vanquo-Tarnith line.

The Mandalorian warrior clans besieged and conquered many systems on the edges of Republic control, starting in the far-flung reaches of the Outer Rim. By 3964 BBY, the Mandalorians were steadily moving toward the center of the galaxy, leading Republic Navy Captain Saul Karath to throw up a defensive cordon known as the Jebble-Vanquo-Tarnith line. Heavy fighting occurred along that barrier, although the Mandalorians were not able to break through. One of the worlds in the line of fire was Suurja, an agrarian planet with a population of 16 million colonists. About four months after the Mandalorians' capture of the Republic Flashpoint Stellar Research Station, the invaders set their sights on Suurja."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mandalorians soon did battle with the Republic naval forces, commanded by Saul Karath, for Suurja.

Over the next few weeks, the Republic and the Mandalorians engaged in several more battles at Suurja.

In the release, Republic defense official Catronus Steffans was quoted as optimistically saying that the stalemate at Suurja represented a success of Karath's defensive cordon, and that it heralded an upcoming Republic pushback."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle of Suurja garnered its first, and thus far only, mention in The Taris Holofeed: Prime Edition, a short postscript to the 2006 comic Knights of the Old Republic 0.
