Republic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala spoke at the rally to a gathering of University of Commenor students. A part of her inter-planetary series of speeches in support of the Campaign against Republic Militarization, Amidala stated warfare was a product of cowardice, and further said that bravery was to let go of the easy, violent path, and instead engage in peaceful negotiations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 21 BBY[source?], Amidala's remarks were publically criticized by the Stark Veteran Assembly in a live interview on the Eriadu-based talk show, Essence, where Assembly Spokesbeing Laslo Dorits called Amidala's statement \"disgraceful, stupid and typical.\" Following criticism of her Commenor rally speech, Padm\u00e9 Amidala posted a statement at the HoloNet's Naboo message exchange, saying that she had great respect for defenders of their native soil, and that she too had a taste of war that she would never forget. Amidala then went on to say that \"needless warmongering of the type being conducted by alarmist elements in the Senate\" was what she did not respect. Nonetheless, war erupted several months later,[source?] and the era of general galactic peace came to an end."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Peace Rally on Commenor appears via hologram in HoloNet News Vol. 531 #45, which was released on February 28, 2002, and written by Pablo Hidalgo and Paul Ens.
