Their mission\u2014which was communicated in writing and never spoken, thus the name of the group\u2014was to assist doctors and surgeons in healing their patients simply by means of their presence. Members of The Silent always wore an identity-concealing osmotic veil when in the presence of the sick or injured, ostensibly to prevent transference of contagions. They never spoke, not even to each other, and took their meals in a private location. It was unknown how The Silent drew their strange power, but the evidence in their favor was startling. Those operating rooms and hospitals in which a member of The Silent was working experienced higher recovery rates than non-staffed facilities. Many believed that The Silent drew upon the Force, although the Jedi Order claimed no relation to The Silent."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
