When inserted, a restraining bolt restricted the droid from any movement its master did not desire, and also forced it to respond to signals produced by a hand-held control unit. Some droids felt sheer horror at the mere mention of restraining bolts. Restraining bolts were also used in the construction of Jawa ion blasters; they, along with accu-accelerators from a starship's ion engine, were fitted to the blaster's firing mechanism."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Droids could not remove restraining bolts from themselves or other droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sabine Wren would sometimes threaten Chopper with a restraining bolt when he was uncooperative."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
