In 8 ABY, he was placed in command of the task force assigned to liberate Kal'Shebbol. The planet was the capital of the Kathol sector, which was ruled by Moff Kentor Sarne, an Imperial officer who had formed his own empire following the death of Emperor Palpatine at the Battle of Endor four years previously. Rumors had reached the New Republic that he was in possession of exotic weaponry, and it had been concluded that Sarne's regime had to be eliminated. While a commando raid executed by Page's Commandos was conducted on the planet's surface to disable the planetary defense shield, the admiral led his forces into battle against Moff Sarne's forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the successful deactivation of the defense shield, the admiral pressed his advantage and completed the liberation of Kal'Shebbol. Sarne, however, managed to escape with the majority of his forces into the depths of the Kathol sector. With the New Republic in control of the planet, the admiral was contacted by Lieutenant Judder Page, the commander of the commando team that had deactivated the shields. He relayed information to the admiral that the rumors over Sarne's possession of exotic technology were true and requested resources to track Sarne down and neutralize him. The admiral, however, had to deny his request as he could not spare any ships. He had also been ordered to leave Kal'Shebbol in three days' time to rendezvous with Sarin Virgilio's forces in the Minos Cluster before heading to the Bozhnee sector to help Admiral Ackbar box in another rogue Imperial that was terrorizing the region.
