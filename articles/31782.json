Therefore, like all vehicles of the class, it had a length of 17.69 meters, a height of 6.54 meters, and could carry up to thirty passengers. The Crumb Bomber was armed with the standard chin-mounted dual laser cannons. It was normally flown by one clone trooper pilot, who was accompanied by a co-pilot. Large spotlights were occasionally mounted on the front for increased visibility at night. The Crumb Bomber, in addition to its standard red-and-white paintjob, sported nose art depicting a Kowakian monkey-lizard holding a missile, with \"laugh this off\" written in Aurebesh above the creature.
