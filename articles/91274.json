Skywalker's secret wife, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, as well as his Padawan Ahsoka Tano and several clone troopers, had been trapped inside an underground laboratory on Naboo after it was contaminated with an airborne strain of the disease engineered by Doctor Nuvo Vindi. Skywalker and Kenobi were able to retrieve the root relatively easily, but found their departure from Iego complicated by a LaserWeb Defense Station the Separatists had installed in the planet's moons before they abandoned the area. The system, known to the Iegoans as the \"Ghost of Drol\", had successfully destroyed any starships attempting to leave the planet for some time. With the help of repurposed battle droids provided by Cliffhold resident Jaybo Hood, Kenobi, Skywalker, and astromech droid R2-D2 were able to take down the laser web, freeing the Iegoans and allowing them to return to Naboo in enough time to save those still alive inside the laboratory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
