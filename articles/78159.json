They were incredibly competitive, and they responded well in the face of difficult puzzles or extreme adversity. However, when faced with easier tasks, they would often intentionally make it harder for themselves. Their love of games also had a distracting effect, so they were highly unreliable when it came to business matters or other jobs they considered unexciting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A number of Krish under the leadership of Bardron were in charge of the basic operations of the swoopdueling tournaments on Jervo's World around the time of the Mandalorian Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Note that The Essential Guide to Alien Species claims that the Krish are from a planet also known as Krish.
