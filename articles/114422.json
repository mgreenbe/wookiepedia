A section of a hidden Imperial communications outpost's landing platform on Endor was configured as a repulsor pad to allow it to be lowered to recover speeder bikes and repuslorcraft. Repulsor pads were also used on the planet Seltos to allow residential homes to hover in the air, connected to the ground by open-air turbolifts. Sinya Deboora's home, 12 Galactar Route, was suspended ten meters in the air using repulsor pads."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
