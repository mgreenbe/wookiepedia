At the same time Greyshade is meeting with his new partner Commander Strom, The Wheel's administrator who has secretly sent his Wheel Security Force to subdue Strom's troops and recover the money that they had stolen from The Wheel. And now that Han Solo is getting ready to enter the main event of The Big Game he realizes that Chewbacca is also entered in the contest, and according to the rules there can be only one survivor. Meanwhile on the planet Ultaar, Darth Vader finds the remains of a Rebel information retrieval team wiped out by the bounty hunter Beilert Valance.
