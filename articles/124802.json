He later served on the Rhommamoolian Senate as one of group leader Nom Anor's advisors on Rhommamool and became one of his closest associates, though Tinoktin remained ignorant of Anor's true nature as a Yuuzhan Vong agent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tinoktin was later present at a meeting in the Rhommamoolian capital Redhaven attended by former New Republic Chief of State Leia Organa Solo, Mara Jade Skywalker, their protocol droid C-3PO and the Noghri Bolpuhr. Following a missile attack on neighboring Osarian, Anor and Tinoktin fled Rhommamool in a disguised A-wing piloted by Tinoktin; Anor faked his death aboard the intervening New Republic cruiser Mediator using a primitive rocket-based shuttle packed with nuclear explosives, which was remotely guided by Tinoktin. Tinoktin later fell asleep in the fighter's cockpit, barely missing Anor's conversation with Yuuzhan Vong Prefect Da'Gara regarding the destruction of Sernpidal. Catching the final words of the discussion but not comprehending what had been said, Tinoktin assumed that Anor was merely preparing another speech."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 26 ABY, during a confrontation with Skywalker and Jaina Solo on Duro, Anor revealed that Shok Tinoktin had been well rewarded for his faithful service to both Anor and the Red Knights of Life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shok Tinoktin was largely unintelligent and ignorant, and was utterly unaware of Nom Anor's true allegiances to the Yuuzhan Vong, simply believing him to be a pro-organic radical. He was also afraid of Anor, dreading any scenario in which the Red Knight's leader would look on him with disfavor. He was lanky and reedy, and likened by Jaina Solo to a mouse."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shok Tinoktin was a reasonably skilled pilot, working overtime to guide Nom Anor's decoy rocket toward the Mediator so as to deliver its explosive payload.
