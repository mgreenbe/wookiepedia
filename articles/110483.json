He was equipped with a limited function vocabulator capable of speaking over 800,000 languages, and a SureDeal-R bargaining and negotiation logic initiator. RT-56/X was the partner of the farmer Biull Sangtwo, where the two would sell the droid to unsuspecting offworlders for a small fee that they would hope to capitalize on by reselling the droid.
