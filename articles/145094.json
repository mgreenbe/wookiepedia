MS-133 was part of the military forces under the command of Moff Kentor Sarne, a warlord who ruled the Kathol sector in the Outer Rim Territories. Led by Doctor Lancer Brunou, MS-133 conducted an archaeological expedition to the planet Aaris III with the intention of discovering why the native species had become extinct several thousand years previously. During their excavations, members of the team uncovered a strange artifact that began to manipulate their feelings, causing them to act in suspicious and homicidal ways. Attacked by the primitive descendants of the native Aaris, Theda was badly wounded by blaster fire. As the situation on the planet worsened, so did Theda's condition. By the time that the survivors were eventually rescued by the New Republic CR90 corvette FarStar, Theda had died."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 8 ABY, Doctor Theda served in the forces of Moff Kentor Sarne, the Imperial warlord who ruled the Kathol sector in the Outer Rim Territories.

The artifact\u2014known as the Plaque of Victory\u2014was an inanimate artifact that housed an entity that fed off of the life force of beings around it, causing them to become suspicious, paranoid, and homicidal. Soon, the Plaque began to influence the members of MS-133; the team started to feel like they were being watched from the jungle surrounding their base camp and generally ill at ease. A small contingent of the team's security detachment headed into the jungle to investigate but never returned, although blaster fire was heard in the distance. Theda, along with the rest of the scientific staff, was issued a weapon in case of trouble."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That night the base camp was attacked by the primitive descendants of the Aaris, the planet's native species, using energy weapon technology.

The call was intercepted by the New Republic CR90 corvette FarStar, and the vessel diverted to assist.
