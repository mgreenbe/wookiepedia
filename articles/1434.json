After her droid, C-3PO, managed to contact a Republic clone trooper, the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tranquility was dispatched and ferried Green Company to Rodia. Green Company, led by Commander Gree, landed in Rodia's Senatorial Palace via LAAT/i gunships and arrested Viceroy Gunray after linking up with Senator Amidala, Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks, C-3PO, and Senator Onaconda Farr. After the arrest, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine thanked the senators and Binks for their help via a hologram set up by clone troopers, and dispatched supplies to Rodia immediately."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Attack on the Tranquility"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Green Company brought Gunray aboard a Consular-class cruiser from the surface of the planet to the Tranquility. General Unduli and Padawan Ahsoka Tano accompanied Gunray as security, and when the cruiser docked with the Tranquility, Gunray was brought to the ship's brig with the help of Senate Commandos so that he could be interrogated en route to Coruscant. Separatist forces, however, quickly created a strategy to either kill Gunray or rescue him, so that Separatist secrets could not be revealed. Separatist Head of State Count Dooku dispatched his assassin, Asajj Ventress, along with a group of Separatist light starships. After some time of interrogation, three Droch-class boarding ships and Vulture droid starfighters attacked the Tranquility. Commander Gree, who was alongside the Jedi and Senate Commando Captain Faro Argyus when they felt the attack, contacted a clone naval captain in the bridge requesting a status report. Upon hearing of Separatist engagement, Commander Gree deployed Green Company to repel Separatist boarders. The three boarding ships all successfully breached through the Tranquility's hull and deployed B2-series super battle droids to the hangar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At least twelve members of Green Company, including Green Leader, initially went to the hangar to engage Separatist forces and attempt to stop them from spreading throughout the ship. During the skirmish in the hangar, Separatist forces prevailed and killed many clone troopers, including Green Leader. Republic forces ultimately failed in preventing Separatist forces from spreading, and the battle droids headed to the prison level. In the aftermath of the skirmish in the hangar, Ventress stealthily deployed from a boarding ship and encountered a Green Company survivor, who attempted to alert the rest of Republic forces of Ventress but was beheaded before he could warn them. As Separatist units advanced, the rest of Green Company retreated to the prison level, all while engaging battle droids in the ship's hallways. While 41st Elite Corps forces were engaging Separatist troops, Ventress rigged explosives on the Tranquility's reactor. The Republic WED-15 Treadwell droid 327-T conducted a perimeter sweep of the reactor room but Ventress managed to stay hidden. 327-T encountered a Clone Captain and a fellow trooper who arrived to check in with 327-T before Commander Gree called on them to head to the prison level. Eventually, Unduli and Green Company managed to destroy all Separatist battle droids, but sensed that their troubles were not over."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the attack, Padawan Tano had remained in the ship's brig with Captain Argyus and four Senate Commandos while Green Company, Unduli, and Commander Gree repelled the boarders. Ventress, however, infiltrates the brig and fights against Tano and the Senate Commandos, killing two and rendering Argyus and the remaining two guards unconscious. Unduli sensed the fight, and along with Gree and two other troopers, headed towards the brig and getting there just as Ventress freed Gunray and imprisoned Tano in a prison cell. Unduli ordered Ventress to surrender, but the explosive charges in the Tranquility's reactor room exploded, allowing Ventress to escape. Unduli ordered Tano to guard Gunray along with Agryus and Gree, while Unduli would pursue Ventress and the two clone troopers headed to another part of the ship. Unduli eventually managed to track down Ventress and engage her in a lightsaber duel, but was defeated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tano, who decided to defy Unduli's orders after speaking with Gree and Argyus, managed to rescue Unduli and continue to fight Ventress. Now having both Jedi occupied, Ventress sent Argyus a signal, which revealed Argyus as a traitor as he killed his fellow guards and engaged Gree. After fighting in hand-to-hand combat, Argyus managed to defeat Gree and free Gunray, fleeing to the Consular-class cruiser that brought Gunray onboard initially, while at the same moment, Ventress managed to evade Tano and Unduli and, after killing two troopers, use a Republic escape pod to rendezvous with the cruiser nearby. After the Republic defeat, Unduli and Ahsoka reported to Yoda and Anakin Skywalker about the loss as Green Company troopers stand guard on the bridge."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Attack on Geonosis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 41st was later sent to Geonosis to retake the planet.

Clone trooper \"Draa\" and the others encountered heavy resistance and  fell back with the 501st as Poggle unleashed the super tanks. Despite the tanks, the foundry was destroyed. They then took part in cleaning up the remaining forces on Geonosis and searched for Poggle. During the clean up operations, Unduli and clone trooper \"Buzz\" used BARC speeders to search for Poggle, eventually tracking him to the Progate Temple. There, Buzz was killed and Unduli was captured, although she managed to contact the other Jedi during her captivity.

During the broadside exchange, troopers of the 41st manned the cannons and many were killed when their stations were destroyed by Separatist fire, although the Guarlara was victorious from the broadside. Following the Battle of Coruscant, the 41st Elite Corps assembled at a Coruscant cruiser staging area as equipment and vehicles were loaded unto a Venator-class Star Destroyer and Jedi General Yoda arrived to command a sub-unit of the corps, the 41st Scout Battalion, before they were to be dispatched to Kashyyyk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 41st Scout Battalion arrived on Kashyyyk and unloaded vehicles and equipment, preparing themselves alongside the Kachirho Wookiee Militia to defend the city of Kachirho from Separatist forces.

Eventually, the Battle of Kashyyyk erupted and the battalion defended the beachhead against the Separatists, taking positions on the beach itself as well as the large trees surrounding the city as well as structures. In the midst of the battle, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine of the Republic, secretly the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, executed Order 66, an initiative that labeled the Jedi as traitors. Commander Gree received the message from Palpatine in the command center, and he and another trooper moved into position to execute Yoda. Yoda, however, sensed the betrayal of Palpatine and the deaths of his fellow Jedi across the galaxy, and beheaded Gree and the trooper before they could fire their blasters. The two Wookiees beside Yoda, Chewbacca and General Tarfful then helped Yoda leave the city."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the battle was over and day had turned to night, members of the battalion, which included ARF troopers on AT-RTs, hunted for Yoda but failed to stop him from escaping the planet.
