Han Solo recognizes the description of Kharys from his old smuggling days and decides to confront her on her home planet of Skye, but the Millennium Falcon is shot down over the planet by Imperials. Luke and Leia are captured and brought to trial before the Supreme Council of the Highland Clans, and there Leia is recognized as an enemy of the Empire but Luke is recognized as the son of their wingless brother and so the council decides to help the two Rebels. Meanwhile Han and Chewbacca have been captured by Kharys and questioned about what they know about Luke Skywalker. Luke and Leia along with their S'kytri allies attack the Majestrix's fortress and rescue Solo and his first mate. Kharys is killed in a lightsaber duel with Luke freeing Skye from Imperial rule."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In this issue Aragh says that, during the Clone Wars, Obi-Wan Kenobi and two of his students saved Skye from destruction. He said one student was Darth Vader and the other he identified by saying Luke wore his lightsaber, implying it was Luke's father. As Return of the Jedi established that Vader was Luke's father, this implication turned out to be impossible. The discrepancy was first explained in Star Wars Gamer 1 and later expanded upon in 2007 in the article \"Aliens in the Empire.\" The issue was also rectified in the 2015 story, SkyeWalkers: A Clone Wars Story."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During her duel with Luke, Kharys uses an ability that is similar to the stun/stasis Force power introduced in the Knights of the Old Republic video game."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following initial inconsistent publication dates, this tale is often collected between Star Wars 30 and Star Wars 31. However, Han Solo and Chewbacca are still on Orleon at this time and do not reunite with Luke Skywalker until the events depicted in Return to Tatooine, making this timeline placement impossible. A logical placement for this story is within the time gap in the early pages of Star Wars 35."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
