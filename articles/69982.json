The Jedi were the guardians of peace and justice in the Galactic Republic, and became perhaps the most well known of the various groups that relied on the Force for their power. Led by a series of Jedi Councils, the Order grew over the millennia despite facing many trials. Most often these threats were engineered by the Sith, the most prominent group of Force sensitives who wielded the dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During several Great Schisms, numerous Jedi broke away from the original Order due to differences in how they believed the Force should be wielded. The various impasses reached by the orthodox Jedi and the defectors led to several wars, including the Hundred-Year Darkness, after which the defectors were exiled and founded the Sith Empire. The Sith were eventually found by the Republic and their discovery led to the Great Hyperspace War, and a Sith invasion of Coruscant. The Jedi on Coruscant, led by Jedi Guardian Anavus Svag and Jedi Master Memit Nadill, successfully defended the planet and defeated the Sith. Again and again however, the Sith would be reborn from within the ranks of the Jedi Order, and many more wars would be fought. Additionally, the ancient Sith Empire had not been as completely destroyed as the Jedi believed, and over the next thousand years, it reformed and grew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A thousand years later, after the Great Sith War, the Sith Empire manipulated the Mandalorians into attacking the indolent Republic. The Jedi Council forbade the Order's members from participating in the following war, but two Jedi, Revan and Alek, garnered the support of many of their peers and entered the war on the side of the Republic. Prevailing after a long and bloody conflict, Revan and the Jedi who had followed him disappeared after the war's final battle. When they returned, they had turned to the dark side, and during the war that followed most of the Jedi Order was either destroyed or seduced by Revan's teachings. During the aftermath the Order was left numbering less than one-hundred Jedi. In light of this, the remaining members of the Jedi Council officially disbanded the Order. Shortly thereafter, nearly all the remaining Jedi were consumed by Darth Nihilus when they convened on Katar. However, the exiled Jedi Knight Meetra Surik defeated the Sith Triumvirate of Darth's Nihilus, Sion, and Traya, and reformed the Order with the help of the Lost Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "About three hundred years after the Jedi Civil War, the ancient Sith Empire had again become strong enough to directly challenge the Jedi and the Republic for control over the galaxy. The initial onslaught of the Sith Empire saw over half of the Republic's territory fall into Sith hands, but the Republic managed to check the Sith's advance in the Mid-Rim. After a time, the Sith Empire surprised the galaxy by offering a truce, which was accepted by the Republic. However, the Sith used the lull in the war to launch a surprise attack on Coruscant. The capture of the Republic capital allowed the Sith to extort many concessions from the Republic, and the resulting Treaty of Coruscant was slanted heavily in the Empire's favor. This began the Cold War, which lasted for about twelve years. Afterwards, the conflict began anew, and the Republic would eventually emerge victorious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Centuries later, the galaxy was again engulfed in a war between the Republic and the Sith.

After nearly three years, the course of the war swung in the Republic's favor, and total victory for the Jedi and the Republic seemed in sight. However, the war itself was simply the penultimate stroke of the Sith Grand Plan, orchestrated by the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, Palpatine, who was in fact a Sith Master. The Jedi eventually learned the truth, but could not stop the plan's execution; Palpatine turned Anakin Skywalker to the dark side and instigated the Great Jedi Purge. The Order was virtually annihilated by the Sith and betrayed by the Republic they had served for nearly all of its existence. Only a few survived the Great Jedi Purge. However, Anakin Skywalker, with the indirect help of his son, Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, eventually defeated the Sith, and Luke formed the New Jedi Order during the time of the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History of the Jedi Order"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Tython and Force Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many ancient and semi-legendary organizations have been proposed to be the forerunners of the Jedi Order, including the Order of Dai Bendu, the Followers of Palawa, and the Chatos Academy. Of all of the ancient Force traditions, though, the true origin of the Order was found on the lush planet Tython in the Deep Core. The galaxy's best philosophers, priests, scientists, and warriors were brought to Tython circa 36,453 BBY by mysterious, pyramidal ships called Tho Yor to discuss their discoveries involving the enigmatic and mystical energy known as the Force. These people, known as Tythans, eventually came to identify as the Je'daii Order, a group of Force-sensitives determined to keep an internal balance between the light side, or Ashla and the dark side, called Bogan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For millennia the Je'daii Order flourished on Tython, erecting great temples and monuments to the Force and remaining ever vigilant to the lures of both the light and the dark. Ultimately around 25,793 BBY, several hundred years before the founding of the Galactic Republic, a conflict arose between the followers of Ashla, or light side of the Force, and the followers of Bogan. Known as the Force Wars, the conflict was waged over the course of a decade and took a terrible toll on the planet, sending Tython out of balance and destroying the ecosystem. In the end, the followers of Bogan were defeated. The Je'daii enamored by the light side of the Force, or Ashla professed that it was stronger than the Bogan and the more virtuous path to walk. Abandoning the Je'daii teachings of balance, this splinter group began calling themselves Jedi and formed a Jedi Council consisting of the founding members; Jedi Masters Rajivari, Garon Jard, Cala Brin and Ters Sendon. Believing that they were given command over the Force in order to assist those in need, the Jedi wished to defeat those who used the dark side and vanquish all those whom they perceived as evil. During the Jedi's earliest days one of its founders, Master Rajivari, broke away and encouraged his followers to abandon the light and look to Bogan for guidance and power. Rajivari's followers were attacked by the Jedi Order. When the True Dark Sons were scattered and leaderless, the victorious Jedi Order decided to abandon Tython, taking with them all surviving text and scriptures they could find."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early interactions with the Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Traveling between the stars, the fledgling Jedi Order fled the Deep Core in favor of Wild Space, a wide swath of the galaxy which had yet to be explored. Discovering a verdant planet much like Tython had once been, the Jedi colonized the world and named it Ossus. Founding an academy on the world, the Jedi Order remained in seclusion on Ossus, devoting their time to the study of the Ashla and warning against the evils of Bogan. Having purposely distanced themselves from the newly-formed Galactic Republic, the Jedi Order welcomed members of other Force traditions to Ossus, merging their philosophies and assimilating many other groups into their fold. Carrying over traditions from the old Je'daii Forge, the Great Temple of Vur Tepe, the Jedi continued to craft durasteel blades as part of initiation ceremonies and imbue them with the Force. While these Force-imbued blades were the primary weapon of choice, the Jedi continued to work in secret to enhance the usability of a new weapon called the lightsaber. In the Order's final years on Tython, a mysterious man from beyond the system brought technology called a Forcesaber to the world. Through the study of the weapon, basically advanced off-world laser technology, the Jedi were able to \"freeze\" a laser beam which could cut through durasteel. By 25,000 BBY the Jedi agreed to join the Republic, remaining isolated on Ossus but supporting the Republic's goal of galactic peace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Order welcomed others to Ossus, the leaders of the Jedi began to be influenced by other thinkers who had been involved in galactic affairs much longer than they had. The most prominent influence was a group of Caamasi who preached the principles of justice laid forth by Hespecia Tik'kla; these teachings would lay the framework for the Jedi Order's view of galactic justice and their role as peacekeepers. At the same time, the Jedi High Council began to assert its authority over the members of the Order, limiting individuality and crafting several exclusionary regulations. Around this time a Kashi Mer exile named Xendor gained a large following on Ossus, taking counsel from a Steel Hand of Palawa named Arden Lyn and eventually breaking peacefully from the Order to found his own academy on Lettow. As the Order witnessed a surge in renunciates following Xendor, the High Council deemed the so called Legions of Lettow a heretical group which strayed dangerously close to studies of the Bogan and the outflow of students was deemed the Great Schism. Pushing Xendor and his band of schismatics into open conflict, the Jedi Order quickly formed an army with which to crush the Legions of Lettow. Xendor attacked first, landing ships on Ossus before being repelled and driven into the core. Xendor attempted to spread propaganda about the Jedi throughout the Republic as the war broke out, warning against the Jedi and their guise as peacekeepers. The Republic saw through Xendor's attempts to discredit the strange monks from Ossus and so began aiding the Jedi in the war effort. As conflict erupted on Chandrila, Brentaal, Metellos and Coruscant itself, the war dragged on and on. Finally, Jedi Master Awdrysta Pina managed to confront Xendor at the battle of Columus and slay the leader of the Legions. In the following months, the rest of the Legions of Lettow were routed and the Great Schism finally ended."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their brief allegiance with the Republic during the Great Schism, the Order was seldom thought of in the greater galaxy since their abandonment of Tython. Because of this the Order's warnings of impending war went unheeded by the Republic government until the Tionese were on their doorstep. As the Tionese War erupted across the Perlemian Trade Route, the Order's attempts to divide Tionese allegiances were abandoned and the Jedi withdrew again to Ossus to avoid involvement in the war. From their ancient fortress world, the Jedi contemplated the war, struggling to see how they fit into the galactic crisis at hand. After a long internal debate, the Jedi High Council declared for the Republic and entered into service as commanders in the Republic Army to crush the Tionese threat. As the war was all but won, the Republic sterilized the planet Desevro in an event which horrified the Order. Meeting above the ruined world, the Jedi struck a deal with the Republic that, while they could not serve the government, they would establish a network of watchmen to protect the Perlemian from the Tionese and Hutts from a series of fortress worlds including Ossus, Falang Minor, and Haashimut.

Officially known as the Recusal, the Jedi Order declared itself independent from the Republic in 11,933 BBY and completely withdrew back to Ossus. Throughout the next millennium, the Jedi Order fought an internal struggle regarding the correct response to the insanity of the Contispex dynasty and the Pius Dea rule it had established. While the majority of the Order refused to fight against the very government it had protected for millennia, some Jedi served as Knights errant, taking the fight to the cultists without the permission of the High Council. Others declared for the Pius Dea, forming a splinter group called the Order of the Terrible Glare.

The Jedi High Council joined with the Bureau of Ships and Services in seeding the cathedral ships of the Pius Dea with a crippling virus, and plotting to arrest the current Chancellor. In a stunning move, a Jedi strike team boarded Chancellor Contispex XIX's flagship, the Flame of Sinthara and arrested him on war crime charges.

The schism stemmed from the Order's reaction to a group of heretical Dark Jedi experimenting with forbidden alchemy. The monstrosities which arose were deemed abominations to the Force by the High Council and war was begun to end the practice of these dark arts. By this time the Order had managed to develop the lightsaber in a way in which it was useful in hand-to-hand combat. Used before as a siege weapon due to its massive power pack, the Order's scientists were able to create a transportable power pack which could be worn on the belt of the user.

Shortly after settling on Korriban, a splinter group of exiles, led by Remulus Dreypa, returned to Republic space to enact vengeance, but were intercepted by a Jedi patrol. The Jedi pursued those Sith across the galaxy, until both factions crash-landed on the planet Kesh. After a period of fighting, the two factions made peace and formed a new organization called the Doomed, striving to achieve balance between the light and the dark sides of the Force.
