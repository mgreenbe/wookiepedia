Jax was also responsible for the destruction of the Royal Guard, and had all but one of them killed off in a surprise attack on the planet Yinchorr.

Jax stood out among his squad as one of the best, and it was not long until Jax was recognized and removed from his squad to receive training to become a Royal Guard. Alongside forty-three other recruits, Jax was brought to Yinchorr, where the original inhabitants had been removed to provide the perfect training ground for the most elite warriors of Darth Sidious, who was publicly known as Emperor Palpatine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the roughest conditions, Jax was subjected to intense training that included mastery of the deadly fighting art known as Echani. This fighting style was supplemented by thorough instruction on the use of the force pike and the vibroblade, especially the double vibroblade. Under the watchful eye of Master Ved Kennede, Jax, along with the other recruits, would test their mettle and their fighting skills in a fighting arena known as the Squall. It was in this arena that Jax first met Kir Kanos, and the pair were often sparring partners in the Squall. Jax was almost always the victor in these encounters and loved to lord his dominance over Kanos. Both of them were trained early on by Myn Kyneugh."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Jax and Kanos were standouts in their class, another recruit was more highly praised for his perfect fighting technique and unmatched skill. Burr Danid was known as the best of the recruits when Emperor Palpatine arrived in an unexpected visit. Jax and Kanos watched as Palpatine's foremost disciple Darth Vader requested that their finest recruit join him in the Squall. Burr Danid joined Vader in the center of the Squall, and under observation from the Emperor, Vader ordered Danid to attack him, adding that he \"hold nothing back.\" Although Danid's technique and fighting form were perfect, Jax was able to see that Vader was just toying with the man. Vader mercilessly killed the young man in front of the entire audience of recruits. Although Kanos was shocked and appalled at the brutality, Jax looked on the event with a stone-cold demeanor. He understood perfectly the lesson that was being taught, and from that point on he trained ferociously to become the best among his class."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the initial number of recruits dwindled to a much smaller number, the remaining men were put into pairs to learn to rely on their \"brothers\" for support and aid. The trials and training took a drastic step up at this point so that the pairs would be forced to rely on each other to complete the tasks set before them. Jax was paired with another recruit, Alum Frost, with whom he lived and trained for an entire year. Jax did not fully respect Frost and attributed all of their success to his own efforts. Despite their inability to work together on the level of some of the other pairings, Jax and Frost were able to become one of the last two pairs to survive the intense training."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the end of a year together, Jax and Frost, along with the other two men, Kir Kanos and Lemmet Tauk, were brought before Master Kennede where he informed them that they had completed their training save for one final test. The final test was to be held before the Emperor himself. In pairs, the four men were to be brought before the Emperor two at a time. Jax and Frost were the first pair to be brought before the Emperor, where they were handed vibroblades. Face to face with the ruler of the galaxy, Jax and Frost were ordered to fight to the death to prove their worth to Palpatine. It was a one-sided contest, and Jax easily slew Frost. His training was complete."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Frost's dead body was removed from sight as the final pair entered the Emperor's chambers.

Left on Coruscant with the remainder of the Royal Guard, Jax came under the command of acting Emperor Sate Pestage, and later the Director of Imperial Intelligence, Ysanne Isard. When the Dark Lady Lumiya requested a detachment of the Royal Guard from Isard, Jax's unit was the one dispatched to the Dark Lady. Lumiya recognized Jax's Force potential, and began to train him as her Sith apprentice. The pair later tracked the Prophets of the Dark Side to their hiding place on Bosthirda and executed the last of them. During his training in the Force, Jax specialized in telekinesis and precognition. He may have also received training from other senior Dark Side Adepts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under Lumiya, Jax began to meet many of the higher-ups in Imperial politics. One of these associates was the ambitious Dark Jedi and Imperial Ruling Council member Sarcev Quest. Quest, a skilled political manipulator who had been working his way towards a subtle ascendancy on the Council for some time, saw Lord Jax as a potential figurehead and military commander, capable of providing forms of leadership that he could not: together the two Force-users moved to take control of the Empire. Using his influence on the Ruling Council, Quest gave Jax a task force led by the Star Destroyers Emperor's Revenge and Steadfast and a military contingent under the command of General Redd Wessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jax, a former soldier, preferred to surround himself with Army officers, as opposed to most Navy-based warlords. Also during this time, Jax assigned Lieutenant Geff Blim to serve as his 'hand,' recalling the services Mara Jade had provided for Palpatine. During this time he met with Nom Anor, later telling Lumiya of the strange agent. However, when Jax was killed, all connection between this agent and Lumiya was severed.

Jax knew that the time would soon come for him to square off against the Emperor. Jax and Quest planned to remove Palpatine from power and take the throne for themselves. Quest secured Jax's appointment as an Imperial Sovereign Protector, and from that position, he served as the fulcrum of a wide-ranging conspiracy. Under orders from Jax, General Wessel secured the support of several senior military commanders, influential civilian loyalists and alien leaders such as the Whiphid spearmaster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meetings to secure support for Jax's plan were treated with the utmost security. Any person that disagreed with Jax's plan or anyone that acted as though they would reveal the plan to Palpatine was immediately killed, often by the hand of Blim. Several times it seemed that the plan would be revealed, and that they would all be executed as traitors, but the quick actions and foresight of Blim stopped Jax's plan from being revealed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using the funds secured by Quest and Wessel, Jax bribed the Emperor's physician into sabotaging Palpatine's remaining clones. With the remainder of the funds, Jax was able to erase himself completely from the Royal Guard's database and any further assignments. The sabotage caused Palpatine's final clone body to age quickly and deform, forcing Palpatine to search for a new body. The Emperor was finally destroyed on Onderon, and although the efforts of R2-D2 resulted in the demolition of the Deep Core throneworld of Byss, Jax's plan had succeeded beyond what he had ever thought possible.

The troopers poured into the facility on Yinchorr, and although the Royal Guards were able to kill hundreds of stormtroopers, they could not hold against the numerically superior forces. One Royal Guard, Jax's rival Kir Kanos, was able to escape the slaughter, thus infuriating Jax. Knowing that Kanos's elite abilities could allow him to sabotage Jax's new rule, Jax ordered a massive bounty on Kanos's head alongside an immense detachment of forces dedicated to finding and neutralizing Kanos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Jax's backers swiftly seized power, with Quest taking control of a new Imperial Ruling Council with Jax's supporters as the new members. The Council allied with Jax as Dark Lord of the Sith and de facto Emperor. Wearing a modified form of Royal Guard uniform reserved for the master trainer of the Yinchorri Academy, Jax planned to continue the resurgence of the Empire and crush the New Republic once and for all. Although he at times commanded from the Star Destroyer Emperor's Revenge, Jax presided over his Crimson Empire from a villa on the Outer Rim world of Ord Cantrell. He continued to oversee the activities of the Imperial Ruling Council which, under Jax's leadership, included the unprecedented membership of several non-Human species: Whiphids, Defel, Givin, and Devaronian races were all represented.

To supplement his lost supplies of stormtroopers, Jax recruited the remainder of the Blackhole stormtroopers and subjected them to further training so that they would be able to defeat Kanos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Onboard Emperor's Revenge, Jax heard of an interesting report where one man had killed four Imperial officers and an entire squad of stormtroopers single-handedly in a tapcafe.

Unfortunately, on Phaeda, the incompetence of the local militia had allowed Kanos to escape once again. However, Jax also learned that while on Phaeda, Kanos had stayed with a group of Rebels under the command of Mirith Sinn. Jax's forces captured the military commander and subjected her to continual torture. Only Jax's personal Force-assisted torture was able to break the woman, and Jax learned that Kanos had fled to Yinchorr. Leaving Steadfast to bombard the Rebels into dust, Jax boarded Emperor's Revenge and set course for Yinchorr."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Thus die all traitors"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arriving above Yinchorr, General Wessel spotted Kanos' ship above the planet's surface and prepared to take it aboard.

Signaling for Blim to shoot Kanos, Jax was surprised to see Blim dead, the victim of two Rebels, Sish Sadeet and Mirith Sinn, the woman he had tortured on Phaeda. The two Rebels hoped to capture Jax and use his knowledge to end the war. With Blim dead, Jax tried to use Kanos's attachment to Mirith Sinn to turn the tide of the battle. Force pulling Sadeet's blaster to his hand, Jax prepared to shoot the meddlesome Rebel. Unfortunately for Jax, Kanos did not hesitate. Battering the blaster away with his vibroblade, Kanos thrust his weapon into Jax's chest. As the light faded from Jax's eyes, his last words were that Kanos's friend wanted him alive. Kanos replied coldly that they were not his friends. Removing Jax's helmet, Kanos told the dead Jax that he was not fit to wear it.
