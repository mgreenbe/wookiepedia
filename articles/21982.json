In 21 BBY, the Outer Rim planet Geonosis, site of the first battle of the war and homeworld to the Separatist-aligned Geonosians, once more became a threat to the Republic as Geonosis Archduke Poggle the Lesser rebuilt droid factories on the planet.

Since the Cerean had been captured during the opening battle of the war on Geonosis, he wanted to make sure that the defenses of the Geonosians would not be underestimated again. Aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Resolute in orbit over Geonosis, Jet; Mundi; Skywalker; Skywalker's Padawan, Ahsoka Tano; and fellow clone officers CC-2224 and CT-7567\u2014nicknamed \"Cody\" and \"Rex,\" respectively\u2014met to discuss the overall Republic strategy for an attack on the shield generator protecting Poggle's primary droid foundry. Jet and Mundi would attack from the north, while Kenobi and Cody would attack the center and Skywalker would lead the southern assault. The Republic troops were scheduled to rendezvous at a staging area called \"Point Rain\" near the shield generator and establish a defensive perimeter there.

The Republic landing forces met heavy resistance from enemy flak and Geonosian fighters. On Mundi's orders, Jet contacted Cody and told the commander to land his All Terrain Tactical Enforcers, which were being held aboard Kenobi's carrier gunship. Shortly afterward, the gunship containing Jet and Mundi was shot down and crashed to the ground. After being helped out of the destroyed gunship, the injured Mundi asked Jet for a status report. The commander reported that Kenobi was the only one to reach the staging area and told the General that Skywalker had also been shot down and had already engaged Geonosian forces on the ground, intending to reach the staging zone and Kenobi. After Mundi ordered Jet to load the wounded clone troopers into the AT-TE tanks, the Jedi decided that the troops would make their way toward a nearby ridge, which was located by the staging area."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rescuing Kenobi's forces"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jet's troops, including several of the remaining AT-TE tanks, advanced through a caltrop field en route to the ridge. Sitting in the back of an AT-TE tank, Jet contacted Republic Admiral Wullf Yularen via comlink to ask for air support. However, Yularen made it clear that the only thing he could do was give them the coordinates of Skywalker's position. Heading toward Skywalker, who was en route to Point Rain, Jet, Mundi, and their troops arrived at the bottom of the ridge. Since the AT-TEs were unable to climb the ridge, Jet left some troops to protect the tanks and ordered the forces to take the longer way around the ridge to the landing zone. The commander himself accompanied Mundi and the rest of the troops to a cave at the top of the ridge, which was a shortcut to the landing zone on the other side. Shortly after entering the cave, Jet and Mundi encountered Geonosian warriors and suffered casualties. However, the clones were able to fight their way through the enemy troops, using flamethrowers to dispatch the Geonosian warriors.

After finding Kenobi\u2014who had been injured after his gunship crashed\u2014the Jedi and their clone troopers convened for a short briefing on the situation and concluded that Skywalker would lead a small task force to disable the Geonosian cannons protecting the shield generator. Afterward, the tanks would advance and destroy the generator. The plan worked, and Jet informed Mundi of the success as soon as Skywalker and his group deactivated the cannons. After Mundi ordered the tanks to attack, the shield generator was destroyed by the concentrated fire of the tanks. Jet and Mundi traveled by gunship to the generator as soon as it went down, where they helped Skywalker's group capture Geonosian warriors. The main droid factory and many other foundries were destroyed, and the Republic eventually won the Second Battle of Geonosis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on the galactic capital of Coruscant, Jet sent a Jedi Knight on an assignment to eliminate a Geonosian super tank that had infiltrated and decimated the interior of a Venator-class Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a clone of Jango Fett, Jet stood 1.83 meters tall.
