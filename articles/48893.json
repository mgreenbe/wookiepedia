He had many jobs, many that were dubiously legal, and gained knowledge of business and starships. After accumulating a large amount of credits, he decided to settle down and start his own business. Cor'gril travelled to Trevi IV and bought a large starship garage that was going out of business due to competition from newer docking bays in the Trevi City Spaceport. Using his contacts from his travels, he obtained several ships and opened his business. He was well regarded by smugglers and free traders who appreciated the ships and services he provided."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his possession was the sabotaged yacht Firerider, bought from its previous owner Serdo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cor'gril was intelligent and polite.
