These were similar to subspace transceivers, but sent their signals through hyperspace, rather than realspace or subspace, giving them effectively unlimited range. They were, however, limited to video and audio communication, and very expensive for the everyday use of regular citizens."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Millions of hyperwave relay stations were tethered in static positions within hyperspace across the galaxy, giving rise to the term \"non-mass\" hyperwave transceivers, due to their lack of mass or size outside of hyperspace. These transceivers served as relay stations for messages sent across the HoloNet, and were responsible for sending Holonet messages across S-threads to locations all across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Notable users included the InterGalactic Banking Clan, aboard their Munificent-class star frigates, and the Galactic Empire, aboard their communications vessels.
