Unlike a normal blaster carbine, the double-barreled carbine did not have an autofire setting, however it could be switched to a \"double shot\" mode which allowed the weapon to fire two shots at the same time, targeting a wider area."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The double-barreled carbine had a close-range stun setting as well, meaning the wielder could switch the weapon to fire stun shots instead of lethal fire, however the close-range stun setting was limited to a range of only 9 meters. A double-barreled blaster carbine required a power pack to operate; after 50 shots, the power pack needed to be replaced. This weapon cost 1,200 credits to purchase, but its ownership and use was regulated by local authorities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The double-barreled carbine was a favorite among those who lived on the fringe of society.
