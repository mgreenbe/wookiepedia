Mako transmitted the order, \"Prepare to evade,\" to all members of the First Strike Element. Unfortunately, a few members of the element misunderstood him to say, \"Prepare to engage,\" causing them to jump the gun and attack the Carrack. Falan Iniro was among those smugglers. He barely had time to destroy a TIE/LN starfighter before he was face-to-face with the Vigilance, at which point its turbolasers lashed out and destroyed Take That! and all aboard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
