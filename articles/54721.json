One of these chambers, the closest to the barrel, contained a small pump and de-coagulation filter for over heated coolant fluid. The other chamber acted as a heat dissipation device. Coolant flowed through this section after being pumped and filtered and the hot liquid was allowed to cool by discharging heat into a special high-temperature mesh on the outer most portion of the secondary chamber. Eventually, the entire unit had to be allowed to cool as excess heat could actually melt the absorbent mesh, causing the device to fail."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
