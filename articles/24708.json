The technology relied on near-instantaneous transmission between programmable crystals. The need for only minimal internal computers cut the construction cost for such droids although the cost of programmable crystals proved high until Loronar began enslaving Tsils from Nam Chorios in order to accomplish the instant communication needed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
