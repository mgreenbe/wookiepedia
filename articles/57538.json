When one of the principal worlds under his control, Lianna, declared independence in the wake of the Battle of Endor, Gronn was aware that a shortage of TIE/LN starfighters would leave him in a precarious position as he was already short of ships and supplies. Lady Valles Santhe agreed to keep supplying Gronn with starfighters in exchange for no Imperial interference on Lianna. Gronn agreed reluctantly, and a special charter of secession was enacted. Lady Santhe also ensured Gronn's cooperation by paying him a hefty sum to prevent any military incursions on Lianna, although she warned him that any such actions would be met by the full military force at her disposal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
