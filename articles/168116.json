He then traveled Balmorra, recruiting members to carry out their own guerrilla tactics against the Imperials occupying their planet. After years of this, Zenith gained a hatred towards the Empire, especially Darth Lachris the Sith's governor, and became paranoid as well. He hated seeing fellow Balmorran citizens work with the Empire, and would often deny aid to citizens who did so. After all that Zenith had gone through with the Balmorran resistance he felt that he may be able to ensure that Balmorra remains free, once the Empire is no longer occupying the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zenith would later run in the election for the leader of the opposition to Tai Cordan. He gained the support of Secretary Varram and managed to beat Nalan Fiskin in the elections by releasing incriminating information about him found in the Gray Star's journals and by convincing Balmorran refugees on Alderaan to return home and participating in the elections, gaining the necessary extra votes. However, he performed his duties from the Barsen'thor's Defender-class light corvette."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later in 3626 BBY, following the Zakuulan Conquests, the rise and fall of the Eternal Alliance, the start of the Third Galactic War, and the creation of Task Force Nova, Lana Beniko informed the Alliance Commander of a shipment of turbolasers being produced on Balmorra that were to be shipped to a Republic base on Corellia.
