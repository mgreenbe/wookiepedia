The report was sent to Grand Consort Iliana Hilts, her mother and the wife of High Lord Varner Hilts. It dealt with the threat posed by the robber and vandal \"Death Spinner\", an enemy of the ruling Lost Tribe of Sith elite on the planet Kesh. This report was filed into the archives one week before his arrest and banishment from Keshtah.
