When the star M'dweshuu at the heart of the Si'Klaata cluster went nova, it released a large dose of radiation that reached Kintan. That caused mutation in the planet's indigenous species, and over thousands of years, it resulted in the evolution of the spine dragons. During the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, the Jedi Padawan Ki Sazen slew a spine dragon known as the Spine Dragon of M'dweshuu on the planet Tas-La, which led to a Nikto cult forming around her. The species was considered reasonably dangerous and was driven to extinction by the sentient Nikto species, who were also native to Kintan. Spine dragons were later popularized throughout the rest of the galaxy during the reign of the New Republic, by holo-serials created by the Human Xenoarchaeologist Henrietya Antilles, better known as \"Corellia Antilles.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Spine dragons were first mentioned in 1995 in Galaxy Guide 12: Aliens \u2014 Enemies and Allies, a supplement book in the Galaxy Guide series for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, a roleplaying game released by West End Games.
