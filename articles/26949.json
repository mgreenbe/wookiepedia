Composed of rock and iron, each sphere was filled with twisting tunnels. It was rumored that some scouts who had ventured into the spheres discovered wondrous machinery, while others were mysteriously altered by processes they could not remember. Some scouts were said to have never returned at all. It was widely believed that the spheres were created by the ancient race known as the Celestials."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ciratu Spheres were originally meant to be mentioned in the 2012 source book The Essential Guide to Warfare by Jason Fry and Paul R.
