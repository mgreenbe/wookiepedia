In addition to the vest's material resistance, it also produced a localized high energy ion field which distorted and disrupted energy attacks. However, this feature was very power-intensive, and the on-board power cells provided for only ten minutes of continuous use. The vest could alternatively be powered by capacitors built into the vest, which required a hour's charge but only provided two minutes' worth of protection. Some bounty hunters took to modifying the vest to run on a small power generator which increased the vest's time of operation at the expense of weight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
