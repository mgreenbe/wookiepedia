The mission was a success, and after escaping, Bane ordered his posse to disperse and go into hiding. Alama took his Flarestar-class attack shuttle to the planet of Florrum in the Outer Rim Territories. There, he was confronted by a small Confederate force led by a Neimoidian, and then a small Republic force under the command of Jedi Knight Aayla Secura."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is probable that Alama did not actually own this Flarestar-class ship, but rather, was borrowing it from Ohnaka.
