They were primarily used for faster-than-light communications, such as in hyperwave transceivers or hyperwave transmitters; however, such techniques had relatively short ranges, far shorter than the HoloNet. Hyperwave signal interceptors used hyperwaves to detect activation or deactivation of hyperdrives. Hyperwave inertial momentum sustainers used hyperwaves to stop interdiction fields."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
