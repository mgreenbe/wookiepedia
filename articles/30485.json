After consulting with the Jedi Council on Coruscant, it is decided that it would be safest to move the artifact there for storage. However, the Believers attempt a break-in to the Almas Academy, presumably to steal the artifact. This causes Master Qel-Bertuk to transport the artifact to Coruscant quickly and with subterfuge. A number of boxes of Mandalorian iron are transported to Coruscant in a number of starships, with only one containing the true artifact."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arrival on Coruscant the heroes discover that another of the ships traveling from the Cularin system has been attacked and so set out to recover its box."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
