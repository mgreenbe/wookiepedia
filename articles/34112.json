However, he also starts learning of the dark side of the Force after Gantoris' death. (Gantoris had been corrupted by the spirit of Exar Kun but turned against him; in revenge, Exar Kun burned Gantoris alive.) Exar Kun's spirit begins tempting Durron. Durron's power increases considerably, and he is tainted by the dark side and the lies Kun tells him of the history of the Jedi Order. After a violent disagreement with Tionne Solusar over ancient history involving the fall of Exar Kun, Durron assaults Skywalker. With the dark aid of Kun, Durron rips Luke's soul from his body, placing him in a coma. With his strength in the Force, Durron reaches out and guides the Sun Crusher from the heart of the gas giant Yavin and sets out on a mission of vengeance against Admiral Daala and the Imperial Remnant. He knows that his brother, Zeth Durron, is still part of the Empire, and he sets course for Carida, intending to rescue him by force if need be."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 2012 book The Essential Reader's Companion dates the events of Dark Apprentice to 11 ABY, following Jedi Search and preceding Champions of the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
