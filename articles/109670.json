It was a crystal structure, shaped as a pyramid and small enough to be held. It was designed to assist sentient beings with the formulation and understanding of complex mathematical computations. Though it could be used by anyone, it was attuned for use by species who possessed a hive mind. When activated, an inner light would shine forth and highlight selected numerals on its sides, and then allow the holder to complete the massive formulations within their own head."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Quilan Pyradex at some point came into the possession of Shiin's Library, on Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
