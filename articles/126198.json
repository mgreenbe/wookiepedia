Familiars were created by the Sith, an order of dark-side-wielding adepts. Such creatures were winged and possessed the ability to fly, and typically they had a wingspan of about 1.5 meters. Sith familiars were brought into existence via the application of Sith alchemy from information recorded on Sith scrolls and within Sith holocrons; the process was expensive and time-consuming, requiring some 10,000 of materials and alchemical apparatus to complete. The creatures were also fragile and easily damaged by combat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sith familiars were bonded to their creators via the Force, allowing the master of such a creature to experience the sights and sounds that crossed the path of his or her familiar. In addition, the master of a familiar could use the beast as a conduit through which select Force powers could be projected, as if the master was at the familiar's location. Abilities that could be channeled via a Sith familiar included the powers Drain Knowledge, Force defense, Force empathy, Force stealth, Hatred, Illusion, Telepathy, and the summoning of storms, although when a familiar was used in such a manner, the energy required to sustain the Force conduit sometimes could consume the creature, resulting in its death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith pioneered the creation of Sith familiars at some point during galactic history but were not the only culture to utilize familiars.
