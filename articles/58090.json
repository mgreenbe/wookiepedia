It became sacred to the Gungans, a sanctuary for troubled times. During the Trade Federation's invasion of Naboo, Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala was guided there by Jar Jar Binks to meet Boss Nass, and together they formulated a plan to retake their homeworld. After the Battle of Naboo, the Gungans took their fallen warriors to the sacred place. They invited Amidala to attend the funeral, though as there was no time the queen sent Eirta\u00e9 and Yan\u00e9 in her place."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
