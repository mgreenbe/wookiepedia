After settling on the planet, Izal Garsea started to attend a local academy to appease her father. Garsea spent most of her days on Eroudac at the spaceport, where she would board her family's light freighter, the Meridian, and fly it around the planet. The planet had a local law enforcement agency capable of issuing citations and granting landing permits. Izal's mother, Ixel Garsea, had been able to smooth-talk her way out of citations and get landing permits from Eroudac's police officers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the death of her parents, Izal Garsea took a Galactic Politics course at the academy on Eroudac. During the course, she met a fellow student and started dating him. The relationship ended after she met her boyfriend's parents, who did not care for an orphaned woman like Garsea, who had no social status on Eroudac and no aspirations of becoming a politician's wife. Sometime later, Garsea accepted a smuggling job from the academy's genetic science professor. She was set to travel to the planet Haneli aboard her starship, acquire some haneli flowers, and smuggle them off of the planet. During the job, Garsea was caught with the flowers, and decided to drop the cargo and to abandon her home on Eroudac rather than returning to face her professor."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Planning the future"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 34 ABY, Izal Garsea returned to the planet Batuu, where she reunited with her old childhood friend, Julen Rakab.
