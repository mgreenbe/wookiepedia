The book includes a foreword by producer Rick McCallum, introduction by actress Natalie Portman, and preface by writer/director George Lucas. An index of costumes, rather than an index of the book's contents, contains thumbnails of costumes from both the prequels and the original trilogy, the latter of which were not created by Biggar; however, only costumes from the prequels are detailed in the book. Many characters in the Legends continuity were first identified in the book."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The book was originally made available in two editions: a regular trade hardcover featuring only the book itself for 50.00 United States Dollars, and a deluxe edition featuring many other items, most notably fabric samples, including a piece of Darth Vader's cloak, from costumes throughout the prequel trilogy.
