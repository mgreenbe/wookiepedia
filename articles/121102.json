While initially developed for corporate scouts, the suit proved to be very popular among Alliance Special Forces Pathfinders. The suit provided lightweight protection to the scout and had an inbuilt equipment harness for storing supplies. It also had integrated macrobinoculars and breath mask with a 6-hour filter.
