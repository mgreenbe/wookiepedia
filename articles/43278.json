They were especially useful for disabling droids. These electromagnetic pulses were not quite as effective against organics, but were still capable of electrocuting or stunning lifeforms that had cybernetic enhancements. Detonations also temporarily disrupted the sensors and visual displays of a clone trooper's helmet systems for a few seconds, somewhat similar to the effects of the reverse-polarity pulse grenade. Since the clone commandos had a more electronic helmet, the effect on them would last closer to an hour than just a few seconds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When rolled at just the right speed, EMP grenades could bypass the shield of a droideka and disable it, making them more effective than blasters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Other anti-droid weapons that produced similar effects were the ion grenade and the electromagnetic pulse launcher."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "EMP grenades were standard-issue weapons for clone troopers and were used to disable battle droids of the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars.
