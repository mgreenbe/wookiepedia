Around 3664 BBY, Eadon was tasked with protecting a Republic political envoy under attack by Shae Vizla and her brother. During the course of the attack, Eadon killed Vizla's brother when the Mandalorian engaged the Jedi Master. Vizla later challenged Eadon to a duel, seeking to avenge her brother's death, but Eadon refused to fight her since he didn't take any pleasure in killing Shae's brother."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
