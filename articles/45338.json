The pair were successful in their efforts and detained Letta Turmond for having fed her husband explosive nano-droids, turning him into an unwitting suicide bomber. Skywalker and Tano captured Turmond and was taken to Republic military base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Turmond later asked for Tano. Suspicious of her motives, Padawan Tano sought to personally interrogate the prisoner in order to better understand the reasoning behind the murder of her Jedi compatriots. During the visit, Turmond began to reveal an apparent plot by another Jedi to orchestrate the bombing, before she could reveal the name of the attacker; she was Force chocked by Offee\u00a0; who hidden herself and framed Tano for the murder. After Turmond was killed, Commander Fox and others two troopers rushed into the custody, Tano was immediately placed under arrest on suspicion of murder. Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin believed her to be guilty, given that she was displeased with Turmond being placed under military jurisdiction. Tarkin then restricted visitors, especially Skywalker, who was forced to leave when he demanded to be let through."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The escape"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a brief stay in a cell, Tano noticed a security access card sitting on the floor just beyond the force field barring the door.

As she was answering her beeping comlink, Commander Fox emerged from a nearby doorway and seeing Tano among the unconscious clones, immediately assumed she was the guilty party and sounded the alarm. Instead of staying to face Fox, Tano ran, trying to escape the facility. After evading several clone patrols, Tano found three dead clones, apparently killed by a lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A chase through the facility ensued, with orders given by Fox to shoot to kill, until the arrival and intercession of Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex, at which point the troops were ordered to only fire stun blasts and capture Tano alive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hunt continued into the landing area outside the base and past the First Battle Memorial, with increasing numbers of troopers and LAAT craft giving chase. During the chase, as she deflected stun bolts, one clone fired a rocket launcher, knocking her off her feet. As she dropped her lightsabers, Tano retrieved one before continuing to run. Eventually, Tano found herself cornered, but was once more able to escape by cutting into a nearby piping system. She managed to evade the troopers before finding herself at the end of the pipe leading to a sinkhole towards the Coruscant underworld. Skywalker managed to find her, pleading her to come back, as escaping would only make things worse. However, Tano refused to be punished for crimes she did not commit and pleaded him to trust her as she trusted him while she finds proof of her innocence. As Rex and Fox caught up to Skywalker, Tano jumped onto a transport descending into the underworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
