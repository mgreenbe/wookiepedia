Star Wars: The Essential Atlas is a galaxy-spanning trove of vital statistics and information ranging from the astronomical and geographical (\"Systems, Sectors, Oversectors and Regions\") to the historical and political (\"The Sith Empire\" and \"The Great Hyperspace War\"). Encompassing the entire Star Wars canon, including all the films and The Clone Wars television series, plus the novels, comic books, video games, and more, this volume is packed with dozens of detailed maps and charts, as well as pertinent data and accompanying facts on."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From Hutt Space to the Unknown Regions, from the Knights of the Old Republic and Episode I to the Fate of the Jedi and Legacy era, Star Wars: The Essential Atlas is the ultimate gateway to space fantasy's most brilliantly imagined and endlessly intriguing galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dan Wallace assured readers of his blog that the book would be \"light years\" better than his previous book on the subject, The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons, which focused more on summarizing plots than on planetary descriptions.

Systems from children's books, the RPG franchise, Classic Star Wars, and the Marvel Star Wars series were included. Due to its scope and formal nature, the atlas focuses on showing star systems rather than individual planets; this is in contrast to some previous maps, which due to artistic license showed planets within a system as two separate locations. However, according to Jason Fry, systems may generally be labeled by the name of their most prominent planets rather than by actual system names, since planet names are usually more familiar to fans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Besides the aforementioned listing of planets, The Essential Atlas supplied maps on various factions and time periods, and was given an in-universe history lecture.
