When he told Merei Spanjaf about how he thought that he should visit Arihnda Pryce, Lothal's governor, to express his concerns about the Galactic Empire's poisoning of Lothal, Spanjaf replied that Pryce wouldn't understand. Holshef noted that his daughter had said the same thing, thus the reason he went into hiding instead. Holshef's daughter lived on Eriadu and Spanjaf arranged for her to meet her on Garel when it was no longer feasible for him to live on Lothal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
