Utilizing D-93 Incinerators to root out entrenched enemy positions and engulf any resistance, flametroopers were equipped with flame-proof armor and were feared for their ability to turn any battlefield into a blazing inferno."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Commonly known as \"toasters,\" \"hotheads,\" \"roasters\", or \"burnouts\" by Resistance fighters, First Order flametroopers were best used to flush out enemy entrenchments, with standard infantry firing on those fleeing the flames. One of the three main types of weapons specialists assigned to stormtrooper squads of ten, flametroopers and stormtroopers worked in tandem, as the faster stormtroopers could protect the slower and more methodical flametroopers while out in the field. Additionally, the flame created by the flametrooper required them to move at a slower pace to avoid entering their own blazes. When strategically deployed, they could deny cover to enemy forces along with supplying cover for allies with walls of flame that stormtrooper armor could withstand. In dry and flammable environments, flametrooper deployment could lead to a quick and decisive victory. Additionally, the flame itself was nearly inescapable when directed at an opponent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A standard flametrooper was equipped with a D-93 Incinerator that was a combination of a single, double-barreled D-93w flame projector gun and backpack that housed twin outer conflagrine-14 fuel tanks and a central pressurized propellant tank. The suit included a reinforced cyramech helmet with minimized openings, a narrow slit visor to reduce weapon glare, and supplemental breathing tank linkages. Other suit features included a temperature control body glove, integrated knee covers, articulated greaves for greater foot movement, and positive grip boots.
