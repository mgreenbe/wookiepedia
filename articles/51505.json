Though slightly more expensive than the standard protocol droids, they were favored by large corporations wishing to provide the customers service without taking up the time of biological employees. But the corporations soon found that GG-series droids were only a partial solution to that problem: the consumers largely resented the presence of these droids because for them they were simply another wall between a company and its consumers. As a result, the GG-series protocol droids were best received in environments where they did not replace biological employees but instead acted as go-betweens that escorted visitors to deal with a living representative of the company, such as GG-36 on the banking world of Telerath."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Corporations also used GG-Series hospitality droids in their corporate offices as receptionists, communications specialists and secretary droids for high-ranking executives until a scandal revealed that Adascorp had planted command routines in the processors of droids sold to other companies, allowing the hospitality droids to spy on their owners and report back to Adascorp."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
