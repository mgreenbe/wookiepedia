They specialized in the production of repulsorlifts and other propulsion systems. Their strength was such that they owned several orbital shipyards including a major ship producing platform above Duro. The company was incredibly prosperous under the Empire and maintained several expensive contracts under this government. After the Battle of Endor, the Empire ended almost all their contracts with Pri-Andylan, and the company began to suffer, eventually being purchased by the Corporate Sector Authority."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
