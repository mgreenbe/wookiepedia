Lucas stated that the scene requires little music, which should convey the conflict within Skywalker between the life of his lover, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, whom he was unwilling to let go of in his greed, and the greater good. Lucas and Williams further discussed about using a pre-established theme from the Star Wars saga. Lucas thought that a combination of \"The Emperor's Theme\" from Episode VI Return of the Jedi and \"The Force Theme\" from Episode IV A New Hope might work, and Williams replied that he himself liked the idea."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, a new motif, \"Padm\u00e9's Ruminations,\" was created for the scene. Featuring a chorus performed by London Voices, the motif is included in a track of the same name, in which the melody of the \"Ruminations\" motif is followed by the Palpatine's machinations motif. The last notes of \"Padm\u00e9's Ruminations\" in the track are interwoven with \"Across the Stars.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
