R2 used his rocket boosters to ferry himself and C-3PO aboard Grievous' ship, where a reception committee of battle droids awaits them, including this droid and a fellow B1 droid. At first, this droid was amazed to see C-3PO and R2 and asked where they had come from. A fellow droid then suggested they might be pirate droids. Hearing that, this droid told R2 and C-3PO they were under arrest.\nWhile at first C-3PO denied that he and R2 were pirate droids, after being prompted by R2, he admitted they were pirates. This droid then sent them to the incinerator room to be melted down for replacement parts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
