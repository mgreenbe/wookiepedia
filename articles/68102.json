During a severe drought, however, the Tulgah witch Morag captured the queen. Using evil magic to change Izrina into a being of literal fire, Morag unleashed the queen on the Wistie folk. The spell proved contagious, and soon the flammable creatures caused a large section of forest to catch fire. As the flames encroached on the Ewoks of Bright Tree Village, threatening their Soul Trees, Wicket Wystri Warrick doused Izrina with water and discovered that this cured her of her fiery affliction. The Ewoks then doused the other infected Wisties and squelched the flames with a special foam made by the shaman Logray while Izrina volunteered her people to guide the airdropping gliders around the dangerous convection currents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short while before the Battle of Endor, Izrina joined a party of Ewoks in their search for Catarine and Jeremitt Towani, who had crash landed on Endor and became separated from their children, Cindel and Mace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Izrina was attracted by a magical candle that Logray had presented to Cindel Towani.
