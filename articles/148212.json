The camp was near a waterfall on the river and its three main buildings were set up on islands. Its defenses consisted of turret droids and a flotilla of Patrol Boats and Single Trooper Aerial Platforms patrolled the area. A pylon with a deflector shield generator blocked access to further down the river. The camp was raided and its prisoners freed by members of the Naboo Resistance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The prison camp appears in the twelfth mission of the 2001 video game Star Wars: Starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
