However, the trip was delayed as the rebellion's stolen Imperial cruiser-carrier did not have enough fuel to make the journey, and so the Spectres traveled to Horizon Base to steal the fuel. There, one of the rebels, an astromech droid named \"Chopper\", was separated and stowed away aboard an Imperial cargo ship. He soon befriended a protocol droid name AP-5 and together they managed to steal the vessel. Upon hearing the rebels planned on stationing their base on the moon of Berzite, AP-5 warned them the Empire had recently set a trap there for the rebels by blockading the planet, the droid instead recommended the planet Atollon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
