It was the location of some of the largest factories in the galaxy, where droids, foodstuff, and starship parts were produced. The Industrial District was the site of giant packing plants, where nerfs and other species of livestock from across the galaxy were slaughtered, processed, and carbon-frozen for distribution to thousands of star systems. Organized crime often used these businesses as legitimate fronts: Haugg Nerf Industries served as a front for the organization of crime lord Groff Haugg. The Industrial District also contained the Coruscant Industrial Zone Detention Center."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 32 BBY, the bounty hunter Jango Fett infiltrated Haugg Nerf Industries to question Haugg on his connections to the Bando Gora cult.
