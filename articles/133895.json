Published by IncrediBuilds, a division of Insight Editions, each deluxe set includes a 32-page hardcover guidebook on the subject and a wood model to be assembled. Regular editions are also published, containing the same model and guidebook, but in a paperback edition. The models are designed for ages 12+ and require no glue or tools. The guidebooks contain a detailed look at the subject matter, with a majority of each book looking at the material from an in-universe perspective through text and images, but also containing a behind-the-scenes section to describe how the title subject was developed and created for filming in the real world. A final spread in the book details how the model may be painted and customized."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Books"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
