After more funding and arms came into their hands they began to take territory, capturing the worlds of Nooli and Galboron, among others, and even pushed into the outskirts of Bothan Space. In response the Empire sent a task force under Captain Par Lankin who soundly defeated the raiders at the Battle of Galboron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of its impact during the early Galactic Empire, the Noolian Crisis and its battles was frequently used as part of an entrance exam for the Imperial Academy.
