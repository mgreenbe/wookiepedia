Based on Hyrotii Corporation's Zebra starfighter, the fighter was heavily modified by the Confederation for their needs. Chief among the modifications was the addition of a bio-plasmatic gel launcher, which carried a magazine of three bio-plasmatic gel torpedoes. The fighters could be carried aboard Qektoth attack cruisers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
