It was considered one of the most powerful blaster pistols in the galaxy, delivering massive damage at close range; however, it overheated quickly. There existed a carbine variation of this blaster including an extended barrel with the existing flash-suppressor and an attachable stock. This was used by Tobias Beckett in the trenches of Mimban before he deconstructed his DL-44 and gave it to Han Solo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
