In 4 ABY, the Mining Collective rounded up the citizens of the town for labor, with one man, Sheriff Cobb Vanth, stealing a camtono of silicax oxalate crystals from them before fleeing into the desert. Vanth eventually encountered a Jawa sandcrawler and traded the crystals for a set of Mandalorian armor. Soon after, the miner and representative of the newly-established organization Red Key Company Adwin Charu arrived to barter with the Jawas. When Charu tried to claim the armor for himself, Vanth shot him before leaving. Returning to Mos Pelgo, he single-handedly liberated the town from the Mining Collective. He became the de-facto mayor and protector of the town."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The city became known as Freetown and was the site of a battle between the Red Key Raiders and Vanth's allies. Later, Vanth defended the people from Tusken Raiders, who attacked their village. By around 9 ABY, the town was once again known as Mos Pelgo. The Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin traveled to Mos Pelgo searching for another Mandalorian. After meeting Vanth, he acquired his armor after helping him slay a krayt dragon that had been killing Mos Pelgo's livestock."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
