Though he was an old friend of Jedi Master Even Piell, during the Red Iaro peace-talks on Malastare, Zash participated in an Iaro-led assassination attempt on the lives of their Jedi councilors. During a night-time air taxi ride, he attempted to kill a number of Jedi Masters, including Mace Windu, Adi Gallia and Even Piell, with thermite bombs strapped to his chest. The plot failed when Piell sliced the air taxi in two with his lightsaber, separating the Jedi from the terrorists moments before the bombs exploded, killing Zash and his accomplice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Piell reflected sadly that Prince Sooflie must have been a bad monarch indeed, to have made a loyal soldier like Zash turn against the royal family."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
