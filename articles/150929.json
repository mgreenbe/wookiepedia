It had inverted wings and was equipped with a four-stage primary thrust sequence. This model was known to have problems with its reservoir-locking mechanisms, which often stuck in one position and stopped the landing gear from fully extending or retracting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though replaced by newer models by the time of the New Order, U-33s could still be found in operation on outlying worlds during the Civil War.

Despite this, Han managed to bring the vessel to a perfect landing, though he scared his instructor almost to death in the process.
