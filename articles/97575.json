It was edible by the Ikkrukkian Jedi himself, as well as the other residents of the outpost, the human Padawan Bell Zettifar, the Twi'lek Loden Greatstorm, the Tholothian Indeera Stokes, and Ember, a charhound the outpost's Jedi had adopted. As its name indicated, the stew contained nine different kinds of eggs. Engle would only reveal what five of the eggs were, which Zettifar suspected was because the sources of the remaining eggs were either rare or disgusting. Stone peppers were another ingredient. Yellow in color, it was sometimes served as part of breakfast. The stew was a favorite of Zettifar's during his time at the outpost, and he usually ate at least two bowls of it when it was served. The Jedi of the Elphrona Outpost ate a breakfast which included Nine-Egg Stew just before they were summoned to rescue the Blythe family from Nihil kidnappers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nine-Egg Stew appeared in the 2021 novel The High Republic: Light of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
