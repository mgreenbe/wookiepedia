The government of the Chiss Ascendancy was an oligarchy based on Nine Ruling Families, with the Syndicure and Aristocra composed of high officials from the Ruling Families and lesser but still influential Great Families. As with much of Chiss society, Chiss families were highly hierarchical. Chiss families had a hierarchy of political ranks as well as social or family ranks. Family ranks applied to all family members. Families' political hierarchies applied to those who worked in politics, policy, and public service; and by extension, those affected by the decisions of family officials. The head of a Chiss family was called the Patriarch, and did not need to be male. The name of one's Chiss family formed the first component of a Chiss name, such as \"Mitth\" within the name \"Mitth'raw'nuruodo\", and also the first part of one's core name."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The process of a Chiss joining a new family (and also leaving their old one) was called rematching. Members of the Chiss Defense Force were recruited from every Chiss family. Conversely, Chiss families would often recruit promising young students, cadets or even officers to join their families. Family politics were not supposed to affect Defense Fleet business in any way. The desire to separate Fleet operations from family politics was so ingrained that, upon promotion to Flag rank, Officers of the Chiss Defense Force were stripped of their family ties, regardless of what their rank within their family had been. This was done so the upper echelons of the Defense Force would not be swayed or biased by family favoritism or rivalries. Nevertheless, the Syndicure sometimes meddled in Defense Force affairs, often with the covert participation of members of the Defense Hierarchy Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chiss Great and Ruling families typically possessed \"family fleets\", which functioned as planetary defense forces for planets affiliated with that family. In certain cases, Chiss families could declare family emergencies and bring officers and warriors directly from the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet to staff their family fleets and defend their interests. Clever manipulation of ambitious mid- and low-level Chiss civilian officials of three Great Families into declaring such emergencies nearly led to a civil war in the Chiss Ascendancy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thousands of years prior to the Clone Wars, Chiss families were simply groups of people related to each other by blood and marriage and closed to people not related or married to the family. Chiss family Patriarchs saw such arrangements as leading to decline and stratification. Dissatisfied with the perceived limitations of such a family system, some Patriarchs began to explore ways to recruit Chiss into their families not involving marriage. Those experiments yielded the Chiss family system as of the last year of the Clone Wars, where Chiss prospects could be brought into a family as merit adoptives and those who proved themselves worthy could rise to the rank of Trial-born or possibly even ranking distant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Organization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chiss families were organized in several different ways, both within and between the various families. Family officials could invoke so-called \"family secrecy protocols\" to prevent members of their families from disclosing sensitive information relevant to their family's interests."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Family ranks"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order of least to greatest privilege and prestige within a family, Chiss family ranks were:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most Chiss who joined a family via rematching did so as merit adoptives, although it was not unheard of for highly sought-after individuals to be invited to a family at higher ranks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon promotion to Flag rank (Commodore or higher), Chiss officers were stripped of family ties. Ozyly-esehembos were also removed from their family of birth at a young age, being a member of no family during their tenure among the Sky-walker corps. However, upon their departure from the corps, former sky-walkers were sought for recruitment by many families as a sign of prestige."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Political ranks"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Families and the Ascendancy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chiss Ascendancy was ruled by Nine Ruling Families of high prestige, power, wealth and influence. Below them were the still-influential but less powerful \"Forty Great Houses\", commonly called the Great Families. Families that were neither members of the Ruling Families nor the Great Families had much less power, prestige, and political influence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Common to Chiss culture was a strong sense of obligation to one's family and a desire to bring the family honor, glory, and power. This was attitude was prominent among high-ranking family officials such as Syndics and Patriarchs, but often also among Chiss who joined a family from another, lower-status family."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Family politics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Family politics\" referred to rivalries, competition, alliances and partnerships among the Ascendancy's families. Family politics often dominated decision making in the Ascendancy, although it was frequently not given as the official reason for taking courses of action. Giving an official reason apart from family politics was particularly prevalent among military matters decided by family politics, as the Chiss Defense Force was supposed to be beyond the influence of family politics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many Chiss remarked that Mitth'raw'nuruodo, while a tactical genius in terms of combat, was completely oblivious to the nuances of politics. At times, some officers such as Laknym would wonder whether Thrawn was \"playing politics\", to which their superiors such as Ufsa'mak'ro would reply that Thrawn didn't even understand politics. Years later, many Imperial personnel would have similar thoughts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Family fleets"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each Chiss Ruling and Great Family had a fleet of warships used as planetary defense forces for planets affiliated with that family. Each family's fleet had particular types of warship design, and officers and warriors of the Expansionary Defense Fleet were trained to know their family's vessels' strengths and weaknesses well. Ruling Families were permitted much larger and more modern fleets than Great Families, and in the event of a Ruling Family's demotion to Great, they would lose the right to the majority of their fleet and the most advanced craft. Nevertheless, Great Families retained fleets for planetary defense."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Great Family fleets included the Xodlak fleet, the Coduyo fleet, and the Pommrio fleet. Family fleets were typically used for smaller-scale engagements than the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet would be deployed for, and in certain cases consisted of vessels at least one-hundred years old."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each family's warships had their own set of unique peculiarities in their design and operations, and each family emphatically taught its Fleet warriors about their family fleet's strengths and weaknesses. This came in handy for Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo at the skirmish above Hoxim, where he employed Xodlak, Pommrio, and Erighal soldiers under his command to target their own families' ships with \"a maximum of ferocity and a minimum of actual damage,\" a tactic that had been dubbed a \"light show\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
