The escort shuttles were part of a defense force for Science Station Youst, an XQ1 Platform that was officially a science station, but was also secretly a weapons lab. The station fell under attack by Ripoblus forces as retaliation for an attack on a convoy by Dimok raiders. The station called for assistance and Imperial forces under the command of Harkov arrived to intervene. After discovering that Youst was a secret weapons lab, as accused by the Ripoblus, the Protector decided to disable the station and capture it. The two escort shuttles attempted to stop the operation but were both destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
