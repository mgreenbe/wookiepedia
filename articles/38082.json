Originally an admiral in the Fourth Battle Group, Scaur was appointed Director of New Republic Intelligence Service when General Airen Cracken retired. While frail looking, he had a very commanding voice. Scaur worked with Alpha Blue and the Chiss to form Alpha Red, a bioweapon designed to attack the Yuuzhan Vong at a molecular level. The Jedi and a number of government officials opposed this, and Cal Omas was persuaded to halt the project after the victory at Ebaq 9. Scaur was quietly forced to resign by Omas after the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar and the end of the Yuuzhan Vong War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dif Scaur was mentioned in the original N.R.I.
