Her husband worked as a tailor in the city of Tahv. Eventually, he placed their daughter under the tutelage of a prominent teacher and geologist, Adari Vaal, a neighbor of theirs. There, her daughter learned controversial theories about the formation of Kesh's continents, contradicting the prevalent Keshiri religion.
