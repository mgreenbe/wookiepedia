The Pau'an male known only as the Grand Inquisitor, who was once a Jedi Temple Guard, held the title of Grand Inquisitor and reported to Darth Vader, a Dark Lord of the Sith and apprentice to the Emperor, Darth Sidious. He was higher ranked than other Inquisitors, such as the Second Sister, Fifth Brother, Sixth Brother, Seventh Sister, Eighth Brother, Ninth Sister,  and Tenth Brother, trained in the arts of the dark side of the Force and lightsaber combat. In order to understand his Jedi opponents, he studied the records of the Jedi Archives from the Imperial Palace\u2014which had previously been the Jedi Temple. This gave him an advantage in combat, as he was able to understand Jedi fighting styles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Age of the Empire, the title of Grand Inquisitor was held by a Pau'an male who reported to Darth Vader. This Grand Inquisitor was dispatched by Vader in order to find Force-sensitives and either recruit them to the dark side of the Force or eliminate them. In this capacity, he hunted the rebel cell that operated on the Outer Rim world of Lothal in an attempt to destroy their leader, the Jedi survivor Kanan Jarrus, and his Padawan, Ezra Bridger. This hunt, however, ultimately led to his death during a confrontation with Jarrus. The Grand Inquisitor allowed himself to die during this lightsaber duel, knowing that his failure to destroy the Jedi would incur a far greater suffering from Darth Vader than death. The death of the Grand Inquisitor subsequently left the position open, with the remaining Inquisitors vying to attain the rank. At least two, Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister, sought to do so by hunting the man responsible for his death, Jarrus, and his Padawan, as well as prime target Ahsoka Tano, another Purge survivor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Darth Vader still had use for the Grand Inquisitor, trapping his spirit on Tempes in the Outer Rim, where he served as a guardian over an abandoned Jedi outpost. It was here that he engaged in a duel with Luke Skywalker, who was looking for an ancient lightsaber, but lost. Vader arrived shortly after, displeased with the Grand Inquisitor's failure. Before leaving, the Grand Inquisitor asked Vader what his fate would be, if there was a chance he could be released. Vader dismissed this idea, calling the Grand Inquisitor a tool for his own purposes. The Grand Inquisitor lamented over his fate, speaking of how there were worse things than death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Inquisitor who held the rank of Grand Inquisitor was a villain created for the animated television series Star Wars Rebels, and he made his on-screen debut in the 2014 television film Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion.

The Grand Inquisitor appeared in a number of episodes until his death in the season one finale, \"Fire Across the Galaxy,\" but the rank of Grand Inquisitor was never referenced in the first season.
