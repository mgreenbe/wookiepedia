The cessation of the drones' transmissions was noticed by communications technician Motto Shemson, who alerted Commander Gingal, the watch commander. Gingal called for an evacuation in the twenty minutes before the Imperial forces reached the base, but Wing Commander Pash Cracken burst into the control room to warn the senior officer that the Imperials would be able to listen to Rebel transmissions once they launched. He suggested that, to counter it, Rebel crews be briefed in advance to subtract two from the second digit of the exit vector coordinates that would be transmitted\u2014a deception that would throw off Imperial pursuit. Gingal agreed to the plan, increasing the second digit of the transmitted vector by two."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cracken led his flight group into the air and against the enemy's Victory-class Star Destroyer.
