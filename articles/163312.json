A sensor device designed to detect power cells and other commonly used weapon profiles, the data was then transmitted to a dedicated computer for virtually instant analysis. Weapon detectors were used in a broad range of locations with restricted access, such as military bases, spaceports, prisons, detention centers and other restricted areas.
