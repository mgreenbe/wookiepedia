This deployment included Blizzard Force, a group of All Terrain Armored Transports directed to destroy the deflector shield generator at Echo Base. As his men prepared their defenses, Callum spotted the walkers with a pair of macrobinoculars from Echo Station 3-T-8 and reported the vehicles' approach back to Echo Base. During the ensuing battle, Callum ordered his troopers at Outpost Beta to focus fire on the enemy walkers, which took no penetrating damage to their armor.

By that time, Callum received word from scouts that snowtroopers were approaching his position. The sergeant major marched along the trenches as the cheering died down, informing the other rebels of the incoming Imperial troops and ordering that the defenses keep the Imperial forces from passing the trenches. Callum's troops were able to decimate the snowtroopers of Blizzard Force using anti-personnel batteries, but were soon forced into a full retreat. Ultimately, the Empire successfully destroyed the shield generator and claimed victory on Hoth, but not before the Alliance managed to evacuate large amounts of its personnel.
