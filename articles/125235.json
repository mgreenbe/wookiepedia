The faction was part of a hierarchy of Force-sensitive factions that made up all of Bosph government and ruled over the planet. Each faction would take any Bosph found to be Force sensitive, known as ela b'Yentarr, at a young age and apprentice them to a member of the group, with each faction training their members in different aspects of the Force. The sickhealers specialized in Force powers which would aid them in healing such as Force healing, Control Pain and Control Disease. Like most ela b'Yentarr many sickhealers were killed during the Imperial bombardment of Bosph."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
