In it, he proclaimed himself Emperor of the galaxy, legalized the extermination of the Jedi Order, and outlined his vision of transforming the thenceforth-abolished Galactic Republic into his new Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The anniversary of the Declaration of a New Order was celebrated as Empire Day."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Full text"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Reactions to the speech"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the speech received unanimous signatures in support of transitioning the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire, the speech itself had mixed reception. Several of the senators were in support of it because it meant a chance at a time of peace after three years of the Clone Wars and the carnage that occurred. Several of these senators also felt it would solidify their power base. Others, notably the senators who signed the Delegation of 2000, personally disagreed with the speech, but felt the need to support it for their own safety, because of armed men inside the room who would shoot if they dared speak out. During the speech, the Naboo senator representing the Chommell sector, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, mused that \"to thunderous applause\" was \"how liberty dies\". Mon Mothma, the Chandrilan senator and later one of the top leaders of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, also reflected later on that she never believed a word of Palpatine's speech, especially his remarks about the Jedi trying to commit treason against him, and also expressed disgust at the fellow senators applauding Palpatine's \"silver lies.\" The full text of the speech was eventually printed out during the Republic HoloNet News Special Inaugural Edition 16:5:241, which was ultimately the last HoloNews broadcast. The speech was also frequently excerpted within the official field guide for the Imperial Military, the Imperial Handbook: A Commander's Guide, released nineteen years after the Declaration. Palpatine, in his introduction to the Imperial Handbook, likewise admitted that the Declaration of a New Order and likewise the resulting shift from the Republic to the Empire was an unprecedented shift of power in galactic history, but also mentioned the people had been desperate and that the Republic could not continue on its current course, and also implied that he acted on the people's behalf when he made the decision for the Senate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some elements of this text contradict the text found in the novelization of the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, such as the \"Safety, security, justice and peace!\" chant.
