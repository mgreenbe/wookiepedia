At some point, Haffa accompanied the liner Salin Mariner on a luxury cruise. During the voyage, the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka attempted to kidnap several high-profile passengers aboard the vessel, by staging an explosion aboard the ship and then trying to deceive his targets into accompanying him into an escape pod.
