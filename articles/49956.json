An ability once possessed by all Jedi, in the final years of the Galactic Republic before its transformation into the Galactic Empire, it had grown rare. Some Sith, as Force users, were also capable of experiencing Force visions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their prophetic nature, Force visions were not absolute in their content and could be left up to much interpretation, with the emotions of the witness potentially clouding their judgement on the issue or otherwise causing them to misread the vision. Some Jedi attributed this to the future constantly being in motion, with the visions merely warning of what could happen. As such, visions were treated with great caution by the Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While she was a Padawan, Mirialan Jedi Knight Vernestra Rwoh developed a tendency for having Force visions while travelling in hyperspace, which she called \"hyperspace visions\" as a result. They stopped after her Knighting, but she later had one of a Nihil attack on Tiikae shortly before the starship she was travelling on was diverted to assist there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the Clone Wars, the Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas had foreseen the galactic conflict, but his ideas of raising an army in defense of the Republic had been dismissed as too extreme, leading to his dismissal from the Jedi High Council. Undeterred, Sifo-Dyas pursued his vision anyways, secretly ordering a clone army from the Kaminoans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Master Yoda was able to see into the future, though he understood that Force prophecy was not absolute and that the future was always in motion. His visions led him to foresee the fall of the Jedi in the Clone Wars and even his own death. Yoda once even had a vision of the exact moment Order 66 was issued, but factors including the brevity of the vision, the Jedi Master's wariness towards such visions, and his uneasiness about the clone troopers' genetically-encoded desire to be obedient prevented him from realizing the true import of the brief glimpse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin Skywalker had extremely powerful Force visions in his dreams when asleep, and his visions were never known to be wrong. He foresaw the death of his mother following terrible torture by Tusken Raiders and was unable to stop it, and she died in his arms. Later, he witnessed through the Force his own wife's death in childbirth and was determined to prevent it happening. However, he neglected to remember the fact that such visions were not absolute; only that what he saw was what might happen. Skywalker fell to the dark side and became Darth Vader to try to prevent it, but instead he caused it to happen; when his wife discovered what he had done, she was horrified and wounded by her husband in his rage, subsequently dying for medically unexplainable reasons after delivering her children."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi General Pong Krell, during the Clone Wars, foresaw the Jedi Order's destruction and the Republic being \"ripped apart from the inside\" to become the Galactic Empire. This caused Krell to fall to the dark side and begin sabotaging his campaigns in an effort to become Count Dooku's new Sith apprentice and forge his place in the \"new order\" he saw coming. However, Krell was unmasked as a traitor during the Battle of Umbara and subsequently arrested by the 501st Legion. Krell tauntingly explained his vision to Clone Captain Rex as he assumed the Umbarans would free him if they captured the base, but the clone troopers chose to execute Krell due to that precise danger, which ultimately never transpired."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the end of the Clone Wars, Maul had a vision of Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side and transformation into the Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious. In an effort to prevent Sidious from turning Skywalker into his apprentice, Maul orchestrated a civil war on Mandalore, hoping to draw him out and kill him along with Obi-Wan Kenobi. Ahsoka Tano, Skywalker's former Padawan, later had a vision of Skywalker's fall as it occurred, but only realized that \"something terrible\" had happened, and the issuing of Order 66 meant she had no further time to think about the vision as she was immediately thrown into a fight for her life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Depa Billaba was able to receive visions during meditation and to pass them on through touch to her Padawan, Caleb Dume. This gave her enough forewarning to fend off her clone trooper battalion long enough for Dume to evade Order 66. Dume was taught that visions were difficult and nearly impossible to interpret; one's emotions could cloud them and it took training and discipline to see things clearly. He later passed on these teachings to Ezra Bridger after his Padawan misinterpreted his first vision."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke Skywalker had a vision on Hoth after he escaped from the cave of a wampa. In it, Obi-Wan Kenobi appeared and directed him to travel to Dagobah where he would find Yoda and learn the ways of the Force from him. Once on Dagobah, he experienced another vision, one of his friends suffering in a city in the clouds. Although his training was incomplete, he rushed to aid his friends, ignoring the warnings of both Yoda and Kenobi, who warned that such a decision was rash and that he needed further training."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Sidious was able to use the dark side to peer into the future and manipulate events on a galactic scale to suit his ends. Despite this, he was unable to foresee his own demise when Darth Vader turned from the dark side to help his son Luke overthrow him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rey experienced a Force vision of her past and future upon touching the lightsaber that once belonged to Skywalker. While training with Luke Skywalker on Ahch-To she had another vision, this one of multiple mirror images of herself. While in the Emperor's Throne Room amidst the ruins of the second Death Star on Kef Bir, Rey had a vision of her dark side self when she touched the Emperor's Sith wayfinder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Supreme Leader Kylo Ren of the First Order had visions that led him to find shards of archaic lore in the old bases of operations once owned by Snoke, his master and predecessor whom he had killed, leading him to discover that a darker force was behind Snoke's power: the returned Darth Sidious. When Ren confronted Sidious on Exegol, Sidious conjured a Force vision before Ren that allowed him to witness the rise of the Sith fleet from beneath Exegol's ground surface. The image eventually disappeared and switched to the marching of Sith troopers before Ren set aside the vision. After the death of his mother Leia, who had sacrificed her life to save her son, Ben Solo encountered a memory of his deceased father Han Solo on Kef Bir. Solo, whom Ren had slain during the Battle of Starkiller Base, encouraged his son to give up the dark side and fulfill what Leia had been fighting for most of her adult life. Following the deceased smuggler's impassioned plea, Ben Solo renounced dark side of the Force, later traveling to Exegol in order to help Rey defeat the resurgent Darth Sidious"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
