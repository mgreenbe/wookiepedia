He was sought by the Resistance, led by Skywalker's sister, General Leia Organa, as well as the resurgent Imperial force known as the First Order. San Tekka gave the map fragment to Resistance Commander Poe Dameron and was soon captured by Kylo Ren, who demanded to know where the map was. When San Tekka refused to comply, Ren killed him.

San Tekka was a member of the Church of the Force during Imperial rule, following the underground faith that believed in the Jedi ideals despite not being Force-sensitive himself.

With a plasma-encased supraluminite lodestone at its center, the compass functioned much like the ancient wayfinders and was attuned to specific points in hyperspace. Through studying the compass, he uncovered a path to Ahch-To, the site of Temple island and the first Jedi Temple. With the help of Lor San Tekka, he finally put together the many clues and learned the location of the temple, a discovery that he and San Tekka kept secret.

After the skirmish on Ovanis, Black Squadron traveled to the prison world of Megalox Beta to question Grakkus the Hutt about his encounter with San Tekka.

San Tekka claimed that they had no right to hold him and that he had only looked at the object, never intending to steal it. His pleas were ignored by Maccon but at the very same time, a significant ship landed at Baron Reya's platform. Maccon asked furiously what tricks Reya has used to get such a significant client.

San Tekka, not knowing who Terex was, asked if he was in Dameron's company. Terex answered that he knew him all too well. When Terex was charging an Z6 riot control baton into his own head, San Tekka suggested that it might be dangerous to the First Order agent.

When Terex continued to charge the baton into his head, San Tekka advised him to stop or otherwise he would die. They shared a friendly conversation, and Terex said that he liked San Tekka and that it would almost be a pity to give him to the First Order. When Terex showed up to Phasma he didn't have San Tekka with him, saying that he would not give her the old man until the First Order removed his implants. When he had gotten his implants removed he headed off into space, giving the First Order the location of San Tekka. At the same time, however, he also called the Resistance and gave them the location of San Tekka, since he didn't care whether the First Order or the Resistance got to San Tekka first, and either scenario would be a win for him. He then sent coordinates revealing that San Tekka was floating around in a spacesuit in the Great Forveen Nebula. He was rescued by Black Squadron, who brought him to their secret base on D'Qar. San Tekka told Leia that although he didn't know where Skywalker was, he had his suspicions, and asked for a starship so he could investigate a bit. Once he had Skywalker's location, San Tekka would send word of where they could meet up with him and get the information. Shortly after San Tekka's departure, Organa reunited with Dameron, informing him of his mission and that San Tekka had the map to her brother.

The dark warrior demanded the map to Skywalker while San Tekka lamented what the young man had become.

Later, Rey, a young Force user who had also hailed from Jakku and helped bring the map to the Resistance, was sent by Organa to Ahch-To.
