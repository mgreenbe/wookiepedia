During the Clone Wars, Rodia was represented by Senator Onaconda Farr in the Galactic Republic's senate. He briefly sided with the Trade Federation during the war, under the promise of food and protection from pirates. Rodia was betrayed, and fell back in line with the Republic. A number of Rodians acted as bounty hunters, including Greedo and Jakoli. Greedo was an amateur eventually killed by the smuggler Han Solo, while Jakoli was a skilled bounty hunter who only killed his targets. Some Rodians also worked as informants, such as Tsoklo, who worked for the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rodians were a species of reptilian humanoids. They possessed large pupil-less eyes that could see in infrared spectrum, slender snouts, pointed ears, twin saucer-like antennae that detected vibrations atop their heads, and a ridge of spines cresting their skulls. Their snouts were said to resemble those of tapirs. Green (sometimes yellow or turquoise) scales covered their bodies, and their skin had a rough, pebbly texture, except on the snout and hands. Their blood was of green color. Females were physically distinguished by their mammary glands, and some of them, like Greeata Jendowanian, were capable of growing long tresses. The Rodian hand featured five long, dexterous fingers with suction cups at the ends. The pads helped them cope with the variety of conditions associated with living in a swamp, and could be used to help them climb aquatic vegetation. The shape of the Rodian hand, however, was as such that if an object was designed for their species, it would be uncomfortable for a human to use. Their toes were a lot like their fingers: long and tipped by suction cups. Although they were oxygen breathers, Rodians could breathe an air saturated with Clouzon-36 without the assistance of a respirator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rodians evolved on the planet Rodia, and eventually joined the Galactic Republic by the time of the Invasion of Naboo. Jabba the Hutt, a crime lord, employed various Rodians as bounty hunters, including one named Greedo. Rodia eventually received representation in the Galactic Senate by means of Senator Onaconda Farr. He eventually made friends with Ruwee Naberrie, a senator from Naboo, and worked closely with him. Eventually, the senator's daughter, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, became the senator for Naboo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Rodia's space vessels were attacked by pirates, leaving the Rodian people impoverished and starving for offworld food. Farr, distressed by his people's suffering, appealed to the Republic for aide, but received none. Desperate, he turned to the Trade Federation and made a deal with their viceroy, Nute Gunray, who was to deliver supplies to Rodia in exchange for control of the planet and Senator Amidala, who was an enemy of Gunray's. Amidala went to Rodia in an attempt to work out her own deal, but was captured by Gunray's battle droids. As the situation progressed, Farr had second thoughts and sided back with Amidala. Gunray was later fooled into thinking a Jedi was attacking his forces, who in actuality was the bumbling Gungan Jar Jar Binks. The viceroy admitted to Farr that he had brought no provisions for the Rodian people with him. Gunray was eventually arrested by the Republic, only to escape at a later date. Farr was later murdered during the war by his aide Lolo Purs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rodians also made it as far as Lothal, where a number of them worked for the Galactic Empire. Some of these Rodians lived in Lothal re-settlement camp 43, nicknamed \"Tarkintown,\" which housed farmers who had been dispossessed by the Empire. Tseebo was a Rodian who worked for the Imperial Information Office, although after stealing a large amount of Imperial data he tried to escape the Empire, and was eventually rescued by a band of rebels. Another Lothal Rodian, Frid Kelio, played grav-ball for the AppSci SaberCats in Capital City."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Rodia was brought into the Imperial fold, many Rodians opposed the Empire and as such, many were recruited by the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the Betu continent of Rodia was ruled by the Chattza clan.

Jakoli was a bounty hunter hired by Count Dooku during the Clone Wars, who died during a subsequent test. Jakoli had a reputation of only taking assignments where he was allowed to kill his target. Tsoklo was a Rodian who lived on the planet Lothal, and worked as a factory worker. He doubled as an informant working for the Galactic Empire. Some Rodians, like Bolla Ropal, were sensitive to the Force. Ropal was a Jedi Master murdered by the bounty hunter Cad Bane. Another Rodian Jedi, Huulik, was killed as a result of Order 66. At least one Rodian was a member of Enfys Nest's Cloud-Riders and fought alongside her on Savareen. Other Rodians were Wald, Pablo, and Ganodi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rodians were created for Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. Costume Designer John Mollo's sketches for the three Rodians present in the Mos Eisley Cantina referred to them as \"Martians.\" At one time, the Rodian masks were to fit a four-armed body, which would eventually be known as a Morseerian, but the heads were switched before filming. Although the terms \"Rodian\" and \"Rodia\" were first developed for the the Star Wars Legends roleplaying sourcebook Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope in 1989, the name stuck, and saw its way into production for the prequel trilogy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
