The mission succeeded when the clone of Cinzia died, leaving the droids without any purpose. The original Cinzia\u2014now Sith apprentice Eldon Ax\u2014took control of the droids and ordered them to kill Darth Chratis before allowing them to destroy themselves. Afterward, the Republic attempted to retrieve some of Sebaddon's rare metals, but due to attacks by the Imperials, their success was limited. The orbit of Sebaddon was later noted to have been knocked off-course, causing it to begin to spiral down toward the black hole."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3650 BBY, Sebbadon was classified as part of the Unknown Regions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
