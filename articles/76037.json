Kidros' light made the skies of Kidron glow a bright orange, and the world was blessed with spectacular sunsets and sunrises. While habitable, Kidron was far from comfortable or hospitable. Most people lived in the High City of Refuge, although there were some other very small settlements on the world as well such as Orfa City. Kidron was composed of two large continents and many smaller islands. The planet was ruled by the Council of Gordek and protected by Kidron System Defense."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
