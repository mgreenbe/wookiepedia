The Authority made it a practice to send prisoners and the sector's least fortunate to Rampa II, and the planet's landscape had become extremely polluted, with very little drinkable water. As such, a bustling smuggling trade sprung up between Rampa and nearby R'alla, which was well-known for its sweet, clear water. That run, known as the Rampa Rapids, was heavily patrolled by both Authority gunships and the native Rampa Skywatch, and was known for being highly perilous. Many smugglers cut their teeth running water to Rampa II, including a young Han Solo, who ran the Rampa Rapids during his early career. Gunrunner Tiv \"Poke\" Pocarno was less successful than Solo, as the Captain of the Broken 'Spanner, in a futile effort to pay back a sizable debt to Reuss VIII crime lord Torel Vorne, botched a smuggling run to Rampa II and died penniless."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the Galactic Empire manned emplacements on Rampa II, which became the target of a popular uprising in 4 BBY.
