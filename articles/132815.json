With only one rebreather, Luke and Leia are forced to share the device as they try to make their way back to the surface. As they spot Kendle underwater, the two Rebels begin to follow their friend.

Lando meets with Admiral Griggor Tower, using Drebble's name as his alias. As Lando claims that he is searching for Tay Vanis to resolve a debt that Vanis owes him, Lando picks up information on K-3PX, getting Tower's permission to search the droids who are on work detail.
