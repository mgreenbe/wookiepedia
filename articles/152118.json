The Bith took part in a fight on the Outer Rim planet Ragmar V that was against the clone armies of the Galactic Republic. The battle was originally planned to be set against a detachment of clone troopers and their Jedi commander, Joc Sah. The fight took a different turn however when the clone troopers were ordered to execute Order 66; a directive that labeled all Jedi as traitors to the Republic and that they were to be executed immediately. The settlement leader, a Human named Gaan, made peace with Joc Sah, and together with the other settlers repelled the clone troopers, with the having Bith taken a place on a roof with three other outcasts for the fight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Bith criminal lived in the galaxy sometime around 19 BBY, during the final year of an intergalactic conflict known as the Clone Wars. Around or before this time, the Bith joined up with a settlement of pariahs and outcasts that existed on the Outer Rim planet of Ragmar V. The settlement was led by a Human male named Gaan, and was seconded by a Klatooinian. During the Bith's stay, the armies of the Galactic Republic, under the leadership of the Jedi Master Jedi and his padawan Joc Sah, arrived on Ragmar V to build an outpost that would be used as a staging ground against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Republic's opposition in the Clone Wars. Gaan detested the Republic for his own reasons, and ordered a Republic Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunship to be destroyed when it landed on a mesa near the settlement. The gunship's occupants, Joc Sah and his detachment of clone troopers, survived, however, and began to make their way to the settlement. Predicting a fight, Gaan ordered the Bith, the Klatooinian, a Rodian, and a Human female to the rooftops while he would confront the Jedi in the street, noting that he wanted to kill the Jedi personally."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bith followed orders, arming up with a blaster, but while Gaan met Joc Sah in the street, clone trooper sergeant Remy received the command to execute Order 66\u2014an order from the Republic's Supreme Chancellor that branded all Jedi as traitors to be executed immediately. Sah managed to escape the follow up attack from his own men, but Gaan had mistaken the clone trooper's fire for the settler's, firing without his command. When informed that it was in fact the clones who had turned on the Jedi, Gaan angrily killed a clone trooper before taking cover with Sah from the return fire. The Klatooinian, still situated on the rooftops, took matters into his own hands and ordered the settlers to fire. The Bith and the others followed through, and eliminated the clone troopers. After the initial fighting was over, the settlers having only lost the Rodian, the Bith made his way down the street to regroup with the other outcasts as Joc Sah accepted the fact that he was now one of them. The Bith then began to make preparations with the other settlers to fight off a second, larger, wave of clone troopers who would be arriving to ensure Sah's elimination. After engaging the clone troopers, Gaan and Sah escaped the settlement and proceeded to manage a number of hit and run attacks on the pursuing clone troopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bith was a hardy individual, and was prepared to go against the odds, ready to fight both a Jedi and his clone troopers, and much later go up against an entire army of clone troopers.
