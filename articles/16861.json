Following his retirement, the human clone Gregor, former soldier of Galactic Republic, came to live on Seelos aboard a modified AT-TE walker with two of his comrades, Rex and Wolffe. Over time, Gregor became obsessed with catching Big Bongo. When the Spectres arrived on Seelos, Gregor convinced one of them, Garazeb Orrelios, to serve as bait for the giant joopa, who was thought to enjoy the taste of Lasat meat. Two other members of the Spectres, the Jedi-in-hiding Kanan Jarrus and his apprentice Ezra Bridger, used electrostaffs to send bolts of energy along a laser line under the surface. When Big Bongo finally surfaced, Rex killed him with a direct hit from the main cannon of the AT-TE. The clones carried the creature's carcass on the side of their walker for a time. However, when the Galactic Empire launched an assault against them, Gregor and his comrades were forced to abandon it for the sake of greater mobility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
