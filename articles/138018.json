It was flexible yet very durable and could easily keep out hazardous materials such as snow, ash, sand, chemicals, and could even absorb a few shots from a blaster. It was used for different kinds of products and machinery but was rarely worn as armor due to its heavy weight. This was not the case however, for the Galactic Marines or 21st Nova Corps, an elite unit for the Grand Army of the Republic which was lead by General Ki-Adi-Mundi and Clone Commander Bacara, who wore special synthmesh armor to protect themselves from the harsh climates of their dangerous planetary missions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
