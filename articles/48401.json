It was not known to be edible and was able to survive in the desolate planet due to the low amount of nutrition needed. It was also incredibly resilient so that it was almost impossible to rip from rock. The Nightbrothers of Dathomir used climbing claws to ascend surfaces covered in the lichen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
