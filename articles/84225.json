In 9 ABY, the insane clone Jedi Master Joruus C'baoth performed a mind trick on Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn's subordinate, Captain Gilad Pellaeon, ordering him to make a special clone for him.

The clone's presence caused a buzzing pressure to form within Skywalker's mind, and Skywalker was constantly put on the defensive as the clone attacked with vicious thrusts of his lightsaber. The clone proved to have a similar proficiency in lightsaber dueling and Force techniques as Skywalker, utilizing Force attacks such as lightsaber throw. Eventually, Skywalker's sister, Leia Organa Solo, entered the throne room but was quickly neutralized by C'baoth. As Skywalker continued to lose ground to the clone, Jade found an opportunity to recover Organa Solo's lightsaber.

Vader intervened and took both the severed hand and the lightsaber as trophies for Galactic Emperor Palpatine. As Vader boarded his shuttle to leave Cloud City, he briefly contemplated creating a clone of Skywalker from the severed hand to serve as his own apprentice.

When C'baoth realized he could not turn Skywalker to the dark side, he struck Jade with Force lightning and introduced the clone. At C'baoth's command, the clone, dressed in a brown robe and concealed by the light of a hologram next to him, unclipped a lightsaber from his belt and began moving toward Skywalker and Jade. The lightsaber the clone wielded was Skywalker's first, retrieved from Cloud City and stored at Mount Tantiss along with his hand. The clone's presence caused a buzzing pressure to form against Skywalker's mind and gave the Jedi a disturbing sense of familiarity. Skywalker was quickly reminded of his confrontation in the Dark Side Cave on Dagobah with the Dark Spirit, a Force manifestation of himself that he had dueled, and the clone Luuke finally revealed his face to the Jedi. Skywalker's mind froze in shock as he gazed upon a face that was his own, the buzzing pressure in his mind continuing to grow. C'baoth disclosed the clone's origins and claimed that whichever Skywalker defeated the other would be the one to serve him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Catching Skywalker off guard, the clone ignited his lightsaber and began aggressively swinging his blade toward Skywalker's chest. As Skywalker attempted to block with his own lightsaber, the force of the clone's attack nearly threw the Jedi off balance. When Skywalker retreated to a raised guard platform at the lower level of the throne room, the clone followed through with a lightsaber throw, which sliced halfway through the platform, causing Skywalker to perform an unsuccessful backflip onto the ground. The clone retrieved his lightsaber and once more engaged Skywalker. He hurled his lightsaber at Skywalker when the Jedi leaped up to a nearby catwalk. The saber barely missed Skywalker but sliced through most of the catwalk and the support struts holding it to the ceiling. Skywalker attempted to Force-pull the clone's falling lightsaber to himself but was thwarted by C'baoth, who stopped the lightsaber in midair and insisted that the duel be fought fairly. The clone had been standing still the whole time, knowing precisely what his master was doing. Skywalker threw his own lightsaber at the clone's, intending to destroy the clone's weapon. However, C'baoth intervened once again and threw an object at Skywalker, which caused the Jedi to miss and lose his mental grip on the clone's lightsaber. The clone recovered his lightsaber and raised it to an en guard position as a weary Skywalker prepared to continue the duel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker's sister, Leia Organa Solo, along with her husband, Han Solo, and the smuggler Talon Karrde, found their way into the throne room during the battle. An attack from C'baoth left Organa Solo incapacitated, prompting Skywalker to aggressively attack his clone in a bid to finish the duel quickly and save his sister. The clone Luuke fell back before the onslaught, barely being able to block Skywalker's blows. The clone then retreated up a set of stairs to his master's side while Skywalker seemingly pursued him. Skywalker, however, switched his lightsaber off and attempted to bargain his own life with C'baoth for those of his comrades. As C'baoth conversed with Skywalker and Jade, the clone reignited his lightsaber and leaped toward Skywalker, who ignited his own weapon just in time to parry the clone's aerial attack. The clone drove Skywalker off the stairway and onto the floor below, and the two continued their fight on the lower level until Skywalker leaped back up to the main floor with the clone in pursuit. The clone then attacked Skywalker with vicious horizontal thrusts, slowly backing the Jedi against a wall. Jade managed to recover Organa Solo's lightsaber while C'baoth was distracted and charged at Skywalker's clone. The clone was aware of Jade's imminent attack but decided to take a gamble and finish off Skywalker first. As the clone swung his lightsaber for a finishing blow, Skywalker ducked, causing the clone's lightsaber to slice through a viewscreen mounted on the rock wall behind Skywalker. The electronic components of the viewscreen exploded in the clone's face, and he shrieked, staggering backward. Dazed and angry, the clone raised his lightsaber in attack toward Jade.

After the duel, Skywalker gave the clone's lightsaber, his own first lightsaber, to Jade as a gift. Skywalker continued to be haunted by the duel with his clone, causing him several sleepless nights. He recorded his experience with his clone in a personal datapad journal written several days after the confrontation. In it, he described his fears about his own future and how restless it left him. Skywalker compared the clone to the spirit he fought on Dagobah, describing how both adversaries had his own strengths and weaknesses and were his equals in almost every way.

The clone was devoid of any sense of individuality and showed no recognizable sign of emotion until the end of his bout with Skywalker, when he shrieked and attacked Mara Jade in fury after a viewscreen blew up in his face.

The clone's lightsaber techniques utilized vicious, aggressive thrusts, and he was able to synchronize with C'baoth's mind, allowing him to carry out the Jedi Master's will instantly.

The story was presented as an epilogue to the Fate of the Jedi novel series and was recounted from the first-person perspective of Luuke, as an in-universe recollection of his life. According to the story, Luuke was secretly selected by Grand Admiral Thrawn to take Luke Skywalker's place among the New Republic hierarchy, and during Mara Jade's duel against Luuke on Mountain Tantiss in The Last Command, the former Emperor's Hand inadvertently killed the real Luke Skywalker and Luuke subsequently took the Jedi's place, pretending that he was the original Luke. According to the text that accompanied the story, this \"revelation\" rendered all appearances of Luke Skywalker in post\u2013Last Command Star Wars media as appearances of Luuke."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An Apology went on to elaborate that after the clone's infiltration of the New Republic, Thrawn surreptitiously fed Luuke orders, and the Dark Jedi adapted well to his new role, although at times he struggled to accustom himself to Luke Skywalker's taste in food. Luuke went on to establish a new Jedi Order and founded a Jedi Academy on the moon Yavin 4. Thrawn requested that Luuke obtain tissue samples from the Sith spirit Exar Kun and the unorthodox Jedi Callista, and the clone failed to complete the task, although Luuke subsequently mollified the Grand Admiral by providing him with genetic samples from the crime lords Prince Xizor and Durga the Hutt. According to An Apology, Luuke later participated in the Black Fleet Crisis and the conflict surrounding the rediscovery of the Caamas Document, but the strains of war began to show on him and Thrawn considered replacing the Dark Jedi with a new clone. Over time, Thrawn gathered a collection of clones, and during the Yuuzhan Vong War, Luuke came to suspect that the Admiral was insane. Thrawn also began substituting clones with their original progenitors, as he had with Luke and Luuke, then imprisoning the progenitors inside the Grand Admiral's fortress in the Patagonia system. A replacement for Luuke, named Luuuke Skywalker, was eventually created by Thrawn, and Luuke planned to go forth to Patagonia, to accept his final fate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
