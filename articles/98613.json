Tan Maarek Stele and his strike force, debuting the new Missile Boats were deployed to disable and capture the Nuance before the transfer could be completed. The Nuance responded by launching multiple wings of T-wings to engage the Imperial pilots while several Delta-class DX-9 stormtrooper transports proceeded to lay a minefield around the parked vessel. This defense failed however and Stele managed to disable the Nuance with the help of Alpha-class Xg-1 Star Wings. Then the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Grey Wolf arrived and sent a Gamma-class ATR-6 assault transport to seize control of the vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The surviving pilots of the Nuance continued to resist the boarding operation and were reinforced by a responding Rebel force led by the Carrack-class light cruiser Prism, which had arrived to collect the TIE Defenders.
