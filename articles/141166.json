The fish took a home in a lake on the forest moon sometime before or during the Rebellion era, and had an encounter with King Elbo at one point, perhaps even going to the king's Coral Castle at the bottom of the sea. He passed this information to three Ewoks\u2014 Wicket, Teebo, and Kneesaa\u2014 after their friend Latara was kidnapped by the king."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fish created a sea bubble for the three Ewoks to travel in, as Ewoks could not travel to the bottom of the sea without air. The Ewoks were hesitant at first, displeased with the bubble's simplicity, but then came around and used the bubble to travel to the Coral Castle.

The general consensus of the Ewoks was that the fish was abnormally small. Sometime before his meeting with the three Ewoks, the talking fish had at least one encounter with the supposed king of the sea, Elbo. During this encounter, the fish saw Elbo perform one of his tests for greed, and later the fish saw Elbo's home, the Coral Castle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Also, sometime before his encounter with the Ewoks, the fish learned how to make a sea bubble, a round, air-filled sphere that had enough room to fit three Ewoks. The fish could create the bubble by inflating himself with air and then blowing it into water. It is unknown if he used this form of transportation prior to making it for the Ewoks."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Helping the Ewoks"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, Kneesaa, an Ewok princess, accidentally dropped her ankle bracelet into the water.

After correctly identifying her bracelet and resisting the temptation to lie about more attractive ones, she received all three. Later, Latara, another Ewok, heard of this story and decided to test it. She purposely dropped her flute into the water, and lied to Elbo.

Teebo, having heard legends of sea monsters in the water, allowed himself to float and make noises in the water. Responding to his call, the fish friend surfaced and greeted the Ewoks. The Ewoks explained their problem to the fish friend, and he explained what he knew of Elbo and the Coral Castle to the three Ewoks. After deciding to rescue the helpless Latara, the fish made a sea bubble in which they traveled.
