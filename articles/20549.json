During the conflict, the town of Rhigar was evacuated, and the bridge became one of several supply lines used by the Separatist Droid Army. A shield generator was installed to defend it against Republic attacks, and a squad of battle droids including B1-Series battle droids and B2 super battle droids were stationed by the bridge. Giving the bridge its numerical designation, the Republic unsuccessfully attempted to destroy or capture it several times, by both ground assault and aerial bombardment - the latter of which demolished most of Rhigar's inhabited structures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A small Republic-allied strike force was called in to sneak into Separatist territory in order to infiltrate the bridge's southern guard post and destroy the shield generator, allowing for a large convoy of clone troopers to overtake it. Whether or not the team was ultimately successful is unknown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bridge 242 was created by Daniel Wallace, Gary Astleford, Eric Cagle and Rodney Thompson as the main objective for players in a short Saga edition Roleplaying game adventure, which shared its name with the bridge. The bridge's ultimate fate depends on whether the players manage to successfully destroy the shield generator, in which case it is captured by Republic forces. Otherwise, the Republic is forced to destroy it by orbital bombardment, with the potential of destroying the players if they are unable to escape the 1 kilometer-blast radius."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
