To wear the double stripe, troopers would have all hair on their head shaved, save for two thick, parallel stripes that ran from the front to the back of their head. The two stripes met in a curve at the base of the trooper's skull, making the term \"double stripe\" a misnomer, as the troopers were in fact wearing a single, lengthy curve of hair atop their heads. This hairstyle was popularized in the Grand Army as an expression of honor towards a trooper's fallen comrades. Clone trooper commander CC-1004 wore his dyed-red hair in this style as a tribute to his brothers-in-arms who had been lost at the Battle of Tibrin. The clone trooper nicknamed Boost also sported the double stripe, as did several troopers serving under Jedi General Anakin Skywalker during the Battle of Teth and the Second Battle of Geonosis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The double stripe was developed as one way to differentiate the many clone troopers introduced in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series.
