If the Gate was ever activated, and thus subjecting Infinity to the physical world, the planet housing the equipment would collapse into the Infinity Gate, along with the surrounding planets, moons, and even suns. As the species fell from power throughout the galaxy, the Kwa sealed the Infinity Gate and the Star Temples and set whuffa worms as guardians to protect the Temples."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 31 BBY, the Nightsisters succeeded in capturing the Prime Gate on Dathomir along with the Star Temple and slaughtered many Kwi. The Nightsisters had intended to access the secrets of the Infinity Gate and use its abilities to project a wave containing Infinity's power to destroy Coruscant, as well as surrounding planets and stars. However, their plot was thwarted by the Jedi Knight Quinlan Vos, who, using his role as Temple Guardian, redirected the deadly wave aimed at Coruscant back at the Infinity Gate, thus causing it to collapse on itself and destroy the Star Temple that housed it and the Realm of Infinity within. Only the scattered ruins of the Infinity Gate and the Star Temple were left."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
