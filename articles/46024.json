Along with other classes of massive Imperial capital ships, they were also referred to as Super Star Destroyers, although they were technically classified as Star Dreadnoughts. The most distinguished Super Star Destroyer was the Executor, flagship of the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vessels of the Executor-class Dreadnought line measured at 19,000 meters in length, and utilizing its thirteen Executor-50.x engines, could reach speeds of 100 kilometers per hour. These starships were crewed by thousands, and were outfitted with a class 1 hyperdrive, a titanium-reinforced hull, over 5,000 turbolaser and ion cannon batteries, and concussion missile tubes. A bridge deflector shield was also included as a layer of defense and maintained a complement of thousands of starships including TIE/ln space superiority starfighters, TIE/sa bombers, and TIE/IN interceptors. Vessels of the Executor-class also had at least one hangar bay and escape pods."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Executor-class's bridge was 285 meters wide and contained shield generators, briefing rooms, and escape pods. However, it was relatively exposed, making it vulnerable to enemy attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Executor-class Star Dreadnought, also known as the Super-class Star Destroyer, was manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards during the reign of the Galactic Empire. By the time of the skirmish against the Third Fleet, Darth Vader had been pushing for the class. During its history, at least two prototypes were manufactured, including the Star Dreadnought Assault Prototype and the Star Dreadnought Command Prototype."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to the Rebel Alliance's intelligence agency, more than a dozen Super Star Destroyers were made, including the Executor itself, the Annihilator, the Arbitrator, the Eclipse, and the Ravager. However, the true number remained a subject of debate, as Alliance analysts endeavored to make sense of Imperial propaganda and see through the black budgets designed to hide the scope of the Emperor Palpatine's secret weapons programs. Darth Vader's flagship saw action at the Battle of Hoth and the Escape from Cloud City before being destroyed at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the months after the events of Endor, the New Republic, the successor government to the Alliance, destroyed five Super Star Destroyers, including the Arbitrator which accidentally jumped into a black hole due to erroneous hyperspace coordinates, and captured three more. The Annihilator, former flagship of Grand General Cassio Tagge, was captured by pirates and renamed Liberty's Misrule. The only known Super Star Destroyer, and so the only known Executor-class, to remain in Imperial hands was Grand Admiral Rae Sloane's flagship Ravager, which also served as the base for Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax. In 5 ABY, Sloane discovered evidence that the Emperor's command ship, the Super Star Destroyer Eclipse, had not been destroyed but had vanished from the official records."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Sloane's disappearance during the attack on Chandrila, Fleet Admiral Rax formally took command of the Ravager as Counselor to the Empire. The Ravager then rendezvoused with a large Imperial armada on the barren planet of Jakku for a showdown with the New Republic. The Ravager was lost in the battle when one of the New Republic's Starhawk-class Battleships pulled it into Jakku's gravity well with its ultra-powerful tractor beam, causing the massive capital ship to crash in the sands of the desert planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
