By 14 BBY, during their mission to rebuild the Jedi Order, former Jedi Knight Cere Junda and pilot Greez Dritus heard rumors of a Jedi living in hiding on Todola, and visited the astronomical object in their starship, the Stinger Mantis, to investigate. However, when they arrived, they discovered the Imperial site, encountering a number of Imperial forces. The Imperials threatened to open fire on the Stinger Mantis, and Junda had to lie, pretending that they had arrived there by mistake. Junda and Dritus later told the tale to Cal Kestis, a Jedi Padawan who had survived the Purge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Todola was first mentioned in the 2019 video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, developed by Respawn Entertainment.
