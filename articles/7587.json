Although Carson initially auditioned for a separate, slightly more prominent pilot role that ended up not making it into the film, casting director Robin Gurland enjoyed the interview with him and so mentioned him to director George Lucas. Deciding that Carson looked like an interesting person, Lucas had him come back in for animatics and then gave him the part of the Jedi Ki-Adi-Mundi instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Carson was later also given the roles of Nute Gunray and Senator Lott Dod, both of which, along with Mundi, required him to wear prosthetics that covered his face. Carson mentioned to Gurland that he would like for his actual face to appear in the film, so when it came time to cast Williams, Gurland asked him if he would like the role. All of the scenes in the cockpit of the Radiant VII were filmed on September 8, 1997."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Naming"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Antidar Williams character was first given a name in the new Star Wars canon by the mobile card game Star Wars: Force Collection, which initially launched in 2013.

Tapley initially wanted the character's first name to be a tuckerization of his own name or one of his nicknames, but after being unable to come up with a satisfying result, he settled for an anagram of \"radiant\"\u2014a reference to Williams's ship, the Radiant VII."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
