Lorana was a Jedi, and Dean's parents were truly proud of her, causing Dean to feel jealous and unloved.

Dean traveled the galaxy frequently during the Clone Wars, spending a brief time in the Hadar sector following the Wars, during which he learned an ingenious trick for exterminating infestations of conduit worms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two years after the New Republic and the Galactic Empire signed their historic peace treaty, Dean joined Talon Karrde's operation.

The Chiss had located the wreckage of Outbound Flight, and Dean, masquerading as a New Republic Ambassador, joined the expedition. During the mission, Dean came to terms with the lie he'd been living over the past sixty years, finally accepting himself for who he was.
