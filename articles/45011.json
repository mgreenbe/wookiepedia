After the war, he began working as a freelance mercenary, ending up on Manaan by the last year of the Jedi Civil War. He expressed a dislike for the Echani and Iridonian mercenaries who were looking for work at the small cantina in Ahto City that catered to the mercenary population of that world, claiming that the former were cowardly dancers and that the latter were little more than bloodthirsty savages. During his stay there, he had a brief meeting with Revan and Canderous with whom they chatted about the old days."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Mandalorian Wars Ergeron fought along side Canderous Ordo, together they became a valuable asset to the Mandalorian Cause.
