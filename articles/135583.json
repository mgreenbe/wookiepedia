Following the Battle of Yavin, he was a lieutenant of the Meatlump gang, a Corellian technology-hating terrorist organization. Around 1 ABY, Stephax Dain launched an ambitious attack on a Weapons Research Facility located on Naboo's moon of Rori. However, a rival Meatlump lieutenant by the name of Kaiya Merel was not keen on letting Dain take all the credit of this action. She tasked a new Meatlump recruit to search Stephax Dain's camp near Kor Vella. The spacer found a well-worn notebook that contained detailed information about Stephax's plans. Kaiya Merel therefore ordered her recruit to disrupt the facility operations before her rival but Stephax and his Meatlump pronks had already taken over the facility when the spacer arrived on Rori. The adventurer attacked the Meatlumps to take control of the research facility, killing Stephax Dain and a number of pronks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stephax Dain appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
