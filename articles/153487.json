They shared the planet with the Mooloolian tribes, which occupied the mountainous regions of the planet. The jungle barbarians eventually vanished, and their language was absorbed by the Mooloolian tribes by the year 275 BBY. In 25 ABY, the protocol droid C-3PO speculated that the language of the jungle barbarians was related to that used by a newly encountered species, the Yuuzhan Vong; however, this later proved groundless as the Yuuzhan Vong's origins were extra-galactic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R. A. Salvatore created the jungle barbarians for his novel The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime, published by Del Rey in 1999.

It is possible that the Mooloolian tribes were a cultural group of the same species; however, this has not been canonically established."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
