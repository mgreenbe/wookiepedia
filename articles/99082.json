During the Battle of Ryloth, OM 7 along with OM 5 were sent by their Commander to check out a Republic Gunship that was blocking their path. OM 5 warned OM 7 of clone troopers, but instead found the gunship full of explosives. A clone trooper found the pair in close range of the gunship and activated the charges. The explosion destroyed OM 7 and OM 5, and also made the hills collapse, making a huge barrier for the droid army's path."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
