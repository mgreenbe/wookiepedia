Whilst they were refueling the ship on Ralltiir, the Trandoshan pirate Slyssk stole it for Marn Hierogryph and Zayne Carrick. The crew arrived at Pad 223, where Slyssk had delivered the ship, shortly afterwards and fired on the thieves with blasters in an attempt to stop them. Their efforts were unsuccessful and the Little Bivoli took off without them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
