While Navett and Klif opened a pet store as a cover, Pensin and Horvic found work at a Ho'Din restaurant. Using this cover, they had access to a power conduit near the generators, which Navett used as part of his plan to send baby mawkrens with explosives strapped to their backs into the generator buildings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Navett took control of this part of the plan, he accompanied Horvic and Klif on a mission to infiltrate the Ishori cruiser Predominance posing as maintenance workers. Once Navett succeeded in taking the planetary shields down, the three agents killed their Ishori escorts, seized control of a weapons turret, and began the bombardment of Drev'starn, setting off the Second Battle of Bothawui. They fired eight shots at the defenseless city before being neutralized."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
