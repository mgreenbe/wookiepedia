During the Clone Wars, Degan Explorations scouted the Iakar system and uncovered rare chemical compounds suitable for bacta replication and other medicinal uses on Iakar. Parent company Chiewab established a research facility, yet Chiewab's competitors, Fabreth Medical and Merisee Prime were able to intercept transmissions and establish up their respective operations. The Iakaru were forced to defend their homes and forests, but corporate security forces prevailed by massacring resistance and relocating entire tree-clans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the establishment of the Galactic Empire, an Imperial occupation force along with scientists from the Imperial Corps of Bioengineers were dispatched to occupy Iakar and recover medicinal properties. The Iakaru were desperate to drive the Empire away, and built or stole starships to escape from the planet, and eventually found a way to expel the Empire from Iakar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
