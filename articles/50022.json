Used to craft lightsabers, the signature weapons of the Jedi Order, the machine was located in the ruins of a ruined city on the planet. After the Sacking of Coruscant by the Sith Empire in 3653 BBY ended the Great Galactic War and turned the public opinion of the Galactic Republic against the Jedi Order, they departed the ruins of their Temple and returned to their recently rediscovered homeworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There, the Jedi discovered many ruins of the ancient Je'daii, among them the temple of Kaleth, as well as the Forge itself.
