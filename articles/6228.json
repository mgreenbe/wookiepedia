By 8 ABY, the Ambition was maintained in a secret underground hangar on the sector capital of Kal'Shebbol for use as an escape craft for the Moff in case the planet fell to enemy forces.

By 8 ABY, the Carrack-class vessel was docked in a secret underground hangar on the planet of Kal'Shebbol, the capital of the Kathol sector. The hangar had been excavated from one of the hills surrounding the planet's Imperial Government Complex, and the Ambition had been sealed in. A secret tunnel connected the hangar to the government buildings, with access points in Sarne's personal quarters and office. Sarne crewed the Ambition with his best and most loyal officers and soldiers, with the intent of using the vessel as an escape vehicle in case Kal'Shebbol was ever attacked by an enemy force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When New Republic forces attacked Kal'Shebbol in 8 ABY, Sarne knew that he would lose control of the planet. Ordering the Ambition to be prepped and readied for departure, Sarne abandoned the command center from where he was directing the defense of the planet and ordered several of his stormtroopers to escort him to the vessel. Along the way, they retrieved a chest full of DarkStryder artifacts that the Moff kept in his quarters. En route to the Ambition, Sarne and his guards were attacked by New Republic soldiers from Page's Commandos, who had infiltrated the facility to lower the defensive shields protecting the planet. Sarne managed to temporarily incapacitate them with a piece of DarkStryder technology known as a Mindwarper module and reached the Ambition."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the New Republic commandos recovered and began firing on the vessel, the Ambition lifted off. The roof of the hangar was blown open to allow the craft to ascend into orbit, joining the rest of Sarne's forces fighting against the New Republic fleet. Sarne quickly marshaled his forces and retreated from Kal'Shebbol without leaving a hyperspace vector for the New Republic forces to follow. At some point after fleeing Kal'Shebbol, Sarne transferred his flag off the Ambition, overseeing his forces from the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Bastion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ambition was featured in the short story The Saga Begins, written by Timothy Zahn and published in The DarkStryder Campaign in 1995.
