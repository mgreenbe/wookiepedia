While stirring the batter, the cook had to maintain the correct speed or the batter could detonate. The ingredients also included sugar, eggs, salt, and a cooking spice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While working at Maz Kanata's castle on Takodana, the Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs held a cooking competition to determine who would replace his deceased sous-chef, Robbs Ely. Unbeknownst to the contestants, he was also determining who killed Ely. In one round, the competitors had an added challenge to dodge blasts from stun cascade rifles. Devaronian prep cook Sama Macoy began preparing her souffl\u00e9 while working through the stun blasts, but she failed to maintain constant motion in the volatile batter and it exploded in her face. Though all were uninjured, the batter explosion forced her to start over with another dish. Judges Carly and J'Nell, a pair of BD-3000 luxury droids, were unimpressed when she blamed the ingredients instead of her own abilities. Macoy was knocked out of both the competition and the list of suspects in Ely's murder, which had been committed by the droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point after the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY, Tuggs included the anecdote about Macoy and a recipe for the souffl\u00e9 in his cookbook, The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook. He expressed his hope that people following his recipe would experience better luck than Macoy, but if they needed a last-minute replacement after an unexpected detonation, he recommended fried zuchii as an easy alternative."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Devaronian Souffl\u00e9 first appeared in the short story \"A Recipe for Death\" by Landry Q.
