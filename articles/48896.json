The adventure includes an illustration by John Robinson, which depicts Spilfer wearing a hat that sits between his tufted ears and features a broad, flat, rounded bill and a collection of keyhole-shaped objects on the front. Nevertheless, the adventure's use of cap is ambiguous about whether the term refers to Spilfer's hat or some other element of his costume."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
