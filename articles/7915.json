By the time of the Battle of Yavin, it was one of the oldest Aqualish gravesites on Talus. Although the Aqualish did not care about their ancient buildings, mostly in ruins, they always preserved their old gravesites. Around 1 ABY, the Aqualish Omkoo was concerned by rumors of thugs vandalizing Aqualish gravesites. As the local Federation of the Double Worlds authorities seemed indifferent to this situation, the Aqualish hired a spacer to investigate and stop disturbing the graves. However, the spacer did not find thugs at the Aqualish gravesite but paramilitary forces of the Tralus and Talus Liberation Party, a group fighting for the independence of the Twin Worlds from the Corellian system. The spacer killed the soldiers plundering the ruins but the TTLP had already shipped off some artifacts. The adventurer then visited the Nashal Starport and a Rebel weapons depot where all stolen artifacts were finally retrieved."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Aqualish gravesite was a location in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
