Kilran's forces boarded the Esseles as Kilran's ship bombarded the other, causing the death of Haken's superior. This left Haken in charge of the vessel just as a group of Jedi, troopers, and smugglers who were aboard arrived on the bridge.

After restoring access to the bridge, the allies encountered Ironfist, who had captured Haken, Navigator Plex, Communications Officer Raste, and the rest of the command crew. Haken and the others begged the heroes to free them, and they watched as the group defeated Ironfist and his group of Mandalorians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the crew was freed, Asara convinced the group to take one of the Esseles' shuttles over to Kilran's ship and disable the tractor beam holding the cruiser. Haken agreed, but he attempted to convince the group to leave the ambassador on Kilran's ship to ensure the Imperials would not follow. They refused and later told Asara of Haken's treachery after they disabled the tractor beam. Asara thanked them for informing her, and confronted Haken when they arrived back on the Esseles. Thanks to the efforts of the allies, the Esseles was able to continue on its way to Coruscant, where the ambassador could continue her mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic-affiliated player can choose to not tell Asara of Haken's treachery or inform Asara of Haken's treachery before leaving her with the Imperials."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
