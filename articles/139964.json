He was also a member of the Delegation of 2,000, a group of senators who had grown concerned with how Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine was conducting the war and wished for him to revoke his emergency powers so that the Senate could once again fully oversee the Republic. He represented Feenix. One day after the formation of the Galactic Empire, Imperial Intelligence conducted a mass arrest of senators, which included Cadaman.
