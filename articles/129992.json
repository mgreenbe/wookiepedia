On the sergeant's recommendation, one soldier was normally appointed Corporal, also known as the \"one-man\", and a brevet list was created which numbered each trooper down to the \"eight-man\", denoting the order in which authority devolved to them if the squad's more senior soldiers were killed.

However, high losses against the Rebel Alliance caused the Empire to rethink how they could improve the line squad as cost-effectively as possible. This led to the process of equipping each squad with a Light repeating blaster to increase their short range firepower. However, only in three sectors were more than half of the squads equipped with these blasters by the time of the Battle of Yavin: the Shwuy sector, Harron and Nembus sector. On heavily populated worlds such as Uviuy Exen and Trammen, every line squad was equipped with a light repeating blaster."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Heavy Weapons Squad"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These heavy weapon squads were armed with either two- to three-man Medium repeating blasters or three-man Heavy repeating blasters.

One of the squad's members would also be a demolition expert with experience operating as part of the sharpshooter squad, making them doubly dangerous.

However, Rebel sources believed that the Empire was also using smaller stormtrooper squads, and by 22 ABY, the standard squad of the 501st Legion apparently consisted of units of four troopers, such as Unit Aurek-Seven, one of ten such units in Aurek Company. According to Section 682.T.ST88 of the Imperial Stormtrooper Corps Field Manual, although the minimum unit allowed in the Stormtrooper Corps was a squad, the squad itself could be subdivided further into two fire teams and organized into wedge formations, with the fire team leader being at the tip of each wedge, in order to permit maximum firing range in every direction and allow ready communication between members, which was usually advised when the composition or position of enemy forces were uncertain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 137 ABY, a squad in the 407th Stormtrooper Division consisted of four troopers led by a sergeant.

They were organized in five-man units known as lances, with each trooper being expected to care for his own mount\u2014usually a one-seater speeder bike like the Aratech 74-Z, although some lances combined one bike with a pair of two-seat flyers. Additionally, although part of the Stormtrooper Corps, scout troopers were often integrated into the Imperial Army order-of-battle: two lances, together known as a scout squadron, were combined with two infantry squads in each platoon of a Repulsorlift Battalion's scout troop, while the scout platoon of a special missions company consisted entirely of biker scouts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Other military forces"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, squads comparable to those of Imperial forces served as the most basic component elements of Rebel Alliance SpecForces regiments, but for active duty, mission-specific units were formed with little regard for the nominal roster or formal organizational doctrine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force, a standard squad apparently numbered six warriors, divided into two half-squads of three."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among the Mandalorians, squads (such as Viper Alpha, Vertigo, and Headhunter) were larger than in other armed forces; this may be due to the fact that the Mandalorians seemed to use \"squad\" and \"company\" interchangeably."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For Yuuzhan Vong warriors, three squads composed a unit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
