It could be found on the High Grounds level of the Rryatt Trail. It was a level 56 Gold Chevron elite, which meant that it was much stronger and tougher than normal moufs and even posed a threat to players with higher levels. It was not involved in any quest, but the players had to cross the area where Rotclaw and a group of other moufs could be found in order to reach the next level of the Rryatt trail."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
