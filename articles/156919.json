In 10 BBY, Governor Kugg kept his planet in a constants state of fear by using a powerful Destroyer droid to terrorize the citizens and demand exorbitant taxes from them. A young boy named Jost Ellon hoped to challenge Kugg's droid with an old Ranger X-One defense robot, but a defeated Head Councilman Althon dissuaded him, leaving Ellon dejected. The old man intervened and gave Ellon a rousing speech, calling on the memory of their forefathers' fights against tyranny and telling Ellon to do what was in his heart."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
