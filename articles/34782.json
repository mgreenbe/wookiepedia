Not all went according to plan, however, as Bastila survived and was able to use the Force to save the spark of life that still lay within the dying Revan. With his mind nearly destroyed by injuries suffered from the bombardment, he was captured by the Jedi and whisked to the safety of the Dantooine Jedi Enclave. The ship was destroyed soon afterward."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
