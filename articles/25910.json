He was aided by a Gotal assistant, who grabbed an unsuspecting Papanoida, followed by her sister. The two were separated, and with the help of Pantoran Senator Riyo Chuchi and Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, Chi Eekway Papanoida was rescued from Separatist clutches."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Papanoida did contact her father at the Galaxies Opera House during the performance of Squid Lake to receive important information for the Loyalists. She was accompanied by her friend and advisor Terr Taneel, who was actually keeping a close eye on her; Taneel secretly harbored fears Papanoida had ambitions to politically outshine her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chi was a member of the group of senators, including Bail Prestor Organa and Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who had grown worried of the immense power Palpatine had been given by the Galactic Senate. Senator Amidala suggested they propose the ideas to the Jedi Order, but Eekway urged them to be patient. The rest of the senators believed they should see what they could accomplish in the Senate first, in the hopes that Palpatine would see that there was opposition to his methods."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a young and impetuous Pantoran, Senator Chi Eekway Papanoida's sphere of control included areas of space dominated by unallied trader guilds that often stretched the limits of Republic law. She learned valuable lessons trying to govern citizens who cherished their frontier spirit. It spoke well of her skills to have earned the respect of a people well known for their disdain for government. Her devotion to Wroonian spirituality\u2014visible in details found in the ornate molf-tasseled overcloak she wore\u2014helped her earn support and respect. Papanoida's near-supernatural levels of empathy helped her quell even the most contentious of political disputes. Perhaps her tenure during a time when an overriding Republic was drawing power away from the individual sectors colored the views of her fiercely independent constituents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For her exposure to a rough-and-tumble culture of law-benders, Papanoida learned the art of the bluff and a diplomatic style more confrontational than the usual measured approaches found in the Senate. In heated exchanges, she has even been known to drop veiled hints at the power her allies could bring to a dispute."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chi Eekway Papanoida was portrayed by one of George Lucas's daughters, Katie Lucas.
