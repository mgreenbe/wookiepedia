In some respects, its ideology was very similar to Darth Sidious' version of a New Order. For example, both Sith Lords desired to promote and enforce the absolute rule of the Sith through the dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Chief of State and Dark Lord of the Sith, Caedus intended to establish a new era throughout the galaxy; an era marked by peace and security, absent of large-scale war and division, ruling a new Empire. His vision of harmony would be protected through martial enforcement, with the Galactic Alliance Guard serving as his chief enforcers. Though the Sith Lord originally sought to corrupt his young cousin, the Jedi Ben Skywalker, Caedus ultimately felt that he was destined to rule the galaxy with Tahiri Veila as his apprentice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Order of Darth Caedus ultimately came to a premature end when Caedus was killed in 41 ABY during the Battle of Shedu Maad. With the death of the Dark Lord of the Sith and the capture of his apprentice, the Second Galactic Civil War came to an end and Caedus' Sith Order was dissolved."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
