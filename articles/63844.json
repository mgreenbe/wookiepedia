During the Clone Wars, the Shadowblade, a Separatist cruiser and superweapon, was armed with a hyper-point destablizer. Around 20 BBY, the Shadowblade and its hyper-point destablizer were seemingly destroyed following an attack by the Galactic Republic on Separatist forces in the Kro'eval system, where the Shadowblade was under construction. However, the warship secretly survived the battle and later reappeared in the Cularin system in 19 BBY, where it was drawn into a temporal rift by Jedi Master Darrus Jeht and never seen again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hyper-point destablizer was referenced in the 2005 short story Dark Soul by August and Cynthia Hahn. The short story provided no detail on the nature of the hyper-point destablizer other than noting it as the armament of the Shadowblade. While the story described the Shadowblade as a superweapon, it did not clarify whether it was the vessel's hyper-point destablizer weapons specifically that resulted in the warship being classified as a superweapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
