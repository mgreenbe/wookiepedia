This was a popular feature among miners, as it allowed a user to smash through rocks and dense metal veins with ease. They also became popular melee weapons early in the history of the Galactic Empire, when mining companies found themselves in possession of the Empire and the miners fought back with what was on hand; even heavily armored opponents could find themselves flying across a room when confronted with this weapon, their armor shattered, making it well suited for combat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
