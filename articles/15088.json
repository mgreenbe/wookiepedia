In this remote region of space the Empire constructed a secret space station, where were studied biological weapons. The Empire's chemical weapons division had developed a deadly new poison, the Ziroxin-12, and the chemical was being produced in massive quantities there. However the Republic discovered the Sith's plans and sent the Coruscant Aegis, supported by Thranta starship, to spearhead assault on the Empire's chemical station. The Republic fought very well destroying the station and all stores of Ziroxin-12."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
