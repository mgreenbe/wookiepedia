Members of the Legion possessed a cult-like devotion to Vago, proudly marching into battle in his name as he led them to numerous victories, and Vago treated his legionnaires as he would as his own children. They were deployed on Taris and established the 75th Legion forward camp, where they planned tactics and were responsible for neutralizing some of the Galactic Republic operations on the Tularan Marsh, weakening the Taris Resettlement Initiative significantly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
