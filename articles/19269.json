As sure as young Booster was anything, he was independent\u2014though his earliest work, honest or otherwise, involved piloting freighters for large corporations, he soon resolved to start his own shipping ventures, independent of anyone's authority but his own. The result was something less than outright success: more than one of his enterprises were quickly driven into the ground, and Terrik soon found himself burdened with enormous debts and no legal way to ensure his continued survival."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Running from a team of bounty hunters in the freighter Starwayman\u2014which he had been forced to steal to effect his getaway\u2014Terrik ended up on the Outer Rim Territories planet Borlov, where he would experience the first of many odd turns of luck. He encountered an avian Borlovian noble, Llollulion, who was intrigued by stories of Terrik's haphazard lifestyle. Something of a rogue amongst his own introverted species, Llollulion longed to escape Borlov and see the galaxy, and Terrik seemed to be the perfect means toward that end. He used his extensive fortune to pay off Terrik's debtors\u2014and purchase Starwayman outright\u2014on the condition that Terrik take him on as a copilot. Happy for the company, and grateful for the financial assistance, Terrik agreed. While the Separatist Crisis was making headlines on the galactic scene, Terrik and Llollulion began a life of steady, if less-than-reputable, work as smugglers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The law would eventually catch up to them, however, and Llollulion found himself locked up in the CoCo District Constabulary on Coruscant, held on various smuggling-related charges.

Starwayman made a series of jumps into the edge of the Unknown Regions in the hopes of shaking the Imperials, but Parck, eager to be rid of what he saw as a tedious assignment, would not be shaken. As a desperate last-minute gamble, Terrik took his ship to ground on a nearby planet, hoping to hide amidst the unnamed world's dense jungle. Parck continued his pursuit, and would certainly have captured Starwayman were it not for the intervention of a mysterious alien - a Chiss male who would later be known as Thrawn. Who had been marooned on the island years earlier. Viewing the alien's tactical genius as a far more important prize than a couple of two-bit smugglers, Parck packed up his forces and left without a second thought, leaving Terrik to wonder at his continued good fortune."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Family man"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next several years, Terrik would continue doing business for the rebels\u2014and profiting heavily from it\u2014but everything else in his life would soon change. Undoubtedly the biggest change was his marriage to a woman named Jysella and the subsequent birth of his daughter, Mirax. Now that he had a family to take care of, Terrik abandoned his nomadic ways and began using Corellia as his base of operations. Llollulion, however, was not done seeing the galaxy, and the two parted ways. It is possible that Llollulion took Starwayman with him upon his departure\u2014the ship was legally his, after all\u2014because around this time Terrik acquired a new ship, the Baudo-class star yacht Pulsar Skate; as well as a new copilot, the tentacled alien Polipe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just when things were leveling out for Terrik, however, his wife met a sudden end. Finding himself solely responsible for Mirax's welfare, Terrik had to rethink the way he conducted business; having a stationary base of operations already made it easier for the authorities to keep track of him, and the last thing Terrik wanted was CorSec showing up at his door and taking Mirax away while he was off on a job. Luckily, he had good friends in Jagged and Zena Antilles, the couple who operated Corellia's Gus Treta orbital refueling station. He often left Mirax in the Antilles's care during smuggling runs, though just as often, he would bring Mirax and the Antilles's son Wedge along for the ride. Spending many of their young years in each other's company, Mirax and Wedge would become good friends; Terrik and the Antilles began to regard each other's children as if they were their own. When Gus Treta was destroyed by careless pirates in a hurried escape from the system, Terrik loaned Wedge, who had been onboard Pulsar Skate at the time, a Z-95 Headhunter, making no move to stop Wedge from exacting revenge for his parents' deaths."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tragedies aside, business continued to go well. At some point Terrik's paths had crossed the business of Talon Karrde, it greatly irritated the information broker, to the point that Karrde was forced to hire a spacer to deliver to Terrik a message to stay out of his business. Terrik held no respect from Karrde and furiously attacked the messenger, but lost and was knocked unconscious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Terrik became an expert at staying one step ahead of the law, forming something of a nemesis in CorSec inspector Hal Horn. Though they hid it well, both Terrik and Horn grudgingly respected the other's tenacity, and it was an emotional day when, in 2 BBY, Terrik was finally caught and tried.

The time affected him profoundly, both mentally and physically\u2014always a large man, the constant hard work piled more and more muscle onto his frame and left him a true powerhouse of a Human being, able to lift another man clear off the ground by the scruff of his neck. Somewhere along the line he would lose his left eye, which was replaced by a large, conspicuous red prosthetic, further adding to his intimidation factor. The hardship, though, was not what troubled Terrik most of all. He was an adventurous soul, after all, and he found Kessel to be, more than anything else, profoundly boring. The only thing that kept him mentally sound during the tedium was his hatred for Hal Horn, whom he cursed with every breath. Unlike Horn himself, it would be some time before Terrik could put their feud behind him\u2014a process made more difficult by the fact that Horn would be killed in the line of duty by the bounty hunter Bossk before Terrik's release."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A lower profile"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several months after the Battle of Hoth, Booster Terrik once again found himself a free man. He emerged, however, into a vastly different galaxy\u2014Wedge had run off with the Rebellion, and Mirax had grown into a capable young woman, one who had personally held Terrik's smuggling operations together\u2014at least, what remained of them after Jorj Car'das and Talon Karrde had finished picking them apart. At first, Terrik set out to pick up where he had left off, but one trip in Pulsar Skate showed just how much he himself had changed. Hyperspace was suddenly too lonely; the confines of Skate too reminiscent of his time in the mines. Terrik also found that he had lost some of his appetite for adventure\u2014though only some. He gave Skate to Mirax and her copilot, Liat Tsayv, to continue its usual operations, and started working primarily as an intermediary for his friends' businesses. This new lifestyle allowed Terrik a measure of security, not to mention keeping him mobile\u2014even more so than could Skate\u2014and in good company."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Keeping mobile, however, meant that he wouldn't get to see his daughter very often. As the years went on, and the galaxy continued to change around him, Terrik went through probably the most leisurely stretch of his life, and sure enough, he found himself longing once again for excitement. That excitement would come in 7 ABY, when he found himself reunited with Mirax on Tatooine in the home of Huff Darklighter, where he had been bargaining for a cache of old weaponry from the Empire's Eidolon Base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Terrik's joy at seeing his daughter again was blunted, however, by her companion\u2014Corran Horn, the son of the man who had sent him to Kessel. Horn barged into the negotiations and, not realizing who he was talking to, tried to scare Terrik off by pointing out\u2014to Mirax's father\u2014who Mirax's father was. Terrik didn't know whether to laugh or throttle the man, and finding out that he was not just Mirax's business partner, but her romantic interest, didn't help matters. Mirax quickly defused the situation, however, by pointing out that they were there on Wedge's behalf. Wedge, alongside Corran and the rest of Rogue Squadron, had resigned his commission in the New Republic military and taken up a personal campaign against former Director of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard, who had set herself up at the head of a bacta cartel on the planet Thyferra. Terrik decided that whatever Wedge wanted, Wedge should get, and persuaded Darklighter to give the weapons to Mirax at a vastly reduced price\u2014and only for that much because Mirax refused to take them for free."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Intrigued by his daughter's new crusade, Terrik accompanied her back to Yag'Dhul, where the Rogues had set up shop in the abandoned space station, Yag-prime. Wedge was thrilled to see Terrik again, and immediately set about finding him a role in their operation, and in the end, Terrik would settle for nothing less than running the entire station\u2014Wedge had planned on using it as a base and little else; Terrik, on the other hand, convinced him to keep the place running as a supply depot, and began instituting expert\u2014if occasionally draconian\u2014measures for bringing in as much of a profit as possible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sure enough, under Terrik's management, the station flourished. The Rogues underwent a series of raids on Isard's bacta supplies on nearby worlds such as Qretu 5, aided by smuggler allies of Terrik's who were then allowed to keep the captured bacta, provided they spent the money they made on supplies from the Yag'Dhul station\u2014everybody won, except for Isard. As his and Wedge's master plan for confronting Isard began to take shape, Terrik saw to the acquisition of a great deal of weaponry, both for the station itself and for the Rogues' small but growing armada. From Talon Karrde he obtained hundreds of torpedo sensor packages and launch tubes, and many thousands of projectiles; more than the station could possibly employ. He also acquired a large number of tractor beams, and a gravity well projector, which was mounted on the station itself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a slow buildup of mat\u00e9riel commenced on both sides of the Bacta War, another, more subtle battle was being fought\u2014one of information. During a rendezvous with Karrde's people in the Alderaan system, one for which Terrik himself was present aboard Pulsar Skate, an Imperial force ambushed the Rogues with the help of the Immobilizer 418 cruiser Aggregator. Only the fortuitous arrival of the automated Thranta-class War Cruiser Valiant, believing Rogue pilot Tycho Celchu to be Another Chance due to his antiquated Alderaanian IFF code, saved the Rogues from certain doom. Aggregator fled, and the Rogues destroyed Isard's Corrupter before it could escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fearing another engagement with the Interdictor, which Isard had leased from High Admiral Treuten Teradoc, Terrik began buying up maintenance parts for Interdictor cruisers with the intention of creating a rumor that the next time someone lent one to Isard, the Rogues planned on taking it. In the meantime, however, there was a more pressing matter\u2014since no one but Terrik, Mirax and the Rogues had known where the Alderaan rendezvous was to take place, the ambush meant that there was a spy in Karrde's organization. Karrde quickly identified the culprit as his aide Melina Carniss, but before he could eliminate her, Terrik leveraged his purchase of the gravity well projector against her continued survival, with the aim of feeding her false information."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually word reached the Rogues that Isard was forcing their hand\u2014she began rounding up Thyferran Vratix civilians and threatened to kill them if resistance to her regime hadn't ceased in one month.

Carniss left a beacon in the system, and in no time at all, the Star Destroyers Virulence and Lusankya arrived in the system ready to pick the station clean.

The ship's captain, Joak Drysso, was not amused. He made ready to obliterate the station and effect an escape, when Lusankya suddenly found itself the target of three hundred proton torpedoes\u2014enough to blast his ship into oblivion. Just when his doom seemed imminent, however, Captain Lakwii Varrscha of Virulence selflessly moved her ship in front of Lusankya, freeing it from the tractor beams' grip. Drysso thanked Varrscha for her sacrifice and made a beeline out of the system and back to Thyferra. Terrik, aided by the fortuitous arrival of a New Republic flight group under the command of Pash Cracken, was able to convince Captain Varrscha to surrender Virulence without a fight, and Terrik immediately proceeded to load it up with his people and Cracken's fighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time Terrik and Cracken arrived at Thyferra, the battle was well under way. Captain Drysso could not believe his good luck when he saw Virulence emerge from hyperspace, but his enthusiasm was short-lived as the ship began pumping A-wings into space. Terrik's arrival, coupled with the recently-defected Sair Yonka's Freedom, and the Rogues' numerous freighters\u2014loaded to the brim with the missiles and torpedoes that were not on Yag-prime station, made short work of Lusankya, and the battle was soon finished, with Isard apparently killed in the act of escaping."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fighting over, New Republic General Airen Cracken arrived to do cleanup work, and from Terrik's point of view, to take credit for the whole operation. One point of contention on which Terrik was particularly stuck was the fate of Virulence\u2014while it had been surrendered to him personally, the arrival of Pash Cracken's unit had played enough of a role in Varrscha's decision that the government had at least a partial claim of ownership\u2014besides which, Cracken wasn't about to leave a fully armed warship in the hands of a civilian. Luckily, Talon Karrde was on hand to broker a deal that, naturally, made everyone happy. Karrde would purchase the bulk of Virulence's weapons from Terrik, and sell them to Cracken; Terrik, in turn, would use the money he made off of the weapons to buy out the New Republic's share in the ship.

The ship was left with a mere ten turbolaser batteries, but otherwise, she was in excellent condition\u2014Terrik even managed to hang onto a portion of the ship's TIE fighter complement. Still every bit as thrifty as he had been as the operator of Yag-prime station, he left the TIEs' ceiling racks in place to complement the usual docking space on the hangar bay's floor; adding customized suspension collars to a number of his smaller ships to ensure that no available corner of the bay went to waste. He retained the Flag Hangar as a more private hangar as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rest of Venture became one of the galaxy's largest mobile entertainment bazaars\u2014the go-to location for thrill seekers, traders, and scoundrels alike. The ship was divided into three levels: Black, Blue, and Diamond.

A large central courtyard linked the Blue and Diamond levels; in the center of the courtyard was an enormous holographic reenactment of the Bacta War played on loop\u2014with Terrik's role slightly enhanced. At the bottom of the ship was Black Level. Not much information was spread around about Black Level; probably because most of its clientele weren't in the business of idle chitchat. Suffice it to say, if you needed something under less-than-legitimate circumstances\u2014and if you had the guts\u2014Black was where you wanted to go."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Terrik could not have been more proud of his new home, managing an entire Imperial II-class Star Destroyer was an enormous feat, even for someone like him.

Accompanied by Mirax and New Republic Intelligence agent Iella Wessiri, and speaking as \"acting captain\" of Lusankya, Terrik informed Isard that the jig was up, and Wessiri attempted to place her under arrest.

When word had reached Borsk Fey'lya that Asyr and fellow Rogue Gavin Darklighter planned on getting married and adopting a Bothan child, he, to say the least, had not been amused. Though it would mean breaking Gavin's heart, Asyr opted to assume a more undercover role in Bothan society and work to change the dirty politics Fey'lya had come to represent. Her \"death\" did not stop Fey'lya from trying to impose his politics on her, however, and upon hearing the news from Distna, Fey'lya traveled to Venture with the intention of bribing Terrik into obtaining a suitable replacement body\u2014Asyr's purportedly having been destroyed in the battle\u2014to be interred in a hero's monument on Bothawui.

Terrik had not taken well to Mirax's relationship with Corran, and was even less pleased when the two were married at Thyferra aboard the freshly-captured Lusankya\u2014without even telling him beforehand\u2014so when Corran responded to her abduction by spending more than two months on Yavin 4 training at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum, their meeting was considerably ugly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Terrik had in fact known about Mirax's capture from the beginning\u2014she had been working out of Venture at the time, using her father's resources to help Airen Cracken keep tabs on the Invids' activities\u2014he augmented his anger over Corran not coming straight to him with the news by pretending to have only just found out. The entire confrontation was designed to test both Corran's commitment to his daughter and his willingness to stand up for his decisions in the face of Terrik's overwhelming force of personality, and Corran not only figured out Terrik's ruse, but passed the test on all accounts.

The ambush was thwarted by Corran using his Jedi and piloting skills, and proved to be a windfall for their search\u2014Terrik tracked the Eyttyrmin Batiiv to the planet Courkrus from the drive signature of a Corellian corvette used by the pirates, and from there Corran was led to the Invids' base on Susevfi. Corran infiltrated the Invids and during the rescue of Mirax, Booster arrived aboard the Venture. Corran fought his way into the pirates' compound, rescued Mirax, and when Tavira turned to engage Booster on board her flagship Star Destroyer Invidious, ready to turn the lesser-armed Errant Venture to scrap, Corran used the Force to project an image of the Lusankya into Tavira's mind. To further tease her paranoia, he added an image of the recently-destroyed Sun Crusher into the mix, causing Tavira to flee the system. Terrik was now firmly convinced that Corran would be an acceptable son-in-law\u2014though he wouldn't dare say so in his presence\u2014and two years later, Corran and Mirax gave him the gift of a grandchild, a Force-sensitive boy named Valin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next several years were a mixed bag for Terrik and Venture.

He ordered the Venture to pivot as far toward maximum firing position as the tractor beams allowed, then opened fire on the nearest beams. Once free, Bel Iblis intended to ram Thrawn's Relentless, taking what he believed to be the Imperial's most valuable asset out of the equation. The effort was for nothing; for every tractor beam Venture took out, two more took its place."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just when it looked like Yaga Minor would indeed be the Venture's last stop, Talon Karrde arrived in the system, came through the defensive perimeter\u2014aided by high-level Imperial codes\u2014and dropped Fleet Admiral Gilad Pellaeon off on Relentless, having furnished him with proof of Disra's and Tierce's deception. With the Thrawn pretender revealed as the con man Flim, Pellaeon assumed control of the Imperial forces, and ordered an immediate cease-fire.

Though quite a thing to behold, the new paint job meant that no one would mistake her for an official warship ever again. His newfound economic security may have also prompted Terrik to splurge on a cloned left eye to replace his prosthetic, because he appeared at Luke and Mara's wedding soon after looking good as new. Any softening of his appearance was certainly well-timed\u2014Mirax quickly put him to work keeping an eye on the large number of children attending the wedding; a role he would revisit with some success in the future."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another new interest Terrik acquired during this period was superweapons. He spent a large amount of money purchasing mysterious technology from the Hutts, purported to have its origins in Durga's failed Darksaber project, which he had installed along Venture's central spine straight through to the bow.

The invasion of the Yuuzhan Vong, however, shattered this peace. Terrik largely stayed out of the war in the beginning, which served Corran Horn well upon his self-imposed exile in the wake of the Battle of Ithor in 25 ABY; he subsequently spent around a year away from the New Jedi Order, traveling the galaxy aboard Errant Venture alongside Mirax. He contributed to the war effort by running guns for the Hutt underground, albeit at a profit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually the Jedi came looking, though when they came it was Terrik and his ship they needed. Evidence of an imminent Yuuzhan Vong/Peace Brigade attack on the Jedi Praxeum had convinced Luke Skywalker to send Jacen and Jaina Solo out in search of Terrik to supplement the academy's defense; Anakin Solo and Tahiri Veila were already on Yavin 4, and Talon Karrde had agreed to lend a handful of ships, including his own Wild Karrde, to the evacuation effort, but the amount of firepower the enemy had brought to bear could only be countered by Errant Venture\u2014especially since the New Republic government had recently taken steps to distance itself from the Jedi. Karrde's ships took a considerable beating in the ensuing battle, and just when all seemed lost, Venture appeared and blasted its way into the maelstrom. Furious over the threat to the students\u2014his grandson Valin being among their number\u2014Terrik unleashed his secret weapon, obliterating the Yuuzhan Vong force's flagship in a sudden flash of light.

The Jedi students\u2014over thirty of them altogether\u2014were brought aboard Venture, along with Anakin's team from the ground, and she fled into hyperspace to parts unknown. With no safe harbor for the Jedi yet in place, Venture became a mobile Jedi Academy, essentially a modern-day Chu'unthor. For the rest of the war, Booster Terrik was at last forced to put others' needs ahead of his own business interests; indeed, he now had one of the most significant responsibilities in the galaxy. He began jumping Venture randomly around the galaxy to keep the enemy from tracking it, going so far as to send out smaller ships to obtain supplies and fuel\u2014and occasionally sending out Nawara Ven to assist endangered Jedi students on planets like Trogan. For months, the ship didn't go near a civilized system; the only beings who could find it were Jedi, thanks to a special proprietary homing beacon provided and installed by Karrde."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the meantime, Skywalker sent Jedi Knights Kam and Tionne Solusar into the Deep Core to search for a new haven\u2014one that would be impossible to locate without the Force.

Ben Skywalker began his life in the Errant Venture's medbay, with Terrik, Jedi healer Cilghal and others waiting nearby. He was soon ushered away to The Maw, located at the opposite end of the Jedi's \"Great River\" of safe passage from Eclipse.

Viewing the New Republic as essentially dead, Wedge proposed that the leaders of the group\u2014himself, the Skywalkers and Solos, Terrik, and a handful of others\u2014start fighting the war as a sort of new Rebellion, independent of anyone else's authority. Among other things, this new strategy meant that Terrik was free to arm his ship however he saw fit; over thirty turbolasers and ion cannons were promptly transferred from Lusankya to Errant Venture.

Idly discussing the new landscape of the galaxy from their own, perhaps less-reputable point of view, Terrik and the others came to the conclusion that it was high time they moved away from their shadier dealings\u2014spice values had plummeted since the decimation of Hutt Space, after all\u2014and focus on legitimate business.

Luke did so at the request of his sister Leia and Booster (who intended to use the Venture as a place to spy on GA troops and gather intelligence on Jacen) knowing full well that Jacen would do the exact opposite of what his uncle demanded. Booster and the Venture made a great deal of profit, as well as collected some useful intelligence, before being forced away by a battle with Confederate Forces. Booster's daughter Mirax remained on the Venture with him to learn the business as his heir, as did Iella and Myri Antilles who aided their friends in the war effort by posing as card dealers and secretly gathering information. Booster offered Myri a full-time position as a dealer; her being so good that her father Wedge Antilles commented to Luke Skywalker that she would be the first Antilles' to become rich.

Under directions from the Jedi, Booster hosted a sabacc tournament, the Tendrando Arms Celebrity Sabacc Charity Challenge, aboard his Star Destroyer, holding many Coruscanti elite hostage. He then provided a diversion by blasting orbital mirrors to draw the Sixth Fleet's attention away from the Jedi Temple so they could launch their StealthX wing.
