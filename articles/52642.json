It was the homeworld of the Gand species. Small pocket colonies covered the surface, separated by kilometers of thick mists, all of which were ruled by the Gand's long-standing totalitarian government. Commerce and trade were conducted on any of the five orbiting space stations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A gaseous planet, Gand's atmosphere was comprised primarily of ammonia, which made it lethal to most galactic lifeforms. At some point, however, the Sith had invaded the planet prior to the arrival of the Exiles on Korriban. Gand was discovered prior to 3951 BBY, during the Kanz Disorders. In the year 3668 BBY, Yuun was born on the world. The planet remained independent of the Galactic Republic throughout the Clone Wars. The isolated world was not located on any major hyperlanes and was not involved in the spice trade. Largely overlooked, the planet was later overrun by the Galactic Empire, whose agents brought sophisticated sensor equipment on-world, to the detriment of the native findsmen. During the Galactic Civil War, Gand remained uninvolved in the affairs, aside from the participation of individuals. In recent years, the planet escaped invasion during the Yuuzhan Vong War, and had no participation in the Second Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
