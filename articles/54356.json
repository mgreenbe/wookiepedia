Having previously been an Imperial slave to Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, he was freed by Captain Juno Eclipse and was recruited to join the Rebellion. Later, he fought alongside Renegade Squadron and was once captured by bounty hunter Boba Fett. During the Battle of Endor, later revealed to be a trap for him and the Alliance, he led Alliance naval forces against the Death Star II. He held the distinction of having been the Supreme Commander of the New Republic Defense Force for nearly two decades and defeating two Imperial Grand Admirals, Osvald Teshik and Peccati Syn, along with numerous other threats.

During that time, he held the rank of Captain in charge of the Mon Calamari Guard and was the chief military adviser to King Yos Kolina and then to the young and inexperienced Prince Lee-Char. When Separatist troublemaker Riff Tamson began advising the Quarren to take up arms, Ackbar requested an envoy from the Republic come to Dac to help steer the troubled planet away from an inevitable war. His duty then was to bring peace with the Quarren, and after the attack, protect Prince Lee-Char. During the battle, Ackbar at the behest Mon Calamari Senator Meena Tills protected the prince during the first attack of the Quarren and Separatist Commander Riff Tamson's droids. Ackbar was successful in his defense of the capital, but Tamson brought in reinforcements in the form of Hydroid Medusas. Though the prince said that they should stay, Ackbar told him that there are times to fight, and times to retreat, with this battle being a time to retreat.

Ackbar initially believed that the establishment of the New Order would lead to a restoration of law and justice, but he was soon dispelled of this illusion when the Empire dispatched a fleet to invade Mon Calamari; Dac's peaceful scientific and cultural achievements rendered it a target that had to be suppressed to preserve the idea of Human superiority. Ackbar attempted to negotiate with the hostile Imperial forces to no avail, and the Empire forced both the Mon Calamari and the Quarren into slavery. Ackbar subsequently contributed to the formation of a resistance movement, which successfully drove the Empire offworld. The resistance's victory proved to be only temporary, however, and Ackbar was captured following the Empire's counterattack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ackbar was initially to serve as an interpreter for the Imperial fleet officer who commanded the subjugation of Mon Calamari, but the officer offered Ackbar to his superior, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, in an attempt to win Tarkin's favor. Tarkin accepted the gift, and in 5 BBY, Ackbar was assigned to Tarkin as a valet\u2013a slave in all but name. During his service to Tarkin, Ackbar observed and absorbed whatever information he could about the Empire, taking a particular interest in military data. Cultivating a placid appearance, Ackbar gained knowledge of Imperial theories of war and became aware of a growing rebellion against the Empire. By observing Tarkin, who found enjoyment in explaining to Ackbar his plans to enslave more worlds, Ackbar also acquired knowledge of space warfare tactics, including Tarkin's own preferred strategies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The existence of a broader resistance movement appealed to Ackbar\u2013although Tarkin's confidence in the Empire's invulnerability unnerved him\u2013and he eventually made contact with the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Ackbar's position made him an ideal spy, with his circumstances occasionally allowing him to examine secret documents, and he sought to learn everything he could about Imperial strategy and tactics. Over a period of many months, Ackbar provided the Alliance with valuable intelligence regarding the Death Star project. However, the information Ackbar could find regarding the weapon was meager, and he learned nothing of it other than its supposed capability of destroying entire worlds. Ackbar later discovered that he was to accompany Tarkin to the site of the very project he had been investigating, and piloted Tarkin and chief engineer Bevel Lemelisk, who found Tarkin's attachment to the Calamarian slave baffling, to the Death Star construction site in a Lambda-class shuttle."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Liberation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Death Star's completion, Ackbar was compelled to pilot Tarkin and Lemelisk again to the superweapon's location in the Horuz system.

Freed from the Empire, Ackbar, now a captain, declared his support for the Alliance and returned to Dac with the intention of stirring its people into a new revolt. However, his efforts were hindered by their lack of morale, and his attempts to create an air force were thwarted by the 181st Imperial Fighter Wing, which shot down and destroyed his equipment. Ackbar led Alliance forces in their first victory against the Imperial Navy at the Battle of Turkana, in which his knowledge of Imperial tactics was a crucial factor; this advantage also proved useful to the Alliance in other early victories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Empire frequently used Nebulon-B escort frigates to defend its supply convoys\u2013a tactic that threatened to cripple the Alliance by degrading its ability to raid Imperial ships for supplies\u2013and Ackbar decided that the Alliance's options were to dispatch its few capital ships or to design a new starfighter for the specific purpose of combat with Nebulon-B's. Commander Ackbar was ultimately commissioned to design a new starfighter for the Alliance\u2013one which would be capable of facing vessels as large and well-armed as frigates. To this end, Ackbar attempted to enlist the aid of the insectoid Verpine, who were renowned shipbuilders from the Roche system. Ackbar failed to persuade the Verpine to join the Alliance, but he did secure their commitment to the starfighter project. Project Shantipole was initiated deep in the Roche asteroid belt, leading to the creation of the B-wing\u2013which Commander Ackbar personally designed with the aid of Verpine shipbuilders from Slayn & Korpil. Ackbar provided a description of the type of ship he desired to the Verpine, who constructed two prototypes and showed a team of engineers under Ackbar's command how to build more of the starfighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ackbar returned to Dac with Senator Bail Organa and the former Imperial Juno Eclipse to help unite the Mon Calamari and the Quarren and galvanize the resistance movement. Ackbar also invited Seggor Tels, the infamous Quarren responsible for disarming the planetary shields causing the first Imperial occupation of Dac, to join in his strategy. United, the group entered Heurkea, one of the floating cities. Once there, PROXY, an Imperial droid designed with Hologram technology, disguised himself as Evir Derricote, commander of the 181st Imperial Fighter Wing. As Derricote, Proxy was able to throw off suspicion while the others planted explosives. As Juno counted off the minutes, Organa and Tels confronted the real Derricote. As Ackbar charged the officer with delivering a message from the resistance to the Emperor, two dozen stormtroopers encircled the conspirators.

Ackbar angrily replied he would never be his slave again. The timers expired, triggering explosions throughout the city and causing the Grand Moff to think the 181st Wing was responsible. As the Rebels proceeded to open fire at the retreating stormtroopers, PROXY took Tarkin's figure and led the stormtroopers away from the real Moff. Despite Ackbar's disappointment at not being able to capture Tarkin, the plan was a success. It was soon revealed that Tels had not truly betrayed them again, and that he had sought to use the opportunity before the timed detonations expired in order to capture Tarkin.

However, Ackbar's forces suffered an Imperial attack at the rendezvous point and were forced to flee their freighter in escape pods moments before the vessel's destruction. Ackbar and his men subsequently landed on the muddy planet Daluuj, where giant worms dragged their escape pods to the bottom of a mud lake; they fought back against the creatures, only to find that they were impervious to blaster fire. Ackbar and his crew were able to transmit a distress beacon, which led to their discovery by Organa, who was accompanied by Captain Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.

The Mon Calamari failed to recover the ship, but after Skywalker and Solo reported that the Imperials were approaching them from across the lake, Ackbar devised a new plan; theorizing that the noises produced by heavy machinery triggered aggressive behavior in the worms, he sent his Mon Calamari into the lake again in preparation for the coming Imperial attack. Ackbar's hopes were proved correct when the worms rose above the lake's surface to destroy the Imperial vehicles, releasing their hold on the Falcon in the process. Ackbar and his allies then departed Daluuj in the Falcon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Imperial Navy blockaded Massassi Base, Ackbar led the Mon Calamari fleet in a feint at the Vallusk Cluster, creating the distraction needed by the Rebels at Massassi Station to run the blockade and evacuate the Yavin system."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Return to Dantooine"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the destruction of the Rebel base on Yavin 4, Ackbar personally led scouting parties to other planets to investigate potential bases.

Renegade Squadron saved his life by bringing him a bacta tank."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Until a permanent base could be established, Ackbar secretly joined Mon Mothma and Leia Organa on Dantooine to reestablish a temporary presence in the formerly abandoned Rebel base. During his time at the base, Captain Ackbar oversaw plans to safely land a few damaged Corellian corvettes. However, because Dantooine was still under Imperial rule, Ackbar required a distraction to allow the corvettes to land. To accomplish this, Ackbar assigned a special operative the task of launching an attack on a squad of stormtroopers on the other side of the planet. The operative successfully killed three stormtroopers during the attack. While the operative was engaging these Imperials, the Empire sent several squads in their direction, diverting their sensors. This allowed enough time for the corvettes to land, become camouflaged, and undergo secret repairs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the successful attack, a number of locals stepped forward to voice their sympathy for the Rebel cause. One person in particular offered to sell the Rebellion some Imperial information. To represent the Alliance in this deal, Ackbar sent his operative to meet with the sympathizer. To Ackbar's dismay however, the sympathizer actually turned out to be bounty hunter dispatched by the Empire. In any case, the Rebel operative managed to kill the bounty hunter. To make matters better for Ackbar, the incompetent bounty hunter actually had on him real information regarding guard schedules. Ackbar asked his operative to deliver this pertinent information to a Rebel spy named Teria Alessie for review."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Ackbar received confirmation from Alessie that the information was real. The datapad possessed by the bounty hunter contained a comprehensive list of flight paths and guard changes, including Star Destroyer patrols around the planet, names of Imperials officers in command, and so forth. Believing this information could change the tide of the war in the Rebellion's favor, Ackbar eagerly contacted Admiral Garm Bel Iblis, who sent an aide of his named Jeremes Kelton to pick up the data.

Ackbar assembled a team to take care of the general, who was being escorted by a large number of unarmed, rookiee stormtroopers. In the meantime, Ackbar's operative was first sent to attack the general's smaller group of armed stormtroopers. To make it look like the operative was acting alone, Ackbar went so far as to have the Rebels leave a decoy body, so that the Empire would believe the operative did not survive the attack. The plan worked, goading the pompous general into a false illusion of success, and securing the secrecy of the Rebel base on Dantooine for a while longer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From the confines of their secret base on Dantooine, Ackbar later received contact from an Imperial officer, a lieutenant by the name of Amminius Goodner, expressing his interest in aiding the Rebellion. Fearing a trap, but willing to see what the lieutenant had to offer, Ackbar dispatched yet another operative to meet with him in the Taikaha Hills of Dantooine. Sure enough, Ackbar's fear proved true, when Lieutenant Goodner revealed his true loyalty to the Empire. During the meetup, Goodner attacked Ackbar's operative, only to be killed during the ensuing firefight. When the operative returned to report the news, Ackbar expressed his dismay, but moved on quickly to other matters. After the debacle with the treacherous Imperial officer, Ackbar sent his operative to activate a communications array to the south of their hideout in order to send an important transmission to General Dodonna on Yavin 4. After activating the communications array, Ackbar's operative was ambushed by an Imperial captain named Halron Yehr and six shadow assault stormtroopers.

Fearing that the Alliance would not survive if both its fleet and its headquarters were lost, Mothma emphatically ordered Ackbar to avoid engaging the Fleet with the Alliance's enemies under all circumstances, specifically mandating that he was to abandon the Hoth base in the event of its discovery. Ackbar, leading the Alliance Fleet from his flagship, the Independence, became known as the \"Father of the Alliance Navy\" as he organized and trained the ragtag group of ships and crews into a fighting force capable of facing the Empire.

The traditionalists in the Alliance hailed Ackbar's reorganization of the fleet into a single armada powerful enough to challenge any battle squadron of the Imperial Navy, but Ackbar looked at the fleet beyond its tactical role: his strategic thinking was cautious, conservative, and perfectly suited for the Alliance's guerrilla operations. He saw capital ships as the decisive force of space warfare, which, like the mighty ocean predators of his homeworld, would hide in the deeps and strike when the enemy showed weakness. The Alliance Fleet would roam the galaxy, holding back from combat and building up its strength, becoming an ever-greater psychological threat to the New Order and undermining its authority merely by continuing to exist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The main subdivision of the Alliance Fleet for both raids and fleet maneuvers under Ackbar's reorganization became the battle line, a group of two or more cruisers with a subordinate close support line of escorts and a picket line of starfighters.

His caution was due to the belief that the loss of the Rebel fleet would sound the death knell of the Alliance. Already hit hard after the loss of their main base on Hoth, the fleet was the last major Rebel asset. However, Ackbar opted to take the advice of Lando Calrissian and engage the Imperial fleet at close range.

Ackbar ordered a concentrated hail of fire on the Executor, crashing its shields and making it vulnerable to a kamikaze run by an RZ-1 A-wing interceptor, piloted by Arvel Crynyd. Shortly after Lando Calrissian and Wedge Antilles destroyed the Death Star II's main reactor, Ackbar ordered for the Alliance Fleet to steer clear of the doomed battle station.

For the first few months following the battle, Ackbar rebuilt and expanded his fleet, preparing it for the eventual wresting of most Galactic territory from the Empire. Consolidating its holdings, the New Republic expanded through diplomacy, buying time as new warships like the MC80B Star Cruiser came off the lines at Mon Calamari and found their way into the fleet. These new Star Cruisers, coupled with several captured and repaired Star Destroyers, gave his fleet some added muscle. Once the fleet was ready, Ackbar began the long trek Coreward.

While the battle was a trap planned by Thrawn, help from fringe groups and the sudden death of Thrawn at the hands of his Noghri bodyguard allowed the New Republic to defeat the Imperial navy soundly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the end of Thrawn's campaign, Ackbar led the campaign against Prince-Admiral Delak Krennel. During this time, Ackbar also was finally able to convince Wedge Antilles to accept promotion to General. In the Battle of Ciutric, Ackbar's fleet was initially outgunned by Krennel's forces, but the use of the Thrawn Pincer tactic brought in additional New Republic forces that helped defeat Krennel once and for all. At the same time, Rogue Squadron successfully rescued the Lusankya prisoners, including an aged Jan Dodonna. However, by this time, New Republic forces were spread around the Rim. This left the vital Core worlds, and Coruscant in particular, open to an attack by reunified Imperial forces.

He was soon called back into service fending off the seemingly endless resources of the Emperor reborn. The campaign of the reborn Palpatine was the most costly struggle in the history of the New Republic up until the Yuuzhan Vong invasion. Countless regions were lost as the government went into hiding. One of the greatest tragedies for Ackbar was when the Emperor's World Devastators attacked his home planet of Mon Calamari, devastating the surface and proving impervious to New Republic attacks. While he kept the majority of the New Republic fleets intact by moving them across the Galaxy much in the same way he had during the Rebellion and successfully reclaimed numerous lost worlds after the Emperor was defeated again, Ackbar blamed himself for the great damage done to his planet and people."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ackbar faced another personal crisis shortly after his fleets reclaimed Coruscant from the forces of the reborn Emperor.

Believing that his piloting was the cause of the accident, Ackbar went into self imposed exile on Mon Calamari, retreating to his secluded seapod in the Mkbuto Seatree Preserve. Ridden with guilt, he devoted himself to repairing the damage done to his homeworld. When Mon Mothma suddenly became ill from a poisoning orchestrated by Caridan ambassador Furgan, Leia traveled to Mon Calamari to persuade Ackbar to come back to the New Republic. While Leia was working to persuade Ackbar to reclaim his post as Supreme Commander, rogue Imperial Admiral Daala attacked Mon Calamari with her Imperial Star Destroyers. Coming momentarily out of his depression, Ackbar rallied local Calamarian forces against Daala, holding off the worst of her attacks until a New Republic fleet arrived. During the fighting, Ackbar recognized a Tarkin strategy and commanded a Mon Cal cruiser under construction in the shipyard to ram and destroy her third star destroyer lying in wait behind the moon. At the same time, Leia realized that Ackbar's niece, Cilghal, was Force-sensitive and a natural healer. Cilghal went on to become a Jedi Knight and healed Mon Mothma."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In spite of this, Ackbar still refused to return to the New Republic.

The victim of Imperial brainwashing, Terpfen had finally overcome the chips planted in his brain by Imperial scientists. The mechanic aided Ackbar, Leia, and Winter Celchu in saving young Anakin from Ambassador Furgan. Ackbar pursued the Dreadnaught that Furgan had used to reach Anoth, but it was destroyed by the unstable moon. After defeating Furgan's MT-AT walker, Terpfen tried to send his own walker off the cliff in a suicidal plunge. Quick thinking by Ackbar prevented this: he told Terpfen that he had a great many things to still offer the New Republic and the Galaxy.

Upon receiving near-simultaneous reports of Daala's attack and the existence of the Darksaber in the Hoth asteroid field, Ackbar and Wedge split up, with Ackbar taking the Galactic Voyager and a small escort to Yavin 4 to defend the Jedi Praxeum. Arriving in the Yavin system, the Galactic Voyager was outmatched against Daala's Knight Hammer, which was compounded by the arrival of numerous Victory-class Star Destroyers. Holding off the Imperials despite heavy damage, the Galactic Voyager was nearly destroyed when Callista Ming sabotaged the Knight Hammer and New Republic reinforcements arrived, dramatically turning the tide of the battle.

However, this task was hindered as many of the New Republic's ships were still recovering from the Black Fleet Crisis or were otherwise unavailable. Nevertheless, while Ackbar assembled his forces he kept in communication with the commander of the Bakuran fleet, Admiral Hortel Ossilege, who was aiding the New Republic and providing vital support in the Corellian system.
