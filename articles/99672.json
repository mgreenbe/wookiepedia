Every claim in the town paid into their budget each year. When the Blythe family, who lived on a homestead not far from the town, was targeted for kidnapping by the Nihil pirates, they called the security force for help. However, the Nihil's reputation was such that when they heard who was attacking the Blythes, they were terrified and claimed they would not be able to arrive in time, an act of cowardice which disgusted Erika Blythe. Ronn Blythe's transmission was overheard by Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro, who reported the raid to the Jedi of the Elphrona Outpost as he hoped to capture one of them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
