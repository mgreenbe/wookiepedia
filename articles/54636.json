Each ginntho had two feathery antenna and eight strong legs, which were capable of walking vertically up the walls of the many sinkholes of their homeworld. Their bodies produced incredibly strong silk and they used webs to capture and hold their prey. Wild ginntho would wrap their prey in silk and leave them to ripen for a few weeks before drinking their remains. Some ginntho lived within Pau City, a city inhabited by the sentient Pau'ans and Utai. During the Battle of Utapau, ginntho created elaborate traps that snared Separatist battle droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
