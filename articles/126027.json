The term \"Sith\" originally referred to a species of aliens native to the planets Korriban and Ziost, who were later enslaved and ruled by exiled Dark Jedi from the Galactic Republic. These Dark Jedi had once been members of the Jedi Order, a monastic Force religion dedicated to peace through the use of the light side of the Force. The Dark Jedi, who refused to rely exclusively on the light side, challenged the Jedi by giving in to the dark side, which started the Hundred-Year Darkness. However, they had been defeated and subsequently exiled from known space, which led to their discovery of the Sith species. Following centuries of interbreeding and mixing of cultures between the aliens and the exiles, the Sith would no longer be identified by their race, but by their dedication to the ancient Sith philosophy. This religious order would survive in many different incarnations throughout galactic history. The rise of a new leader, or Dark Lord, would often cause drastic reorganizations in the cult, however the Sith would always be characterized by their lust for power and their desire to destroy the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith were the most infamous of all dark side religions, and the members of the cult were often seen as the pinnacle of power within the dark side. Throughout their long history, the Sith commanded several Empires and initiated many galactic wars. With such great influence, the Sith religion inspired many cults that weren't technically part of the Sith Order, nor did they consist of actual Sith. Instead, they were founded and made up of Sith devotees and other Force-sensitives dedicated to prolonging the teachings and the memory of the Sith. Such cults included the Naddists, the Disciples of Ragnos, and the Krath."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Philosophy"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Forged by fire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith believed that conflict was the only true test of one's ability, and so emphasized its importance. It was their belief that conflict challenged both individuals and civilizations, and so forced them to grow and evolve. They believed that the avoidance of conflict\u2013like the pacifist teachings of the Jedi\u2013resulted in stagnation and decline."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another purpose served by conflict was the elevation of the strong and the death of the weak. By encouraging strife, the strong were able to exercise their power while the weak were weeded from the ranks of the Sith. A core tenet to Sith philosophy was self-reliance and the idea that an individual only deserved what they were strong enough to take. Likewise, morality was treated as an obstacle to be overcome, as it got in the way of a Sith's ability to recognize and seize opportunities for advancement and self-empowerment. According to the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi shortly before dueling his former friend turned Sith Lord Darth Vader, a key mark for someone permanently becoming a Sith is if they \"deal[t] in absolutes.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Such philosophies were embraced and taught at Sith academies, where students were encouraged to challenge one another and fight for prestige that would be recognized by the headmaster of the academy. At the academy on Korriban during the Jedi Civil War, students were tasked with gaining prestige so they might become one of the \"chosen few\" accepted into the ranks of Darth Malak's Sith Empire. The strife to achieve prestige caused rivalries and animosity between the students, as there were few tasks that offered prestige, and many prospective Sith. Similarly, the students of the academy during the New Sith Wars were pitted against each other in dueling sessions atop the academy. It was during these dueling sessions that intense rivalries were formed - rivalries that resulted in the deaths of students Fohargh and Sirak at the hands of Darth Bane."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Empowered by passion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cornerstone of a Sith's power was emotion. While the Jedi taught that fear, anger, and pain were negative emotions to be overcome, the Sith believed that these strong emotions were natural, and aided individuals in their survival. By harnessing their emotions rather than suppressing them, the Sith believed they could achieve true power. This belief was in stark contrast to that of the Jedi, who strived to place themselves beyond such base emotions. Indeed, the Sith saw passion as the only real way to fully understand the Force. However, the Sith believed strongly that the worthy could control their emotions and use them, while the weak were ruled by them. In accordance, Dark Lady Lumiya refused to accept Jacen Solo as a Sith Lord until he was able to control his anger instead of becoming a slave to it, and Freedon Nadd renounced his faith in Exar Kun shortly before his destruction, when he discovered the limitless ambition Kun served."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, not all emotions were embraced by the Sith. They, like the Jedi, considered 'love' a dangerous emotion, but for different reasons. The Jedi discouraged love because it led to attachment, but the Sith taught that love led to mercy, which was anathema to them. While Darth Sidious preyed on Anakin Skywalker's love for his wife in order to corrupt him, he had no intention of allowing the relationship to survive Skywalker's fall to the dark side. Darth Bane had fallen in love with fellow Sith pupil Githany, however he did not allow himself to retain any connections to her, and did not regret her death on Ruusan. However, this didn't stop some Sith from taking lovers and allowing themselves to feel this emotion. Darth Malgus, for example, had a lover, Eleena Daru. In Malgus's case however, he eventually killed Daru as he realized that she constituted an intolerable weakness."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Sith'ari"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the original Sith, the term \"Sith'ari\" translated literally into \"lord\" or \"overlord\". Over time however, the term became closely associated with the idea of a perfect being, who would rise to power and take control of the Sith Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The prophesied coming of the Sith'ari was based around the notion that a perfect being, would epitomize the teachings of the Sith Code and became free of all restrictions. This being would lead the Sith, but also destroy them- a destruction that would make the Sith Order stronger than before. The identity of the Sith'ari has been confirmed as Darth Bane,[source?] who destroyed the Brotherhood of Darkness in order to remake the Sith through the Rule of Two. The prophesy of the Sith'ari is very similar to the Jedi's prophesy of the Chosen One\u2014an extremely powerful Force-sensitive who would lead their Order to perfection."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Guiding codes"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Code of the Sith"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The code of the Sith was the mantra which stated the core beliefs of the Sith Order and is believed to have been created in contrast to the Jedi Code.

By way of victory, the Sith believed they could free themselves from the limitations of regular beings, and achieve their potential. Neophyte Sith believed that the breaking of chains represented the ability to do whatever one wished, however more seasoned members of the Order recognized that the true meaning of freedom was the end of all physical restrictions and the ability to attain perfection. The Sith believed that the only being who could truly live up to the code and attain freedom was the Sith'ari, and as such saw it as a guideline by which to live, not a law to abide by."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The rule of two"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rule of Two was the principle upon which the Order of the Sith Lords was founded. It was created by Darth Bane, a Dark Lord and member of the Brotherhood of Darkness. Bane believed that the Sith had weakened themselves by accepting too many into their ranks and that the true dark side had abandoned them. After studying the holocron of Darth Revan, Bane decided that the Brotherhood needed to be destroyed and the Sith rebuilt as a secretive order consisting of two beings\u2014a single master and a single apprentice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane believed this philosophy would solve the infighting that had long been the bane of the Sith Order. By allowing only two members into the cult at a time, the dark side would remain concentrated within those two beings, instead of legions of ineffective warriors. When the apprentice learned all they could from the master, it was their duty to kill the master and take an apprentice of their own, in order to ensure the continuing strength of the cult. As such, the Rule of Two embraced the idea of the rule of the strong. The small number of Sith allowed the Order to remain hidden for a millennium."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The rule of one"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rule of One was the guiding code of the One Sith. Created by Darth Krayt after the collapse of the Order of the Sith Lords, it embraced the ideals of the ancient Sith, wherein there was a single Dark Lord of the Sith who led many lesser Sith Lords, along with other minions and acolytes. The \"One\" represented the Sith Order itself, a unified and cohesive group of Sith who restrained from infighting and were fanatically obedient to Dark Lord Krayt. The practice of one apprentice per master was retained, however there were many masters. Also retained was the practice of slaying a master once an apprentice's training was complete, however this was not done to continue the rule of the strong, but rather to show one's faith and devotion to the Sith cause."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Order was considered heretical by Darth Bane, Darth Nihilus, and Darth Andeddu, who voiced their opinions via holocron. Some, including Darth Nihl and Cade Skywalker believed that the lack of a line of succession would cause the One Sith to collapse if Darth Krayt were ever killed, though upon Darth Krayt's final death control passed to Darth Nihl and the One Sith continued to follow their Lord loyally."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A similar yet different philosophy existed under Sidious's running of the Order.

The Sith species began to coalesce as a society some time prior to roughly 100,000 BBY, when their culture and religion developed. Early on, they immersed their culture in rites and lore of the dark side. Coming together as a species, they were able to fight off a Killik incursion circa 30,000 BBY, presumably resulting in an eventual Killik Sith Lord taking up residence on Alsakan, although how this Sith Lord was able to break from the hive-mind is unknown. Around 28,000 BBY, legendary Sith King Adas ruled his people and their Empire. Having ruled as a warlord for some time, he was able to unite the peoples of Korriban, and was pronounced the Sith'ari, or overlord. Adas's reign lasted for several centuries, ending only after the invasion of Korriban by the Rakata of the Infinite Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Initially friendly, the Rakata taught Adas how to create holocrons, and lent their knowledge of space travel to the Sith. However, it soon became apparent that the Rakata intended to take the Sith people as slaves, and Adas launched a war to rid his world of them. After driving them from Korriban, he hijacked several of their ships and used them to spread the Sith species to Ziost, Tund, and Malachor V, and was eventually successful in driving the Rakata from Sith space entirely. However, the victory cost him his life. The Rakata left behind a Star Map on Korriban, and possibly the origin for the Darth title."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The death of Adas threw Korriban into civil war, with many different Sith scrambling for power. The world was devastated from the years of conflict, and no new leader arose from the ashes. One of the horrors of this war took place in 7000 BBY, when Dathka Graush destroyed most of the cities on Korriban, possibly resulting in the backwards, primitive cultural regression of the Sith species (ultimately witnessed by the exiled Dark Jedi, upon reaching Korriban).[source?] The Sith people moved their center of government and culture to the world of Ziost, and left Korriban, with that planet becoming a tomb world for their fallen leaders. A millennium prior to this, in 8000 BBY, humans and aliens escaping the oppression of the Tapani Dynasty arrived through the Stygian Caldera, possibly accounting for the Sith influence upon the future Mecrosa Order in later centuries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25,053 BBY, elsewhere in the galaxy, the Galactic Republic was forming. On the planet Tython, scholars, scientists, warriors, and religious figures met to discuss an anomalous energy field present in the galaxy that would become known as the Force.\nIn these discussions, several individuals advocated the use of Bogan, what would become known as the dark side. The followers of the light rejected this idea and defeated the followers of Bogan in the Force Wars of Tython.\nFollowing the conflict, the victors established the Jedi Order, a group of warrior-monks who followed the light side. Around 24,500 BBY, a Jedi named Xendor accepted the teachings of the dark side and left the order, along with many other students calling themselves the Legions of Lettow. The resulting conflict, known as the First Great Schism, ended with Xendor dead and the Legions of Lettow defeated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The dark side would not have a strong hold until 7000 BBY, when another group of Jedi left the Order to follow the dark path. These Jedi had been delving into alternative uses for the Force, and became increasingly reliant on it. They discovered that the Force could twist life to serve their purposes and create new life. These practices were looked upon with apprehension by other Jedi, as memories of the First Schism were still present. Feeling their power was threatened, the rogue Jedi sought supporters within the Order, but were turned away. Arguments for their cause turned to conflicts, and these Jedi were exiled from the Order. Taking their teachings with them, they became known as Dark Jedi, and launched a war against the Jedi Order that would come to be known as the Hundred-Year Darkness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using alchemically altered soldiers and beasts, the Dark Jedis' war lasted a hundred years. It was during this war that the Leviathan was created, along with many other monstrosities. Eventually, the Dark Jedi were defeated at the Battle of Corbos as a result of infighting and Jedi bombing. As punishment, the surviving Dark Jedi were gathered by Republic forces and loaded aboard unarmed transport ships.

They emerged from hyperspace above Korriban, where they were greeted by the primitive Sith people. The Exiles, who included XoXaan, Remulus Dreypa, Ajunta Pall, Sorzus Syn and Karness Muur, shocked the natives with their dark side abilities and were proclaimed Jen'jidai, meaning Dark Jedi in the language of the Sith. The Jen'jidai forged an alliance with the Sith ruler's second in command and used that relationship to overthrow the King and claim dominion over the Sith. They adopted the title \"Lords of the Sith\" and their ruler came to be known as the Jen'ari, or Dark Lord of the Sith. Shortly after settling on Korriban, however a splinter group of exiles, led by Remulus Dreypa, returned to Republic space to enact their vengeance, but they were intercepted by a Jedi patrol. The Jedi pursued those Sith across the galaxy, until both factions crash-landed on the planet Kesh. After a period of fighting, the Jedi and Dreypa's followers made peace and formed a new organization called the Doomed, which strived to achieve balance between the light and the dark sides of the force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the first Dark Lords was the Exile Ajunta Pall. Pall began remaking the Sith Empire into a new Imperial regime lead by the Sith Lords instead of the Kings of the Sith people. Over time the Jen'jidai and the Sith interbred to make the two groups indistinguishable from one another, and the Empire continued to be lead by a succession of Dark Lords, including Tulak Hord. Deceased Dark Lords were entombed in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban instead of the Valley of Golg as Sith Kings had been. Their tombs were filled with the treasures they had accumulated during their life, as well as strong dark side energies. Often the tomb would also house the spirit of the Dark Lord himself, who remained attached to his body and possessions through the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During their reign, the Sith Lords fought for power, challenging one another with new and innovative weapons created through the dark side. One such weapon was the Muur Talisman, which was created by the Sith Lord and former Dark Jedi Karness Muur. Muur was an expert in Sith alchemy and may have helped to create the Leviathan during the Hundred-Year Darkness. His talisman had the power to transform humans into alchemically engineered monsters called Rakghouls, whom Muur would be able to command. When he discovered that aliens and Force-sensitives were unaffected, Muur created the Rakghoul plague, which would spread his monsters to those immune to the talisman's power. Eventually, a rival Sith Lord Remulus Dreypa created an oubliette which would contain Muur, his talisman, and the plague. Muur was killed before he could be captured and his talisman was lost, only to end up on Taris several millennia later by unknown means."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, a legendary Sith half-breed named Marka Ragnos defeated Sith Council member Simus in combat and rose to power, claiming the title of Dark Lord of the Sith. His little-documented but long reign was known to have been during the \"Golden Age\" of the Sith Empire. During this time the Empire experienced relative stability and encompassed at least 120 planets, including Arkania, Malachor V, Thule, and Vjun. By this time the Galactic Republic and Jedi Order had forgotten about their fallen brethren, just as the Sith had forgotten about them.

Control of the Empire fell to the Sith Council, which was divided over who should succeed Ragnos as Dark Lord. Two contenders rose to the forefront- Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh. Sadow was known as a progressive expansionist in contrast to Kressh's reputation as a conservative protectionist. Originally confined to arguments and debates within the council, the disagreement exploded violently during the Funeral of Marka Ragnos. The funeral procession was led by Kressh, with Sadow conspicuously missing during the ceremonies. Much to Kressh's chagrin, Sadow made his entrance in the middle of Kressh's eulogy for the fallen Dark Lord. The enraged Kressh demanded Sadow leave, however his rival instead claimed the mantle of Dark Lord. Kressh responded by claiming the title as well, and the two entered into a duel at the foot of Ragnos's tomb. The fierce battle was interrupted by the ghost of Marka Ragnos, who implored the two to stop fighting and pick their battles carefully, for the Sith Empire he had helped build was in the balance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Ragnos's departure, the two Sith Lords prepared to reenter combat, however they were once again interrupted, this time by the arrival of wayward hyperspace explorers Gav and Jori Daragon. The sibling explorers claimed to hail from the Galactic Republic, and were quickly taken into custody and imprisoned on the Sith capital world of Ziost. Setting aside their conflict for a time, Kressh and Sadow rejoined the Council, which was debating the fate of the Daragons. Unsurprisingly, the two disagreed on this as well. Kressh, under the belief that they were harbingers of a Republic invasion, called for their immediate execution, while Sadow saw them as a pathway to expansion, by way of conquering their Republic. The council was yet again split between the two, however Ludo Kressh was able to win with the support of the council majority. Simus, a former contender for the title of Dark Lord and ally of Naga Sadow's, went to inform the Daragons of their impending execution. However, Naga Sadow had no intention of following the will of the Council, and killed Simus with weapons confiscated from the Daragon's ship, the Starbreaker 12, making it appear as though it was a Republic attack. He freed the Daragons and hid them away in his fortress on Khar Shian, while reporting Simus's death back to the Council. Feigning shock, he claimed that the apparent Republic aggression and rescue of the Daragons required retaliation, something he had foreseen. The Council almost unanimously elected him Dark Lord, with the exception of Kressh, who claimed the title for himself and stormed out of the meeting. Shortly afterwards, Sadow staged yet another Republic attack by stealing the Starbreaker 12 from impound on Ziost. He would need the ship to return Jori Daragon to the Republic, thereby leading the Dark Lord to his next frontier. The human female was being kept in Sadow's decoy fortress on Khar Delba, while her brother remained on Khar Shian to be trained in the ways of the dark side by Sadow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the process Sadow hoped to rid the Empire of Kressh, and so planted evidence on Ziost that would point to back to himself. Kressh acted predictably and attacked Sadow's decoy fortress on Khar Delba. Sadow had prepared for the battle and stationed his fleet on the dark side of the moon Khar Shian. He attacked an unsuspecting Kressh, whose commanders were betrayed by their crews. Kressh, knowing he could not win the battle, staged his own death and fled, leaving Naga Sadow as the undisputed ruler of the Sith. During the battle he allowed Jori Daragon to escape with the Starbreaker 12, which was wired with a homing beacon. In his first act as Dark Lord, Sadow gathered his forces for an invasion of the Republic, initiating a conflict known as the Great Hyperspace War. Sadow even used Sith Lords as generals in his powerful army, including Garu, and Shar Dakhan. The Republic, unwilling to believe Jori Daragon's story of impending war, was unprepared for the onslaught and was initially overwhelmed by the invasion. Sadow's warships and warriors spread throughout Republic space, attacking many worlds simultaneously, while Sadow himself aided by using battle meditation from within his Sith Meditation Sphere. Stationed above the star Primus Goluud along with his flagship, Sadow presented the Republic with a seemingly unbeatable enemy. Empress Teta of Koros Major was the only Republic official prepared for the assault, and her forces beat back Sith attacks on Cinnagar and Kirrek, and were able to pursue them back to Primus Goluud, where Sadow activated a superweapon within his flagship, the Corsair, that caused the star to supernova. The explosion killed Gav Daragon and forced the Sith to retreat back to their Empire, with Teta's forces in pursuit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning to Korriban in defeat, Sadow's forces were met with those of Ludo Kressh. After feigning his demise, Kressh had remained within the Empire, gaining support while Sadow lead the invasion of the Republic. The two fleets clashed, initiating the first battle of Korriban. When it appeared Kressh would win the battle against Sadow's already wounded forces, the Dark Lord ordered that one of his vessels ram Kressh's flag ship. The impact killed the rival Sith Lord and ended the battle, Sadow's final conflict with Ludo Kressh. Sadow was unable to enjoy his victory however, as Empress Teta's forces emerged from hyperspace moments later, crippling Sadow's ship and decimating his forces. Hoping to escape to Yavin Prime, Sadow fled the battle, and was believed killed in the Denarii Nova he created with the Corsair. As the remains of the Sith Empire crumbled behind him, Sadow and his remaining Massassi warriors landed on Yavin 4, where construction began on mountainous temples dedicated to the Dark Lord. With the Republic navy entering Sith space the Sith became desperate. Shar Dakhan as acting Dark Lord of the Sith ordered his Massassi pilots to ram invading Republic ships. This drove the Republic back for a while, however the Republic's triumph was inevitable. They destroyed most of the Sith Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, this was not the end of the Empire. Various Sith survivors fled to different parts of the galaxy. Several Sith fled to Thule, where they would remain for generations, waiting for their revenge on the Jedi and the Republic. They established a military dictatorship, ruled by an oligarchy of eight generals. Several of the remaining Sith Lords sought refuge on Ambria, where they hid among the planet's dark side energies in order to avoid persecution. They stayed on the planet for many years, until passing into the Force themselves, leaving yet more dark side spirits on Ambria. On Kesh, the descendants of a crashed ship the Omen survived and formed the Lost Tribe of Sith. Several Sith sects survived on Vjun and passed on their teachings secretly through the families. On Tund, the Sith refugees eventually became mere charlatans known as the Sorcerers of Tund. As a result of an unstable hyperdrive, the Sith starship Harbinger traveled to the future to the year 41 ABY. Finally, one Sith Lord took his forces and retreated to the Unknown Regions where they would bide their time, and wait. This hidden Sith Empire still held on to Malachor V as a teaching center.

Around six-hundred years following the fall of the Sith Empire, a young human began training at Odan-Urr's Great Jedi Library on Ossus. The young Jedi named Freedon Nadd impressed his masters with his connection to the Force and eagerness to find harmony. The attention from his masters caused arrogance in Nadd that lead him to believe he would soon be elevated to knighthood. To his surprise, he was passed over for knighthood, causing him to become resentful and conflicted. Nadd sought out Jedi Master Matta Tremayne in the hopes that she might be able to show him what he must do in order to become a Knight. In a test for the young Jedi, Tremayne ignored him until his anger burst out and he turned to leave. Only then did she acknowledge him, challenging him to a lightsaber duel. The two engaged one another, and Freedon's anger rose. Sensing this, Tremayne deactivated her lightsaber, exposing herself to attack from Nadd. Realizing it had all been a test far too late, Freedon's saber cut through Tremayne, killing her.

Sadow, finally recognizing Nadd as one who could restore the power of the Sith, awakened and consented to train the fallen Jedi in the ways of the Sith. The training lasted for a time, however before it was complete, Nadd's confidence in his own abilities once again took control. Believing himself strong enough for the title of Dark Lord, Nadd slew Sadow and seized the mantle.

Onderon was a densely forested planet home to large beasts and a single, heavily guarded city, Iziz. The city was surrounded by walls and defense towers used to keep out the beasts of the jungle, which the people of Iziz had fought for centuries. Nadd arrived on the planet and wowed the populace with his dark side magic and Force powers. Much like the exiled dark Jedi millennia before on Korriban, Nadd proclaimed himself the ruler of the people in Iziz and King of Onderon. Iziz's law and order was based on the policy of banishing dissidents and \"criminals\" from the walled city, condemning them to death by the animals of Onderon. Eventually, the banished criminals organized themselves into the \"Beast Riders\" after taming the beasts of the jungle, such as the Drexl, Cannok, and Boma. The Riders continually attacked the city they had once called home in a centuries-long conflict known as the Beast Wars. Nadd was able to elevate himself to a near-God status with the people by repelling attacks by the Riders by use of the Force. Although his reign was oppressive, the Onderonians accepted his teachings and embraced his dark side influence. Nadd eventually died and was buried beneath the Iziz palace in his tomb.

Nadd played the two against one another hoping the competition would reveal the stronger of the two, and thereby the one worthy of becoming the vessel of his resurrection.

Ommin and his wife were both too embroiled with their own interests to take direct command of the cult, and so their proxies, Warb Null and Novar, acted in their stead.

Although Nadd hoped this would scare the Queen back into her dark side studies, Amanoa took an entirely different direction and requested the aide of the Jedi Order to end the centuries-long conflict. The Jedi agreed and sent Master Arca Jeth's apprentices to Iziz to begin negotiations. Hiding the taint of the dark side from the young Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma, Cay Qel-Droma, and Tott Doneeta, Amanoa requested their assistance in defeating the Beast Riders, who kidnapped her and Ommin's daughter, Galia, shortly after the Jedi arrival. Soon, Amanoa learned that her daughter consented to be married to the leader of the Beast Riders, Oron Kira, and hoped to settle the war peacefully. Having no interest in a peaceful settlement, the enraged Queen revealed her dark side allegiance to her enemies, surrounding Iziz in a palpable darkness.
