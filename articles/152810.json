Outside of Jabba's Palace, the three-eyed hunter and Bossk's troupe clashed with Jabba's swoop gang, sent by Jabba himself to steal the frozen Solo away from Fett so the Hutt would not have to pay Fett's hefty sum, and defeated the swoopers. However, Fett duped his assailants into believing he was loading Solo into the palace aboard a hoversled, while he secretly sneaked into the palace unmolested."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
