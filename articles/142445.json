The decision was made to use only McQuarrie's original artwork for the title, which led to certain challenges, since McQuarrie painted Luke with both hands in the climax of his duel with Darth Vader. It was decided to tell certain parts of the story with words, such as \"Darth Vader not only hurt Luke with his light saber, he hurt him with his words.\" The title also features a piece of artwork featuring Luke, Leia Organa and Darth Vader that was originally used as the cover artwork for the classic Legends novel Splinter of the Mind's Eye. Due to the inherent restrictions of length, DiTerlizzi chose to focus the story heavily on Luke himself, as well as his discovery of family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The book is dedicated \"For my sister, Jennifer, and my brother, Adam, whom I shared many a space adventure with long ago.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The story is largely faithful to the events of the original story, but omits certain characters and events entirely, including Owen and Beru Whitesun Lars, the Destruction of Alderaan and most scenes involving members of the Rebel Alliance.
