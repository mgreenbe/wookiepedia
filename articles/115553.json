Unlike most other dictionaries, Riccix's did not feature an image of Jabba the Hutt in its entry on Hutts. Rather, it featured an image of Ka'Pa the Hutt, as the editors argued that they were sick of seeing Jabba as the main reference to Hutts in dictionaries. The image of Ka'Pa was taken by the famous holographer, Bovit Leebo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
