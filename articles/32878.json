Like the Lucrehulk-class, it was originally a corporate transport vessel before being converted for wartime use, serving in a support role for both droids and organic soldiers. Such a vessel was present at the Battle of Umbara and was key to supplying Confederate forces on the surface. It was destroyed by Hardcase, Jesse, and Fives who were piloting Zenuas 33 Umbaran starfighters on a rogue infiltration mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the war, more were seen blocking Dooku's home planet of Serenno until some of them went with General Grievous and a Separatist battalion to Dathomir to massacre the Nightsisters for Ventress's betrayal. DH-Omni Support Vessels were later present at the Invasion of Scipio where they blockaded the planet before Dooku and the super tactical droid commander Kraken withdrew, allowing the Republic to win the battle and nationalize most of the InterGalactic Banking Clan after Rush Clovis's death. One DH-Omni Support Vessel was used to transport a kyber crystal from Utapau, even being mistaken for a mound by Anakin Skywalker, but was destroyed along with most of the droids on the ship. DH-Omni Support Vessels also engaged Maul's Shadow Collective and more were later present in Trench's fleet during the Battle of Anaxes until the rescue of CT-1409 \"Echo\" by the Bad Batch. The vessels were later blown up by Wrecker alongside the rest of the fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
