The Sith Meditation Sphere Ship took five Sith from the Lost Tribe of Sith to ambush a Damorian S18 light freighter, which was en route from the planet Eriadu, in order to gain supplies to help repair the Lost Tribe's starship, the Omen. After suffering heavy damages, the freighter was forced to land on a nearby planet for repairs. The Sith pursued them to the surface, where they hunted down the survivors and salvaged the ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
