Copies of the painting were available for purchase in the township of Aurilia on the planet Dathomir to those who had assisted the town significantly. The painting had a white background and depicted three humanoid figures wearing black robes and hoods, the forwardmost of whom held a black staff in the left hand. The figures stood upon a gray, cobblestone floor and encircled a tall, red crystal that stood on its tip. A greenish haze in the shape of a man's face, believed to be that of the ancient Dark Lord of the Sith Exar Kun, gazed at the viewer from behind the cowled figures."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Will of Exar Kun was a painting that appears in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies.
