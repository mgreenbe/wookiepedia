As Vader feigned surrender, Swan and Arana argued about whether or not to kill the Sith. Arana killed Swan so he could use her lightsaber to execute Vader, but the Sith Lord then killed Arana. Vader offered Farr, Choi, and Dart\u00e9 one final chance to tell him where Kenobi was. When the three Jedi refused, Farr combined his Force powers with Choi and Dart\u00e9's, throwing debris against Vader. After critically wounding the Dark Lord, Choi prepared to kill Vader.
