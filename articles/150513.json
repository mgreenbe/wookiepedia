He can feel Obi-Wan Kenobi's presence in his mind's eye, but searching an entire planet for a man who doesn't want to be found has proven to be far more difficult than Maul expected. In exasperation and rage, Maul cries out Kenobi's name. His voice reverberates through the desert. Maul does not want to die in the desert, and vows to draw Kenobi out of hiding. While contemplating, Maul has an idea, slowly opening his hand to reveal a fragment of the Sith holocron from Malachor."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The holocron's messages"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, at Chopper Base on the planet Atollon, Ezra Bridger is sleeping in his bunk bed above Garazeb Orrelios when he is woken by a faint recording of Kenobi's voice emanating from Kanan Jarrus' holocron. Ezra at first thinks that Zeb is snoring, but hears the holocron speaking when Ezra opens his eye. The holocron repeats Kenobi's warning to the Jedi following Order 66. Ezra enters Kanan's quarters, where Kanan's holocron and the Sith holocron are stored. He finds Kanan's holocron repeating itself. The Sith holocron then glows red, and Ezra hears Maul roaring Kenobi's name again, causing him to trip backwards as red light flashes from the broken holocron. Ezra finds his master, Kanan Jarrus, standing behind him and tells his master that Maul is back."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ezra, Kanan, Hera Syndulla, Rex, Commander Jun Sato, and Chopper meet in the base's command center to discuss the news. Kanan is unsure what the holocrons are trying to say, but Ezra believes that Master Kenobi's life is in danger because Maul is after him right now. While sympathetic to Ezra's hope that Kenobi is still alive, Rex \u2013 who had served at the Jedi's side during the Clone Wars \u2013 tells Ezra that Senator Bail Organa had confirmed Kenobi's purported death. Ezra thinks that Senator Organa is wrong, and fears that Maul is closing in on Kenobi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hera thinks Ezra just heard a broken recording, but Ezra counters that he heard Maul's voice. Kanan reminds Ezra that Maul has tricked him before, but Ezra insists on going to Tatooine to check things out. Hera takes the young Jedi aside for a private word.

Ezra argues that Kenobi is alive and could help the Rebellion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hera dismisses that idea that Kenobi is alive based on the reasoning that he would not be hiding on a backwater world instead of helping the Rebellion. Hera wishes things were different, but reiterates that she needs him here for the Lothal mission. Ezra reassures her that he is enthusiastic about helping the rebels on the Lothal mission. Hera tells Ezra she understands what he is going through, and allows him to leave.

While the trooper confirms the authenticity of Ezra's manifest, Ezra takes the opportunity to disappear. Unbeknownst to Ezra, Chopper is also watching and follows the boy. Before the trooper can tell Ezra to take the munitions to the trainers, Ezra climbs into the cockpit of an RZ-1T trainer and takes off despite the trooper's orders not to, pretending that he can't hear the trooper. As he leaves, Ezra says that he hopes Hera can forgive him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ezra takes the RZ-1T trainer into hyperspace and flies to Tatooine. Upon arriving over the desert planet, Ezra is startled by Chopper, who has stowed aboard the trainer. Ezra jerks the RZ-1T in fright.

Shortly before landing, the holocrons fade. After disembarking, Ezra tells Chopper to stay with the ship. The holocrons lead him towards a glowing shard of the Malachor Sith holocron, which Maul had used to lure Ezra to the planet.

Ezra tells Chopper to find cover while he takes position under the fighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ezra is soon attacked by a Tusken Raider, but Chopper comes to his aid by spraying foam at the assailant. The other Tuskens concentrate their fire on the RZ-1T, causing it to explode. Ezra and Chopper narrowly avoid being hit by the blast, Ezra saving Chopper by pushing him to the ground. The jubilant Tusken Raiders then raise their sticks and begin chanting. However, Maul arrives and cuts them down with his lightsaber. Meanwhile, Ezra gets to his feet and lifts Chopper up.

Ezra thinks that crossing the sands is a bad idea, especially for droids. Chopper suggests traveling along the ridge.

Using the Jedi and Sith holocrons, Ezra believes that Maul is out there and that they have to venture into the desert to stop him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chopper grunts, but Ezra insists on finding Master Kenobi. He tells Chopper that he is free to follow the ridge and find a settlement. He suggests that Chopper can then contact Chopper Base. After some thinking, a grumbling Chopper reluctantly follows Ezra into the desert. The two rebels are soon caught in a sandstorm. Ezra uses the Jedi and Sith holocrons to guide them, but the two are blinded by the sand. Amidst the sandstorm, Ezra hears Maul's voice telling him to draw Kenobi out. Maul tells Ezra that his pain and sorrow call out to Kenobi. Ezra tells Chopper to keep moving."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sandstorm eventually subsides, but the two rebels are exhausted. Chopper's battery drained, the droid shuts down. A despondent Ezra tries to revive his rebel comrade. With Chopper immobile, Ezra blames himself for not heeding Hera's advice. While waiting under the scorching suns, Ezra is tormented by Maul's voice claiming that Kenobi is dead because of his actions. An exhausted Ezra then sees Maul looming over him, and charges at him with his green lightsaber. However, Ezra discovers that he only saw a mirage, succumbing to exhaustion and heat stroke as Maul laughs.

Ezra protests, saying that he has come to warn Kenobi about Maul."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Kenobi already knows that Maul has been hunting for him.

Ezra adds that the Rebellion needs Kenobi's help to defeat the Empire. Kenobi responds that Ezra already has what he needs, and warns the young Padawan that he is already letting it go. When Ezra expresses puzzlement at why the holocrons would send him here, Kenobi tells him that Maul used the holocrons to manipulate Ezra's emotions and thus altered the course of many things."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He warns Ezra that Maul knows his fears and has manipulated the truth to lead him here, where he should never have been. When Ezra tells him that the holocrons tell the truth, Kenobi explains that the holocrons only told him what he wanted to hear and believe.

Maul insults Kenobi by describing him as a \"rat in the desert.\" Kenobi counters with \"Look what I have risen above.\" Maul tells Kenobi that he has come to kill him, but thinks it is worse to leave him here festering in squalor. Kenobi responds that Maul has nothing, because he solely defines himself by his power to take life and to dominate others. Maul ignites his double-bladed lightsaber and slashes at the sand, dousing the fire.

In his last moments, Maul asks if Kenobi is hiding the Chosen One. Kenobi confirms that this is true, which implies that Kenobi thinks Luke Skywalker, not his father Anakin Skywalker, is the Chosen One. Maul then says that he [the Chosen One] will avenge them, before passing away.
