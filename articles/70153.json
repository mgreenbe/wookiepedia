The chapter house was the site of the Great Seal, the artifact which separated the surface world and the Underworld; historians debated which preceded the other. For unknown reasons, the Order abandoned Aleen and their chapter house, allowing it to fall into disrepair and eventually collapse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, circa 21 BBY, the Galactic Republic established an excavation site at the ruins of the chapter house where Republic researchers attempted to understand the groundquakes plaguing the world.
