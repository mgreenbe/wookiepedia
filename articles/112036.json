They had two large tusks, a blowhole on top of their head, and gray skin. The creatures were known to be prevalent around the local port, as crews would often dump their gray holds out, creating a food supply for the carnivores. Around 9 ABY, a ravinak attacked a landspeeder, destroying the craft and killing its human pilot. The ravinak then attacked the Razor Crest, a gunship flown by the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin, who was attempting to leave the planet with his Mythrol bounty. The ravinak grasped the landing gear of the Razor Crest as it was mid-flight and began pulling it down, but it was repelled by the Mandalorian's Amban phase-pulse blaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ravinak appeared in the first episode of the television series The Mandalorian, titled \"Chapter 1: The Mandalorian,\" which was made available on Disney+ on November 12, 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
