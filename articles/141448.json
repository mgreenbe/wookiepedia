The device's small power source quickly burned out when repeatedly stressed, requiring replacement of the entire unit. The Jedi Exile may have used one of these shields as protection when traveling through superheated sections of the mining tunnels under the Peragus Mining Facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the name of this shield is the Telos mining shield, it had no connection to Telos IV and was in fact used by miners at the Peragus Mining Facility. There is evidence to suggest that Telos was the temporary name given to the planet in which the mining tunnels were to be located, solely for the purpose of testing a KotOR: TSL demo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
