By the time the new settlements of Kiidan and Tamarack were established, the immigrants to Cilpar knew little of the species. During the Galactic Civil War, the Cilpari Resistance used some of the temples as weapons depots. One of those Rebels, Elscol Loro, tried to sell parts of a temple to smuggling kingpin Talon Karrde, but the structure proved too difficult to dismantle. The temples were subsequently the site of several skirmishes against the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This species is only alluded to, but never named, in Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Rebel Opposition, a comic book written by Michael A.
