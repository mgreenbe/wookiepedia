It also allowed them to interact with rare or obscure technologies produced by Imperial subcontractors. The E-3PO units, greatly limited and highly expensive, were aware of their prestigious status, and the awareness was, in turn, reflected in their metaprogramming. In time, E-3PO units would exhibit a superior attitude, and haughty behavior. In keeping with their limited numbers, E-3PO units rarely applied identifiers to their serial number, often just going by the name of \"E-3PO.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The E-3PO line of protocol droids was produced during the Galactic Civil War on the factory world of Mechis III. Given the TechSpan I technology, their purpose was to interact with many different kinds of disparate Imperial networks. In time, the E-3PO units became aware of their own exclusivity, and became notoriously brusque and rude by protocol droid standards. That flaw in their personality and programming inspired IG-88A to use the E-3POs as his spies throughout the galaxy to help implement his Droid Revolution. His own sleeper programming, which caused personality aberrations, was masked by the natural temperament of the E-3PO. Modifying the droids on Mechis III, he dispatched scores of Imperial commissioned droids throughout the galaxy, with their alterations totally unknown to their owners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the first demise of Emperor Palpatine during the Battle of Endor and the subsequent rise of the New Republic, New Republic Intelligence Service agents were able to acquire an E-3PO unit that had served on Cloud City, Bespin.

The droid acted as the vessel's steward and when the smuggler Dash Rendar and his associate Eaden Vrill were invited aboard the ship in 2 BBY to act as bodyguards to Charn, the E-3PO droid greeted the pair and showed them to their quarters aboard the yacht."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally assigned to Darth Vader's Death Squadron, one particular E-3PO unit was transferred to Cloud City, where he served as a translator for Ugnaught engineers.
