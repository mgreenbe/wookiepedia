Tech wants to jump into hyperspace, but Hunter is determined not to abandon Omega. Echo says that the bounty hunter who took her is long gone and points out they have no chance of finding her if they are shot down.

Taking pity on Todo 360, Omega offers to help him fix his leg, explaining that it is a simple booster adjustment which she has done a bunch of times for AZI-3 on Kamino.

Since he disappeared at the start of the Clone Wars, Omega was the sole known remaining living source of Fett's raw genetic material.
