The Snogars say that part of the city is a bad place of ancient outworlders and that they never go there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "So, of course, the three do go there directly, where they find the Mole nursing Chewie back to health. The Mole is Boba's target. He is a spy for Darth Vader, who has recently abandoned the Empire.
