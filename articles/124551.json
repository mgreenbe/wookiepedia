In both the Hall of Confluence and the coffer, there were dovin basals that caused the gravity to increase as they approached the hau polyp throne, making those who approached the Supreme Overlord feel like they were walking uphill. The Shamed One Onimi, Shimrra's jester who was the true Supreme Overlord, was capable of manipulating the Citadel independently of a yammosk, dhuryam, or even Shimrra's own control."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, the Citadel was breached by the Galactic Alliance troops, including Page's Commandos and YVH 1 droids, thus defiling the structure.
