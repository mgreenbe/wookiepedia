The one-meter-long cord was molecule-thin and wrapped around carbonite handles on each end and was strong enough to cut through most materials, even duranium and plasteel. It could be used in a manner similar to a garrote, or swung like a lash at enemies. The danger of handling this weapon meant it was only issued to expert users."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
