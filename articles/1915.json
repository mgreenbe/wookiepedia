Outdated by this point, the droid had been programmed to fight Humans. During a melee attack, 8-13 would strike for a Human's vital organs. At some point, the hunter killer droid found its way into the irrigation system underneath the farm of Morgan Katarn, which was under the watch of the Galactic Empire at the time. While alone in an underground tunnel, it sensed the approach of Morgan's son, Kyle Katarn, and the Katarn family droid WeeGee. When the pair neared, 8-13 activated its comlink and fired a blaster shot at Katarn, which missed. WeeGee, in a bid to protect his master, rushed 8-13 and closed the gap between them. As a result, 8-13 deactivated its ranged weapons, and opted to use its melee weapons instead. It was unable to strike any of WeeGee's vital zones, however, as 8-13 attempted to grab at the nonexistent vitals of a Human due to its programming. WeeGee ripped 8-13's head off, removing the war droid as a threat. Afterwards, WeeGee opinioned that 8-13 must have never encountered a heavy duty farm droid before."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "8-13 was first introduced in the 1998 novella Dark Forces: Rebel Agent, which was written by William C.
