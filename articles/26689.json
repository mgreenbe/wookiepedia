Its purpose was to provide background material for the game. The article documents the major events of the Old Republic era of galactic history, from the Great Hyperspace War to the opening skirmishes of the First Jedi Purge. It is notable because it contains backstory information concerning characters such as Revan, Kreia, and Atris that can be found in no other official source."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chronicles are plagued by a number of minor continuity errors.
