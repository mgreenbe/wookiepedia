It gave Hyperspace members a chance to leave their mark on the Star Wars Expanded Universe by allowing them to provide the backstory for certain aspects of the saga; usually obscure background characters or vehicles from the films. Winning entries became official Star Wars lore: published in the Databank and added to the Holocron continuity database. This feature was launched June 24, 2005 and concluded on January 4, 2008, as first hinted by Pablo Hidalgo of Lucas Online. The feature began with the backstory for Tannon Praji, a character from the (then) recently released Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, and, somewhat appropriately, the final entry was Bane Malar, a character from Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, chronologically the (then) final Star Wars film."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In October 2008, new stories from What's The Story? authors began to be published on Hyperspace.
