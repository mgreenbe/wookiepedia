The opposite was the equally ancient haa-yaah, literally translated as \"farewell.\" The same hand gesture was used, but this time with the head bowed slightly. These greetings and gestures were almost universally understood by air-breathing species, though Ugnaughts took offense to it; when dealing with them, Ebenn Q3 Baobab advised instead silently bowing slightly and awaiting a guttural purring in response."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The word \"Sith\" could be found in Pre-Corellian lexicons, having the meaning of \"due to\" or \"since.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
