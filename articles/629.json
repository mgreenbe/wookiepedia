Along with FX-7, 2-1B was stationed at Echo Base on Hoth and treated Luke Skywalker with bacta after he had been attacked by a wampa. 2-1B also treated Skywalker after his hand was amputated in a duel with Darth Vader on Bespin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "2-1B had long experience with humans since the times of the Old Republic, giving him a caring bedside manner. It was thanks to this that Skywalker specifically requested 2-1B's treatment following the loss of his hand.

According to Delk, he was unaware that he played 2-1B in Empire Strikes Back until several people, including his fans and agents, had pointed it out to him. The actor found it comfortable to voice the character during the looping process as he did not have to match any lip flaps, since droids in Star Wars typically did not have mouths."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He was first identified in canon in the 2015 reference book Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, which was written by Adam Bray, Kerrie Dougherty, Cole Horton, and Michael Kogge.

The 2018 reference book Star Wars: Droidography confirmed this was 2-1B. In the Star Wars Legends continuity, 2-1B first appeared in the novelisation of Empire Strikes Back by Donald F.
