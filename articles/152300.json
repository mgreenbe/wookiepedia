When the Sith Lord Darth Vader was searching for Han Solo, smuggler and Rebel Alliance associate, in the time after the Battle of Yavin, he pursued Solo's YT-1300 light freighter Millennium Falcon to the droid's shipyard, where Solo managed to blend in with the other YT-series freighters and evade Vader. Following Solo's escape, Vader and an Imperial officer met with the droid, who apologized for the loss of Vader's target but was honored by the magnitude of its visitor. Vader silenced the droid, recognizing Solo amongst images of various other individuals. The droid identified Solo by name, offering to assist in tracking down the smuggler, but Vader refused. When the droid asked again, insisting that it would not be any trouble, Vader sliced the droid in two with his lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
