Fiercely territorial, Lucites lived as hermits in small villas or towers where they presided over their arcane texts and studies. They believed that \"the truth\" had been unlocked when a star fell from the sky, teaching them that power came from the suffering of others. Hunted by the Astromancers for their cruel and vicious rituals the Lucites preformed on other living beings, some Lucites masqueraded among the Astromancers so that they could attend the annual conclave at Skyholme."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
