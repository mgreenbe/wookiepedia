Long-range turbolaser technology was stolen by the Confederation very early on, however, and the Confederation was able to deploy the technology on many of its Star Destroyers at the Second Battle of Balmorra without the Galactic Alliance Fourth Fleet being so equipped. Only Rear Admiral Gavin Darklighter's bold tactic of sending his starfighter screen to engage the capital ships while leaving his own fleet open to starfighter counterattack was able to prevent the Galactic Alliance from being forced to withdraw. Super-class Star Destroyer Megador was also equipped by long-range turbolasers, using them during Battle of Uroro Station in 41 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
