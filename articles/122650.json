In 19 BBY, during the Clone Wars, Vant lived on the Outer Rim world of Utapau, serving as an Air Commodore in the planet's air force, the Utapau Skyforce. During that year, the Confederacy of Independent Systems attacked and captured the planet, forcing Vant's forces into hiding. However, a short time later, Republic Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi arrived, with a contingent of clone troopers, to free Utapau and kill the Separatist Supreme Commander, the cyborg General Grievous. In the ensuing battle, Vant piloted a Porax-38 starfighter and led the Skyforce while it engaged Separatist Mankvim-814 light interceptors. Vant had black eyes and tan skin as well as red markings on his fighter. In combat, he wore piloting gear."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vant was pictured in Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross-Sections, a 2005 reference book detailing vehicles seen in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.
