The smugglers, led by the Mirialan Hylo Visz, launched an attack on the Mandalorian's Blockade of the Hydian Way. Although they were nearly wiped out, but succeeded after they were joined by the forces of the Republic Navy, having been mobilized after the SIS was tipped off about the battle. Their victory ended rioting on Coruscant, but also provided an impetus for the Sith Sacking of Coruscant several years later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
