According to the tale, he was the strongest and wisest Jedi Master of his time, which earned him the nickname the \"Great Jedi.\" The story went that, at one point, Chuang's apprentice died. However, instead of mourning his departed pupil, Chuang decided to spend time with his friends, playing music, singing, and joking. A messenger later came to him, bringing the condolences of Master K'ungfu, and he found the Great Jedi laughing while the body of his apprentice was still lying there. Noting the messenger's outrage, Chuang told him that death was not something one could avoid forever, and it only meant becoming a different part of the Force. Therefore, Chuang felt that it was better to sing and laugh over the dead than cry. The messenger then reported the words of the Great Jedi to Master K'ungfu, who accepted his colleague's teaching with a smile."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Long after hearing the tale from his mentor, Yoda passed it on to the aspiring Jedi Luke Skywalker while training him in the swamps of Dagobah.
