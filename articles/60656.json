Hela-Tan was sent to search Darth Maul's ship, Scimitar, after his band of pirates succeeded in surrounding Maul as the Zabrak assassin journeyed to Tatooine. Maul's mission, as Darth Sidious first explained to him, was to to eliminate the Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi and capture Queen Amidala to return her to Naboo, where she would be constrained to sign a treaty with the Trade Federation, making its invasion and occupation of the planet \"legal\". In his run-in with the pirates, Maul escaped his own ship in a small pod, then evasively infiltrated and attacked the occupants of the pirate vessel, killing all on-board including its captain. Hela-Tan fought Maul even as the Sith Lord, having at last recovered the Scimitar, was executing his escape from the remaining pirate assailant to continue towards Tatooine. Hela-Tan succeeded in wounding the Sith on the leg before he himself was sucked into space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
