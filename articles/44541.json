It had been outfitted with enhanced power couplings and sub-systems, which allowed its weapons to fire high powered blasts at a faster rate than average. The performance modifications were built around existing systems, which visibly differentiated the Enhanced AT-ST from standard AT-ST walkers, with two such differences being dark colored armor plates and the absence of side-mounted weapons on the command pod."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
