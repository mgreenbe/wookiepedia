Groj originally sold Battlemaster gear, but with the release of Game Update 2.0 on April 9, the PvP commendation system was simplified, condensing most of the different gear levels into a new system. As a result, he was reclassified, and his gear and that of similar vendors often changes with new tiers of gear. He was later removed entirely in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
