They were a combination repulsor and rocket unit. Thin cables going from the knees were attached to the user's pants or leggings to give additional support. Control cables, long enough to reach the users' hands were used to operate the device. The boots were commonly used in sports and other recreational activities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The boots' repulsorlift engine's power packs had to be replaced after an hour's use, having a flight ceiling of 35 meters. The boots' rocket jets held enough fuel for five blasts, and five blasts' worth of fuel cost 25 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The R82 Jump Boots were designed by Michael Kogge for which he received an honorable mention in Galadinium's Fantastic technology."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
