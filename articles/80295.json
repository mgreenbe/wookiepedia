Under the leadership of Mawat, the splinter group called the Scavenger Young decided to start another war. Another group loyal to Nield and Obi-Wan Kenobi tried to stop them and a firefight began. However, it stopped when Qui-Gon appeared with a message from Cerasi who asked them to stop all fighting. It was the last conflict on Melida/Daan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
