X-7 wanted to test the skills of the mercenaries by opening fire on their ships as they approached the moon of Iope where he was waiting. X-7 was able to kill 5 of the mercenaries before Lune Oddo Divinian, one of the mercenary pilots, figured out that the visible base on the moon's surface was just a decoy.
