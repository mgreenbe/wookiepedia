As the droid came online, it perceived the scientists as a threat and eliminated them. It then uploaded its programming into units B, C, and D. The droids killed everyone at the facility and released IG-72, who left the four IG-88 droids to track down and destroy their programmers, as well as their notes to prevent anyone from learning their weaknesses. The droids then went separately into the galaxy to become bounty hunters. Though all were ultimately destroyed when they tried to take Han Solo from Boba Fett, IG-88A transferred its mind into the second Death Star's computer core; that was destroyed in the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
