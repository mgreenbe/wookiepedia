In 4000 BBY, government scouts were organized as the Republic Astrogation Survey Team, a part of the Science and Culture Administration. The Imperial Survey Corps was much more tightly controlled than its Galactic Republic predecessor. The Humanocentric biases of the Empire, the ISC's new emphasis on finding worlds for the Empire to ruthlessly exploit and conquer, and attempts to recruit scouts into the Imperial Starfleet led many scouts to join the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The company Lardanis Survival Systems made equipment specifically for explorers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Republic formed its own scout service soon after its formation, with the goal of rejuvenating exploration of Wild Space and the Unknown Regions and undoing some of the damage the ISC had done."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The scout is a starting class in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.
