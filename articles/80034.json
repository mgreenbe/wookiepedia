Fearing a trap, he ordered the activation of the deflector shield just before the impact. While the surface cannon was reloading, his damaged ship was immediately attacked by old Nimbus-class V-wing starfighters but they were easily repelled by the more modern A-wings. Understanding that his ship was too damaged to resist another hit, even with the shields at maximum power, Ndigo decided to disable the shields and concentrate all power to the turbolasers so as to attack the planet. The cruiser was able to destroy the surface cannon before it could shoot the ship once again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
