Its terrain consisted of great mesas jutting up from the planet's oceans, where colonists lived behind the protective screen of great windbreaks called shield-barriers, man-made from starship-grade metal.

In addition to an intelligence agent who was shadowing him, Luke detected blank spots in which his powers could not detect anything, which could only mean ysalamiri.
