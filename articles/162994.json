Born on Kamino, Warthog became a skilled starfighter pilot and joined his clone trooper brethren in a number of engagements against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. He became good friends with fellow pilot Tracer, who served as the tail gunner for his BTL-B Y-wing starfighter during their service in Hunter Squadron. Warthog piloted his Y-wing during the Battle of Gwori of 22 BBY, serving under Jedi Masters Koon and Saesee Tiin to cripple the planet Gwori's Separatist shipyards. Although the mission was a success, Warthog lost Tracer to enemy fire from a Vulture droid starfighter while withdrawing from Gwori. At the First Battle of Felucia in 21 BBY, Warthog flew a V-19 Torrent starfighter, working with Koon to provide starfighter cover for a convoy of LAAT/i gunships. Warthog and Koon safely escorted the gunships to the surface of Felucia, where they rescued a Republic battle group that had been overrun by the Separatist Droid Army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Besides serving in Hunter Squadron, Warthog was often attached to Clone Commander CC-3636's 104th Battalion, providing aerial support or piloting one of the unit's gunships. The latter was the case during a supply mission to Aleen, where Warthog ferried 104th troops and relief supplies. Flying a nimble clone Z-95 starfighter, Warthog joined Koon in leading a starfighter assault on a slave processing facility on Kadavo, where the Separatist-allied Zygerrian Slave Empire had enslaved a number of Togruta colonists. Warthog and his Wolfpack pilots eliminated the Zygerrians' HH-87 Starhoppers and turbolaser defenses so that Admiral Coburn could retrieve the Togrutas with the light cruiser Hand of Justice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Assault on Gwori"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clone trooper who took the nickname \"Warthog\" was born on the planet Kamino for service to the Galactic Republic. Warthog became a clone trooper pilot and entered the Republic Navy during the Clone Wars, in which the Republic battled the Confederacy of Independent Systems for galactic supremacy. By 22 BBY, the first year of the war, Warthog joined the Republic Navy's Hunter Squadron, a starfighter unit led by Jedi General Plo Koon that primarily piloted BTL-B Y-wing starfighters. Fellow clone pilot Tracer became the tail gunner for Warthog's Y-wing, and the two pilots formed a close friendship while stationed on the galactic capital of Coruscant. On one assignment, Warthog's unit was deployed aboard a Republic fleet to an Outer Rim staging area in the Moskk system, in preparation to mount an assault on the nearby Gwori system. The battle group's target was the primary shipyards of Gwori Revolutionary Industries, which produced battleships for the Confederate Navy at the planet Gwori."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As part of the Republic's plan, a small team of Jedi and clones was sent to infiltrate Gwori to pinpoint the exact location of the shipyards, so that Hunter Squadron could move in and destroy the facility. Once Generals Koon and Saesee Tiin received the coordinates, they called a briefing aboard their Venator-class Star Destroyer to outline the attack strategy to Hunter Squadron. In response to comments from Warthog about their newest \"no returner\" mission, Tracer bet him ten rotations' worth of drinks that they would survive their assignment. After Koon and Tiin stated that they would be using high-power proton bombs against the enemy facility, the squadron's captain voiced his concern about reaching the shipyards themselves, as a massive Confederate fleet was blockading Gwori. Tiin explained that they would be utilizing a precision hyperspace jump, a risky maneuver that would allow them to emerge between the blockade and the planet. With all preparations in place, Warthog and Tracer set out aboard their BTL-B Y-wing starfighter with Hunter Squadron, following Koon and Tiin in their Delta-7B interceptors to the jump point. The Jedi Masters and clone pilots managed to safely reach Gwori, bypassing the Separatist blockade and heading for the world's equatorial canyon system, where the shipyards were located. Upon arrival at the shipyards, which were built into the canyon wall, Warthog and his comrades released their proton bombs onto the facility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Hunter Squadron's bombers landed direct hits to the facility, they failed to do damage beyond the top deck of Munificent-class star frigates. As the clones did not have enough ammunition to whittle away at the frigate decks in that manner, Koon had Warthog and the others set their targeting grids for the construction supports, which would compromise the facility's hold on the canyon wall. Circling back around in single-file Bantha formation, Warthog and his comrades encountered an incoming squadron of Vulture droid starfighters, which Overseer Juhm had dispatched to protect his facility. Though Tracer managed to hit several droid starfighters with their bomber's laser cannons, droid laser fire penetrated the ship's gunner bubble-turret, and Tracer was hit in the chest. Despite being concerned for his comrade, Warthog released his proton bombs alongside the rest of his unit, hitting the facility's supports and causing it to crash to the bottom of the canyon. With their objective completed, Koon and Tiin ordered Hunter Squadron to meet them at the rendezvous point, and the clones departed to jump to hyperspace. However, Tracer did not survive long enough to receive treatment, succumbing to his injury and dying before Warthog left Gwori's atmosphere."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First Battle of Felucia"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Warthog saw action on a number of worlds as part of his service to the Republic. At one point, he brought reinforcements to a Republic outpost aboard a prototype Y-wing scout bomber. In 21 BBY, as the Clone Wars entered their second year, Warthog and Hunter Squadron, flying V-19 Torrent starfighters, served under Koon as part of an evacuation operation at the jungle world of Felucia. As Koon's wingman, Warthog joined his fellow clone pilots in providing starfighter cover for the Republic fleet's LAAT/i gunships, which were to retrieve a battle group\u2014under the command of Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2014that had been trapped on the surface by a Separatist blockade. Once Hunter Squadron eliminated one of the enemy Munificent-class frigates over Felucia, Koon and Warthog moved in, leading the convoy of gunships through the breach in the blockade with an escort of starfighters. Warthog protected the gunships while Koon blasted through several Vulture droid starfighters, clearing the way for the rescue vessels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite bypassing the first wave of droid starfighters, the Republic convoy was pursued into the planetary atmosphere by more Vulture droids. A pair of them locked onto Warthog's V-19 Torrent, resisting his attempts to evade them. Unable to shake his pursuers, Warthog reported his predicament to Koon, who doubled back in his Delta-7B interceptor, the Blade of Dorin, to assist his wingman. Koon destroyed one of the droids, with its debris hitting the second droid and causing it to crash in the jungle below, right where Skywalker and Kenobi were situated with their troops. Thanks to Warthog and Koon's escort, the LAAT/i gunships were able to reach the evacuation area and collected Skywalker, Kenobi, and their men. Warthog and his general continued to provide cover after the gunships lifted off, with the convoy also retrieving a clone trooper patrol led by Skywalker's Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, from elsewhere in the jungle. The Republic forces withdrew from Felucia, abandoning the world to the Confederacy for the time being."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to operations with Hunter Squadron, Warthog served with Koon's 104th Battalion of the Grand Army of the Republic, often supplying starfighter cover or flying one of the unit's Plo's Bros gunships to deploy troops onto battlefields. Later in 21 BBY, Warthog was part of a 104th task force\u2014led by Clone Commander CC-3636, nicknamed \"Wolffe\"\u2014that was dispatched to block a Separatist annexation of the Mid Rim Qiilura system. En route there aboard an Acclamator-class assault ship, the clone detachment was redirected to deliver relief supplies to the nearby planet Aleen, which had been devastated by groundquakes. A number of LAAT/i gunships were fully loaded with provision crates and 104th troops, as was one of the Republic assault ship's accompanying Pelta-class frigates. Warthog was among the pilots assigned to bring the gunships to Aleen's surface. After launching from the transport's hangar, Warthog did a double take when he caught sight of a native Aleena flying a can-cell mount, remarking that it would be another one of \"those\" worlds. Once the pilots had brought their supplies to an Aleena refugee zone and repaired the world's mainframe computers, Commander Wolffe recalled their forces from Aleen, and they departed to rendezvous with Koon."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rescue on Kadavo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Confederacy facilitated the capture and enslavement of a number of Togruta colonists from the planet Kiros, the Republic launched an operation to rescue them from subjugation by the Zygerrian Slave Empire. After Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano infiltrated the Slave Empire, they discovered that the Togrutas were being held at a slave processing facility on Kadavo, and they called in Koon and the 104th Battalion as reinforcements to liberate the slaves. Being attached to a 104th Wolfpack squadron of clone Z-95 starfighters, Warthog was dispatched aboard Admiral Coburn's Venator-class Star Destroyer to the Kadavo system. Upon their emergence from hyperspace, Warthog left the Star Destroyer's flight deck aboard a Z-95 starfighter, heading for the slave facility alongside Koon and the Wolfpack. Leading the starfighter assault with Koon, Warthog was tasked alongside his comrades with eliminating the air defenses of the facility, which was suspended over a volcanic crater, so that Coburn could bring in the Arquitens-class light cruiser Hand of Justice to retrieve the Togrutas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Zygerrian defenses soon grew from the facility's ray shielded turret towers to HH-87 Starhoppers, which were launched to do battle with the Republic starfighters. One of the enemy Starhoppers landed a hit on Warthog's starfighter, damaging a portion of his wing between the cockpit and port engine. Noticing the struggling Warthog, Koon briefly cut his interceptor's engines, maneuvering behind the Starhoppers and firing upon them. Koon shot down one of the Zygerrian fighters, earning Warthog's thanks. Although the Republic starfighters were unable to take out the turbolaser towers due to their shielding, Skywalker addressed that issue by commandeering one of the turrets and turning it against the others. While Warthog and his fellow pilots continued to circle the facility, Coburn moved in with the Hand of Justice, allowing Wolffe and his men to rescue the Togrutas from their holding cell, which had been opening onto the crater below. Once Coburn's vessel was clear of the facility, Koon ordered the Republic's LAAT/i gunships to open fire on the enemy station, compromising its supports and dropping it into the crater. With their mission a success, Warthog, Koon, and their comrades pulled out from Kadavo, and the Togrutas were brought aboard Coburn's warship for medical treatment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Human male clone of the Grand Army template Jango Fett, Warthog stood 1.83 meters high and had black hair, black eyes, and tan skin. A veteran pilot and ace, Warthog possessed considerable skill in combat operations. He was a member of Hunter Squadron, a Republic Navy unit that enjoyed a high mission success rate, even for so-called \"no returner\" assignments. Although Hunter Squadron was reputed for piloting BTL-B Y-wing starfighters, the highly capable Warthog was also comfortable with flying a number of other vessels, including the V-19 Torrent interceptor, the LAAT/i gunship, and the agile clone Z-95 starfighter. He formed a close friendship with his Y-wing tail gunner, Tracer, and the two pilots bet on drinks over their mission to Gwori. During that operation, Warthog was so relieved with the success of their precision hyperspace jump that he almost promised to forgo their bet. He urged Tracer to hang in there after the latter was injured by enemy fire, but Tracer died from his wound."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Serving under Jedi General Plo Koon, Warthog built up a close relationship with his commanding officer throughout their mutual service on the front lines, being his wingman at the First Battle of Felucia and leading a starfighter assault on Kadavo alongside the Jedi Master. Koon saved Warthog from pursuant enemy craft on a number of occasions, including at Felucia and Kadavo, and the clone pilot was only too happy to repay the courtesy. Warthog exhibited a sarcastic sense of humor, which caused him\u2014in addition to weariness and his previous service on various worlds\u2014to comment cynically about Aleen and its inhabitants while on a mercy mission there. He spoke Galactic Basic Standard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Gwori, Warthog sported the standard pilot version of Phase I clone trooper armor, with yellow markings and the red insignia of the Galactic Republic on his helmet. By the time of the First Battle of Felucia, Warthog adopted a customized suit of Phase I armor, with his helmet featuring a black bird emblem. He did not make the jump to Phase II armor immediately, but when he did, he carried over a variation of his black helmet markings, incorporating them into his new gear. All of his armor suits were equipped with vital sign sensors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Warthog first appeared in September 2008 in the comic book The Clone Wars: Shipyards of Doom, which was drawn by the Fillbach Brothers and written by Henry Gilroy, the Head Writer for the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series. Warthog was incorporated into the television series in the episode \"Holocron Heist,\" which aired on October 2, 2009 as part of the premiere of the series' second season. He was later featured in the fourth season episodes \"Mercy Mission\" and \"Escape from Kadavo,\" which were released in October 2011 and January 2012, respectively. The latter episode debuted a new Phase II armor model for him, as all of the series' clone trooper characters were upgraded to Phase II for the fourth season. Warthog was portrayed by voice actor Dee Bradley Baker in the television series. As part of his appearance in \"Escape from Kadavo,\" Warthog received an entry in the StarWars.com Encyclopedia.
