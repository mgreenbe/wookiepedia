The Nightsisters of Dathomir mummified their dead and put them in cocoons built to resemble the trees of their homeworld. In times of crisis, those mummies could be revived through magick and fight on behalf of the clan. Because some mummies were wrapped in bandages, the Teedos of Jakku were sometimes compared to them.\nThe mummified remains of Jedi Master Luminara Unduli were held in the Spire on Stygeon Prime. A mummified Dowutin Sith were present when Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra and Dok-Ondar were on a mission to collect the Sword of Khashyun."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
