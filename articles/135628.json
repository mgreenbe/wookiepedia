The bond was always between members of the same steris, the name for an Adnerem family, and entirely non-sexual, but the Adnerem would become so close they thought of themselves as a single entity. At any one time, about ten percent of the Adnerem population was in a sterika, and whilst Adnerem did not actively seek a partner to form a sterika with\u2014as other species sought love\u2014those Adnerem not in a sterika often appeared envious of the close bond between those who were. It was incredibly rare for Adnerem to form any other kind of strong emotional attachment to a living being."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
