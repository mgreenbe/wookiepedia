The designations and color name of the unit were applied by Luke Skywalker. The Bothan pilots who would operate as Blue Squadron had less than a hundred hours of flight time in their Y-wings and were fair shots, according to Koth Melan. The Bothan pilots of this unit were joined by human Rebel pilot Ace Azzameen, selected to fill an opening in the squadron due to his exemplary record."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Raid on the Suprosa"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under the command of Rogue Leader Commander Luke Skywalker in his T-65 X-wing starfighter, Blue Squadron flew cover for a data-raid on the Imperial armed freighter Suprosa  by a Bothan team boarding via the mercenary Dash Rendar's freighter, the Outrider, to capture a supercomputer later revealed to hold the plans of the second Death Star. During the battle, the Suprosa launched a single diamond boron missile at the incoming fighters. Despite the best efforts of Rendar to defeat the missile, it successfully detonated in the midst of the Blue Squadron formation, obliterating four craft and their crews in an instant. Through the combined efforts of Skywalker and Azzameen, the freighter was disabled. Once the ship had been surrendered and the supercomputer obtained, the surviving squadron members traveled to Kothlis, delivering the data to the expert slicers of the Spynet. Six fighters, twelve Bothans in total, were destroyed in the raid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the novel Shadows of the Empire implies that Blue Squadron consists entirely of Bothans, the video game Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance features its protagonist, the human Ace Azzameen, as Blue Six."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
