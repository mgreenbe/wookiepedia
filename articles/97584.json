In 45 ABY, when Soroc was searching the Chiloon Rift, she had discovered Marvid and Craitheus Qreph's Base Prime in the heart of the Rift, stationed above an unknown object that may or may not have been the Mortis monolith. Soroc's StealthX was attacked by the Qreph brothers' force, prompting her to escape. However, upon dropping out of hyperspace, her StealthX was attacked again, and one of the first blasts caught Nineball, destroying him, while Soroc was captured. The Qrephs then used Soroc's StealthX to act as a beacon to lure in anyone coming to the rescue, but the plan was foiled by the Millennium Falcon and Ben Skywalker and Tahiri Veila, who used Nineball's remnants to piece together what had happened to Soroc."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
