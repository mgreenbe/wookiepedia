Normally kept in a strongbox under the main engineering console with a galactic chart of pulsars and other variable stars, it was employed in circumstances when the navigation computer systems of a starship had suffered a catastrophic failure. By manually plotting the position of at least two such stars, a spacer could plot a rudimentary course for the hyperdrive and avoid being stranded in the depths of space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Republic Sienar Systems manufactured the A-121 Plotter during the reign of the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
