The device had a bulb that connected to tubes and a needle like siphon. They needed to be fitted with a fresh leather skin every time they were used for extraction. The reclaimed \"essence\" would then be used to create an oily substance called oracle salve, which was a useful substance that was given great reverence in Scyre society. Similar moisture detraxors also existed on Otomok, but only for beasts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
