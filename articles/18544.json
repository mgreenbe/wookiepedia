The liner was endangered by its Captain, a member of the Ufsa family, and rescued by Junior Commander Mitth'raw'nuru and his patrol boat the Boco. Thrawn saved the lives of the 8,000 Chiss aboard by shooting off the liner's luxury wings, lightening the vessel's mass enough to secure it with the Boco's tractor beam projectors. The Boadil family was angry at the loss of their property, but family politics prevented them from seeking justice from the Ufsa or scapegoating the Irizi family of Thrawn's commanding officer Mid Captain Irizi'ar'alani. They therefore sought censure and demotion of Junior Commander Thrawn, who subsequently lost command of the Boco."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The diplomat Boadil'par'gasoi was a member of the Boadil family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Haplif of the Agbui, the Boadil family seemed to switch alliances and allegiances with other Chiss families as the need, mood, or \"possibly just the current solar cycle\" required."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
