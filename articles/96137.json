However, Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had arrived on the Saak'ak to negotiate an end to the blockade was searching for a way to escape from the ship after surviving an assassination attempt perpetrated by Viceroy Nute Gunray. The Jedi found his way to the room the Neimoidian controller was working in, and questioned him about the means to pass through the security door in the Saak'ak's hangar. The concerned Neimoidian stated that it was not possible to open the door while the power generator was functioning, so Kenobi decided to destroy the generator. After the generator was destroyed, the Neimoidian asked Kenobi to leave, and the Jedi complied."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Controller of the power generators"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A male Neimoidian worked for the Trade Federation as a controller of the power generators in the hangar bay of the Saak'ak, a Lucrehulk-class LH-3210 cargo freighter.

Kenobi managed to escape from the assassination attempt, and tried to reach the hangar to escape from the ship. Sighting Kenobi, the panicked Neimoidian quickly shut the metal door to his room, sealing himself inside and leaving the battle droids to fight Kenobi.

He was very frightened by Kenobi and tried to lock himself inside the control room when he first saw the Jedi. When this failed, the Neimoidian begged for his life, asking Kenobi not to hurt him. During Kenobi's questioning, the Neimoidian answered him quickly; however, when asked about the means to destroy the power generator, the concerned controller lied to Kenobi, telling him that the generators were indestructible.

Kenobi does not have to interact with the Neimoidian in any way and can even kill the unarmed being, which has no effect on the game. Due to this, and the fact the player has several dialogue options, whether the conversation between the Jedi and the Neimoidian is actually canonical\u2014and, if it is, the exact form in which it transpires\u2014is ambiguous. This article assumes 100% game completion with no \"dark side\" options. The game's strategy guide advises the player to talk to the technician.
