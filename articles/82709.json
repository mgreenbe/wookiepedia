It was also used by wielders who frequently used their lightsabers as a thrown weapon. The locking of the blade prevented it from being accidentally deactivated when the weapon impacted the target."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The locking activator was utilized by Jax Pavan in 18.8 BBY during his encounter with Xizor.
