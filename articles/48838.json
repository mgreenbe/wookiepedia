The droids discovered Blay and two other cloaked Yuuzhan Vong and, by analyzing their communications, uncovered more than a dozen sympathizers. In order to avoid alerting them to their discovery, these infiltrators and sympathizers were summoned to a staffing meeting arranged by Jedi Knight Jacen Solo, who intended to bring their spying to an end. Quietly, the Imperial forces transferred the group to the Right to Rule, an Imperial I-class Star Destroyer stationed above the planet Borosk. First, the sympathizers were brought in individually to prevent them from recognizing their fellow conspirators. Blay arrived five minutes before the final sympathizer, showing no signs of suspicion, followed shortly after by the remaining two Yuuzhan Vong."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they awaited the arrival of Torvin Xyn, the final infiltrator, Blay and her cloaked comrade remained undeterred by the meeting, though several of the sympathizers began to suspect the meeting's true nature. Upon Xyn's arrival, he realized Solo\u2014who was present at the meeting\u2014was a Jedi and immediately removed his masquer and launched an attack, with the other Yuuzhan Vong following suit shortly after. Without their vonduun crab armor and wielding only their amphistaffs, all three infiltrators were quickly killed, with Blay being cut down by stormtroopers and security droids. Afterward, Imperial Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, who witnessed the meeting, lamented the unnecessary deaths of the infiltrators to a skeptical Solo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon her arrival at the meeting for the discovered Yuuzhan Vong infiltrators, Blay, believing her cover to be intact, remained calm and did not question why she was there.
