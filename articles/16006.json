During that time, the Rakata made use of the world as a prison colony, where they placed many dangerous prisoners that remained trapped for the millennia. It entered an ice age around 5000 BBY. Its inhabitants dwelt in three volcanic jungle rifts. Later, during the Great Galactic War, the Republic used Belsavis' prison, The Tomb, to confine dangerous Sith Lords and war criminals. By the beginning of the Galactic War, the resurgent Sith Empire discovered Belsavis' location from the imprisoned crime lord, Ivory, through use of a Rakata transmitter, and sought to perform a mass prison break, including freeing the imprisoned Dread Masters and discovering Rakata secrets. At the same time, the Sith Emperor dispatched Executor Krannus to destroy Belsavis, which would have sent shockwaves into hyperspace that would have destroyed adjacent systems, fulfilling the Emperor's intended galactic genocide. It was only through the intervention of the Hero of Tython that Belsavis was saved."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A community by the name of Plett's Well was settled in 88 BBY by Jedi Master Plett, and came to be called simply Plawal.

Some of the younglings, such as Roganda Ismaren, were captured by the Inquisitorius. Around 6 BBY, the Imperial Governor stationed a few tariff police on the world to deal with increased smuggler activity. Around 0 BBY, Brathflen Corporation and other fruit-companies established domes around the world.
