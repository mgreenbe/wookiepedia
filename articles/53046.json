Its headquarters was a Ubrikkian Floating Fortress, but they also had a Trandoshan prisoner ship to transport their captured. Although the hunting guild was known to hunt various kinds of big-game animals such as wampas, narglatches, and gundarks, the guild was also known for kidnapping sentient beings from across the galaxy in order to hunt them down for sport in their MSP80 Pteropter hover pods. Shortly after kidnapping the Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano and the Wookiee Chewbacca, all but three of the guild members were killed by a Wookiee-led rescue mission, effectively dissolving the guild."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
