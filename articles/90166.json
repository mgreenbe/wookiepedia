While the suit was heavier and more restrictive than some of its counterparts, it was sturdy and afforded solid protection. For this reason, it was a popular choice of armor for many mercenaries, who found the trade-off tolerable. Brejik, the leader of the Black Vulkars, wore such a suit of armor when he was killed during a brief fight against Revan and Bastila Shan in the wake of the Tarisian Season Opener swoop race of 3956 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
