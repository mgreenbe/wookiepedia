Forged in the shape of a traditional mythosaur axe with metals taken from the Galactic Republic's prized capital ship, the Courageous, after the Mandalorian's victory in the Battle of Serroco, the battle-axe became a symbol of Mandalore's prowess. With a long pole staff and the addition of cortosis, as well as an energy cell, Mandalore the Ultimate's battle-axe was twice as deadly as those traditionally constructed from mythosaur bone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Mandalore the Ultimate arrived aboard the Arkanian Legacy to meet with the Arkanian leader Arkoh Adasca, along with representatives of the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic competing to obtain control of Adasca's Project Black Harvest, he came face to face with Republic Admiral Saul Karath. Mandalore brandished his battle-axe at the meeting as spoils of war, taunting Karath with the remains of his former flagship, the Courageous. The meeting ultimately came to naught, and as the conference turned to open conflict between the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders, the Republic Military, and the Jedi, Mandalore the Ultimate departed the Arkanian starship with his battle-axe in hand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mandalore the Ultimate's battle-axe was a modernized update of the ancient mythosaur axe traditionally created by early Mandalorian warriors. But while these traditional axes were constructed from calcified bones of the long-dead mythosaurs of the Mandalorian's cultural homeworld of Mandalore, Mandalore the Ultimate forged his own weapon from metals salvaged and melted down from the Galactic Republic cruiser, the Courageous, as well as lightsaber-resistant cortosis. When constructing the axe, Mandalore the Ultimate had the metal blades placed atop a lengthy pole staff, nearly as long as the Taung warrior was tall, and installed an energy cell that enabled the axe to deliver a strong electric charge. With these features, Mandalore the Ultimate's battle-axe was capable of inflicting nearly twice the damage as traditional mythosaur axes made of bone. The weapon weighed ten kilograms in total, and possessed an estimated value of 1000."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3963 BBY, the forces of the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders engaged the Galactic Republic Navy over the planet Serroco. After bombarding the cities of the surface, the Mandalorians turned their attention to the Republic fleet and their flagship, the Inexpugnable-class tactical command ship Courageous. The Neo-Crusader warships overwhelmed the Republic battle group, boarding and taking the Courageous as the crew was forced to evacuate and flee. Claiming their battle-won prize, the Mandalorians had the Courageous torn down and melted for scrap. Taking a share of the Courageous' materials, the Mandalorian leader, Mandalore the Ultimate, forged a battle-axe in the shape of a traditional Mandalorian mythosaur axe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that year, Mandalore was invited to a meeting with the leader of the Arkanian mega-corporation Adascorp, Arkoh Adasca, aboard the company's starship headquarters, the Arkanian Legacy. There, Adasca offered representatives of the Republic, Jedi Order, and the Mandalorians the opportunity to take command of a secret bio-weapons project he had cultivated. As Mandalore the Ultimate met face to face with Republic Admiral Saul Karath\u2014the former commanding officer of the Courageous\u2014at the negotiations, he brandished the battle-axe he had forged and taunted Karath with the revelation of the weapon's origins. When one of the Jedi present at the meeting created a false scenario designed to make Mandalore the Ultimate believe he had become the target of an assassination attempt by Adasca, Mandalore took his battle-axe and departed the Arkanian Legacy, while violence broke out between his Neo-Crusader warriors and the Republic military and Jedi Knights."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mandalore the Ultimate's battle-axe first appeared in Star Wars canon in the twentieth issue of the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic comic series.
