Jabba Desilijic Tiure sent the Rodian bounty hunter on a mission to kidnap the Givin codebreaker from the InterGalactic Banking Clan on the Outer Rim planet of Mygeeto. During the mission, Greedo used a lightsaber to break a window open in order to escape with the code breaker. When a grappling hook was shot across from a skiff to escape, the Givin said it wasn't safe for him to zipline across. Greedo pushed the codebreaker onto it anyway but the zipline snapped and the Givin fell to his death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Givin codebreaker was employed by the InterGalactic Banking Clan to help win an upcoming war with the Hutts. The codebreaker was with Vice Chairman Anolo observing Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi's lightsaber when a blaster bolt shattered the window near them. Jabba the Hutt sent the bounty hunter Greedo and other enforcers to the planet Mygeeto to kidnap the codebreaker. The Givin and Anolo evacuated with the guards but while observing a wall, the Givin realised that they were led into a trap as Greedo and Takvaa broke in and engaged in a firefight with the guards. Anolo and the guards were killed, and Greedo grabbed the Givin, barricading himself in. As Greedo was trying to figure out a means of escape, the codebreaker calculated their odds of escape and why he was being kidnapped to Greedo's annoyance. Greedo used Ki-Adi-Mundi's lightsaber to break the window and had a zipline shot across from the skiff they were escaping on. The Givin tried to tell Greedo that it was too dangerous for him to cross but Greedo did not care, pushing the codebreaker on to the zipline. The zipline snapped and the Givin fell to his death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The codebreaker had black eyes and was a pale skin male with a AJ^6 cyborg construct attached to the back of his head. Being a Givin, he had a gift for mathematics which was improved by the AJ^6 in his head. The cyborg construct also synced his brain to the Imperial algorithm that generates security codes. He would sometimes make a sarcastic comment during his kidnapping and was also trying to calculate everything going on around him. His constant pestering got to Greedo who threatened to kill him if he kept talking. The Givin was also very worried. He refused to go on the zipline, citing it would result in his death which it ultimately did."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Givin codebreaker had a AJ^6 cyborg construct implanted into the back of his skull by the InterGalactic Banking Clan when he was employed. This improved on his gift of mathematics giving him the ability to make more precise calculations. The codebreaker's clothing consisted of a long blue shirt with grey pants and brown boots. He wore a brown robe over his shirt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Givin codebreaker first appeared in Galaxy's Edge 2, a comic written by Ethan Sacks and illustrated by Will Sliney."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
