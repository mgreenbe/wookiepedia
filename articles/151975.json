When Jedi Master Yoda intervened and began destroying Ventress' droids, battle droid commander 224 and several of his droids were sent out to defeat him, with the winner of the ensuing battle gaining Katuunko's trust. During the battle, the battle droid was destroyed by Yoda, along with his companions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rugosa"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle droid was a B1-Series battle droid manufactured by Baktoid Combat Automata and Baktoid Armor Workshop to serve in the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars, a conflict between the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Galactic Republic. During the war, the droid was deployed amongst a battalion of battle droids to the moon Rugosa, under the command of the Sith apprentice Asajj Ventress and the battle droid commander 224. The Separatists had learned that King Katuunko of the planet Toydaria and Jedi Grand Master Yoda were meeting in secret on the moon in order to discuss a Republic supply post being created on Toydaria in exchange for protection of the Toydarian people. Ventress had managed to reach Katuunko first, and offered Separatist protection instead, but after she and the king learned that Yoda had successfully landed on the planet, an agreement was made. If Yoda could defeat her droid forces and reach Katuunko, he would have the allegiance of the Toydarians but if he failed they would side with the Separatists instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving on the moon in a C-9979 landing craft, commander 224 led a section of the droid forces including this one to find and defeat Yoda, including three Armored Assault Tanks, one of which this droid walked alongside. Entering the coral forests of Rugosa, they soon sighted the Jedi Grand Master, who was accompanied by three clone troopers, nicknamed Lieutenant Thire, Jek and Rys, and ordered his troops to open fire. The Separatist forces were out of range, however, and 224 soon had to give the order to stop as the tanks could not fit through the surrounding foliage. As the vehicles could not continue, 224 remained behind while sending out ground troops to find the Republic forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While patrolling with several other droids, another droid noticed a small green creature, and pointed it out to his companions. This droid irritably told him that this was Master Yoda and noted that he certainly was, as Ventress had stated earlier, a little one. The droid then ordered his companions to blast the Jedi, and he and his fellow droids all did so. However, after initially splittling up into squads, they were all eventually cut down by Yoda. Yoda and his companions destroyed two patrols of B1 battle droids and a group of B2 super battle droids, but were eventually driven back by droidekas. Yoda was ultimately successful in defeating the remaining droid forces and reaching the rendezvous point, earning the allegiance of the Toydarians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like all B1 battle droids within the Separatist Droid Army, the driver stood at 1.93 meters tall and had masculine programming.
