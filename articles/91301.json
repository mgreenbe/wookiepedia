It was executed through several operations, the first of which, called Operation Furball, was to rescue the Wookiee chieftain Tarfful. This was followed by Operation Intervene, whose objective was to destroy Separatist supplies and bases. After this, Delta Squad's objective in Operation Forest Fire was to destroy the Kachirho Bridge to stop the Separatist advance. However, all of these missions were almost completed in vain when a Recusant-class light destroyer started to unload waves of troops. Operation Gauntlet was Delta Squad's final operation on Kashyyyk, with the destruction of the ship through the commandeering of several Wookiee dual missile turrets being the objective."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The commandos, led by Jedi General Etain Tur-Mukan and Boss, infiltrated a Trandoshan mercenary camp in order to rescue the Wookiee Chieftain Tarfful. The commandos successfully rescued Tarfful from several of General Grievous's bodyguard droids, as well as obtaining intelligence about the Confederacy's alliance with the Trandoshan mercenaries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Delta Squad also found out the number of hostiles on Kashyyyk, which was more than the Republic High Command had thought. The squad then sabotaged the Trandoshans' outpost on Kashyyyk, destroying two of their landing pads. When the Confederacy launched their full-scale invasion of the Wookiee tree-city of Kachirho, Delta Squad was the only Grand Army of the Republic unit planetside capable of assisting in the defense. Delta Squad sabotaged a bridge connecting the two sides of Kachirho, stopping the Confederacy's advance. The commandos also secured vital munitions and ordnance depots for the Wookiees, allowing them to sufficiently arm themselves to fight against the Confederacy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their final operation was the destruction of a Recusant-class light destroyer attempting to land more battle droids onto the surface. Following the destruction of the cruiser, Sev, the team's sniper specialist, was lost, presumed MIA, but orders that came directly from Grand Master Yoda forced Delta Squad to abandon Sev. Delta Squad was then extracted and redeployed as the Republic invasion force arrived, and the Battle of Kashyyyk was joined."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars: Republic Commando showed the date of this mission as 785 days, or roughly two years, after the Battle of Geonosis. This led some fans to believe that the Battle of Kashyyyk raged on from 20 BBY to 19 BBY. However Ryan Kaufman, one of the lead writers of Republic Commando, has said that day 785 was an oversight and that the mission was meant to take place just days before the Battle of Kashyyyk that appeared in Episode III."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
