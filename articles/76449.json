By the time of the Clone Wars, Dilsn was an elderly man. Around 21 BBY, after suffering several injuries, Dilsn had surgery performed on his leg and hip, and, following the procedure, he recovered from the operation on the moon Iktotch. Later, while he was still not fully healed, Dilsn required transport to the planet Almas, the site of a Jedi academy. The Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents from the Cularin system, agreed to take Diln to Almas in their starship, and they subsequently collected him from Iktotch."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "En route to Almas, the agents landed their ship on Burnout, a space station located in the Thaereian system, in order to refuel.

The agents set out to recover the chip while Dilsn opted to remain aboard the starship and guard it, as his injuries prevented him from pursuing the saboteur.
