It was the chooba's favorite dish. The plant had a very meaty interior. Kitonaks often mimicked sulfaro plants. They would lie down and wait for a chooba to climb up to its head, looking for the plant's interior. The Kitonak would then swallow the chooba whole."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
