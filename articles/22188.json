It was present on the Weequay pirate ship, Marauder when two droids, C-3PO and R2-D2 were captured on Balnab by the pirates. He was watching a gladiatorial fight between droids which was meant for the Weequay's entertainment. CS-321 was to fight in the arena soon. One droid, K0-5D kept blasting away at its competition in the arena which instilled fear inside C-3PO. CS-321 informed him that they were next which further scared C-3PO. However, when C-3PO and R2 were about to take on K0-5D, General Grievous, who was passing by, attacked the Marauder for target practice. The Confederacy of Independent Systems blew a hole in the ship which sucked C-3PO, R2, K0-5D, CS-321, several other droids, and Weequays into space. CS-321 along with some other droids were captured by Grievous's battle droids and taken to his ship where they would be incinerated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "CS-321 was voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
