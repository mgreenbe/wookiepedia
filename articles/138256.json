When detonated, each grenade released T-289 stun gas, which caused disorientation, nausea, and vomiting. The gas was nonlethal, except in very large doses, and ineffective against targets wearing protective breath masks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The stun gas was useful against a wide range of alien species, although its effectiveness could vary depending on the target. While a Human would go down quickly from T-289, a Wookiee could still get in a few good swipes before finally passing out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
