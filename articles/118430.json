They started out by selling the music to tourists on low-quality datachips. The business soon took off, because Tarasin music became popular among various aquatic species, who found the vibrations of the music to be very soothing to their gills. When Senator Lavina Durada-Vashne Wren planned to marry Jarid DeBell, she ordered some Tarsin music from S&N Music for the ceremony.
