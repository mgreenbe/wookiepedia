When Vestara was later sent on a mission to confront the Jedi Luke Skywalker, Lahka Khai remained in good health, although she missed her daughter.

Vestara began training in the ways of the Sith, and shortly after Ship, a Sith Meditation Sphere, arrived on the planet in 41 ABY, she was called to meet with the Circle of Lords in Kesh's Circle Chambers, in the capital city of Tahv. Gavar and Vestara were worried that she might have gotten in trouble, and, though Lahka could tell that something was wrong, she knew it was not her place to be concerned about Sith business. However, at the meeting, Vestara was chosen to become the apprentice of Lady Rhea. To begin her training, Vestara had to move away from her family and live in the Sith Temple located in the nearby Takara Mountains."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 43.5 ABY, Vestara was chosen to be a member of the Sith strike team sent to confront the Jedi Luke and Ben Skywalker. She was the sole survivor of the mission, and went on to recruit a group of dark side Nightsisters on Dathomir to the Tribe's cause. Gavar, too, left on a mission to find Vestara and then make a feigned alliance with the Jedi to attack the dark side entity Abeloth. Throughout that time, Lahka Khai remained in good health.

He was able to take some time to meet with Lahka and live with her at their estate for a few days. Lahka then joined Gavar and the majority of the Sith in the Tribe in attending Abeloth's arrival planetside at the Tahv spaceport. Later that evening Lahka returned to their estate while Gavar attended a masquerade for Abeloth to which Lahka had not been invited. Gavar spent the night on his ChaseMaster frigate, the Black Wave, rather than returning home; and in the night Abeloth unleashed a powerful attack on the city, leaving much of Tahv in ruins and destroying many of its inhabitants.

She was also capable of reading some of Gavar's emotions. Lahka did not fully understand the matters of the Lost Tribe of Sith, but she knew that it was not her place to interfere in their affairs. As such, she did not ask questions of her husband and daughter when they became troubled by Vestara being called to the Circle Chambers. She missed her daughter when Vestara traveled off-planet on a mission to kill the Skywalkers, but she was proud of Vestara's accomplishments. When Gavar told her of Vestara's developing relationship with Ben Skywalker, Lahka suggested that Ben could prove a powerful asset to the Tribe and their family if Vestara swayed him, and when Gavar responded with his fear that Ben might sway her, Lahka stated her faith that Vestara would never betray her family, the Tribe, or the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lahka was partial to the Sith Victory flower, and happily crushed them during Abeloth's celebration in order to enjoy their scent.
