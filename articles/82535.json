Meanwhile, a Force-wielding Nightsister hailing from the planet Dathomir also ended up stranded on the Forest Moon. By the time following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Charal kept the stranded Trandoshan as a slave, earning him the moniker of \"Lizardman the Slave.\" Dimwitted, but with a keen sense of smell, Charal sent Lizardman on a mission to gather a certain type of herb which grew within the forests of the small moon. The leaves were to serve as one of the main ingredients for a poultice Charal was concocting, a potion which would have the power to divine the future. Unfortunately for Charal, her plans were delayed when the foolish Trandoshan ended up getting lost in the woods. In the meantime, Charal bided her time at Terak's Keep, a stronghold belonging to the Marauders, a band of Sanyassan pirates led by King Terak."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luckily for Charal, a spacer happened upon the stronghold and ended up becoming a servant for the Witch-Queen. After having acquired an Ewok spleen for her poultice, Charal sent her newly acquired servant deep into the forests of Endor to find the wayward Lizardman and bring him back safely to Terak's Keep. Out in the woods, Lizardman was finally discovered by Charal's newest servant, and willingly followed the individual home to his master. Lizardman's extended absence was not a complete misadventure. He had on him the leaves needed for Charal's poultice, and promptly handed them over to her. After obtaining a third ingredient in the form of Ewok spit, Charal was finally able to complete her poultice, and envisioned a future where many starships would arrive to the moon, thus allowing her to steal one and secure passage back to her homeworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lizardman the Slave had green skin and gold colored eyes. Considered by Charal to be \"dumb,\" the Nightsister Witch-Queen nevertheless valued Lizardman for his keen sense of smell, which proved useful for finding the necessary herbs for her poultice. However, the slave's lack of intelligence rendered him unable to find his way back home after getting lost in the woods of the Forest Moon. The Trandoshan's lack of intellect was also evidenced by the simplistic manner in which he spoke Basic.

He was included in the second quest given by Charal, an NPC located at the Marauders' Stronghold on the moon of Endor. In the quest, players were instructed by Charal to find Lizardman and return him safely to the stronghold.
