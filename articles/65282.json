The two posed as inspectors to gain access to the depot. One of the stormtroopers asked for authorization, and Chewbacca provided their \"authorization:\" shots from his bowcaster. He then took control of the Imperial walkers and used them in the assault on the communication jammers in Chenachochan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Depot appears in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds during the Chewbacca campaign.
