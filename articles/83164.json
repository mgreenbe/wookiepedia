Jinzler, who had joined the mission by posing as a diplomat for the New Republic, identified it as Lorana's and Skywalker offered the weapon to him.

Eventually, he showed it to Lorana's younger brother Dean Jinzler in the aftermath of an attack on Outbound Flight by warriors of the Vagaari Empire. While Skywalker suspected the lightsaber might have belonged to C'baoth, Jinzler, who joined the mission by posing as a diplomat for the New Republic identified it as Lorana's. Skywalker offered to give the weapon to him and although Jinzler accepted the offering, he postponed taking it. Instead, he told Skywalker to temporarily keep it, believing the Jedi would need it in their attempt to prevent the escape of a group of Vagaari warriors aboard Dreadnaught-Four who had stolen droids for use against the enemy Chiss Ascendancy. During the ensuing battle, Jade Skywalker used Lorana's lightsaber to destroy a droideka. After maneuvering the droideka above the lightsaber, she used the Force to activate the blade from a safe distance and destroy its mini-reactor. In hitting the mini-reactor, Jade Skywalker triggered a large explosion that destroyed both the droideka and lightsaber. Although the two Jedi searched, they could not find any remaining part of Lorana's lightsaber to present to her brother. Despite the loss of the last remaining material connection to his sister, his journey to the place where Lorana sacrificed her life helped Jinzler come to terms with the bitter feelings he once had for his sister. As a result, he was able to accept the loss and felt it was fitting that the weapon was sacrificed to protect the survivors of Outbound Flight, just as Lorana had given her own life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lorana's lightsaber first appeared in the 2004 novel Survivor's Quest written by Timothy Zahn.
