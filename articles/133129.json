Luke believes that Wedge Antilles, here described as an old friend who grew up with him on Tatooine, is aboard. When they come aboard, the ship appears to be abandoned, but the ship's log contains a recording of Wedge's voice. The recording tells the story of how Wedge and fellow pilot Wes Janson survived the Battle of Hoth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were stranded there for months, fending off the deadly cold and Wampa attacks. One day, when Wedge went out hunting for ice scrabblers, a group of scavengers led by Arns Grimraker came across the wounded Janson and killed him. Wedge avenged his friend by stealing the scavengers' ship, and leading their pursuing ships into the path of the TIE fighters who had been left behind in the Hoth system to search for Rebel stragglers. The tape ends with Wedge noting that his vessel is now adrift."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, it turns out that Wedge is still alive, and was merely outside the transport doing exterior repairs.

Wedge Antilles is stranded on Hoth in this issue, although he escapes the Battle of Hoth in the radio adaptation of Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, and appears in Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire.
