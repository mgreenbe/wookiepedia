Also known as just NT, she could detach from the Inferno and operate as an independent unit. NT was pre-programmed with ethics circuits, which her Devaronian master found to be quite annoying. She was also quite fond of Jedi Master Quinlan Vos, to whom she had given access to the ship's systems. She was made at the Golden Nyss Shipyards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
