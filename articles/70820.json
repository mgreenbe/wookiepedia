He ran for a while and eventually came to Tatooine where after some time he tried to remotely access Viidu's old bank account. Not long after that, he was caught by a group of mad militiamen who had turned to cannibalism. Fortunately for Jettison, Corso Riggs noticed him trying to access Viidu's account and tracked his location, which allowed him and the Voidhound to arrive just in time to save Jettison from a gruesome fate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the ordeal, Jettison got a job testing HoloNet security in Anchorhead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
