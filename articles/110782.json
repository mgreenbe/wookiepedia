During the conflict, Foxfire Squadron was deployed to support the Grand Army of the Republic in an engagement against Separatists over the world Ongary IX. During the battle, Foxfire Squadron were deployed as bombers to fire burrowing plasma charges against Separatist positions entrenched inside fortified mines.
