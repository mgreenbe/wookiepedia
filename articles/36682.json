Director Orson Krennic owned one such vessel. It had a starkly geometric hull shape and folding bat-like wings. Magna Tolvan chased down Chelli Aphra to Skako Minor in a Delta-class T-3c shuttle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Delta-class T-3c shuttle was originally designed as a side project by Sienar Fleet Systems and was not intended for production. However, Director Orson Krennic saw the concept design of the transport and became fascinated by it, leading to Sienar's decision to produce the shuttle. The ship was optimized for stealth, with a dark, sloped hull and composite skin. The crew cabin was sparse, with simple crash seats and storage straps. The foldable lateral wings decreased the shuttle's footprint when on the ground. The wings contained HoloNet and Subspace antennae to maintain communications when in deep space. Laser cannons were attached to the bottom of the shuttle and on the tip of each of its three wings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
