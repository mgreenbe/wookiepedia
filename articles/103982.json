The player with the highest score less than or equal to 20 won the round, and the player who won three rounds won the match. A round in which the two players tied was not counted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Gameplay"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pazaak had two different decks. The main (or \"table\") deck was composed of cards numbered 1\u201310. (The total cards in this deck was unbound, though it tended to have four of each number.) There was also one side deck for each player in the game. The players themselves assembled these decks, which had to have exactly ten cards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the beginning of the game, each player would randomly select four cards from their side deck, making up their Hand. Each player drew a card from the main deck, with the highest card determining who played first. Then the first turn of the first player would start. The player would draw a card from the main deck and play it on the table. After that, the player could choose to either place a card down from their hand, or to end their turn. Only one hand card could be played per turn, and no more cards were ever drawn from the side deck."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When ending their turn, the player had two options:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "End Turn: If the player ended their turn, they had to draw a new card from the main deck at the start of the next turn. This was repeated until either they stood, went bust, filled the table, or reached a score of exactly 20."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stand: If the player stood, they kept their current sum until the end of the set and did not play any other cards. The opponent, however, could continue playing cards, unless he had chosen to stand as well.
