In the year 0 BBY, Adema was stationed in the Citadel Tower on the planet Scarif under the command of General Sotorus Ramda. He was present in the Citadel's command center when Director Orson Krennic of the Empire's Imperial Military Department of Advanced Weapons Research division arrived there to retrieve from the facility's archives all recorded correspondence ever sent by Imperial scientist Galen Erso.

Some of these reports were genuine, but others, including those from Pad Two and Pad Five, were false attempts by defected Imperial pilot Bodhi Rook and fellow rebel Corporal Stordan Tonc from aboard the stolen Imperial cargo shuttle SW-0608 on pad nine to distract the Imperial forces. Adema fell for the ruse and, after asking for confirmation from Pads Twelve, Ten, and Eight, ordered that men be sent to Pad Five, where no rebels were actually fighting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after being fooled, Adema received a report of unauthorized access in the Citadel's data vault, as a three-person rebel team had sneaked inside the tower to find the Death Star plans while the battle raged outside as a diversion.

Krennic quickly worked out what was happening and left to confront the rebels in the vault with two death troopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In an attempt to prevent the battle station's plans from falling into rebel hands, the Empire destroyed the Citadel soon after with the Death Star's superlaser.

When reporting the unauthorized access of the Citadel's data vault to Krennic, Adema's head twitched to the side, seeking support from other officers in the control center, but he received none.
