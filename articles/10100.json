After fighting off his bodyguards, Chanath took Big String into custody. However, she dropped him into the ocean after receiving a call from Emperor Palpatine.

He built a fortress which stored the vast majority of his proceeds from various illegal activities. String also owned assets offworld. Shortly before the theft of the Emperor Palpatine's luxury yacht Imperialis, String incurred the wrath of an enemy who sent the bounty hunter Chanath Cha to destroy his empire and to bring him captive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The attack"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cha fought her way into the fortress and blew it up. String managed to flee onto a water speeder with three of his bodyguards. When one of the bodyguards asked if they should return to find survivors, String told him to drive on. However, Cha followed riding rocket boots. Knowing Cha's capabilities, String urged his guard to drive faster. However, Cha swam under the water speeder and rocketed her way out through the speeder, disabling it and leaving it dead on the water."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sting and his henchmen clung to the hull of the ship.

The bounty hunter identified herself as Chanath Cha and told String that someone out there did not like him. She attacked Sting's bodyguards and threw them into the water. When Cha faced String, he demanded to know what she was going to do to him. Cha replied that she was going to safe him from drowning if he would drop his blaster.

String tried to bribe her but Cha countered that she had destroyed much of his wealth. Sting responded that he had offworld holdings. At that point, Cha received a message on her holoprojector. Knowing that the client was the Emperor, she dropped String into the ocean. The Emperor then tasked Cha with recovering his yacht Imperialis or destroying it if she could not recover the ship in order to keep the items inside from falling into the hands of others."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack on Big String's fortress first appeared in the 2015 comic Lando 2, written by Charles Soule, drawn by Alex Maleev, and colored by Paul Mounts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
