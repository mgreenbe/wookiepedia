Although a small and idyllic world, Scarif played an important part in the Galactic Empire's military-industrial complex, becoming a center for top-secret research beyond inspection distance of the prying eyes of the Imperial Senate. Among the projects stored here was the Death Star battle station, a construction so important the entire planet was covered by a planetary deflector shield that could only be entered via a Shield Gate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Scarif was a verdant, beautiful if relatively small world, measuring just over nine thousand kilometers in diameter. It had a remote and isolated galactic location in the Abrion sector of the southeast Outer Rim Territories. A deep-blue world speckled with clouds, Scarif was comprised of tropical, volcanic island chains rising from clear, shallow oceans. Deeper oceans teeming with life were surrounded by rocky archipelagos. The planet's mantle was filled with dense metals that became valuable in starship construction. Scarif's sandy beaches were tranquil and idyllic, and some led into jungle canopies filled with wildlife, including areca nut palm trees and the giant peetalex sea grape, which offered natural protection. The world had a temperate and comfortable climate and from the surface appeared as a tropical paradise despite its challenging ecosystem and dangerous predators."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galactic Empire constructed its Imperial security complex across a wheel of islets and landmasses connected by sandy tombolos and artificial transit tubes. The region was surrounded by a volcanic island covered in jungles, and the central islet housed the monolithic Citadel Tower."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Scarif's planetary mantle was filled with dense metals valuable in starship construction, its remote location deep within the Outer Rim Territories meant that supplying shipyards of the Core Worlds proved too costly. However, the Galactic Empire saw Scarif as a potential place to house their most classified projects away from the inspection distance of the Imperial Senate. To this end, the Empire built a major security complex in the planet's northern hemisphere, garrisoned by a special deployment of the Tarkin Initiative, centered on a Citadel Tower. Large swaths of land were excavated in order to build starships, and a high-altitude Shield Gate station allowed entry past the planetary deflector shield, which itself was protected by several Imperial Star Destroyers. Scarif became the principal construction facility for the Empire's vast war machine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the years, various officers treated Scarif as a place for an unofficial retirement, where they could neglect their duty in the comfort of a tropical paradise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 9 BBY, the Death Star, an armored battle station whose superlaser would be capable of destroying entire worlds, was moved from Geonosis to Scarif to continue its construction under the supervision of Director Orson Krennic. The designs for the station were transferred to the massive databanks of the Citadel. Despite the importance of the project, the officers of the garrison, commanded by General Sotorus Ramda, became complacent, mainly because of the confidence placed in Scarif's defenses."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Scarif"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Scarif was a battle between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire, taking place in the year 0 BBY. The Rebels had received information from Jyn Erso that the Death Star plans were being held in the Citadel Tower, and decided to attempt to capture them. The group successfully infiltrated the tower and successfully managed to transmit the plans to Princess Leia Organa and the Alliance Fleet. However, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin ordered the Death Star to fire a precise single reactor blast at the planet in an effort to halt the transmission, as well as to eliminate his longtime rival Krennic. The blast did not destroy Scarif itself but dissipated its planetary shield and obliterated the Citadel Tower as well as everyone in its vicinity. The Death Star's superlaser boiled the oceans of Scarif, burning a part of the planet's surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Scarif is a tropical planet that was created for the 2016 Star Wars anthology film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.
