Skirtopanol was used to coerce confessions out of subjects, and administered via injection. Skirtopanol took effect within a few minutes, making the subject lethargic, compliant, open to suggestion, free with information, and also sometimes caused them to ramble. An agent would have to work constantly to keep torture on track with a subject injected with skirtopanol, as they would also begin to ramble and trail off in the middle of a sentence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, if injected with the wrong dosage, a subject could fall into a coma and permanent cognitive impairment. Confessions extracted via the usage of skirtopanol often were ruled as inadmissible by courts due to the suggestibility of individuals under its influence. As such, courts also frowned upon its usage by law enforcement agencies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
