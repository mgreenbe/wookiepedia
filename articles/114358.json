The Confederacy of Independent Systems attempted to attack the stronghold with a plan that would sacrifice many of their battle droids due to the planet's treacherous icy terrain. The tactical droid in charge of deploying the forces chose to land them in a safer area, where they would not be devastated by natural causes but would be spotted by the Republic. The Republic army was prepared to defend the fortress, resulting in a loss for the Separatists, but a minimized number of droid casualties."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
