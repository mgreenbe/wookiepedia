The invitations were passed out by Lando Calrissian to 100 of the most influential politicians on Coruscant, as part of a plot to help the Jedi launch their StealthXs safely. As soon as the politicians were aboard the Errant Venture, Terrik had their security teams incapacitated by coma gas, and then he opened fire on orbital mirrors over Coruscant to distract the Galactic Alliance Sixth Fleet\u2014the fleet could not return fire with the politicians on board, and the distraction allowed the StealthXs to launch successfully. The tournament continued as the Errant Venture traveled to Pydyr with the StealthXs, where the starfighters helped Luke and Ben Skywalker fight off the Sith. By that time, the tournament was down to its final table, with Chief of Staff Wynn Dorvan the favorite to win."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 43.5 ABY, several Jedi began to fall prey to a Force psychosis, causing strained relations between the New Jedi Order and the Galactic Alliance government. Meanwhile, exiled Grand Master Luke Skywalker and his son, Ben, encountered a new Sith Tribe. The Jedi Order wanted to send a wing of StealthXs to assist the Skywalkers, but were unable to due to first a Mandalorian raid on the Jedi Temple, and later a siege of the Temple."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the siege was lifted in 44 ABY, the Jedi Council wanted to launch the StealthXs as quickly as possible, but interim Grand Master Kenth Hamner wanted the Jedi to wait\u2014he had secretly made a deal with Alliance Admiral Nek Bwua'tu to wait to launch the StealthXs until Bwua'tu gave his word, in order to ensure the cooperation of the Alliance Navy with the Jedi strike team. However, an assassination attempt on Bwua'tu left him in a coma, unable to help, and when the rest of the Council learned of Hamner's actions, they grew furious and relieved him of his duty, determined to launch the StealthXs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Lando Calrissian and Jaina Solo had returned to Coruscant with news of the Sith Tribe building a war fleet, and the Jedi decided that they needed to launch their StealthXs as soon as possible; although they acknowledged that, with the Galactic Alliance Sixth Fleet in orbit, they would need to distract the fleet in order to launch safely. Calrissian thus passed out invitations to the first ever Tendrando Arms Celebrity Sabacc Charity Challenge, a sabacc charity event to be held for one hundred of the most influential politicians on Coruscant\u2014including Senators Fost Bramsin and Haydnat Treen, General Merratt Jaxton, and Moff Drikl Lecersen. The entrance fee for the tournament was 1,000,000, and the top prize was 50,000,000."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The tournament"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi coordinated carefully with Booster Terrik, who agreed to hold the tournament in his Star Destroyer, the Errant Venture. Treen was running late to the event, but Galactic Alliance Chief of Staff Wynn Dorvan had heard about the tournament and showed interest, and as they were pressed for time, Terrik agreed to give him her chair. As the Jedi prepared to launch their StealthX wing, Terrik saw that the politicians' security teams were incapacitated by coma gas, and the Errant Venture began to open fire on some of Coruscant's Orbital Mirrors. The Galactic Alliance could not strike back with one hundred important government figures aboard the vessel, and Terrik suggested that Dorvan\u2014who was still on the bridge, send a message to Chief of State Natasi Daala, explaining the situation to her. He was reluctant, claiming that she did not negotiate for hostages, but eventually complied. Although Hamner attempted to prevent it, the StealthXs successfully launched and, thanks to the sabacc tournament, safely left Coruscant in the company of the Errant Venture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the fact that Dorvan sat down to the table ten minutes late, he was successful in the tournament. As the Errant Venture traveled with the StealthXs to meet the Skywalkers on the moon Pydyr, the three-day tournament reached its final table. By the time of their arrival at Pydyr, Dorvan was the favorite to win the tournament and he won. The strike team also arrived in time to help rescue the Skywalkers from the Sith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
