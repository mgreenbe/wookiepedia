The 6-2Aug2 was known to be easy to repair and maintain. It was quite similar to the Tusken Cycler rifle although more modern and with a faster rate of fire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke Skywalker owned a 6-2Aug2 during his youth on Tatooine. His uncle started teaching him to use it when he was only seven years old, the same age Owen started. Luke often used womp rats as target practice; by the time he was seventeen, he could shoot them from the driver's seat of his landspeeder without stopping to aim. The rifle was destroyed during a fight with the Tusken Raider URoRRuR'R'R in the Jundland Wastes prior to the destruction of Alderaan in 0 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Marvel Star Wars Comics Luke's 6-2Aug2 was referred to as a \"laser rifle\" or \"energy-rifle\".
