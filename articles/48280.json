The fish had silver-scaled bodies with long thin lower jaws that extended far beyond their broader upper jaws below their nostrils and black eyes. The species possessed a pair of fins extending from just behind their gills and a tail fin. The fisherman of Coronet City on Corellia, and members of the sentient Lanai species on Ahch-To caught fingerlip garpons for food. In the year 34 ABY, the Lanai caretaker matron Alcida-Auka prepared a garpon with a fish scaling knife in the Jedi village where Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and the scavenger Rey were residing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A fingerlip garpon first appeared in the 2017 film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi.
