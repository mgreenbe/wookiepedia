The original version of the dish is served in a to-go cup that contains overnight oats, yogurt, and seasonal fruit, with different menus highlighting the inclusion of dragon fruit or popping pearls. When Galaxy's Edge opened at Disney's Hollywood Studios on August 29, 2019, the version served at Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo changed in several ways. It was served as a plated meal with fruit as a side salad instead of a topping on the overnight oats and yogurt, it came with a mango smoothie, it had a higher price, and it was renamed to Tuggs' Morning Oats. At Oga's Cantina and Ronto Roasters, however, it remained available in a to-go cup and without the smoothie, though both versions of the dish shared the same name. Within two months, the dishes were renamed again to Tuggs' Overnight Oats."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
