Ely refused to share the book as it contained his most prized recipes, for which he was murdered and the book stolen by BD-3000 luxury droids Carly and J'Nell, who believed that Ely's meals were potentially hazardous. After the droids had been exposed as Ely's murderers and destroyed, Ely's boss Strono Tuggs uploaded the book's contents to the Orto Culinary Academy so that the dead chef would be remembered and the recipes would be passed down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
