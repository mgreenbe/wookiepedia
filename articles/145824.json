He obtained financial backing from some friends, enough to buy OM813 (renamed Thrantin). Then, during the four decades after it, Warren planetscaped all of Thrantin, aiming to create a training camp.

Warren thus created Zero-G areas, an Ammonia Ocean and the Heavy Grav Mountainous Zones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since that moment, Thrantin became the planet-wide Galactic Outdoor Survival School, directed by Warren himself with a specialized staff.
