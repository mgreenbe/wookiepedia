The meeting was ostensibly arranged by Admiral Rae Sloane and attended by self-proclaimed Grand Moff Valco Pandion, General Jylia Shale, Imperial advisor and Dark Side adherent Yupe Tashu, and Imperial financier Arsin Crassus, and it operated under the temporary title of the Imperial Future Council. The purpose of the gathering was to collectively determine a path of action for restoring the crumbling Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The summit was bogged down by infighting between the delegates, particularly the rivalry between Admiral Sloane and Grand Moff Pandion. A group of insurgents under the New Republic starfighter pilot Norra Wexley learned about the conference and inspired an uprising in Myrra. New Republic Navy forces under Admiral Ackbar then intervened on Akiva, bringing the emergency summit to a close. Sloane managed to escape but Pandion and Crassus were killed during the escape attempt. General Shale and advisor Tashu were captured by New Republic forces. In truth, the summit had been staged by Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax with the objective of eliminating rivals to his succession over the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
