A trained soldier and pilot, the lieutenant was assigned to command the security detachment for MS-133, a scientific research team that had been formed to conduct an archaeological dig on the planet Aaris III. Aaris III had once hosted a native species that had died out several thousand years previously; the team was assigned to excavate the ruins of the civilization's cities and discover the cause behind the extinction. The lieutenant also doubled as the team's shuttle pilot, and ferried the team to Aaris III aboard a Curich-class shuttle, setting down near a large field of ruins. The team leader, Doctor Lancer Brunou, suspected that the lieutenant had been ordered by Sarne to land at a specific set of coordinates, but he could not prove his theory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For several months, the scientific and technical staff conducted their excavations. Eventually, members of the team discovered an artifact within a chamber in the ruins. After removing it from a floor vault, the expedition members began to experience heightened paranoia, feeling like they were being watched from the jungle despite their being no evidence of any other living beings on the planet. In reality, the artifact was an inanimate lifeform that sought to destroy those around it by inducing feelings of paranoia and suspicion that would eventually lead to homicidal behavior. The team's experiences were the result of the artifact's influence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With members of his team reporting that they saw \"spies\" in the jungle, the lieutenant took five of his men into the foliage to investigate. The small team never returned to the base camp, although those still at the camp heard blaster fire in the distance about an hour after they had left. That night, the base camp was attacked by the primitive descendants of the native Aaris wielding energy weapons, and a small battle occurred. When morning came, the bodies of the small unit that the lieutenant had led into the jungle were found just inside the foliage line. Over the course of the next few days, the artifact's influence and constant attacks by the Aaris reduced MS-133 to two survivors\u2014expedition leader Doctor Brunou and a research assistant, Solla Deremot. Both were eventually rescued from the planet by the New Republic CR90 corvette FarStar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lieutenant was a qualified ground force commander and pilot, with enough skill to pilot a Curich-class shuttle.
