The sap was highly prized for its use in certain mixtures. Trome sap was a main ingredient in the antidote to plant growth formula, and during the stranglethorn crisis, the two Ewoks, Wicket Wystri Warrick and Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka undertook a quest to obtain Trome sap from the Trome tree to stop a large out of control stranglethorn. However, it appeared that the sap could only be harvested by removing a branch of the Trome tree. This proved a problem as the Trome tree only possessed one branch when the Ewoks arrived at the tree's location. The removal of the last branch on the tree would cause the plant to die, and so the two Ewoks decided not to obtain the sap in order to save the tree which was also home to the Tromes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
