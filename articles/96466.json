They made an exception with Crying Dawn Singer, a famous artist, because the income from his concerts would help the other Shashay. When the Alliance to Restore the Republic asked the Nestmothers for permission to place a secret base on Crytal Nest, the Nestmothers initially refused, wanting to know if the Alliance could really defeat the Empire before making such a decision. Soon afterward, Crying Dawn Singer was kidnapped, and the Nestmothers contacted the Alliance to ask for help."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
