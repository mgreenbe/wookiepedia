When the scavenger Rey brought the Resistance droid BB-8 to Niima Outpost the following day after encountering the latter in the Jakku desert, she suggested that Horvins may be willing to give the droid a lift offworld. Rey considered Horvins to be a decent person, in contrast to the other thugs on Jakku, though she also warned the droid not to be put off by Horvin's countenance. BB-8, however, decided to stay with Rey until they were forced to flee the First Order with the defected Stormtrooper Finn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Horvins is mentioned in the adaptations of Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, released in 2015.
