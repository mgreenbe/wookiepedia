The Rebel Starfighter Corps. officer's uniform utilized shoulder rank plates on the left shoulder of a given uniform. It had two versions, one being used pre-Battle of Hoth, and one for after the Battle of Hoth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first version of shoulder plates had six rankings, which were identified by the amount of bumps on the plate as well as their placement. Flight Cadets had a blank silver plate, while flight officers had a large gold bump in the center. Likewise, the rank of lieutenant had two gold bumps going up to down. The rank of captain likewise had three gold bumps formed in an upside down triangular shape. The rank of commander had four gold bumps, with each being in the center and all corners except for the upper right corner. Finally, the rank of general and admiral shared the same plate, which was composed of five gold bumps forming an X-shape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The second version was redesigned to have a more patch-like appearance as well as colored borders, and having the gold bumps replaced with dark red bumps of varying sizes, and also had an additional three ranks to before. In particular, a new starter rank was implemented in the form of recruit, which had a silver border. Flight cadet, likewise, had a maroon border, while flight officer had a yellow border. Another new rank, Lieutenant Junior Grade, had a small bump slightly to the right side. Lieutenant largely adopted the same pattern as the previous version of flight officer, with Captain similarly adopting the same pattern as the prior version of Lieutenant. The new rank of Lieutenant Commander had a similar design for the prior version of captain, although the bottom bump is smaller than the two top bumps. The rank of Commander's design was redesigned to have a upward triangle pattern to its bumps. The ranks of General and Admiral retained the same pattern as before."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
