Though Celwis was economically valuable, the world was politically insignificant. While plotting to lead the Chiss into a civil war, Haplif of the Agbui resided on Celwis for a time in order to manipulate the Xodlak Councilor Xodlak'uvi'vil."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Haplif enticed Councillor Lakuviv with apparently abundant nyix jewelry. The Agbui successfully coaxed Councillor Lakuviv into staging a coup against Celwis's Patriel Lakooni, whom the renegade Councillor impersonated to declare a family emergency. Lakuviv thus summoned all eligible Xodlak-family officers and warriors from the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet to assemble at Celwis, forming the Task Force Xodlak from the remains of the historic Xodlak fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Local rancher Xodlak'phr'ooa \"Lakphro\" suspected foul play on Haplif's part, seeing the nyix jewelry Haplif had given officials as bribery. He confronted Haplif as the Agbui waited to leave Celwis with his cohorts. Haplif responded by trying to kill Lakphro, but Lakphro killed Haplif in self-defense. In spite of Haplif's death, his plan nearly came to fruition with the skirmish above Hoxim, where Xodlak, Pommrio, and Erighal forces all arrived to claim the Agbui mining world of Hoxim for their own families. However, thanks to the work of Lakphro, Thrawn, and Lakinda, a civil war was prevented."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Celwis's largest moon had a cliff wall concealing an abandoned Chiss frigate from the days when the Xodlak was a Ruling Family."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
