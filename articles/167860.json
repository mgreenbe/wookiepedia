She was a promising officer in the final part of the Great War, when Rycus Kilran took her under his wing. She was onboard Kilran's starship during the Sacking of Coruscant, and enjoyed bombarding civilian buildings. During the Cold War, she became the admiral in charge of the Imperial Forward Command. Ranken would earn the respect of Darth Krovos during her service to the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ranken became one of the few experienced officers to survive the Eternal Empire's conquest of the galaxy. Ranken desired to join the Outlander's Alliance but had no way to contact them. In her search, she came into contact with Balmorra Senator Tai Cordan and Malita Tal, an exiled Zakuulan and popular holo-dancer. Deciding to search for the Outlander together, the trio formed an alliance. Eventually, they were captured by Emperor Arcann's forces and were en route to Zakuul for interrogation as to the Outlander's whereabouts. However, the Alliance raided their transport ship and set them free."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: The Old Republic, Ranken is voiced by actress Anna Graves."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Gameplay alternatives"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ranken appears in Chapter XV: The GEMINI Deception of Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire.
