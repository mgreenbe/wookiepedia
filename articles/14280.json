Rebel Alliance forces took a computer core holding the Death Star II plans from the freighter and delivered it to a Bothan Spynet safehouse on the colony world Kothlis. The site was raided by bounty hunters, and although Rebel Commander Luke Skywalker was captured, the data core was smuggled out. The core was transferred to the CR90 corvette Razor. A battle started over the planet when the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Motivator arrived and captured the Razor. Rebel reinforcements arrived and destroyed the Star Destroyer, which plunged to the planet with the corvette in its hangar bay. A commando raid was launched to recover the data, and although surviving Imperial forces deployed to defend the wreckage, Crix Madine's commandos took the data before the reactor went critical."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel Alliance against the Galactic Empire was in a desperate struggle after the loss of its base in 3 ABY, and rumors began reaching Alliance High Command about the construction of a larger, more power Death Star superweapon. The Bothan Spynet received a tip from the Black Sun criminal organization that the Death Star II plans were being secretly transported on a freighter, the Suprosa. The Alliance had also successfully destroyed the Super Star Destroyer Vengeance during the Battle of Nocto although they suffered heavy casualties including several B-Wing starfighters. Commander Luke Skywalker, along with the smuggler Dash Rendar, traveled to Bothawui and met their contact Koth Melan in 3.5 ABY to train the Bothan's Blue Squadron to intercept the freighter. There was a vacancy, and Rebel pilot Ace Azzameen was assigned to the raid. The Rebels intercepted the freighter, which was heavily armed, and lost six ships in the raid. Skywalker disabled the freighter, and Rendar boarded and took the data core containing the plans.

After a Bothan technician was close to decoding the computer core, the safehouse's door exploded. The building was attacked by a team of bounty hunters looking for the bounty on Skywalker. As fire was traded in the storehouse, Melan fell to blaster fire while Skywalker used his lightsaber to defend himself. A Bothan grabbed the computer and ran off, and Luke was captured by the Barabel Skahtul.

Rogue Squadron, flying three B-wing starfighters, four T-65B X-wing starfighters, and three RZ-1 A-wing interceptors, escorted the medical frigate Redemption.

The Rebels were surprised to find a portion of the Star Destroyer's ground forces had survived the crash.

The Alliance later launched an attack on the under-construction battlestation.

The next appearance was in 1996 with the Shadows of the Empire multimedia project. A quote from that chapter of the novel includes a reference to THX-1138. There are two conflicting sources for the capture of the Razor. The battle as described above is the storyline as it appeared in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader in two consecutive missions: Razor Rendezvous and Vengeance on Kothlis. In the 1999 video game Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance the story goes a little different, though the outcome is the same. This article follows the Star Wars: Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader version, as it is the later source, and was pictured in the art book Star Wars Art: Visions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The surviving Bothan spies flee from Kothlis on Fey'lya's Pride, with the stolen Imperial computer to Kothlis II.

This article assumes the player took out the ion cannons to protect the Redemption. At the end of the mission, the player can deliver the coup-de-grace on the Motivator by performing a kamikaze run on the ship, the requirements of the mission stated the player can still get a Gold Medal if they only lose one life, and the Rebel Strike Official Nintendo Strategy Guide suggests that the player does so to finish the mission with a Gold Medal. This article assumes the player did not do so, as Antilles canonically survives, and respawns are a game mechanic. If the player destroys the Star Destroyer before the Razor goes into the hangar bay, it can be seen floating in space in the ending cutscene, although it canonically falls to the surface with the Motivator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the second mission, the player must protect the commandos. They can have casualties but not too many, although the mission will fail if the transport gets destroyed.
