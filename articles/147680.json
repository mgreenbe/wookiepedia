A major trade and industrial hub, the planet was orbited by numerous space stations, and spaceports littered the surface. A naturally volcanic planet with high levels of activity, Torize's atmosphere was hazardous to most beings, and a breath mask was required. The atmosphere was worsened by an industrial accident in 5 ABY that released toxic pollutants into the air. In 8 ABY, the sector capital, Kal'Shebbol, was liberated by New Republic forces, forcing the local Imperial warlord, Moff Kentor Sarne, into retreat. The planet subsequently faced an internal power struggle between Imperial loyalists intent on holding the planet, and New Republic sympathizers who wished to overthrow them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet Torize was located in the Torize system of the Outer Rim Territories' Kathol sector. Torize was situated on the Trition Trade Route between the Kal'Shebbol and Kolatill systems, with a spur connecting it to Oon Tien system. A major stopping point on the Trition Trade Route, the world was eighteen hours' travel from the sector capital Kal'Shebbol by Class One hyperdrive, a day and four hours travel from Kolatill, and Oon Tien was fourteen hours away. Supporting a population of 1.5 billion inhabitants, Torize was a major manufacturing planet ringed with space stations and with extensive starports on the surface. A naturally volcanic planet, the atmosphere was classed as Type II, with residents requiring a breath mask when outside.
