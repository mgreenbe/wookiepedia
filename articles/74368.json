Its application was somewhat controversial, given its system of government (an absolute monarchy, led by King Sha-Mar Ma-dred), and the facts that its inhabitants, the Kashirim, were a primitive race and could be somewhat suspicious. In fact, according to Obi-Wan Kenobi, Kashirim were known throughout the galaxy as thieves and pick-pockets, since stealing was an honored tradition and practiced art on their home planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
