The wastes were filled with toxic chemical dumps and polluted water ways, and no crops could be grown due to contaminated soil. There was no native animal life in the wastes. Domes were built around cities to ensure that the air was filtered for the residents, and anyone venturing into the wastes was screened and decontaminated upon their return."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
