When beginning his career as a bounty hunter, he coveted owning a Model AXM-50 \"Blast and Smash\". Once he acquired it, Darry enjoyed how it made crowds scatter when they saw him carrying it. On the entry for the SC-4 blaster pistol in the Datalog, Darry related a story about a bounty hunter they knew who was gifted one of the weapons for services rendered. After the hunter took down the wrong target with it, he was arrested by Imperial forces and forced to work for them. After retiring, Darry opened a cantina. Over the bar hung his \"Blast and Smash\" to discourage any firefights in his bar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
