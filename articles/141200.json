When she was six months old her Force-sensitivity was discovered by Jedi Masters Mace Windu and Yoda and tagged for training at the Coruscant Jedi Temple. However, before she could be transported to the academy, the Corulag Academy's Science Services' Chief Scientist Frexton kidnapped her, wishing to use her to scientifically study the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Discovering that the girl had been abducted, the Jedi High Council dispatched Jedi Vel Ardox, Noro Zak, Adi Gallia, Qui-Gon Jinn and Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi to rescue her. As the Jedi were stationed at the Order's chapter house on Rhinnal, they were able to arrive at Corulag quickly, but were soon foiled by Bartokk assassins. Master Jinn and his fellow team members held off the assassins while Grand Master Yoda himself rescued Panjarra from Chief Frexton and destroyed the Bartokk and their queen. With the girl safe, the Jedi were able to take Panjarra to the Coruscant Temple where she would begin her training."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
