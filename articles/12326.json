When Bane's Sith Apprentice wondered why Bane let the Muun live, he told her that the Muun was still of use and killing him prematurely would be a waste. The Muun may have also been a part of the InterGalactic Banking Clan. Darth Bane was not his only client, as he had stated that anonymity was the reason people went to him when Bane requested reassurance. He was able to secure payments through third-party means that were completely untraceable to their sources."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
