This scientist, realizing the Mandalorian clan under the leadership of Mandalore Ung Kusp was after him, offered to outfit Jaing and Durge, who were enemies of Kusp's clan, with armor incorporating advanced weaponry and reflex systems if they protected him. Shortly after the operations were complete, a Mandalorian strike team broke into the scientist's building and attacked Jaing, Durge, and the scientist's assistant Nubyl in the form of a defense cyborg.
