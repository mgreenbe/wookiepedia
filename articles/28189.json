From here, ships' pilots could direct the sublight maneuvers of their craft, execute landing and takeoff maneuvers, dock with other vessels, and, in the case of hyperdrive-equipped ships, set navigational courses. In starfighters, this was where the main weapons controls were located, along with a targeting computer, sensor scopes, and other such systems. The viewports on ships were usually made of transparisteel, and could be weaker points compared to rest of the ship's hull."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The term also applied to land and atmospheric vehicles, particularly on walkers and repulsorcraft.
