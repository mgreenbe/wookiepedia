Located in Zone 210, Eeookko sat in the center of an enormous crater, 120 kilometers across, that was made thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire. Eeookko made good use of this crater; the impact exposed veins of precious metals, as well as exotic ore introduced by the steroid itself. However, because this region was struck by meteorites more than other locations, the majority of Eeookko - including the city's critical facilities and living quarters - was located more than five kilometers underground. Only about five percent of the city was located on the surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
