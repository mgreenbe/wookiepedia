It was the main place of worship for the native Godoans and housed the Dancing Goddess and Minstrel statues. Fumiyo took Han Solo, Admiral Ackbar, Bey, Chewbacca and the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 to visit the temple when they were investigating the virus that was afflicting the Godoans. Upon closer inspection, C-3PO and R2-D2 discovered that the building was a \"techno-organic construct\", a machine of sorts. When the group were at the House, they found that the two statues were missing; thus causing the virus across the planet. Han and Luke retrieved the Minstrel while Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca retrieved the Dancing Goddess. When both of the statues were replaced in the House, the machine began to function again and the red fumes in the atmosphere that caused the virus were dissipated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
