It could be worn in a similar manner to a chronometer, and fired bursts of small, extremely sharp discs that were capable of shredding through armor and flesh like a flechette. The weapon's spread could be adjusted so that it fired all loaded discs in a single line or in a broad arc that could catch multiple targets. And entirely silent and easily concealable, the Mk-127 was often used for jobs which required silence and stealth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
