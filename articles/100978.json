An Imperial TIE/sa light bomber could carry up to six such mines in its main ordnance bay. Space mines could range in size, from large explosives that could devastate the area around it, to smaller mines that could be attached to asteriods. An Imperial minefield left over from the Galactic Civil War was used by the First Order at some time prior to the Battle of Starkiller Base. They could be detonated by a bolt from a Glie-44 blaster pistol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
