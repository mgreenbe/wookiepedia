Its coordinates were obtained by Jedi Master Even Piell in the Outer Rim Territories during the Clone Wars and were of strategic interest to both sides of the conflict. As the hyperspace route travelled into the hearts of both the Republic and Separatist homeworlds, the Nexus Route had the potential to tip the scale of the war in the favor of whichever side possessed its coordinates. While returning from the Outer Rim, Piell's Venator-class Star Destroyer was boarded by the Separatists. Piell erased the coordinates from the ship's computers and memorized one half of the coordinates, while his captain, Wilhuff Tarkin, memorized the other. The Jedi General and his crew were subsequently captured and imprisoned in the Citadel on the planet Lola Sayu, to be interrogated for the Nexus Route's coordinates. Though the Republic launched a mission to rescue Piell and his forces, the Jedi was killed before he could escape. However, he entursted his half of the data to Padawan Ahsoka Tano before he passed, demanding that she deliver the information to the Jedi Council. Tarkin, meanwhile, refused to give his half of the data to anyone other than Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, with whom Grand Master Yoda would confer to decide on the best course of action."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Outer Rim Sieges, Darth Sidious provided Separatist General Grievous with the coordinates for the Nexus Route, allowing his fleet to jump from the Outer Rim to the Republic capital of Coruscant in the Core Worlds and kidnap Chancellor Palpatine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
