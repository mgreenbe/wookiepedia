Around 4 ABY, the New Republic Vanguard Squadron pilots Keo Venzee and Feresk Tssat led a mission to recover an astromech droid from Laanen, an ice moon of the gas giant Navlaas. In response, the Imperial Logistics Division confiscated all supplies of Clouzon-36 from the nearby space stations of the Navlaas Triad, an action that the New Republic intelligence chief Ardo Barodai likened to the buzzing of a Killik nest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Killik species were mentioned in Star Wars canon in the short story \"The Light You Bring,\" a tie-in story to the 2020 video game Star Wars: Squadrons, though the Killiks had an extensive history in Star Wars Legends. The species were first mentioned in the 1995 book The Illustrated Star Wars Universe, in which a piece of Ralph McQuarrie concept art for the film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi depicted structures known as \"Killik mounds.\" This art went on to inspire the design of the Lurmen village in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode \"Jedi Crash\" as well as the landscape of the planet Lothal seen throughout Star Wars Rebels. The Killiks themselves had their first proper appearance in The Joiner King, the first book of the Star Wars: The Dark Nest Trilogy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
