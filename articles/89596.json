At that point, they were trying to recruit new members, including local Wookiees, Kaarl the Ithorian and some newcomers, but the people in Darkside felt no respect for the local Cell. Shortly thereafter, they were captured by a group of spies working for Nirama."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His implication in The Cell and subsequent capture were public knowledge less than one month later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
