It could also be used for meditation. The stance was used by members of the old Jedi Order. Users of this stance would hold the lightsaber horizontally, with the lightsaber hilt just below the chin. The meditative stance would find use in combination with more passive and defensive forms. One who fell deeply into this style could almost unconsciously defend from even the most flowing random attacks and feints."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
