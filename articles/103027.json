In 3643 BBY, Pallos met the new Havoc Squad Lieutenant who saved Castle Organa from an Imperial missile that was nearly launched by Gearbox. He discovered that Markus Thul had made a deal to provide information and save his family. Pallos didn't agree to this since he was angry that Markus attempted to murder Duke Charle. He demanded to know what Havoc's mission was, but the CO refused to say, saying it's classified. Pallos was insulted that an ally would not trust him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Havoc CO rescue Markus' wife and daughter from House Thul and thwarted Gearbox, Pallos was concerned and disappointed that the Lieutenant made a deal with Markus, as well as turn a prison cell into a hotel.
