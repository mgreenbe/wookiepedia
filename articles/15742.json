The matrix was split into two modules\u2014the obedience-rational module and the sensory-response module. The obedience-rational module governed the logical and social behavior of the droid while the sensory-response module controlled the droid's systems including audio-visual circuits, an olfactory-speech center, a gyro-balance unit, a spectrum analysis unit, and an extremity control system. The behavioral chips of several upper-end droid models were built using Vonium, a precious metal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
