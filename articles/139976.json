Tanno Vik moved from gang to gang where he learned to survive and fight, betraying his allies when the gang showed weakness or instability. To get off of the crime-infested moon Vik enlisted in the Galactic Republic Military and was bounced from posting to posting as his insubordination prevented him from taking on a placement with the Republic Special Forces Division."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Vik was accused of criminal activity during his service, promotion did not seem likely, especially after a conviction in a case which named Vik as the mastermind of an exploitative racket on the planet Talay. Dismissed from the military, Vik made a living working as a mercenary on the planet Balmorra, seeking to get into the Balmorran Arms Factory to steal its prototype weapons for profit. At the same time, Havoc Squad came to Balmorra to recruit him for a mission to take on an Imperial superweapon, codenamed Gauntlet. General Elin Garza formally granted Vik the rank of Specialist once he was recruited. Vik proved useful in taking down the Gauntlet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Eternal Empire's Conquest, Vik's CO went missing.
