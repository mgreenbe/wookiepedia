It had an adjustable grenade housing that allowed it to use a wide variety of munitions, including thermal detonators, though the system required recalibration for each new grenade type and could jam if different-sized grenades were stored in the magazine. Unlike comparable models such as the MobileMortar-3 , its range was shorter and it lacked an attached repulsorlift to ease the weight burden."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
