In 0 ABY, the Imperial Advisor Coh Veshiv visited Esseles on a fact-finding tour in his CR90 corvette, the Empire Forever. Following their arrival there, the CR90 stayed near jump point 180:45:115, which was in the sights and range of the Golan III's weapons. Shortly after Veshiv arrived at Esseles, the seemingly Imperial EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Far Orbit turned up as well and requested an orbit of the world parallel to the Empire Forever's orbit; however, the frigate was actually a disguised Alliance privateering vessel, whose crew intended to capture Veshiv. Upon convincing the Empire Forever's captain, Annance, that the Far Orbit would take up the role of Veshiv's transport for the rest of his journey, Captain Dhas Fenoep Vedij of the EF76 arranged for the advisor to be transferred to his ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vehsiv was taken to the Far Orbit in his personal shuttle, the Myrenia. Once the advisor and his shuttle were aboard the Nebulon-B, the Far Orbit jumped to lightspeed, and its privateer crew succeeded in capturing Veshiv. Because the frigate was in hyperspace, the Imperials in the shuttle could not contact the Empire Forever or Platform 8127/121 for assistance. Veshiv was then handed over to the Alliance for a cash reward."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Platform 8127/121 first appeared in the roleplaying game adventure The Capture of Coh Veshiv, from 1998's The Far Orbit Project by Timothy S. O'Brien. The Far Orbit Project was a supplement to West End Games's Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game and was a sequel of sorts to the previous publication, Pirates & Privateers, carrying on that book's theme by following the privateer vessel Far Orbit. If the privateers reveal themselves as they attempt to capture Veshiv when he is on the Far Orbit but before the frigate jumps to hyperspace, it is possible for the Myrenia's crew to alert the Empire Forever and Platform 8127/121 to what is happening. If this is the case, the Far Orbit must jump away while being fired upon by the pair."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
