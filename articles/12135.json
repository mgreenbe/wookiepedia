Tambor had pilfered the treasures from Confederate-conquered worlds, and Argente had taken them to the planet Ryloth to be concealed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tambor invaded the planet and placed its Twi'lek inhabitants under a harsh rule, and the Confederacy's subjugation of the world led the Twi'lek Cham Syndulla to form a group of his admirers for combat against the Confederacy. Syndulla and his fighters engaged the Confederate droid forces on the plains of Cazne. However, the resistance lost many lives, and the increasing number of Confederate battle droids forced the Twi'leks to go into hiding. Syndulla and his forces took refuge under several destroyed Confederate C-9979 landing craft and Multi-Troop Transports on the plains, although they continued to fight and ambush battle droid patrols."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While they took shelter, Syndulla's friend, the Twi'lek minstrel Gobi Glie, composed the \"Ballad of Cham Syndulla\" to further inspire the freedom fighters' efforts. The song included Syndulla's antagonistic views of Ryloth's Twi'lek senator, Orn Free Taa, whom Syndulla believed to be uncaring of the Twi'leks' fate on Ryloth while he remained on the galactic capital of Coruscant, headquarters of the Galactic Senate. The ballad also illustrated Syndulla's exploits and leadership of the resistance, as well as the insurgency's first engagement with the Confederate forces at Cazne. Syndulla was opposed to the song and believed that it inaccurately portrayed him as a legend rather than an ordinary soldier, while Glie himself believed that the potential of inspirational leaders was an advantage that the Twi'leks had over the Confederate droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Lyrics"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The \"Ballad of Cham Syndulla\" was structured in three sets of a refrain and two verses each.
