At some point prior to 10 BBY, the Besalisk Dexter Jettster learned of a ore hub being run by the Crimson Dawn criminal syndicate on Athus Klee and traveled in the world in order to investigate. He managed to capture several surveillance images of the hub and its workers, who were forced to undergo cybernetic enhancement to improve their efficiency."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After rescuing one of the workers, Jettster then contacted a friend on the planet Coruscant who sent someone to pick up the rescued worker and surveillance data from Jettster with the aim of taking the data before the Council of Labor Abuses. Jettster later wrote about the incident in the book that would eventually become known as the Smuggler's Guide and admitted that he did not expect his actions to lead to the shutting down of the Crimson Dawn, but hoped that it might at least result in someone putting a stop to the cybernetic work being done on the hub's workers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Council of Labor Abuses was first mentioned in the 2018 reference book Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide, which was written by Daniel Wallace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
