Born on Corellia, he was orphaned at an early age and taken by the pirate Garris Shrike to serve on his crew. He was treated cruelly, and served Shrike for many years before escaping while in his teens. Solo became a smuggler, and fell in love with Bria Tharen, though she left him due to her duties to the Rebel Alliance. Solo then entered the Imperial Academy at Carida, serving with distinction. He was kicked out, however, when he stopped an Imperial officer from beating a Wookiee named Chewbacca with a neuronic whip for resisting capture. In gratitude, the Wookiee swore a life debt to Solo, protecting him with his life and a bond of friendship formed between the two that was unbreakable. Solo became a smuggler once again, with Chewbacca at his side. Piloting the upgraded and customized the Millennium Falcon, which he won in a game of Sabacc against Lando Calrissian, his future ally, he became known as one of the best smugglers in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the run from Imperial officials, Solo became caught up with the Rebel Alliance, courtesy of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker, and Princess Leia Organa, whom he helped rescue from the Death Star. Solo helped Skywalker destroy the Death Star when it attacked the Rebel base at Yavin 4, where they had taken Organa. Solo became an unofficial member of the Rebel Alliance, and fell in love with Organa. He officially joined the Alliance in 4 ABY and was immediately commissioned as a general. He led the strike team that helped destroy the Second Death Star at the Battle of Endor, in which Emperor Palpatine was killed. A year later, the New Republic was founded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo married Organa in 8 ABY, and the two had three children: Jaina, Jacen, and Anakin. As the New Republic was threatened by many enemies in its first years of existence, Solo was always on the move, sometimes traveling with Skywalker, who was Organa's brother. Along with his wife and faithful Wookiee friend, Solo fought against Warlord Zsinj, Grand Admiral Thrawn, the reborn Emperor Palpatine, Admiral Daala and the Yevetha. In 25 ABY the New Republic was attacked by the Yuuzhan Vong. The war that followed lasted four years and was extremely bloody. Solo's closest friend Chewbacca and his son Anakin Solo both died during the war, deaths that haunted the ex-smuggler. The Vong were eventually defeated and the New Republic was reformed into the Galactic Alliance. In 40 ABY, his son Jacen turned to the dark side of the Force, and took control of the Galactic Alliance. Solo and his wife joined the rebel faction opposing Darth Caedus, and the two were prepared to kill him, as they no longer saw him as their son.

Shrike took Solo in as a member of his band of vagabonds, training and using him in his underhanded enterprises. First, Han was sent out as a beggar, using his young appearance to get handouts. When he was older, Han learned how to pickpocket by first practicing on a droid of Shrike's, and then being sent out into the streets. During this time, Solo was befriended by Dewlanna, a Wookiee who was serving as a cook aboard Trader's Luck, Shrike's ship. Dewlanna raised Solo as her own son, teaching him Shyriiwook and taking care of him when he became ill.

There, he tracked down his long lost aunt Tiion Solo and his cousin, Thrackan Sal-Solo. The reunion with his family went badly, however\u2014his aunt was a housebound madwoman while his cousin was a sadistic bully who eventually sold him out to Shrike.

Intermittently, he would attend school while going undercover as part of a \"respectable family\" while Shrike was running a complicated con. At one point, Solo briefly attended a school where Garm Bel Iblis gave a speech. Afterward, he asked the Senator two insightful questions, which impressed Bel Iblis.

When Solo was about to leave, Shrike and a few of his cohorts caught him as he was saying goodbye to Dewlanna.

A Togorian by the name of Muuurgh was assigned to be Solo's 'bodyguard', and, despite some initial tension due to the nature of the relationship, Solo and Muuurgh became fast friends. Solo also developed a relationship with one of the pilgrims who had come to Ylesia seeking religious sanctuary\u2014a Human woman by the name of Bria Tharen.

Also key in his flight was that Bria, who had also learned the truth about the Ylesian fraud, was to be married to Ganar Tos. In the process, Solo and Tharen stole a small cache of treasures from the High Priest Toroenza's treasure room and indirectly killed Zavval, the Hutt administrator of Ylesia.

At flight school, Solo's record was mixed: he earned excellent piloting marks, but his academic record was poor and he earned a number of demerits and conduct reports. His flight instructor, Alexsandr Badure, approved of him, filing a report praising Solo's abilities when he managed to land a malfunctioning U-33 orbital loadlifter by executing a number of difficult flight maneuvers, saving the lives of numerous cadets and Academy Dean Horace Wyrmyr. Student Advisor Lucinta Cal-Meg noted Solo's innate intelligence and that he worked hard to improve his academic performance. However, many also had deep reservations about Solo's judgement, conduct, and suitability for military service, as well as his friends at the Academy.

Nyklas ordered Han to skin the helpless Chewbacca, but Han refused and Nyklas swore to punish the Corellian. Shortly afterward, Han and Chewbacca were put to work on the construction of a new wing of the Imperial Hall of Heroes on Coruscant by Wookiee slaves. An enraged Chewbacca turned on Nyklas, who drew his blaster on the Wookiee.

They piloted many of their ships, including both Hutts' personal yachts. Solo also befriended Lando Calrissian, a gambler who saved him from the notorious bounty hunter Boba Fett, and Jarik \"Solo\", a street urchin who claimed to be a long-lost relative. Han knew that Jarik's claim was a lie, but he took the youth under his wing anyway. He also became romantically involved with the magician Xaverri and later fellow smuggler Salla Zend. During his time with Xaverri, Han became her stage assistant, and performed across the galaxies in her shows. He also served in the other part of her work\u2014schemes designed to hurt the Empire and Imperial officials.

After dealing with a traitor in the group, Solo and the others arrived at Stars' End. In order to gain entry, Han, Atuarre, Pakka, Bollux and Blue Max posed as a troupe of entertainers.

The trilogy built off of Daley's earlier books as well as several other works, consolidating many existing elements of the character's past while telling a story of its own. Many of these elements, particularly ones originating in Daley's works, would show up in author James Luceno's Agents of Chaos Duology, two novels written in 2000 as part of The New Jedi Order. The duology focused heavily on Solo, owing to Luceno's desire to pay homage to Daley, who was a good friend of his and who had passed away in 1996. Luceno hoped for the duology's first installment, Hero's Trial, to be a \"Han Solo, this is your life\" novel. Luceno also wrote The New Jedi Order's final chapter, The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force, and considered killing Solo in the book.

However, he saw Solo as a chess piece that could be moved around and even killed, as the character wasn't as important to Star Wars as its Force-using characters. Ford has called Solo a thin character, and one that wasn't interesting enough to be developed throughout several sequels, unlike Indiana Jones. As such, Ford thought that if Solo died in Return of the Jedi, it would introduce a needed complication for the character and give the story resonance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the words of George Lucas, Solo is \"a loner who realizes the importance of being part of a group and helping for the common good.\" James Luceno has identified Solo as one of his favorite characters to write, owing to the humanness of the character.

Many fans disapproved of the change, and an online petition that called for Lucas to re-release the original cut of the scene was signed by thousands.

The non-canon comic story \"The Emperor's Court\" sees Solo argue with Greedo's mother in court over who shot first. Arguments over the subject appear in the films Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and Clerks II, and a scene from the 2005 movie Serenity was inspired by the debate.
