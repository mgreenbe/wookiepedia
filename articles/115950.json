Several thousand people were killed as the result of an impact of debris from the freighter Legacy Run, amid the crippling of hyperspace travel across the Outer Rim due to the danger. The valiant efforts of the star system's security squads were the only reason casualties were not worse, and the event caused Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh to widen the hyperspace cordon set up to prevent further incidents yet again. Due to the tragedy, Senator Izzet Noor of Serenno did not protest Soh's decision, although the pressure to find a solution was mounting. Jedi Master Avar Kriss thought of the Emergence while visiting the heads of the San Tekka clan of hyperspace prospectors in search of answers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
