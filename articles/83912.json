For a time, he used a yellow lightsaber he found in a High Republic Jedi outpost. Although his mentors, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, had told him only a little of the way a Jedi had to use the Force to build a lightsaber, Skywalker reached out with his mind and found the right pieces\u2014some easily purchased, some much harder to acquire\u2014during the time that followed the Battle of Hoth and his duel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finally, during his return to his homeworld, Tatooine, to rescue his friend Han Solo from Jabba Desilijic Tiure, he was guided by the Force to Kenobi's hut.

After leaving Kenobi's hut, he knew he had at last collected everything he needed, and while his friends prepared for the upcoming rescue, Skywalker retreated into the solitude of a desert cave and puzzled over the pieces. He made use of the Force to put it all together and bring the crystal inside to life.

The weapon remained in his possession until Vader delivered it to his master, Emperor Palpatine, in the second Death Star's Throne Room.

Immediately feeling a sense of shame in considering killing his nephew even only for an instant, Skywalker hesitated long enough for Solo to wake up. Upon seeing his Master standing above him with his lightsaber raised, Solo used his own lightsaber to defend himself, bringing his hut down and trapping Skywalker under the rubble.
