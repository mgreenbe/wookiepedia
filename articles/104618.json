With the rank of Vice Admiral in the Imperial Navy, he spearheaded one of the Empire's most brutal biological weapons programs, which included testing \"ancient diseases\" on subjugated worlds. Following the Imperial defeat at Endor, he fled the Empire with a good deal of Imperial credits, eventually hiding out on Vorlag with slaver Slussen Canker. He was tracked down by a team of New Republic Imperial hunters led by pilot Norra Wexley sometime following the Rebellion on Akiva. Despite temporarily capturing them with the help of Jas Emari, her betrayal led to his capture, and he was placed in isolation on the Halo, their SS-54 assault ship. He died before the team reached Chandrila, poisoned with mycotoxin by bounty hunter Mercurial Swift, under the orders of Admiral Rae Sloane."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Perwin Gedde was a Vice Admiral who oversaw one of the Galactic Empire's biological weapons programs, which involved testing \"ancient diseases\" on captive worlds. Following the Battle of Endor, Gedde resigned his commission in the Imperial Navy and fled the Empire, absconding with a large sum of credits.

In 5 ABY, the New Republic starfighter pilot Norra Wexley and her team of hunters including the bounty hunter Jas Emari, the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus, and the New Republic Special Forces soldier Jom Barell tracked Gedde down to Slussen's palace. Prior to the mission, Jas infiltrated the palace through the hroth-beast feeding room in order to disable the crackling laser portcullis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In secret, Jas made a deal with both Gedde and Slussen to betray Norra and her team. Jas was heavily in debt and wanted to trick Gedde and Slussen into helping her pay off her debts. In return for alerting him to the New Republic hunters, Gedde paid Jas while Slussen paid her a 15% finder's fee. Unknown to Gedde and Slussen, Jas was still secretly loyal to Norra and was lulling them into complacency so that she could kidnap Gedde and bring him offworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Norra and her team were ambushed by Slussen's henchmen, Gedde appeared with a seemingly captive Jas.

Jas then publicly claimed that she had double-crossed Norra and her team in order to pay her debts.

While Norra and her team freed themselves using a key that Jas had attached to the neck of one of Slussen's hroth-beasts, Perwin returned to his quarters.

After reuniting with Norra and the rest of her team, the rebel operatives then fled aboard Jas's ship Halo, which was being piloted by Norra's teenage son Temmin Wexley.
