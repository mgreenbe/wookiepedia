Its vast oceans were interrupted by some 2 million volcanic islands, of which only a few in the southern hemisphere were active during the Galactic Civil War. There were two northern island-continents: Belshain and Madieri. Some of the planet's mountains were capped with snow and home to snow-wolves. Delgas Medical and Hydrospeare Corporation were headquartered on Kabaira. The capital city was Eponte Spaceport, which was known for Drayhar's Cantina. The local day consisted of 23 standard hours; the local year of 341 local days. Humans and Twi'leks inhabited the planet. There was a Rebel Alliance cell on the planet. This planet was also the birthplace of the Aquatic Terrain Armored Transport, which had been an extensive modification of the All Terrain Armored Transport executed by the Imperial Army garrison stationed on the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
