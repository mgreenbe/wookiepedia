The particular properties of the whipcord that made it seemingly self-propelling are unknown. The whipcord launcher was favored by bounty hunters, as it was easy to carry and use, it was species-nonspecific, unlike poisons, and it virtually always ensured a live capture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
