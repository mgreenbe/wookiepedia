Any trash not packaged for orbital export was mixed with oils to be processed by the garbage worms. They chewed it down to tiny pellets, removing any last bits of organics, plastic, or recoverable metal. They reduced millions of tons of these pellets into carbon dioxide, methane, and other organics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thousands, if not millions of worms occupied the garbage level of the city-planet.
