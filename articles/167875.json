Additionally, the end of their tail sported a large fin. Their feet had an adhesive grip, allowing them to traverse along vertical surfaces such as cavern walls. They were most commonly found in rocky and windy habitats, and preferred cold temperatures to warmer ones due to their climate sensitivity which caused them to become sluggish in hot areas. They deviated from other saurian species in their proclivity for living in packs. The zaur remained successful on Bogano due to its high level of adaptability."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY, while visiting Bogano, Cal Kestis witnessed a number of Zaur traversing a rock face, causing him to remember his training as a Padawan and allowing him to regain the ability to run on walls using the the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zaur first appeared in the 2019 video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, developed by Respawn Entertainment.
