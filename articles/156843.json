With Vader's starship having its communications jammed and thus not being able to transmit access codes to Coruscant's orbital defense, a missile platform launched several missiles, resulting in Vader crashing on Coruscant's surface. The incident was part of a conspiracy against Vader by several Imperial officers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
