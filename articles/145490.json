Commanded by Admiral Pevel Kronara, the cruiser was part of the small peacekeeping fleet maintained by the Republic Defense Coalition. When the Hetzal system was threatened by hyperspace anomalies and sent out a distress signal, the Third Horizon was sent by the Republic and the Jedi Order to save the star system, with the effort being led by Jedi Master Avar Kriss. When Kriss determined that a large container of liquid tibanna was heading towards an R-class star, which would destroy the system, she left the Third Horizon to rally the Jedi to move the container with the Force. After refugees were loaded into the ship's hangar, Admiral Kronara took off to leave the system in case the Jedi failed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
