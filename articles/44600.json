The Enrichment Dome was used to grow plants needed for the AgriCorps research. The interior of the facility was lit by an artificial sun, as Bandomeer's natural conditions could not sustain the plants that the AgriCorps needed to grow. AgriCorps staff were forbidden to be inside the dome at night. Offworld Mining Corporation hid an annex inside the wall of the dome and used it to store mining supplies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 44 BBY, failed Jedi Initiate Obi-Wan Kenobi was sent to the Enrichment Dome to learn about the AgriCorps' work by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. At the facility, Kenobi was met by the Arcona Si Treemba and the Meerian RonTha for a tour of the dome. During the tour, RonTha was called back to the administration building. While RonTha was gone, Kenobi and Treemba discovered the annex hidden in the wall of the dome. Jinn later came to the dome himself to arrange for transportation to the deepsea mines located on the Great Sea of Bandomeer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Enrichment Dome was featured in the young adult novel Jedi Apprentice: The Dark Rival, the second book in the Jedi Apprentice series.
