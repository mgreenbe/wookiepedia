Although unable to fly, the odupiendos were fast runners. Taking advantage of that particular skill, the Naboo people had created a sport called odupiendo racing, which involved several of those avian creatures running along a circular track. Such races were among the favorite betting sports in gambling places like the Outlander Club on Coruscant, and, for that reason, a stable of trained odupiendos was considered a highly valuable possession."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
