He despised his Mon Calamarian neighbors, but never made his hatred known. He joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic, climbing the ranks until he attained the rank of Lieutenant and a position of power as Commander Gial Ackbar's chief aide on the Shantipole Project in the Roche asteroid field. He operated as a spy for the Galactic Empire, and intended to use the use the Empire to make the Mon Calamari suffer for their perceived crimes against the Quarren. His Imperial contact was District Commander Bane Nothos, and Glek kept him advised of the progress of the new two-man B-wing starfighter being developed at Research Station Shantipole. As the prototypes for the B-wing neared completion, Glek sent a message to Nothos, giving him time to form a strike fleet before sending a final signal to attack and claim the prototypes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Glek learned from an engineer that the two B-wing prototypes were flight-capable, but the Quarren kept that information from Ackbar. Three days after sending the signal, Glek met an Alliance team that arrived at the base carrying a priority holodisc for Ackbar direct from Mon Mothma. Glek attempted to intercept the disc, but the team had orders to hand it directly to Ackbar himself. The team met with Ackbar, and the holodisc indicated that it was private for Ackbar and the Alliance team; Glek was dismissed from the room while the message from Mon Mothma was played, but chose instead to take the team's starship, the Out Runner, and flee to Nothos' command ship.
