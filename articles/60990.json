Hermits who had retired from society for somewhat religious reasons were also called anchorites. The powerful Force wielder known as the Father described himself and his two children as such. At the time of the Invasion of Naboo, Beggar's Canyon on the desert planet of Tatooine housed hermits who had been chased out of Mos Espa. The Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi later became a hermit on Tatooine so he could watch over Luke Skywalker from a distance as he grew up. Similarly, Grand Master Yoda spent the last years of his life alone on Dagobah, where he studied the secrets of immortality, and Luke Skywalker himself came to live alone on Ahch-To following the destruction of his new generation of Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
