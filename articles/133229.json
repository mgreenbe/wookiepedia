Written by Michael Moreci, the series is set during the Clone Wars, focusing on characters from the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. The first issue of the series was set to be published on April 1, 2020, but was pushed back due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first issue was eventually resolicited for June 3, 2020, though was later moved to May 20."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Set early in The Clone Wars TV series, Battle Tales centers on a group of clone troopers sharing stories about the war, similar to Cavan Scott's Star Wars Adventures: Tales from Vader's Castle. However, the stories told by the clones in Battle Tales are not like the more tall tale leaning stories seen in Tales from Vader's Castle. Moreci felt that the clones were not the type of characters to share tall tales. During the development of the comic, Moreci tried to have CC-5576-39 \"Gregor\" appear, but this was denied."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
