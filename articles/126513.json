The pirates were rumored to have raided a caravan from Annaj that was transporting treasures to be appraised and sold, as well as an Ayrou antiquities freighter, before the pirates crashed on the Forest Moon of Endor. The Skewer was equipped with a black market transponder. A fringer named Macy Yakaro knew the frequencies the pirates used for their transponder from his time as a spaceport controller on Annaj, and would charge those who wished to find the ship and its cargo a fee for his help in detecting the various frequencies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
