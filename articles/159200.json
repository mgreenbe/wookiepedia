As part of an elaborate ploy to kill Jacen Solo and destroy a large segment of the Alliance fleet, the Valorum was sent to a deep space rendezvous with Solo's flagship, the Anakin Solo, to discuss terms for a surrender. In truth, the operation was simply an effort to bring Jacen Solo into the open and kill him using the recently operational Centerpoint Station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alliance fleet, led by Colonel/Joint Chief-of-State Jacen Solo, and the Confederation fleet, led by the Valorum's Captain Hoclaw, engaged in a battle.
