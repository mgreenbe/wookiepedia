Averaging about two meters tall, Vuvrians were cordial, diplomatic, and inquisitive in nature. As a result of living on an almost idyllic homeworld\u2014Vurdon Ka was a windless, predatorless world of mosses and trees\u2014the species developed extremely sensitive skin, which declined in sensitivity as a Vuvrian aged."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vuvrians were natural problem solvers.

They had an oblong-shaped head on top of their long, thin necks. They had twelve eyes, varying in size and color, and two long, thin antennae on their heads. They stood about 2 meters tall, with females displaying slightly thinner builds and more oblong-shaped heads. Many other species found the Vuvrians' appearance almost comical."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a species, the Vuvrians evolved a highly fine sense of touch, a survival mechanism developed in response to the few predators that called Vurdon Ka home. A Vuvrian's skin was so sensitive that an individual could, for example, feel the minute shifts in air temperature when another being walked into a room. Such heightened sense was often mistaken by other species for latent telepathic ability or even Force-sensitivity. Indeed, a number of Vuvrians excelled as Jedi, with their innate abilities augmented by the power of the Force. As a Vuvrian aged, however, their skin became increasingly wrinkled and less sensitive\u2014a process that was accelerated in harsh offworld environments such as those found on Tatooine or Hoth. Vuvrians did not deal well with pain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Considered younglings until they reach eleven standard years old, Vuvrians reached adulthood at around eighteen.

A warm, sincere, friendly people, Vuvrians were very diplomatic, and were natural problem solvers. Although some species found the Vuvrians' physical appearance somewhat disturbing, it was difficult to resist their outgoing, charismatic personality, and their skill in oration and logical argument often meant others found it all but impossible not to see a Vuvrian's point of view. The species' genuine interest in learning about other cultures, and to help others solve problems, ingratiated many Vuvrians into the wider galaxy, and made it easy for a Vuvrian to notice the quirks in other species' cultures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Common Vuvrian names included Cimilak, Gwent, Kirrewa, Mylthea, Nilzilun, Scrin, Swiegel and Weelax."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As well as their own language, Vuvrians could speak Galactic Basic Standard and read and write aurebesh."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vuvrians never developed a great interest in offworld colonization, despite being long-standing members of galactic society. Rather than found colonies and enclaves outside their home system, Vuvrians were content to tour and observe the greater galaxy, although many found other worlds, and even space stations, paled in comparison to the paradise of Vurdon Ka. Curiously, it was noted that those Vuvrians who settled offworld tended to gravitate towards harsher climates, and xenobiologists were unable to explain why this was so."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vuvrians were more than happy to join the Galactic Republic.
