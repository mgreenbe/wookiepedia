In the city, he comes across Commandant Cumberlayne Aresko and Taskmaster Myles Grint who, along with a group of stormtroopers, are harassing a local merchant, Yoffar. The merchant expresses his disagreement with the Empire, saying that the Imperials ruined Lothal and the rest of the galaxy, for which Aresko charges him with treason. Ezra arrives and steals Aresko's communicator, which he uses to impersonate an Imperial officer and send Aresko and Grint towards a supposed emergency in the city's main square.

Bridger steals one of the speeders and, with it, a set of crates, and speeds away before Jarrus and Orrelios can stop him.

The fighter fires on him and destroys his speeder, leaving Bridger defenseless until the fighter is shot down by the Ghost, the rebels' ship. Jarrus offers Bridger a chance to escape as additional TIE fighters approach, and Bridger unknowingly uses the Force to leap into the hovering ship with his crate, much to the surprise of the former Jedi.

Orrelios eventually throws Bridger into a small, closet-sized room, but the boy enters an air vent and makes his way through the bowels of the ship. Syndulla, meanwhile, is impressed by what she's heard of the boy, and thinks he would be useful as part of the crew\u2014which Jarrus, at first, disagrees with.

Upon returning to Lothal, the Ghost lands near Lothal re-settlement camp 43, which the locals call \"Tarkintown,\" named for Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin after he forced the settlers off of their farms and into refugee status. The rebels bring the stolen crates into Tarkintown, where, for the first time, Bridger sees the suffering of the people there. Later, Jarrus and Syndulla speak to local Lothal crime lord Cikatro Vizago, for whom they stole the blasters in return for payment.

Jarrus and Syndulla spot him with the weapon, having been alerted to the break-in by the C1-series astromech droid Chopper, and Jarrus demands that Bridger hand over the lightsaber.

In the ship's common room, Jarrus explains that Vizago gave them the location of an Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser carrying Wookiee prisoners, most of whom fought as soldiers for the Galactic Republic before its fall. As Jarrus begins to explain his plan, Bridger falls into the common room, having once again snuck through the ventilation shaft.

The transport allows the Ghost to dock, and Jarrus and Wren enter with Orrelios, who pretends to be a \"rare hairless Wookiee.\" The Imperials do not believe them, so Orrelios knocks them out.

Once Kallus leaves and the stormtroopers take most of Bridger's gear, Bridger finds that he still has the holocron he stole from Jarrus.

Not believing that anyone will come to rescue him, however, Bridger tricks the stormtroopers guarding him to enter the cell, giving Bridger an opportunity to slip out and lock the troopers inside. He makes his way to a storage room, where he picks up his gear and an Imperial helmet, inside of which he can hear the communications aboard the Star Destroyer\u2014and learns that the Wookiee prisoners are being taken to the spice mines of Kessel.
