After arriving on Tazan, Orr and the rest of the team rendezvoused with the Alliance sympathizer Willer Clines in Clines' house, in the Desander Section of Tazan City. However, their conversation with Clines was secretly monitored by a group of Imperial stormtroopers and once the stormtroopers believed that Rebels had revealed all that they would about their mission, the stormtroopers entered Clines' lounge and attacked Orr and the rest of the Rebels. The agents escaped and eventually infiltrated the Data Processing Facility, where they extracted some Imperial TIE Fighter communications protocols and then blew up the structure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orr was a keen pilot, but unlike some of his colleagues, he held the opinion that an ordinary transport starship could perform just as well as an X-wing starfighter and would probably be more effective in combat. Orr joined the Alliance primarily because the Alliance imposed less discipline onto their troops than the Galactic Empire did, rather for political reasons. However, Orr was convinced that the Alliance was the best hope for the galaxy and while he wished to be a hero, he was satisfied that he was helping the Alliance to achieve its goals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
