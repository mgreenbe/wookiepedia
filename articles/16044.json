It provided a safe alternative to airspeeders and landspeeders. It was a slightly more upscale version of the standard slidewalk, which moved standing pedestrian traffic. A similar beltway existed on board Super Star Destroyers. It was an octagonal shaft that ran from stern to prow, and had a tracked hauler at the top, which allowed it to move heavy equipment. The shaft was estimated to be large enough to fit two T-65 X-wing starfighters side by side."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
