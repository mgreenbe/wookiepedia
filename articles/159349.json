It was the land-based equivalent of their Jedi Vectors, with a smooth and sleek aesthetic. Jedi outposts had at least one Vanguard in their standard kit, engineered to operate in the environments of the outposts' locations. The Vanguard could operate as a wheeled transport, as well as a repulsorlift speeder. As with the Vectors, the weapons systems of the Vanguard required a Jedi lightsaber to act as a key. Two Veil speeders were stored on racks at the rear of the vehicle. The Jedi outpost on the planet Elphrona was equipped with a Vanguard, which was torn in two by mole mines while the Jedi pursued Nihil marauders. Jedi Master Loden Greatstorm detached the laser cannon of the Vanguard, using it to shoot and destroy one of two Nihil Cloudships before the marauders could escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
