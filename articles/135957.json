While battling Imperial troops, pilot Jan Ors destroyed storage tank sixteen, prompting air-traffic controllers Zyak and Nomo to try and shut off the fuel valves for the rest of the tanks, in order to minimize the risk of them exploding from a fuel leakage. However, before they could act, Ors destroyed tanks fifteen, fourteen, and thirteen. Zyak deserted his post as a result, leaving the inexperienced Nomo in charge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
