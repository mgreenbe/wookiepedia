If the player brings Akaavi Spar, Shae Vizla, or Torian Cadera to meet Indigo, he will walk away in disgust, saying that he does not deal with Mandalorians or their kind. Otherwise, he will request the player to meet him in private, where he will demand the player kill Veek as a condition for his support.
