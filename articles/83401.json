The gases in the field limited sensors and blocked communications, making it difficult to navigate with low visibility. During the Clone Wars, automated defenses were set up within the asteroid field. After stealing the head of a New Republic protocol droid, a Resistance crew led by Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo escaped in a passenger starship, pursued through the field by Commander Poe Dameron. Holdo anonymously helped Dameron navigate the field, before informing him of the Resistance and their purpose."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
