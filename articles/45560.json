Their narrow hull was rectangular and had surprisingly spacious interior hold. In addition to passengers and their belongings, the shuttle could carry a pair of stowable emergency Undicur-class jumpspeeders. The flight deck was small and spherical, and was transparisteel on nearly all sides and allowed the pilot high-visibility. A tall vertical stabilizer was attached to the hull's dorsal side; two variable-pitch S-foils were mounted port and starboard. Its four engines were turned for long-range efficiency."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Republic use"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the Clone Wars began, the Eta-class shuttle was used primarily used by the Galactic Senate and the Republic Ambassadorial Corps for transporting VIPs on assignments.

It was used by a small Republic task force during the Battle of Saleucami. Anakin Skywalker and Adi Gallia used it to board General Grievous's Separatist destroyer flagship, dropping out of hyperspace in the middle of the opposing fleets in order to reach Grievous's ship unnoticed. The vessel survived the battle and was used to transport the rescued Jedi Master Eeth Koth and the team away from the enemy ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the war, it was used by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Quinlan Vos to hunt down Ziro the Hutt on Nal Hutta. Thereafter, one was again used by Kenobi, alongside Skywalker and his padawan, Ahsoka Tano, to investigate an ancient Jedi distress signal that had been mysteriously activated in the Chrelythiumn system. In so doing, the Jedi stumbled upon a mysterious structure that absorbed the ship, where they awoke on the planet Mortis, their ship still perfectly intact but mysteriously nonfunctional. There, the three would discover the presence of The Ones, who believed Skywalker to be the prophesied Chosen One, and the Jedi became enmeshed in a power struggle between the mystical anchorites, wherein Son wanted to use the shuttle to flee Mortis and thereby pursue his goals of galactic reformation. Ultimately, however, Skywalker and the others were able to prevent Son's attempts at leaving, and, having succeeded in that goal, rematerialized aboard their shuttle in the midst of space. Another Eta-class shuttle was utilized by Obi-Wan Kenobi again when he ventured to Raydonia to face Darth Maul. Darth Sidious used an Eta-class shuttle to travel to Mandalore at some point after Kenobi's confrontation with Darth Maul."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial rule"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Galactic Empire came to power, the Eta-class shuttle was slowly phased out.
