Lonus was part of the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Corrupter's vital resupply convoy. They were housed inside the Nebulon-B frigate Monitor, which was set to meet with the Corrupter in the Mev system. The shuttles contained hyperdrive technicians. The shuttles were then launched in an attempt to reach the Corrupter, but all of the shuttles were destroyed by Rebel starfighters. The loss of this technical team, combined with the loss of the convoy, left the Corrupter stranded and unable to pursue the fleeing Rebels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
