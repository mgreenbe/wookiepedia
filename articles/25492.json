During a raid on an Imperial heavy freighter, the squad was attacking guard posts. When the squads evacuated, Charmer reported his squad's departure with one minute to spare, to Namir's delight. Sometime later, the Sixty-First was fighting on Mardona III. During the fight, Charmer's squad was attack by an armored worm vehicle.
