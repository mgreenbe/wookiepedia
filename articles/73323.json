In that role, she ensured that the Republic's forward bases, like Waypoint Station Morne and Lytle Research Outpost, received the necessary supplies. However, Wek suspected her superior to be corrupt\u2014the human used his position to ensure good rations and benefits for himself, while the rest of the base was forced to survive on meager supplies. When one of the base's supply ships was set to leave for the nearest supply depot, Wek noticed that one of the ship's engines was damaged. Gardit, however, dismissed her concerns and allowed the ship to leave. The ship had barely lifted off when it crashed in a nearby swamp infested with bogstalkers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Gardit asked a Republic-allied individual to help recover the supplies from the downed craft, he sent them to Wek for the location of the crash.

Regardless, Wek planned to court-martial the commander, and thanked the individual for the help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She also asked them to investigate the fates of the supply convoy that the base had sent to Waypoint Station Morne a week ago. The convoy's crew had not reported anything, and Morne had not received the supplies.

She appears first as part of the Republic Taris mission \"Supplies and Demands,\" but can also give the bonus mission \"Prove Gardit's Corruption.\" Both missions, as they appear on the Republic version of the planet, are restricted to Republic players, but players do have alignment options. Players can gather the evidence for Wek and complete \"Prove Gardit's Corruption,\" and they can choose whether or not to give the recording to Wek. Giving her the recording and supporting her against Gardit results in light-side points, while siding with Gardit results in dark side points."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wek also starts the mission \"AWOL\" after the completion of \"Supplies and Demands,\" where she asks Republic players to search for the missing convoy.
