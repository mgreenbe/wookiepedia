The series was illustrated by Toshi Kudo and edited by David Land, and was specifically adapted from the screenplay of the movie by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas. It was, of course, based on the original story, though slight differences between the manga and the movie do occur."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the fact that it is an adaptation of the movie, it is treated in the same vein as the Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back novelization. It enjoys a level of canon only slightly lower than G-level canon, and takes precedence over other Expanded Universe works. However, as far as it is known the manga is placed at the very bottom of the ladder, underneath the various other adaptations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Issues"}]}
