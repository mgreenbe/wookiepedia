Multiple times she used large blast waves to throw groups of people off their feet, such as when she used her Electroripper staff against Crimson Dawn's Hylobon Enforcers. Enfys used a much smaller blast wave against Tobias Beckett when she fought him aboard a 20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport, sufficient to throw him backward several meters. Enfys used this same small-scale blast not moments later in an acrobatic pole vault onto her waiting Swoop, allowing her to jump the distance between the conveyex and her getaway vehicle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
