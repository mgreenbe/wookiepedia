The building was attacked by the rogue MI-series security droid, MI-726, who insulted the security guard and then set off an explosion which destroyed the entire factory. The guard survived and gave a statement on the attack which was then used in a bounty posting on 726. The bounty posting was created due to the destruction of the factory and several other Imperial targets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The factory was first mentioned in \"Bounties to Die For\", an article in the sixth issue of Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Gamer magazine series.
