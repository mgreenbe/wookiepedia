There existed dozens of different models."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Variants"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Empire"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Starfighters & bombers"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE series first saw manufacture by Sienar Fleet Systems during the Imperial Era. The first model was a prototype designed by Raith Sienar at the request of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and the Admiralty of the Imperial Navy. It sported the basic design of a ball-shaped cockpit mounted on pylons between two hexagonal solar panel wings, which powered twin ion engines. With the approval of Emperor Palpatine, the prototype lacked shields, but it also lacked the structural integrity to support atmospheric flight, so later designs were adapted to include stronger pylons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The upgraded models evolved into the TIE/ln space superiority starfighter, which retained the prototype's design and became a ubiquitous symbol of Imperial authority. Imperial pilots would make use of flight simulators and TIE training drones for training purposes. One TIE variant was the TIE/rb heavy starfighter, a bulked-up version of the TIE/ln with heavier armor as well as a secondary pod with heavy laser cannons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another early TIE variant was the TIE/gt, which eventually evolved into the more prominent TIE/sa bomber, with inward-bent wings and a second pod to carry ordnance. A heavy variant was the TIE/ca \"Punisher\" Starfighter, which contained quadruple the payload of the TIE bomber. The TIE/fc, TIE/sr, TIE/rc, and TIE scout were models used for reconnaissance missions. While it resembled a TIE/ln, it featured a hyperdrive to allow for long-range travel."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Shuttles & transports"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE/sh shuttle was derived from the TIE bomber and maintained its two-pod configuration, with the second pod built to carry passengers between capital ships. It was identified by its wings, which were distinctively bent outward. Another TIE shuttle variant was the TIE Boarding Craft, which more closely resembled the TIE bomber and was used for the transportation and boarding of up to two stormtrooper squads. Along with the TIE shuttle, it was one of the few TIE variants equipped with deflector shields."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE lander was a triple-hulled TIE variant that could transport an entire company of troops. A more unique model was the TIE/rp Reaper attack lander, a shuttle used to transport elite troops to points on a battlefield. It featured two pointed, forward-facing wings."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Advanced & experimental models"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE Advanced v1 was an advanced starfighter prototype equipped with a hyperdrive, shields, and curved folding wings with extra armor. It commonly saw use by members of the Inquisitorius. The TIE Advanced x1 was another advanced fighter with similar features, but was smaller and featured bent wings similar to the TIE bomber. One such model served as Darth Vader's personal starfighter. However, the TIE Advanced x1 was too expensive to mass-produce, so the TIE/IN interceptor was created as its successor. While it lacked a hyperdrive and shields, it featured extra laser cannons mounted on its pointed wingtips. The TIE Avenger was also inspired by the TIE Advanced."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grand Admiral Thrawn's fighter initiative on Lothal saw the development of the elite TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter, which was equipped with heavy cannons, shields, and a hyperdrive. Its characteristic three wings resembled those of the TIE Interceptor inverted, and the fighter proved a powerful combatant against rebel starfighters. An even more powerful variant called the TIE/D Defender Elite was developed, but the entire project was halted by the destruction of the Lothal City fuel depot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Other experimental TIE models included the TIE/ag \"Aggressor\" Starfighter, a medium attack craft with a rear-mounted turret, the TIE/ph \"Phantom\" Multi-Role Stealth Starfighter, which saw extremely limited use, the TIE/sk x1 experimental air superiority fighter, a fighter designed for optimal atmospheric flight and base defense, and the TIE crawler, a tank that resembled a TIE cockpit with tank treads replacing its wings."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Mining Guild"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mining Guild's affiliation with the Empire granted it access to certain Imperial resources, including TIE models, which the Guild modified into the TIE/mg Mining Guild starfighter."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Imperial remnants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial remnants still utilized TIE fighters following the destruction of the Empire. Moff Gideon's Imperial remnant made use of several Outland TIE fighters, which resembled a TIE/ln, but featured wings that folded outwards upon landing. Commodore Visler Korda's Imperial remnant also produced the Auto-fighter, a drone TIE fighter, during its time on Rekkana."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First Order"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The First Order Navy continued to use TIE fighters based on the Empire's designs. Manufactured by Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems, the new TIE models boasted significant upgrades from Imperial technology. The successor to the TIE/ln was the TIE/fo space superiority fighter, which, unlike most TIE models of the Empire, was equipped with basic shielding to protect the pilot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The First Order Special Forces used the TIE/sf space superiority fighter, another advanced model equipped with a hyperdrive and shields as well as a gunner-operated turret on the underside of the cockpit. The fighter's hull featured red markings to identify its affiliation with Special Forces. Also in use were the First Order's TIE/se Bombers, a transport called the TIE/es assault shuttle, and a stealth fighter known as the TIE/wi Interceptor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "More elite pilots such as Major Elrik Vonreg used the TIE/ba Baron Space Superiority Interceptor, an all-red TIE Interceptor. Inspired by the TIE Defender, First Order technicians sought to revive heavy weapons capabilities and developed the TIE/vn space superiority fighter, which was tested by only the most elite pilots, including Kylo Ren. Ren later utilized a TIE/wi modified interceptor during his time as Supreme Leader."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Sith Eternal"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith Eternal Final Order fleet used the TIE/dg starfighter, which was identifiable by its triangular wings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE line first appeared in the first Star Wars film, Episode IV A New Hope of the Original trilogy, in 1977.
