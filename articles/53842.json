The Vessel was assigned to transport four Jedi to the Starlight Beacon for its dedication. The Padawan Reath Silas was confused by Geode's nature, but Jedi Knight and Wayseeker Orla Jareni gave him a friendly greeting. Geode was motionless as he produced the coordinates to navigate the ship away from Coruscant. As the Vessel traveled through hyperspace, Silas was startled to see Geode in the mess hall and wondered how the Vintian had moved or been moved from the cockpit to that location. Geode was present as Silas and Hollow discussed the Jedi and celibacy. Later in the cockpit, Gyasi received explanations about the Jedi from Hollow and Geode, specifically their interpersonal relationships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the journey continued, Gyasi noticed that something was wrong with hyperspace traffic and the directions in which other ships were travelling. When Gyasi asked Geode if he had also noticed the readouts, Geode was ominously silent. A disaster struck when the transport freighter Legacy Run collided with a Nihil Stormship deliberately placed in its path by Marchion Ro, the Eye of the Nihil. The Vessel had to act quickly as they tried to avoid the debris spread across the hyperlanes, but the ship was struck despite their best efforts. When Gyasi realized it had come from a passenger craft, he said in his frustration he wished it had been \"any damn rock out there in space,\" then quickly told Geode that he meant no offense, and Geode silently indicated that none was taken."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Geode possessed the appearance of a tall, dark gray rock, with a flinty and flaky surface that sparkled slightly in the light of hyperspace.
