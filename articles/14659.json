Imperial forces intervened, resulting in the Ripoblus forces being driven off, and illegal Dimok weapons being discovered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ripoblus staged a raid on the Dimok Science Station Youst as a retaliatory strike in response to a recent Dimok raid on one of their weapons convoys. Near the station were a series of containers, which the Ripoblus planned to steal for their own benefit. Using a mix of Modified Corvettes and Assault Transports, they quickly penetrated the station's modest starfighter defense, and began firing on the station itself. Admiral Harkov, intending to stop the conflict from mushrooming into neighboring systems decided to intervene to stop either side from gaining the advantage by destroying enough forces to convince the Ripoblus to withdraw."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Prophets of the Dark Side were concerned about station's research and wanted to know what they were researching and ordered Maarek Stele to inspect the station and its containers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just as the Dimok defenses fell, the Victory-class Star Destroyer Protector entered the area, and launched 3 TIE Fighters and 3 TIE Bombers. Harkov ordered the Ripoblus forces to cease the attack, but the Ripoblus refused saying that Youst is a weapons lab. Maarek Stele, piloting one of the bombers, was initially tasked with making an example to the Ripoblus by destroying one of the Corvettes. However, as the battle progressed the Modified Frigate Dromon entered, just above the Protector, and began firing on it. Stele and his wingmates quickly retreated to defend the Protector. While the Destroyer's shields were considerably depleted, its turbolasers and bombers overwhelmed and destroyed the Dromon. Getting a reload from a Utility Tug, Stele and the rest of his bombers then targeted the assault force, destroying a Corvette and several Assault Transports, and the mounting losses compelled the Ripoblus to call off the attack and retreat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Acting on orders from the Prophets of the Dark Side, Stele scanned the Dimok containers and found illegal weaponry. Protector then deployed two DX-9 stormtrooper transports to capture and confiscate these weapons and place Science Station Youst under their supervision. The capture was not difficult as the platform's shields were severely weakened by the earlier Ripoblus assault. Several Dimok Delta-class JV-7 escort shuttles exited hyperspace to try to stop the Imperials from capturing the science station, but it was too late and they were destroyed by the Protector's TIEs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While this was going on a Shuttle called Toten carrying an officer departed from the Protector and jumped into Hyperspace to an unknown location."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle demonstrated that the Empire favored neither side and wanted to bring the Sepan system under Imperial rule. This lead to an unexpected outcome that Harkov would learn the hard way at Sepan 8 when he learned of a meeting between two leaders and would later intercept them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The conflict is described in the game Star Wars: TIE Fighter.
