In April of the same year, Seth Green and Matthew Senreich revealed that Lucasfilm felt it would have been counter-intuitive to spend three years introducing children to a comedic, deconstructionist view of characters whom they would then be expected to take seriously upon the release of Episode VII. Believing that Detours was timeless, the two were confident that their presentation of characters like Darth Vader as beleaguered middle-managers could wait until after the sequel trilogy's sincere presentation of Star Wars had concluded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In October 2015, voice actress Felicia Day mentioned during a live stream on her YouTube channel that as far she knew, the show had been cancelled.
