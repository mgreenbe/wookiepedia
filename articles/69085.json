After escaping from slavery, Fett tracked the Death Watch to Corellia, where he set his starfighter on a collision course with the Death Rattle's engine block, causing the ship to crash onto Corellia. Fett then escaped from its cockpit and breached the hull of the armored ship with his rockets, attempting to kill Vizsla and a good many of his followers onboard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
