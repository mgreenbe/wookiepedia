The Fleet was finally stopped in a confrontation with the Gravestone, a massive alien frigate that used its Omnicannon\u2014a powerful weapon able to spread damage from a single shot to multiple adjacent targets\u2014to drive back the fleet. The Gravestone ultimately proved victorious, forcing the fleet into a state of dormancy somewhere in the Unknown Regions. After the battle, the Gravestone's unknown builders scuttled the ship in the eastern Endless Swamp of the planet Zakuul, where it was lost to history for centuries, though the story of the battle would became famous."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
