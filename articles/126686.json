The captain of the ship, Panha, recognized the invaders and attempted to warn Artorias of the impending danger. The Yuuzhan Vong closed on the ship and launched a boarding party to take the crew of the Pythea as prisoners. Panha and her co-pilot Sarkkin managed to fight them off but realized that they were doomed. They decided to sacrifice themselves and strike a blow against the invaders. They managed to destroy a Yorik-vec assault cruiser and damage a Miid Ro'ik cruiser."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
