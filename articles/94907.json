Its properties made it capable of disrupting starship sensors, and in large doses it was fatal to even members of the Hutt species. During an attack on a Hutt starship in the Kazlin system, Nihil pirates used the gas as a weapon. Later, the Jedi Ceret found signs of nagnol poisoning on the corpse of a Hutt killed in the raid, although the Hutt had also been shot and stabbed repeatedly. When the Hutt's body was later autopsied on the Starlight Beacon, it was discovered that it had not died due to either nagnol poisoning or the injuries inflicted on it by the Nihil, but due to an infection by a Drengir root system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
