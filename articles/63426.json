Unlike most other blaster carbines, the hunting blaster carbine was incapable of making autofire attacks. They came equipped with a retractable stock. This weapon had a close-range stun setting as well, meaning the wielder could switch the weapon to fire stun shots instead of lethal fire, however the close-range stun setting was limited to a range of only 9 meters. A double-barreled blaster carbine required a power pack to operate; after 50 shots, the power pack needed to be replaced. The hunting blaster carbine cost 1,000 credits to purchase, but its ownership and use was regulated by local authorities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wookiee bounty hunter Chak carried a hunting blaster carbine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
