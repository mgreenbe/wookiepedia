During the reign of the Galactic Empire, Jedha was occupied by Imperial forces in order to mine kyber crystals for use in the Death Star's superlaser. Citizens began to die in great numbers in the mines and during attacks from insurgent groups attempting to drive out the Empire. These deaths lead to a large number of orphans within Jedha City. Gimm persuaded her younger sister, Kaya Gimm, to turn her home and droid repair shop into an orphanage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gimm became friends with Chirrut \u00cemwe and Baze Malbus, who shared in her religion as Guardians of the Whills. \u00cemwe and Malbus helped the Gimm sisters maintain the orphanage by stealing supplies from the Empire. The Empire retaliated, destroying Kaya's home and forcing the Gimm sisters and their charges to flee. Malbus found an abandoned home for the two sisters to move into along with their orphans. A few months later, it soon became clear that Jedha was no longer safe for the orphans and Gimm sisters. With the help of Saw Gerrera and his Partisans, \u00cemwe and Malbus were able to steal a Sentinel-class landing craft in order to evacuate the Gimm sisters and the orphans. However, due to her poor health, Killi decided to remain on Jedha. Kaya and the orphans departed, hoping to find a safer world. Killi remained in Jedha City, and was present shortly before its destruction by the Death Star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Killi Gimm was first shown in the reel of promotional footage released for the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story at Celebration Europe on July 15, 2016.
