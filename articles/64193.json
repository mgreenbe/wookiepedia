The InterGalactic Banking Clan maintained an army of IG lancer droids. One model of IG was the IG-88 assassin droid, a set of five identical assassin droids manufactured by Holowan Laboratories during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. Only moments after their activation, the IG-88s slaughtered their constructors and escaped their laboratories to roam the galaxy.
