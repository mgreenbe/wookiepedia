Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker caught up to Dane and took over the chase.

When Kenobi and Skywalker pursued Kash, the Jedi paused to bide their time when they beheld the supremacy of the battle droids that Dooku had brought with him. When the Sith Lord unleashed his droids against both the Jedi and members of the Station 88 Spaceport planetary alliance that had convened at the villa to discuss allegiances, Web, as he took aim at Kash again, was dispatched by Kenobi, who Forcefully hit his chest with both feet, causing the bounty hunter to fly back against a stone wall, where he was impaled by a piece of protruding stone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
