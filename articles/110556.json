In 3964 BBY, while each of their students went through their trials on Taris' Rogue moon, a place where the Force flowed freely, the Covenant meditated together to see the future that lay before them. Tey envisioned herself on Taris while Mandalorians and Sith invaded and then herself struck down from behind by an individual wielding a lightsaber. Each other member had premonitions of similar events, all committed by a being in a red space suit: the same suits that their Padawans were using during their trials. Terrified by these visions, Tey suggested that they kill the Padawans immediately.

However, the students recognized something was amiss as the Covenant agreed to Knight the inept student Zayne Carrick. The group attempted to cover their tracks and hide their true intentions, claiming that Carrick had a special connection to the Force that would arise in time.

When brought before them, Carrick revealed everything that he had discovered, including their visions. Draay retold the story of what had happened at the Knighting ceremony, and as he was about to kill him, the power in the Tower ceased and an explosion was heard. At first, Tey speculated that a bomb had gone off, but in reality, the Tower had been hit with blaster fire. Suddenly, a red-suited individual wielding a lightsaber crashed through the glass ceiling. While the Covenant believed that this was the Sith Lord that they had seen, this individual was actually the Arkanian girl, Jarael. While Tey and the others rushed for their sabers, Carrick hurled their weapons from the tower.

While collecting the younger Carrick on Phaeda would arouse too much attention, it was arranged for Arvan Carrick to be transferred to the world of Telerath. Tey hired bounty hunters to watch Carrick's father and see if he made contact with his son. These bounty hunters, however, were not of the caliber desired.

Tey's and the Covenant's solution would be to meet up with the Brothers in orbit around Telerath and finally deal with Carrick's father once and for all.

In the nightmare, Tey was a young Togruta on Taris during a Mandalorian and Sith invasion. She entered the Jedi Temple and apologized to the Masters for her tardiness. Inside, what she found were not Masters but rather the students she and the others had murdered, standing over the bodies clad in the red environmental suit she had foreseen. While the young Togruta claimed that they had abandoned the tower, Zayne Carrick and the dead Padawans claimed that they never left it. Carrick reminded her of his vision, in which the one who confesses of the murders lives.

Prior to leaving Taris, Tey and the other Masters had removed the lightsaber crystals from the Padawans' lightsabers and had them sent to their families as remembrance. Tey had been the one to give Jelavan the crystal that she held dearly around her neck, the crystal Jelavan still held onto when Tey gave her a mission.

The Hidden Beks, with Carrick in tow, came to the Resistance headquarters to ally themselves with them. Almost instantly, Jelavan emerged from the crowd that had gathered to see the visitors. While Carrick was delighted to see Jelavan, she pulled out a blaster and shot Carrick. Tey herself emerged from the crowd as well and drew her lightsaber.

Tey ordered Jelavan to finish Carrick off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Carrick had been accompanied by not only the Hidden Beks but Marn Hierogryph and Del Moomo, one of the bounty hunters Tey had hired on Telerath. Moomo wanted the bounty for his own, and Tey, still angry at him for his failure, became enraged and attacked him, with the ensuing scuffle distracting Shel long enough for Gryph to disarm her. Before she was able to harm to the Ithorian, Gadon Thek and his Hidden Beks gang members raised their weapons and ordered her to back off. The Resistance forces did the same towards Thek. Senator Goravvus emerged and asked Tey to stand down. She protested under the grounds that both Carrick and the Hidden Beks were criminals. Thek made Goravvus an offer of help when he revealed Constable Sowrs's children, Nahk and Tallie. Thek informed the senator that Carrick had found them. Tey continued to protest the acceptance of Carrick into the resistance, believing him to be a Sith.

Before Goravvus and Thalien could discuss the matters of the secret dealings they had in the past, Goravvus was seized by Del Moomo, attempting to claim the bounty Thalien had actually placed on Goravvus. Tey sprung into action and attacked Moomo again. The senator was flung into Tey, and Moomo took to attacking her directly. Tey and Moomo ceased their fighting as a bomb, placed inside the communicator, was about to explode. However, the communicator had been damaged when Jelavan shot Carrick and failed to detonate. Tey confessed to the senator that she knew nothing about the weapon upon examining it. Moomo on the other hand identified it as a MM-40 Thermal Charge and the blaster shot had overloaded the connection. Goravvus ended the communication and the rest of their dealings with Thalien there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Tey overheard Carrick, Jelavan and Hierogryph arguing over the Padawan Massacre.

Zayne shot back that he knew about her nightmares, which he attributed to a guilty conscience. Becoming frustrated at both of them, Jelavan stormed out, wishing she never met any of them. Goravvus, Gadon, and Sowrs reported to Tey Cassus Fett's usage of the Jedi Tower as his command center.

Goravvus requested for Tey to show them the way, but she still refused to disobey the Jedi. Carrick and Jelavan volunteered for the job instead.

She entered the tower as Jelavan opened up the grate from inside a storage room. She knew that Jelavan had the chance to eliminate Carrick but did not take it. Tey rushed off to find Carrick and finish her mission. She managed to find him in the Council chambers and confront him. Carrick became aware of Tey's insanity as she lunged at him to destroy the one who would bring the Sith. While his skills with a lightsaber had improved since the chase had begun, he was still unable to match that of Tey's fierce and wild combat moves. Utilizing a jetpack, he attempted to avoid Tey, though she still managed to disarm him of his lightsaber, forcing him to use a blaster pistol. Frantic, Carrick begged Tey to remember her teachings. She became enraged further by this and threw Carrick into the glass ceiling, sending glass shards into her face, and disabling his jetpack. Carrick was disarmed and at her mercy. Picking up Carrick's lost saber, she informed him of the Prophecy of the Five, believing that he and his deceased friends were the ones who would see the Jedi Order and the Republic fall between them; Zayne retorted it may have referred to \"traitorous, evil Jedi Masters,\" but Tey dismissed the thought, right before she raised her sabers.

Raana initially refused, assuming that Zayne wanted her to confess. Zayne said that he didn't care, and that enough people had died in the tower. This act of compassion caused Raana to finally realize that she had been wrong about him, and prompted her to attempt to escape. However, her hand had become stuck. She attempted to use her saber to cut herself free, though Hierogryph mistook her for attacking Carrick and blew the charges set in the Tower. Tey, realizing her coming demise, told Carrick to tell Krynda Draay that she was sorry. The tower blew as Carrick and Jelavan escaped, destroying Raana Tey.

Despite this startling information, Vrook felt that Krynda Draay was too important of a figure and accusing her would tear the Order apart. However, Krynda died soon afterward during Haazen's insurrection of the Covenant when she was taken out of stasis, which she had been in ever since the Rogue Moon prophecy. Prior to her death, Xamar met his death by orbital bombardment and Q'Anilia had committed suicide when she believed Krynda was dead.

She felt a tremendous amount of guilt in murdering her Padawan, Kamlin, and in framing Zayne Carrick for it. This was in no small part due to her nightmares that grew worse since the Padawan Massacre. As the nightmares continued, she even began to fear Carrick exacting his revenge on her, which only pushed Tey further into desiring his demise, as well as that of his companion, Jarael. Her loss of sanity due to the Massacre ultimately resulted in her death as she viciously attacked Carrick during his return in the Jedi Tower. Believing she was going to end the Sith threat, she was careless and was unaware that Shel Jelavan had entered and stabbed her in the back with her brother's lightsaber. Even though this did not kill her immediately, it did wound her mortally.
