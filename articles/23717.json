Vizsla and his troops set up a camp near a local town and forced the peaceful Ming Po into servitude. It was here that Lux Bonteri arranged to meet with Vizsla and deliver the location of Count Dooku, upon whom both Bonteri and Vizsla wanted vengeance. Though things quickly turned sour when the Pre Vizsla was warned to leave the planet by the Ming Po for abducting one of their own and continued harassments of the people. Much to the Chieftain's surprise, Pre Vizsla agreed to leave camp and return his people back as soon as the next day."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Death Watch returned to Ming Po town, Pre Vizsla brought along Lux Bonteri and Ahsoka Tano to watch as Pre Vizsla killed the Chieftain's grand daughter. Death Watch would later burn the village until Ahsoka Tano revealed herself to be a Jedi that would ultimately result in her capture. Though she would escape along with Lux Bonteri on the starship Phoenix (GX1 Short Hauler) with the help of R2-D2 and his small army of reassembled Death Watch shooting practice droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after the events of Lux Bonteri's escape, the Galactic Republic shot down a Munificent-class star frigate. A Jedi Knight and the 104th Battalion under the command of CC-3636 arrived to finish off the remaining battle-droids near the crash site of the frigate. The Republic would later encounter the Death Watch and lead a campaign against them as they fought to destroy many of Death Watch's camps on Carlac. Ultimately ending in the death of Sergeant Kellov, Kherr Dawar, Mord Jayran and Kro Lann and most importantly, Pre Vizsla and the remaining Death Watch to abandon the planet, eventually settling on Zanbar and establishing a camp there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
