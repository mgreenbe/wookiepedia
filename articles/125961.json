These were covered with the estates of wealthy families who had rich naval backgrounds, in the Azure Imperium, the Old Republic, and the New Order. As with the capital, most vehicles were banned in the Sirpar Hills, so residents would switch out their vehicles for Keffis at the nearby Sirpar Station. The Holt family made their home in the hills."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
