One of those pouches of Alderaanian survivors was located in an enclave on Sullust. However, a spy in the princess's company revealed their presence on Sullust to the Empire, putting the Alderaanians' life in grave danger. Ultimately, the princess and her people managed to evacuate the enclave with the help of Nien Nunb, a Sullustan smuggler.

It was worn by Princess Leia, played by actress Carrie Fisher, during the closing scene of the film. The name of the necklace was never spoken on-screen, but was referred to as \"chalcedony waves\" on page 219 of the Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope novel. That name was later confirmed to be canon in the fourth issue of the Marvel comic book series Star Wars: Princess Leia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The piece of jewelry that was used in A New Hope was designed by Bj\u00f6rn Weckstr\u00f6m of Lapponia Jewelry, one of the most famous jewelry designers in Finland. In spring 1976, the secretary of Star Wars creator George Lucas contacted Weckstr\u00f6m, requesting a piece of silver jewelry to feature in a movie the name of which could not be revealed at that point. That piece of jewelry was to appear in a scene that was due to be filmed within six weeks. The project seemed interesting to Weckstr\u00f6m, who accepted the assignment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Weckstr\u00f6m had started to design a new piece, he was told there had been a change in the filming sequence of the scenes, and the jewelry would be needed in a week's time. Since Weckstr\u00f6m was unable to finish his design work on such short notice, it was decided that Princess Leia's jewels would be bought from Lapponia's products that were available in London, where Lucas' movie was being filmed. Consequently, Lucas' agents acquired a necklace and a bracelet from a Lapponia retailer on Bond Street, London. The chosen pieces were the \"Planetoid Valleys\" necklace and \"Darina's Bracelet,\" which were part of the \"Space Silver\" collection Weckstr\u00f6m had designed in 1969. Those silver pieces were inspired by the Finnish winter landscape with its frozen lake surfaces. The designer was later notified that Lucas thought his jewelry was fantastic, but still did not know in which movie it would be displayed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, A New Hope was released in May 1977, although it only premiered in Finland on December 16. Having seen one of the first screenings of the movie in Finland, a friend of Weckstr\u00f6m's recognized his jewelry in the final scene of the movie. Shortly thereafter, Weckstr\u00f6m himself went to see the movie, and was impressed to see his own work on the big screen. Thanks to its appearance at the end of A New Hope, \"Planetoid Valleys\" became the all-time most well-known piece in the Lapponia Jewelry collection. As of 2015, both \"Planetoid Valleys\" and \"Darina's Bracelet\" are still part of Lapponia's catalogue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
