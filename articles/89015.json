Having evolved on a world with a noxious smell, they had adapted to their environment: the Mephitisians had no noses, so they lacked the ability to smell, and their black eyes were small and covered with clear lids. They had large upper lips that they flapped over their mouths to limit their exposure to the air. The Mephitisians were dexterous beings. Their heads had two horn-like projections, which were sensitive to vibrations and air movements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mephitisians evolved on the planet Mephitis, located in the south-western portion of the Colonies. The atmosphere on their homeworld was noxious and offensive to all species that visited the planet. The Mephitisians were part of the galactic community from the time of the Galactic Civil War. The Mephitisian Mosh Pelkan was a Turf Boss on the planet Questal. Turf Bosses were criminal leaders who had agreements with the official District Commanders to keep down insurgency in exchange for the Commanders turning a blind eye to their activities. Originally traveling to the planet with the intention of becoming an ardanium prospector, Pelkan soon realized that importing illegal goods earned a greater profit. He established a significant power base and was a popular figure in Gralleenya, Questal's capital city. When Imperial Moff Bandor was given jurisdiction over Questal, he gave Pelkan control over a district of Gralleenya."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pelkan hosted a costume gala at his mansion to celebrate Bandor's birthday. The party was infiltrated by agents of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, who were searching for the missing agent Tiree.

At Pelkan's party, entertainment was offered in the form of gladiatorial combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their best efforts, the Rebel agents gained no useful information from Pelkan, but were instead forced to fight in the arena against his champion, Cromag.
