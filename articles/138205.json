Around 94 BBY, T'un was tasked with maintaining all holographic data files on Jedi Initiates within the Order. A member of the Jedi High Council, the records were only accessible to those who received special permission from either T'un or another Council member. By 44 BBY, T'un had reached an age of several hundred years and become a wise being of great knowledge. During that year, several of the files he maintained were stolen, although Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn was able to recover them. T'un received aid from two student volunteers each year to help him with the files in his office, although they were not allowed to be within the filing office without the Jedi Master."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "T'un was first mentioned in Jedi Apprentice: The Uncertain Path, the sixth novel of the Jedi Apprentice series.
