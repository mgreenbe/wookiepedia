The cult gathered the Living Force from several Dagoyan Masters and kidnapped Queen Julia and brought her to a ziggurat on Zardossa Stix to steal her life force as well. Talzin arrived on the planet as the ritual began, but she was confronted by Jedi Master Mace Windu and Representative Jar Jar Binks. Talzin summoned her sword from spirit ichor and battled with the Jedi, but Jar Jar managed to free Julia and shatter the sphere containing the stolen force, causing a massive explosion. Talzin disappeared after the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
