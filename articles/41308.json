Desiring justice for Tarnis's death but disagreeing with his Master's dishonorable order to destroy the deactivation codes for the Shock Drum superweapon and therefore prevent the Jedi from stopping the active weapon from destroying Tatooine, Praven challenged the Knight to a duel for the codes on the Esus Mesa. The duel ended with Praven's defeat at the hands of the Knight, but the Jedi refused to kill the honorable warrior and convinced him to abandon the ways of the Sith and become a Jedi, and the Knight then departed to the Dune Sea region in order to deactivate the Shock Drum weapon while Praven surrendered himself to the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The duel"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi was attempting to deactivate the stolen Republic superweapon known as the Shock Drum, and Praven had offered to give up the deactivation codes if the Knight could defeat him.

The Knight attempted to convince the Sith to turn away from the dark side, appealing to the Sith's strong values of honor and courage, but Praven believed that the Jedi and the Sith held no common ground. Forced to duel, the Knight and their Padawan were able to defeat Praven, but the Jedi refused to strike down the wounded Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi appealed to Praven again, asking him to reject the dark side and embrace the light. The Knight swore to him that he would be accepted into the ranks of the Jedi Order, and that his past did not matter\u2014only his choices now. Convinced, Praven accepted the Knight's offer, and gave them the deactivation codes as per their agreement. He told the pair that he would contact the Republic and the Jedi, as he was too injured to aid the Knight.
