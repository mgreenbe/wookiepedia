It was able to block lightsaber attacks. In 14 BBY, several Purge Troopers wielding electrohammers were stationed on Kashyyyk and Nur, where Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis fought and killed them. The electrohammer had two abilities, one being to charge up the hammer's power and slam it onto the ground. This created a shockwave in a short radius, knocking anyone in range off their feet. The second ability would be to charge up the hammer's power, and slam it onto the floor at an angle, which would create a shockwave ripple towards the opponent of the hammer's user."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
