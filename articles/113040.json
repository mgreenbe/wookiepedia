Remaining behind for support fire, the three Star Destroyers deployed the V-19 Torrent starfighter Blue Squadron, led by Tano, against Neimoidian Captain Mar Tuuk's Lucrehulk-class Battleship and its two accompanying Munificent-class star frigates. The squadron managed to cut a path through a swarm of enemy vulture droid starfighters directly to the Separatist command ship, but as the V-19s approached the Lucrehulk, Tuuk summoned four additional Munificents from hyperspace to reinforce his fleet.

Due to Tano's disobedience, the Redeemer and the fleet continued to suffer heavy damage from Vulture droid suicide attacks. After losing most of Blue Squadron to enemy fighters, Tano returned to the fleet, allowing for the Defender and the Resolute to make their retreat to hyperspace.
