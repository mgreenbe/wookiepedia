In return, they asked that the senator cast his vote for an amendment in an upcoming military appropriations bill, which would see the New Republic Military purchase YVH 1 battle droids from Tendrando Arms.

Thinking of his future, Boras realized that with his homeworld under Yuuzhan Vong occupation, and without a homeworld to vote for him, his chances of being reelected were slim. However, Boras did not anticipate that Karrde and Calrissian would bribe a large number of other senators and flood the market with their own relief supplies, which kept the price of commodities low.
