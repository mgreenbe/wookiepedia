As the two lay in the collapsing wreckage, Skywalker's droid, R2-D2, arrived in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, informing Plo Koon and Padawan Ahsoka Tano of the two Jedi's current state.

Comet asked if it was a droid, but Tano replied that is was probably just an animal. Telling the men to remain alert, Comet and his fellow troopers made their final approach to the wall and took cover at the tree line. As Skywalker and Koon made their assault to draw the Separatists towards them, Comet and the others took out the sentry droids and successfully scaled the wall with grapplers. As Tano guarded the rear, Comet told her to come up after them as the men secured their position. However, as Tano reassured Comet that she was right behind them, she was captured by the Trandoshan hunter Lo-Taren as Comet and the men continued on, unaware that she had been captured."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Kadavo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the population of Kiros was enslaved by the Zygerrian Slave Empire and brought to a slave processing facility on Kadavo, Koon led the Wolfpack to attempt a rescue.

As Comet noted that they were probably way off, Wolffe replied over the comm from the clone turbo tank he was traveling in that the data said they were very close. Comet assured his commander that they had scoured the area three times, declaring the area to be a wasteland as he could not see anything by visual or using the scanner.
