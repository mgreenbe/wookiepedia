Nampi ate Jabba's top aide, Scuppa, to take him as her husband, as Orooturooan mating rituals involved the female eating the male. However, Jabba had put an explosive inside Scuppa's head to use if he betrayed Jabba. When Nampi ate Scuppa, Jabba set off the explosive, which caused Nampi to gruesomely explode. After Nampi's death, Jabba took her starship to Cabrool Nuum and tried to give it to him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
