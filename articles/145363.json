During the latter days of the Galactic Republic, the sector's senatorial representative, Silya Shessaun, was a native of the planet. A staunch loyalist during the Clone Wars, she mediated a number of disputes in her sector involving worlds that threatened to secede to the Confederacy of Independent Systems. However, Shessaun was later made to step down from office by the Galactic Empire, who replaced her with a more pro-Imperial senator; despite her resolute support of the Republic, her friendship with senators in the Delegation of 2000, such as Padm\u00e9 Amidala, had cast a shadow over her future allegiance to the Empire. Later, as the internal structure of the Empire changed, an Imperial governor was appointed to the sector. However, the governor was known to be corrupt and open to bribes, creating room for criminal activity to flourish in some parts of the Thesme sector. Slavers were allowed to prey on a number of the sector's backwater worlds without fear of too much Imperial interference. One such group was the Zygerrian Slavers Guild, which had links on Feriae Junction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Feriae Junction was a trade world that boomed during the Corusca gem rush in the nearby Yavin system.
