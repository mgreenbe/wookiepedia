The title page contained an illustration that depicted Skywalker wielding a lightsaber while riding a bantha into battle against a fire-breathing krayt dragon. Han Solo purchased a copy of it along with other holothrillers of its vintage in order to pass the time while Leia Organa was engaged in negotiations. Solo viewed it, along with the others, as being of low-quality, but not harmful. Skywalker, on the other hand, took exception to its inaccuracies, pointing out that he had never done such a thing and that krayt dragons did not breathe fire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
