Sniper weapons included scopes but for most other weapons they were a costly addition, especially for the high quality ones. The Mark I, II, III, & IV scopes in turn allowed for increasingly significant boosts in accuracy over longer ranges."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
