She had the task of concluding landing rights and trade agreements with all who landed on Bis Refinery, Savareen. In return for their services and the refinery, the Savarians asked for medicines, technology, food or clothing. After all, credits had no value on Savareen. Garajon sometimes helped with the help of Vamasto Maja or Taraja Cuttsmay.
