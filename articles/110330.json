The squad recieved either O-Four, DD, or Sev as a replacement in 28's stead, but Niner observed that the new trooper seemed to feel as if he was not accepted by the unit. In 22 BBY the squad was deployed to the Outer Rim world of Geonosis in the first battle of the Clone Wars. In the battle, three of the squad's members were killed in action, leaving RC-1309 as the only survivor to be assigned to Omega Squad shortly after, which he remained as squad leader for the duration of the war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "RC-1309's squad was mentioned in the 2004 novel Republic Commando: Hard Contact, written by Karen Traviss.
