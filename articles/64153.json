They were a favorite of General Grievous, who used them as his bodyguards during the Clone Wars, though they were also known to accompany other high-ranking Separatist personnel. MagnaGuards were equipped with electrostaffs that could be used against Jedi lightsabers and were capable of continuing a fight even with the loss of one or multiple limbs or even their heads. They were worthy competitors even to the most skilled Jedi, one was even able to back Obi-Wan Kenobi into a corner. While formidable opponents in close-quarters, they were also capable of piloting Rogue-class Porax-38 starfighters and using blasters and RPS-6 rocket launchers, and were often seen wearing cloaks. MagnaGuards usually fought in pairs of two, one to occupy the Jedi's lightsaber and one to attack from the unguarded flanks or behind. The presence of MagnaGuards indicated that high-ranking commanders were present, and gave the droids automatic authority over other battle droids deployed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime following the outbreak of the Clone Wars on Geonosis, several MagnaGuards accompanied General Grievous when he hired the droid assassin AD-W4 to oversee the Separatist operations on the planet Hissrich."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several MagnaGuards accompanied Count Dooku during his negotiations with Jabba the Hutt at his Palace on Tatooine. After Ventress's failure in \"rescuing\" Jabba's son, Rotta, Dooku sent his MagnaGuards to deal with Skywalker. A pair of MagnaGuards flew Rogue-class Porax-38 starfighters and were able to shoot down Skywalker's ship before they were destroyed. Later, group of MagnaGuards then attacked Skywalker's apprentice, Ahsoka Tano, with orders to kill Jabba's son near his palace. Despite being only a Padawan, Tano was able to destroy them all and return Rotta to his father."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grievous then took another group MagnaGuards with him to Skytop Station on Ruusan 2. When Grievous's spy, R3-S6, reported that Skywalker had infiltrated his station, Grievous tasked his MagnaGuards with taking R2-D2, who was a Separatist prisoner, to his ship. However, Skywalker and R2 were able to defeat the MagnaGuards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several MagnaGuards were then stationed at Grievous's fortress on Vassek's third moon. However, Count Dooku, who sought to test the general's skills against the Jedi, had remotely deactivated the guards stationed there prior to the arrival of Jedi Master Kit Fisto, Jedi Knight Nahdar Vebb and Clone Commander Fil and his squad. After Grievous was ambushed by the Jedi upon arrival, the general retreated to his quarters and reactivated his guards and ordered them to secure the perimeter of the castle. One of the MagnaGuards then used a rocket launcher on the clones' Nu-class attack/transport shuttle. However, R6-H5 was able to make a quick escape before the MagnaGuards attacked him. Though one of them managed to cling onto the fighter as it took off, R6 was able to rid himself of his antagonist by spinning the fighter in mid-air, sending the screaming MagnaGuard flying off it. The MagnaGuards then assisted Grievous, fighting the two Jedi until the cyborg killed the young Mon Calamari. Grievous and his MagnaGuards then surrounded Fisto as the general demanded his surrender. However, Fisto escaped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane then used one aboard his command ship when he attempted to force Jedi Master Bolla Ropal to open the holocron in order to reveal the Kyber memory crystal's information.

Grievous also used them in his fight with Kenobi aboard the Republic light cruiser Surrogator at Saleucami."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the war Dooku had four stationed at Rish Loo's secret laboratory on Naboo. Together, they were able to capture Skywalker when he snuck into the lab. One of the MagnaGuards then tortured Skywalker with its electrostaff. Several MagnaGuards were also stationed on Serenno at Castle Serenno and the Box. Dooku also used them when he attempted to kidnap the Chancellor, but were defeated by Kenobi and Skywalker. Several of the droids accompanied Grievous as he massacred the Nightsisters on Dathomir. General Kalani also had several MagnaGuards with him to guard, torture and execute King Rash's prisoners during their execution."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Utapau, there was a pair of MagnaGuards stationed on the planet when Dooku and Grievous had prepared a deal with the Sugi arms dealers, for a massive kyber crystal for a secret weapon, but when Jedi Master Tu-Anh, a Jedi investigating the conspiracy, attempted to find out their plans, they shot and killed her with a precision laser dart. Later, Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi were sent to Utapau to investigate Tu-Anh's death. During their investigation, they interrogated a Toydarian named Garri, who informed them that a MagnaGuard was there earlier, during a meeting, and that he was paid by the MagnaGuard to not reveal information. Skywalker and Kenobi eventually tracked down a pair of MagnaGuards. They were both destroyed, but not before Skywalker obtained information about the arms deal. When Skywalker and Kenobi obtained the crystal, several MagnaGuards pursued them along with Grievous, all but one were destroyed by the Jedi. Two more accompanied Grievous on a Separatist supply ship, holding the kyber crystal that the Separatists had recently stolen from Skywalker and Kenobi. They were both destroyed when the Jedi caused the crystal to explode."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two MagnaGuards, IG-101 and IG-102, were aboard the Providence-class Dreadnought Invisible Hand during the Battle of Coruscant. When Jedi Generals Skywalker and Kenobi reacquired their lightsabers that Grievous had taken, the general ordered the IG-100 droids to attack them. However, both of the MagnaGuards were destroyed by the Jedi quite easily. Another four were with Grievous when he returned to Utapau and one observed Kenobi landing on the planet. They were then destroyed by Kenobi before he engaged Grievous in a final duel that resulted with the cyborg general's death."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Age of the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point after the Battle of Yavin, a pair of refitted MagnaGuards were on Nar Shaddaa in the service of Grakkus the Hutt.
