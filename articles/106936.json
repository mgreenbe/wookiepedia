Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Luke landed with his BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber near the town. He went to the depot to take a rest and find a guide who could lead him to the Temple of Eedit. Porst regarded it as an evil place with a demon and that it was better to stay at the depot. Luke eventually found Sarco Plank and was guided to the Temple by him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
