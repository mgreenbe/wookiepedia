Stranded without a starport visa in Iziz, Gormo was unable to travel back offworld or even return to his ship at the starport. Unsympathetic Onderonian soldiers refused to allow Gormo through the starport entry checkpoint, even after the Tweigar's crew came out and vouched for him, confirming he was their captain. The stubborn adherence of the Onderonian soldiers to protocol- that no one could enter the starport without a starport visa- infuriated Gormo and in conversation with Meetra Surik, he vowed that if he succeeded in leaving Onderon, he would never be coming back."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ultimate fate of the Tweigar partially depends on the actions of Meetra Surik. Gormo is one of the individuals to whom Surik can give one of the two open starport visas she comes into possession of. If Surik does give one to Gormo, he immediately returns to the starport, rejoins his crew aboard the Tweigar, and departs Onderon.
