It was primarily designed to knock out opponents rather than killing them. It had a wide muzzle, with two transceptors mounted in the corners of the barrel. It could deliver normal damage, but it was short-ranged and did little actual damage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
