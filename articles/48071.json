Fierce was sickly and stooped with age, with dirt and garbage stuck in her matted fur, ribs showing through her skin, and surrounded by a cloud of floater fleas. She was able to perform simple tricks. Though fearsome in appearance and perpetually on the verge of starvation, she was quite shy and docile around crowds and was only known to become aggressive if her master was threatened."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
