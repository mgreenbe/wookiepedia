Incarcerated in the spice mines of Kessel by the Galactic Empire at an early age, Durron's deep anger against his imprisoners was easily exploited by the spirit of Dark Lord of the Sith Exar Kun, once Han Solo rescued the young Force-sensitive and took him to Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4. Under Kun's guidance, Durron stole the Sun Crusher superweapon and embarked upon a vendetta, destroying several Imperial targets and unwittingly killing his own brother in the process. Only after Kun's influence had been banished did Durron begin a long quest for absolution which led him to become Skywalker's most talented pupil and one of the first Jedi Masters of the New Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite Durron's reformation, his desire to repent for his actions manifested itself in a high-profile campaign against smugglers in the Outer Rim Territories as part of a philosophy of direct action against those whom he perceived as wrong-doers. When the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong attacked the galaxy in 25 ABY, Durron was one of the first to meet the threat, losing his apprentice and many other fellow Jedi in the opening months of the war. His policy of aggressive action was enhanced in the face of the Yuuzhan Vong menace and Durron began leading like-minded Jedi to war, against the wishes of Skywalker. Following further losses, Durron briefly took Jaina Solo as his apprentice and was later reconciled with Skywalker following Galactic Alliance Chief of State Cal Omas' creation of the High Council, upon which both men had seats. Durron saw the war through to its conclusion and remained one of Skywalker's leading advisors on the newly formed Jedi High Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 35 ABY, when a border conflict between the Chiss Ascendancy and the insectoid Killik species flared out of control, a group of younger Jedi departed to fight on behalf of the Killiks, provoking Chief of State Omas to attempt to gain more control over the Jedi Order. Durron, as the proponent of the philosophy that Jedi should follow the guidance of the Force rather than the policies of the reigning government, stridently opposed Omas, upholding his principles throughout the course of the conflict. The Jedi Master later found himself fighting the Galactic Alliance directly during the Second Galactic Civil War, when Jaina Solo's twin brother Jacen Solo took control of the government and attempted to impose Sith rule upon the galaxy as Darth Caedus. Following Jacen Solo's defeat, the galaxy entered into a period of reformation under the direction of Chief of State Natasi Daala, one of Durron's former Imperial enemies. Daala's policies included attempts to curb the autonomy of the Jedi Order, which Durron weathered alongside the emerging threat of a mysterious Force psychosis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early years"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kyp Durron, a Force-sensitive Human male, was born in 7 BBY on the planet Deyer, a colony world in the Anoat system. Durron, who was an active child during his childhood, had an older brother, Zeth, with whom he had a close relationship. As small boys, Kyp and his brother used to fish, swim and play in the lakes that covered the planet's surface. Zeth, who was an intelligent youth, had dreams of attending Deyer's civil engineering school to help out in the running of the colony. Kyp, however, was six years younger than his brother and was content with his simple life on the waterworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Durron family lived in one of Deyer's many raft cities, which floated upon the lakes as the inhabitants fished and sold their produce through a cooperative system which brought the backwater colony a decent profit. While Durron's parents were not, as far as the young man knew, Force-sensitives themselves, they were political opponents of the Galactic Empire, the authoritarian government that had come to power in 19 BBY following the dissolution of the Galactic Republic. Durron's parents believed that Emperor Palpatine could be convinced that moderate action was preferable to oppressive governance and protested during the anniversary of the Ghorman Massacre. The Deyer colonists in general, however, even though they had modeled the charter of the fishing cooperative on the ideals of the obsolete Galactic Republic, were largely ignored by Emperor Palpatine while they experimented with civil liberties, due to the planet's backwater status."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following events in 0 ABY, however, the political activism of the Deyer colonists could no longer be tolerated. The Galactic Empire's Death Star superweapon was used to destroy the planet Alderaan, a world known for its pacifism, an action that provoked outrage across the galaxy. Many of the colonists, among them Durron's parents, spoke out against the Galactic Empire's actions, believing that democracy and peaceful protest could effect change. Deyer's representatives denounced Alderaan's destruction and requested that Palpatine dismantle his New Order. The emperor's response came in the form of repression. In 1 ABY, Imperial stormtroopers moved in on the colonies, putting an end to the co-operative and its liberal propensities. Deyer's raft cities were rapidly overwhelmed, its capital city of Feiya conquered and its population rounded up for imprisonment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kyp Durron was eight years old at the time of the attack. One evening, stormtroopers melted down the door of the Durron family home. A stormtrooper captain read an arrest warrant accusing Kyp's parents of treason, before stunning them with blasters. When Zeth, who was fourteen at the time, attempted to protect his mother and father, he too was stunned. The four family members were taken into Imperial custody. While Zeth, who was old enough to be conscripted, was taken to the Imperial training center on Carida to be indoctrinated and trained as a stormtrooper, Kyp Durron was incarcerated alongside his elderly parents in the spice mines of Kessel, sentenced to hard labor."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "From prison to power"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Incarceration and tutelage"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The spice mines of Kessel were a dangerous and inhospitable environment. Working in complete darkness, Durron and the thousands of other prisoners were forced to travel deep into subterranean tunnels in order to extract glitterstim, a euphoria-inducing drug activated by light. On the surface, Kessel's weak atmosphere ensured that the Human miners had to wear breath masks, precluding escape attempts. The mines themselves contained mysteries; throughout the course of his long incarceration in the mines, Durron and other prisoners observed bogeys, rare glowing balls of energy that drifted through the tunnels and fed on the glitterstim in the mines. Many were superstitious and frightened by the bogeys. For a time, Durron believed that the Imperials would return and take him to Carida to serve as a stormtrooper like his brother but the Galactic Empire never showed an interest in him following his original arrest. After 5 ABY, a prison revolt took place, and Moruth Doole, a corrupt Rybet administrator, and his right-hand man Arb Skynxnex, staged a coup and wrested power from the Imperial warden. In the chaos, Durron's elderly parents found themselves on the wrong side. Smugglers and criminals executed Durron's mother and father."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several years after Doole's coup, the young Human made the acquaintance of a wizened elderly woman, who was seemingly in hiding and possessed a guilty and furtive demeanor and who identified herself as Vima-Da-Boda. Durron was skeptical of the old woman and her ramblings; nevertheless, as she explained to him that he had the ability to manipulate a pervasive energy field known as the Force, Durron listened to the brief lessons taught to him by the crone. The young man began to use the Force in rudimentary ways, deploying mind tricks and taking advantage of the precognitive powers which his abilities afforded him. In one of Durron's last lessons with Vima-Da-Boda, the old woman disclosed that he possessed tremendous potential in the Force and that he would be able to perform superhuman feats. Sometime after 5 ABY, the Imperials came to haul Vima-Da-Boda away and Durron was deprived of his teacher. Despite his unexplained abilities and the advantages which they gave him, Durron remained uncertain and confused by the Force and continued to wonder whether Vima-Da-Boda had simply been superstitious and insane."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Flight from Kessel"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was one black day in the mines, sometime in 11 ABY, that Kyp Durron met a Corellian and a Wookiee who would change his life forever. Durron noticed two new captives one day as the descent into the mines began. Intrigued by the prospect of news from above ground, the young Human clambered his way across the mine carts in pitch darkness, using a mind trick to distract a guard as he did so, before seating himself next to the new arrivals. Durron introduced himself and talked of his past. The Human, Han Solo, informed him of the news in the galaxy; Durron was happy to hear that the Emperor had been defeated at the Battle of Endor seven years previously."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo also introduced his Wookiee partner, Chewbacca, with whom he had come to Kessel as an ambassador from the New Republic, the fledgling galactic government based on Coruscant. Solo revealed that they had been incarcerated due to Moruth Doole's suspicions of their purpose on Kessel. As the day wore on, Durron acted as the guide for the Human male and the Wookiee, helping them orientate themselves to their new surroundings. Once they arrived at a glitterstim fault, Durron taught his new companions how to sort through the rocks to find the spice and worked alongside them for a long time in the darkness. Later, when a bogey moved through the area, the guard grew frightened and called an end to the shift. The workers returned to the lit sections of the mining complex and Durron introduced himself to Solo and Chewbacca under the artificial light, brushing off Solo's exclamations at his youthful age."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next days, Durron formed a closer bond with Solo and Chewbacca, despite their advanced ages. After one shift, when an irate Solo threw a punch at one of the guards and started a small-scale riot in the muster room, Durron joined in the fight. Boss Roke shortly restored order; the workers were taken to their bunks and forced to go to sleep once Roke turned on the sleep-generating field. Due to their role in the riot, Solo and Chewbacca were obvious choices for a small team of prisoners that would descend into the lower tunnels, where more prisoners had recently gone missing, with Boss Roke the next day. Durron volunteered to accompany Solo, knowing the older man had something in mind. Roke selected the prisoner Clorr and another guard to fill out the team before the small group descended into the lower tunnels. Solo divulged that he believed that prisoners were not being killed, but were rather escaping, locating new tunnels to the surface. The Corellian felt that if Roke and his guard could be overpowered, they could all flee the spice mines together."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boss Roke took the mine cart deep into the tunnels before ushering the small groups out of the vehicle and taking spice readings. As Roke had suspected, the tunnels were full of glitterstim deposits; the boss led Durron and the others deeper, until Clorr, who was at the front of the group, was suddenly whisked away into the darkness by a massive unseen creature. Moments later, Roke was grabbed; Solo, Durron and Chewbacca ran away from the mysterious creature as it began its pursuit. Solo was able to grab the infrared goggles from the last guard and observe as a giant energy spider impaled the man with razor sharp legs and fed on his body heat. Durron and Chewbacca raced to the mine cart and powered it up; once Solo was aboard, with the energy spider in close pursuit, the three prisoners took the mine cart at speed back up on the only possible course\u2014the muster room. Durron proposed putting the mine cart on manual control and finding their own escape route but Solo, terrified by the thought of more energy spiders, rejected the idea."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On arrival in the muster room, Durron and his companions opened the door to find Arb Skynxnex waiting to execute Solo and Chewbacca. The three prisoners were forced to flee back to the mine cart and head back into the tunnels with Skynxnex and more guards in close pursuit. In their slower mine cart, made up of three carriages, Durron and his companions lost ground to their pursuit and Skynxnex began firing upon them from an individual mine cart at long range. Unknowingly relying on the Force to enhance his reaction times, Durron managed to swerve the mine cart manually out of a collision and avoid blaster fire from Skynxnex. When he realized, however, that the automatically inputted course was taking them back down to the lair of the energy spider, Durron took manual control of the mine cart, relying on his unusually enhanced senses to survive. When another bogey moved through an opening in the tunnel wall made by a stray blaster shot from Skynxnex, Durron followed it, taking the mine cart into what was, unbeknownst to him, the energy spider's lair."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Durron managed to evade the creature, Skynxnex drove his mine cart straight into it by accident and was killed. Solo directed the young Human to a new passage, which led them to the artificial upper tunnels. Once they burst out onto the brightly lit surface of Kessel, Solo took the controls. The next step was to find a starship and flee the planet; Durron directed Solo toward an atmospheric factory where they spotted a pair of supply shuttles. While Durron kept watch, Solo and Chewbacca attempted to gain entry into one of the shuttles but the trio were forced to switch to the second shuttle, a 500-X model, once Solo tripped the automatic lockout systems. Durron watched nervously as a team of guards on a routine patrol arrived and noticed the damage to the first shuttle. As the alarm was triggered and guards rushed out to prevent their escape, Solo piloted the shuttle away from the factory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moruth Doole contacted the trio of escapees through the communications system and informed them that their escape was doomed; the entire Kessel fleet, garrisoned on Kessel's lone moon, was scrambled to intercept them. Just as the 500-X shuttle neared the edge of Kessel's weak atmosphere, Durron received a premonition in the Force and slammed on the starship's acceleration. Moments later, Kessel's planetary shield was powered up\u2014Durron had saved himself and his new companions from death by a fractional distance. Despite the close call, the trio was still in danger. Doole's forces jammed the shuttle's communications and pursued the fleeing starship. Solo pumped all power into the vessel's shields, which failed to offer much protection. Desperate but aware that his powers could give them a chance at survival, Durron told Solo to fly the shuttle into the Maw. The Corellian was deeply skeptical but when Durron divulged the knowledge of his tutelage under Vima-Da-Boda\u2014whom Solo had in fact met previously\u2014he decided to trust in Durron's abilities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shunting all power to the engines, Solo piloted the shuttle into the Maw at great speed. The Kessel fleet abandoned pursuit on the edge of the cluster of black holes. Durron took the controls from the nervous Corellian and closed his eyes, allowing the Force to guide the shuttle and its crew to safety. For a long period of time, in silence, with the black holes on all sides, the young Force-sensitive flew the shuttle toward the area of gravitational calm in the center of the cluster. By the time the journey finished, Durron was exhausted from the exertion of his abilities and encouraged a period of recuperation while they repaired the shuttle in the comparative safety of the region. On arrival in the center of the cluster, however, the trio of escapees discovered a fresh danger. Four Imperial I-class Star Destroyers were in orbit around a habitational complex built into a cluster of asteroids in the center of the region."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Another prison, another escape"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Star Destroyers immediately scrambled squadrons of TIE/LN starfighters and TIE/IN interceptors in response to the shuttle's arrival and, following the failure of the old starship's shields, capture once again appeared inevitable. To the surprise of the trio of escapees, the Imperials present aboard the Star Destroyers contacted them, requesting a security clearance code, in the belief that the 500-X shuttle was bringing news from the Galactic Empire. Solo's attempts to bluff the Imperials failed, however, and Durron and his companions were taken aboard the flagship of the four Star Destroyers, the Gorgon, for interrogation. In the Gorgon's ventral hangar, a group of Imperial stormtroopers took them into custody. Leading the Imperials was a Human woman who identified herself as Admiral Daala, who had been on duty in the Maw, unaware of the Galactic Empire's collapse, for approximately the same amount of time as Durron had been in the mines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Durron was separated from Solo and Chewbacca and subjected to deep interrogation, his pain receptors manipulated by an interrogation droid until he was desperately searching for useful information to stave off further torture. After it emerged that he knew nothing of the outside galaxy, the young Force-sensitive was thrown into one of the Gorgon's detention cells, pronounced useless by the Imperials and sentenced for execution. While sitting in his sparse cell, Durron brooded, recalling the consistent role played by the Galactic Empire in preventing him from living in freedom. Angrily trying to wield his Force powers, Durron swore to himself that he would learn how to manipulate his abilities to prevent himself from ever being in such helpless situations again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Durron increasingly immersed himself in the Force, he was able to sense the emotions of those aboard the Gorgon and observed as the crew appeared to enter a heightened state of readiness. Convinced that something important was about to transpire, Durron prepared himself to attack the Imperials as he heard activity outside his cell door. When Han Solo killed the stormtrooper guard and entered the cell, Durron eagerly joined the Corellian and the Omwati scientist, Qwi Xux, with whom Solo had allied to effect their escape. The trio set off to locate Chewbacca, who had been drafted into a work detail in one of the Star Destroyer's hangar bays. Durron disguised himself in stormtrooper armor and accompanied Solo and Xux to Chewbacca's location, whereupon Xux\u2014who was defecting due to her belated realization that the Death Star superweapon she had designed had been used to destroy planets\u2014used her credentials to secure the Wookiee's release. Xux then urged them all to travel with her to Maw Installation where she promised that a starship could be stolen. Upon arrival, the Omwati scientist led the trio to a heavily secured hangar. Utilizing her official documents to facilitate their entry, Xux revealed to the group their escape craft\u2014the Sun Crusher superweapon, a small starship clad in near-indestructible quantum-crystalline armor and armed with Resonance torpedoes capable of inducing a supernova in a star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the group boarded the superweapon, stormtroopers rushed to prevent their escape. Durron watched as Solo sealed the craft and used its laser cannons to blow a hole in the hangar roof before piloting the Sun Crusher through the gap to open space. Admiral Daala scrambled her forces to intercept the superweapon; while the quantum-crystalline armor prevented it from physical harm, the sheer quantity of TIE fighters in space around the Sun Crusher penned Solo in and as the fourth of Daala's Star Destroyer's, the Hydra, moved into their path, Durron's friend made a snap decision. Solo piloted the small craft directly toward the bridge of the Star Destroyer and punched the Sun Crusher straight through the superstructure. The Hydra, deprived of its command center, drifted into one of the black holes, its destruction enabling Durron to take over the controls and pilot the Sun Crusher into the Maw."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Repeating his earlier technique, Durron surrendered control of his senses to the Force and navigated a safe path through the black hole cluster. Solo sat alongside him during the journey, which exhausted the young Force-sensitive. Once the Sun Crusher emerged on the other side of the Maw, however, it was met by Moruth Doole's onrushing Kessel fleet. Solo was perplexed by the fact that the fleet had apparently not moved in the days since they had entered the Maw aboard the 500-X shuttle but when Durron realized that the lead starship in Doole's fleet, Solo's own YT-1300 light freighter the Millennium Falcon, captured by the Rybet's forces, was in fact fleeing the rest of Doole's fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Natasi Daala's pursuing Star Destroyers emerged from the Maw and engaged Doole's fleet, believing it to be a New Republic flotilla, Solo acted quickly, contacting the pilots of the Millennium Falcon from the Sun Crusher, who happened to be Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and entrepreneur Lando Calrissian\u2014Solo's brother-in-law and close friend, respectively. Having come to Kessel to search for Solo and Chewbacca, Skywalker and Calrissian had been forced to flee aboard the Millennium Falcon when Doole realized their purpose. As the light freighter's navicomputer was disabled, Solo sent the Millennium Falcon data from the Sun Crusher and the two starships made a hyperspace jump to Coruscant, the capital of the New Republic, leaving Doole and Daala to battle it out."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Civilization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arrival at Coruscant, Durron was amazed by the scope and scale of the ecumenopolis along with Xux while Solo reunited with his wife and two twin children, Jacen and Jaina. The Sun Crusher was taken away by New Republic officials to be examined, while Durron came into Solo's temporary care. Shortly after their arrival on Coruscant, Durron and Solo met with Luke Skywalker, who was hoping to establish a Jedi Praxeum on the moon Yavin 4 where he could train Force-sensitives such as Durron in defense of the galaxy. Durron was excitable as Skywalker probed his Force potential, thankful that he would be able to prevent further misfortune befalling himself if he could wield the abilities with which he had been born. Firstly, Skywalker scanned Durron with a device that could measure his abilities. The device mapped Durron's abilities but delivered a reading that confused Skywalker, who subsequently attempted another test. Durron watched as Skywalker appeared to fall into a trance before the Jedi Master was suddenly thrown across the room. Shocked and surprised, Durron was relieved to hear that Skywalker had expected the response, as in probing the Deyer native's Force-sensitivity, he had triggered a subconscious reaction that was proof of Durron's power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker later left for Yavin 4 with the promise that Durron could join him when the young Human was ready. For the time being, Durron remained on Coruscant with Solo, who helped to integrate him back into civilization. The two friends undertook a series of activities together and Durron began to feel as though he owed a great debt to Solo for all of the Corellian man's help. One day, Solo took Durron and his children to Coruscant's polar ice caps, where an alpine turbo-ski resort had been constructed. Although unaccustomed to the idea and slightly nervous, Durron and Solo prepared to ski on the beginner's slope while Jacen and Jaina went tobogganing with their droid guardian C-3PO. Rather than follow Solo on the beginner's slope, however, Durron fired up his turbo-skis and took a precarious and treacherous route, much to his older friend's dismay. Utilizing his reflexes, Durron raced over cliffs and chasms with Solo close behind, exhilarated by the freedom."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the two men raced across a pristine glacier field, a mammoth ice-processing machine erupted from the snow without warning, forcing Durron and Solo to evade its lethal grinders before skiing over the edge of a frozen waterfall to land safetly at the resort center.

Although saddened, Solo promised that he would secure Durron a flight to the jungle moon, before a message droid arrived with the urgent news that Leia Organa Solo and Admiral Gial Ackbar, a leading New Republic official, had been injured in a shuttle crash on Vortex.

When two engineers panicked while examining the Sun Crusher, mistaking one of its message pods for one of the resonance torpedoes capable of inducing a supernova, Durron was forced to leave at gunpoint by the guards. Ironically, Durron was later informed that he would be traveling aboard the Sun Crusher to the gas giant Yavin Prime, where alongside General Wedge Antilles of the New Republic and Qwi Xux he would help deposit the superweapon in the center of the gas giant, before Antilles dropped him off on Yavin 4.

Programming the controls to chart a plunge into the heart of the gas giant, Durron docked the superweapon with the New Republic transport and watched from the cockpit viewport with Antilles and Qwi Xux as the Sun Crusher streaked down into Yavin's core.

Along with Dorsk 81, Durron often traveled into Yavin 4's jungles to map the region and its numerous Massassi temples. Soon, however, Durron realized that the development of his Force-potential was moving at a pace with which Skywalker himself was having a difficult time coping. One day, as the Jedi candidates used the Force to move objects telekinetically, Durron's prodigious talent for the exercise resulted in his fellow classmates abandoning their own efforts and observing his. As the Deyer native lifted a number of objects into the air while extending his Force senses across the moon, he realized that Skywalker had come to observe his progress personally. When the Jedi Master brought the exercise to an end, Durron eagerly pressed the older man for more lessons and knowledge.

Durron and the other starfighter pilots had to contend with less coralskippers than during the previous engagement, due to the fact that many of the Yuuzhan Vong pilots had left the system to strike at new targets. As Luke Skywalker lured the bulk of the coralskipper defense force back to Helska 4, Durron and his pilots flew cover for the shieldships. Despite the loss of four of the vessels, the tactic worked.

Durron was vocally scornful and promised to fight the Yuuzhan Vong without New Republic support if necessary. His comments and those of his supporters received retorts from Streen and Jacen Solo and ultimately Skywalker intervened and requested unity. Following the discussion, Skywalker dispatched Jedi off on different assignments. Eventually, Durron reformed the Dozen-and-Two Avengers, drawing together veteran mercenary pilots to rebuild his lost squadron. Having lost the finest starfighters at Helska, however, the squadron became more ragtag, with a number of old and battered vehicles taking the places of the lost X-wings and B-wings.

Maintaining a semblance of decorum, Durron informed the Skywalkers and Corran Horn that the meeting was about to take place, only to be challenged first by Horn, who admonished him on his aggressive approach to the developing conflict, and then told by Skywalker to delay the convocation of the Jedi until the next day."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker did, however, leave the arrangements to Durron, who set up the auditorium in which the meeting was to be held in a manner which opposed his bloc against Skywalker's.

Durron did not believe his parents to have been Force-sensitive and was surprised to learn of his abilities.

These gave him fast reaction times, enabling him to avoid death in the Kessel spice mines and over the surface of the planet, when he had a premonition of the activation of Kessel's planetary shields. This ability also enabled Durron to navigate his way through the dark spice tunnels and the Maw, the latter of which was a feat mastered only by a handful of other Jedi.

Contrary to popular belief, the Deyer native did not tear the Sun Crusher out of the heart of Yavin with telekinesis alone, although Durron did slow the superweapon's descent as it approached the Great Temple. In later years, Durron began utilizing telekinesis in his creation of shadow bombs, hurling proton torpedoes with great speed toward Yuuzhan Vong starships during the Yuuzhan Vong War. During the fall of Coruscant, Durron also made use of a destroyed freighter as a telekinetic weapon despite its large size.
