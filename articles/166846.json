Conspiring with Lobot, who wanted the corrupt Raynor out of office, Ymile devised a plan to make Dominic lose ownership of Cloud City so that they could see the rest of the galaxy. In a high-stakes sabacc game with Barpotomous Drebble, another patron of the Cloud City casino, Ymile used a skifter placed inside a pendant on her neck to allow Calrissian to win. As Ymile left the casino, a thief named Zlato stole her pendant and began to flee before Calrissian trapped the robber in his cape. In a brief discussion, Lando returned the pendant to Ymile and dubbed her his \"Lady Luck.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Calrissian's extraordinary luck caused Raynor to take interest, and he challenged Calrissian to a game. However, his luck ran out, as Drebble, seeking his revenge, used another skifter within the dealer's deck to give the game to Raynor.
