A New York based professional sculptor and FX artist, his company, Tom Spina Designs, recently helped recreate that famous scene, bringing iconic characters back to life for Volkswagen's 2012 Super Bowl commercial, 'the Dog Strikes Back.' You may have also seen their work in the form of authentic Star Wars creations for Sideshow Collectibles or spotted their now infamous Han Solo in Carbonite Desk. Tom's passion for original movie memorabilia led to the creation of his business, which offers private collectors museum-worthy services: incredible mannequins and displays, sculpture and theming, and groundbreaking work preserving and restoring original film props and costumes.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
