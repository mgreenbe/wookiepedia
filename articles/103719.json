That year, the Empire's Commission for the Preservation of the New Order began enforcing a non-native workers act on Brentaal IV that had been passed before the Imperial Senate disbanded. As a result, Imperial personnel arrested the Devaronian Tynial\u2014who was secretly sympathetic to the Alliance\u2014and several other of the Pathline Tapcafe's non-Human waiters and staff for not having the proper identification. This left the manager scrambling for staff, though the Imperials neglected to check the Humans who were not from Brentaal IV for the right identification."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two days later, a group of crew members from the EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Far Orbit arrived at the Pathline Tapcafe looking for Tynial; the Far Orbit was actually a privateering frigate for the Alliance, and Tynial was the Alliance contact from whom they were hoping to obtain a valuable datadisk containing information pertaining to the route of the Imperial Star Galleon-class frigate Emperor's Will."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the absence of Tynial, the crew members still asked one of the waiters for Gruuvan shaal, which was the passphrase that they were supposed to use with Tynial.

The waiter, who was also an Alliance contact, handed over the datadisc to them in Jovvitz that night, though the privateers ended up being chased by Imperial Security Bureau agents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Pathline Tapcafe first appeared in Raid on Brentaal, an adventure scenario in 1998's The Far Orbit Project, by Timothy S.
