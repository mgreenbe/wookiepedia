Immediately, Pakkpekatt was at odds with General Lando Calrissian, dispatched by Admiral Hiram Drayson under the guise of representing the Defense Fleet. After Calrissian and his crew boarded the Vagabond against Pakkpekatt's orders, the Colonel attempted to give chase when it vanished at Gmar Askilon. When the CSI recalled most of his task force for duty in the Koornacht Cluster, Pakkpekatt took a volunteer crew aboard Lady Luck to rescue Calrissian, Lobot, C-3PO and R2-D2. Pakkpekatt and his crew managed to find the Vagabond through a slave circuit, and they were pulled through a series of hyperspace jumps until arriving at Brath Qella, where the mystery of the Vagabond was made clear."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
