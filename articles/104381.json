Equipped with a reinforced kinetic channeler in the barrel, with a recoil counterweight calibrator built into the stock, the weapon was also equipped with a targeting sight - considered unnecessary given the blast radius of the weapon's particularly explosive blaster bolts. Despite the weapon's size, smaller sawn-off percussive cannons that lacked a stock also existed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "JND-41 percussive cannons with a black finish and gold accents were carried by the Hylobon Enforcers, the security forces of Dryden Vos.
