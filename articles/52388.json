The company's vehicles were not as innovative or reliable as those made by Corellian Engineering Corporation. Even with continued product overhauls and slick marketing, the company rarely turned a profit. Gallofree Yards eventually filed for bankruptcy several years before the Battle of Yavin, though many of its starships remained in active use as a part of the Rebel Alliance fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
