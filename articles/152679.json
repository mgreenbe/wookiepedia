The ship's commander then confirmed that it has docked with the transport and is transferring the prisoners onto its own ship as they spoke. It then relayed to Rogue Squadron requesting for backup as it was being swarmed by various TIEs. Upon successfully retrieving the prisoners, the GR-75 transport then left the ship and prepared to jump into hyperspace, with the commanding officer thanking Rogue Squadron for their support."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the ship never got the chance to leave: an Imperial escort carrier captained by the storm commando Sarkli ambushed the vessel and proceeded to recapture the prisoners.
