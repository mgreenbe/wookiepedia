Among the combatants were the reformed Black Knights, a faction of dark side Force-users who had risen again several times since their initial defeat by the Jedi early in the New Sith Wars. The uprising caught the attention of the Jedi Order, resulting in the participation of Yoda\u2014who was at the time a newly chosen Padawan\u2014in the conflict. Having ascended to the rank of Grand Master by 115 BBY, he reviewed the Jedi trainee guidebook The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force for future editions that year and made a notation about the Black Knights' resurgence during the Fluwhaka revolt, reminiscing it to have been an adventure for him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Fluwhaka revolt was first mentioned in The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, a reference book written by Daniel Wallace and published in 2010.
