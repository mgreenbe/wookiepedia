After their lessons, clan-mates of the Jedi Initiate Dooku often swapped tales of the Nameless, among other phantasmagoria.

The holocron further stated that dangers of the past only remained dormant, and the entire galaxy would be at threat once the darkness was released. Thus, when the Force itself falls to corruption, a Chosen One would come, fatherless, and ultimately restore balance to the Force. While training his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn continued to study the holocron and its ancient prophecies, having become facinated with them as a Padawan himself under Dooku's tutelage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While detained in the castle of the Sith Lord Darth Vader on the planet Mustafar during the war between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance, Alliance lieutenant Thom Hudd spoke of knowing \"the Curse of the Nameless.\" Hudd claimed that the tale was frightening enough to keep one awake at night, and mentioned other dark tales such as \"The Silent Circle.\" While Hudd had brought up the tales in an attempt to stall a bored Vane\u00e9\u2014the horror-loving aide of Vader in the castle\u2014from executing him, Vane\u00e9 nonetheless expressed his disinterest in Hudd's stories and prepared to kill the rebel.
