Following the initial attack, Frigate Ludwick patrolled the system until Imperial convoys carrying parts and construction crews could arrive to build a new space installation. Imperial Intelligence reported high probability of enemy counter attack. The Ludwick deployed two flight groups of TIE fighters and a group of TIE interceptors to patrol the system until the convoys arrived. Less than fifteen minutes before to the convoy arrived, Alliance EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Huntress emerged from hyperspace, launching B-wings and Z-95 Headhunters, rapidly joined by Y-wings from Red Squadron to bomb run the Frigate Ludwick. Imperial fighters bested the initial fighters fronted by the Rebel Alliance, swiftly replaced by fresh X-wings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial Fighters, one of which piloted by Maarek Stele, fought vigilantly against the Rebel attack, however their Rebel rocket and torpedo attacks succeeded in heavily damaging the hull of the Ludwick. The Huntress also got hit to the point of losing shields. Which resulted in two Shuttles called Escape carrying Officers leaving the frigate. However, both were destroyed by Maarek while the Frigate prepared to retreat. As the Ludwick's condition deteriorated, Assassin-class corvette group Horvus arrived, along with Victory I-class Star Destroyer Stalwart and the rest of the convoy, consisting of Cargo ferry group Bakkun, freighter group Ravn and Modular conveyor group Gorfan. With the might of the Stalwart and its combined task force, Frigate Huntress fled to the safety of hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the attack repelled the space installation could be installed without interference.
