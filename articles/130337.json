Studying together at the Coruscant Jedi Temple during the Separatist Crisis which would plague the Galactic Senate for nearly a decade, Reath was selected as a Padawan by Jedi Master Echuu Shen-Jon while his sister remained at the Temple. Selected as part of Master of the Order Mace Windu's task force that was sent to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala from Geonosis, Reath and Shen-Jon rushed to the planet to fight during the opening salvo of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While other Jedi entered the Petranaki arena Reath and his master joined High Council members Plo Koon and Ki-Adi-Mundi, along with Windu's apprentice Depa Billaba and several other Jedi in a mission to destroy several Trade Federation battleship cores. Completing the mission successfully, the group was then given orders to prevent Count Dooku from escaping to a hangar and leaving the planet. When the Jedi reached the area, they encountered Dark Acolyte Sev'rance Tann, a prominent General for the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Engaging Tann in a lightsaber duel, Reath was quickly slain and Tann and Dooku escaped. Reath's death left both his sister and Shen-Jon in great emotional pain and suffering from the temptation of the dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
