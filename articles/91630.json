However, it was actually a trap set by Dooku to ensnare Yoda and to deliver a deadly blow to the Republic's forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The origins of the Mission go back to when Dooku was a Padawan in 83 BBY. During this time, Yoda came across him in the Room of a Thousand Fountains, where the young man was toying with a sea shell. The two of them talked about the meanings of home and Dooku's fear of losing the Jedi Temple as a place to call home. he related it to the shell of a hermit crab that he had found, saying that a hermit crab constantly moved into bigger shells as it grew."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since Yoda suspected a trap, yet he didn't want to throw away the opportunity of bringing back the Count to the fold of the Jedi and the Republic, he arranged with Republic Intelligence for an actor famous for playing Yoda to make a public departure from Coruscant in a Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor. Yoda was accompanied by the Jedi Masters Jai Maruk and the Gran female Maks Leem, along with their respective Padawans, Scout and Whie Malreaux. Scout was an insubordinate girl with little Force-sensitivity and this was her first real mission while Whie had been the heir to the Ch\u00e2teau Malreaux on Vjun before the Jedi brought him to the Jedi Temple when he had been discovered to be Force-sensitive as a child. The planet had been in chaos in the past years as a result of generations of interbreeding to produce Force-sensitive traits in the population."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It turned out to be a trap after all since one of Dooku's Dark Jedi operatives Asajj Ventress tracked down the Yoda decoy and captured him. Having realized that he was just a decoy, Asajj Ventress caught up with the real Yoda at Phindar Spaceport. During the confrontation, she slew both Jai Maruk and Maks Leem while her escort assassin droids went on a rampage in the concourse. Eventually, the two \"orphaned\" Padawans Scout and Whie caught up with Yoda as they continued their journey to Vjun. At the Ch\u00e2teau Malreaux on Vjun, the mission ended in stalemate. Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker arrived at the palace while Scout and Whie along with his family droid Fidelis survived a duel with Ventress; Dooku failed to turn Yoda to the dark side or kill him. In the end, Dooku managed to escape Vjun while Yoda, Kenobi, and the Padawans returned to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon his return to Coruscant, Obi-Wan Kenobi was made a member of the Jedi Council for his heroism in the war to date. The seats of the Council, according to tradition, were reserved for Jedi Masters, so Kenobi was also promoted to that position. He used the opportunity to construct a new lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For his heroic actions at the Battle of Praesitlyn, Yoda and Jedi Master Mace Windu had privately agreed to endow Anakin Skywalker with the title of Jedi Knight. However, they would first have to consult with their fellow council members for the decision to go through; thus, a Council meeting was arranged regarding the dwindling amount of Jedi Knights and the increasing demand for Generals on battlefronts in the Clone Wars. During the meeting, the topic of Separatist General Grievous was brought up, and Ki-Adi-Mundi felt the need to remind his fellow council members of his encounter with Grievous on Hypori, believing the situation conveyed the General's threat to the Jedi Knights."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As he had promised to his Padawan after the Praesitlyn victory, Kenobi then suggested that the traditional Jedi Trials be forgone in Anakin's case as to help them bolster these numbers. For months, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine had been requesting that Skywalker be promoted to Jedi Knight, but the request had been continually denied since politicians had no power over internal Jedi affairs. Even though Skywalker lacked official trials, Kenobi nevertheless argued for his apprentice's early promotion, citing his confrontation with Ventress on Yavin 4 as a test of skill and the loss of his arm to Count Dooku on Geonosis as a Trial of the Flesh. Furthermore, Kenobi had argued that the war itself had provided numerous Trials of Courage, all of which Skywalker had passed. This was a controversial suggestion; Kit Fisto and Ki-Adi-Mundi openly and zealously supported Skywalker, while Oppo Rancisis and Adi Gallia questioned whether he was mature enough, and the consensus was that he still had to face his last trial, in which his spirit would be tested. In the end, the decision fell to Yoda, who decided to have Anakin Knighted in a secret ceremony."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon his arrival at the temple, Skywalker was chided by Kenobi for being late. Master and apprentice bickered once again, resulting in the Padawan unfavorably comparing Kenobi with Qui-Gon Jinn. Immediately realizing the severity of his insult, Skywalker retracted his comment, but Kenobi was not upset. He instead cryptically informed the Padawan that their relationship as master and apprentice would be coming to an end, as he ushered Skywalker into the council chamber, which was darkened. As the young man stood in the center of the chamber, the Jedi Councilmen, Kenobi amongst them, ignited their lightsabers, in a ritualistic display of honor for the Chosen One. Yoda beckoned Skywalker to kneel before him, and the Grand Master dubbed him a Jedi Knight of the Galactic Republic, severing the young man's Padawan braid to complete the ceremony. After the ceremony, Yoda informed Skywalker that his greatest test was still yet to come. Skywalker later had the braid delivered to his wife, Padm\u00e9 Amidala as a memento; Amidala returned the favor, bequeathing her astromech droid, R2-D2, to her husband. Skywalker immediately put the astromech droid to use in his new Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
