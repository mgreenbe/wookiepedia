As a combatant in this conflict, the Jedi Knight became infected by the nanogene spore, a virus capable of transforming living beings into part-machine, part-organic mutants known as technobeasts. Through the power of the Force, he prevented the virus from lobotomizing the frontal lobes of his brain. In the process, the Knight managed to preserve his own identity, becoming known as the \"technobeast Jedi\" and serving the galaxy for decades under this new moniker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
