His tenure on the Dark Council was brief but memorable, ascending to the Dark Council after the death and betrayal of Darth Baras. The blows struck against the Sith Emperor by the Jedi Order only drove Darth Arho to push even harder for the final defeat of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Arho stayed away from the powerplays of other Dark Councilors and his warlike personality was often used by Councilors against one another. He proved himself on Ilum to be a capable commander, however, the Dark Council disapproved of his willingness to win at all costs. But this attitude changed after the Empire's catastrophic loss during the Battle of Corellia when Darth Arho was selected by the Dark Council to lead the Operation Dark Ice, which would come to be known as the Battle of Ilum."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The initial landing was marked with heavy Imperial casualties as Grand Moff Ilyan Regus' forces struggled adapting to Ilum's harsh environments.

The Republic heroes managed to free Rans, but not before capturing Arho's apprentice Lord Loyat. With the help of Malgus' information, the Republic heroes managed to finally put an end to Darth Arho."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Arho was talented in lightsaber combat as well as a powerful dark side user.
