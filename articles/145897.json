The squadron would divide into three flights and form a triangle with one flight in front and the two behind. On each flight, the starfighters would form into a diamond shape formation with one in front, one in the back and two in the middle. Throughout all this, all of the starfighters would be facing the same direction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Rogue Squadron returned to Coruscant after successfully liberating the planet Thyferra from Ysanne Isard, they found themselves escorted by a squadron that also identified itself as Rogue Squadron.
