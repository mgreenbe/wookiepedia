In 9 ABY, an Imperial faction known as the Kaarenth Dissension was sowing anti-human and anti-New Republic feeling among the aliens of Corva sector. Uneasy with the new atmosphere of distrust, Mellaha decided that everything in his store had to go and prepared to relocate to a safer location."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 9 ABY Arrejis Mellaha was operating a personal supplies store called Serooin's Gear. The shop was located on the West Cliff of Betha Starport on Betha II, a sparsely populated smuggler's haven in Corva sector. That year, a splinter group of the Galactic Empire known as the Kaarenth Dissension was flexing its muscles in the region and stirring up anti-human sentiment among aliens. As violence and mistrust spread to the starport, Mellaha came to trust no one but himself. He could see the Kaarenth Dissension's tentacles squirming ever closer to his place of business, so he started laying the groundwork for a move to another patch of galaxy before it was too late."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One day in 9 ABY, a group claiming to be smugglers\u2014unbeknownst to Mellaha, they were actually New Republic agents\u2014wandered into his shop and made some purchases.

He refused to divulge more."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mellaha was paranoid, greeting visitors to his shop with a curt question and a reach for a hidden blaster. Nevertheless, he wanted to move operations to another world, so he gladly sold anything in the shop. He ignored legality when stocking his shelves, and his prices were 20% above the normal level. He was a particularly keen purveyor of information and answered inquiries honestly for a mere 50 credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Squib had nothing in particular against humans or the New Republic\u2014their designations of certain items as illegal merely drove up the prices\u2014and he had no love for the Kaarenth Dissention.

To that end, he was planning to uproot and relocate at the earliest opportunity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arrejis Mellaha is a background character in the roleplaying adventure \"Counterstrike\" in the Star Wars Adventure Journal 8 for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.
