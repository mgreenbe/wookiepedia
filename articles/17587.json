Therefore, the Blackguard had many members of their order scattered around the galaxy to achieve their goal. The Blackguard also believed that there was no light or dark side, and that only the light or dark side would dwell within the user. They sought to bring balance to the light and dark sides within themselves, similar to the ancient Je'daii Order and the Order of Revan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Ranks"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were five ranks of Blackguard: Minion, similar to the Jedi youngling; Elite Minion, similar to the Jedi Padawan; Wilder, similar to the Jedi Knight; Elite Wilder, similar to the Jedi Master; and \"The Kursk,\" similar to the Jedi Grand Master.

This was similar to the Jedi Padawan being Knighted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Blackguard also had three specialized ranks: Marauder, Trinity Assassin, and Ravager. The Marauder's purpose was to explore the galaxy to seek and study various Force traditions. The Trinity Assassin served to eliminate enemies of the Blackguard and guard Force relics. The Ravager's purpose was to defend the order's headquarters, similar to the Jedi brute. However, unlike the Jedi brute, a Ravager was not required to have intimidating bulk; it could be any expert at lightsaber combat and Force combat techniques. Any of these specialized ranks could be chosen when an Elite Minion advanced to Wilder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Blackguard's techniques came primarily from the teachings of their founder, Vulta Daanat, who trained under the leader of the Brotherhood of Darkness, Skere Kaan. Therefore, it was probable that Vulta was skilled in the same things that Kaan was, such as military strategy, mind tricks, battle meditation, lightsaber combat, and Force combat techniques which Daanat would have then passed down to them, They may also have known how to construct holocrons, due to the fact that they knew about one, the Mustafar Sith holocron, which they had guarded by Trinity Assassins."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
