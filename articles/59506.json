It was not recommended for use against flesh-eating daggerworms, brain crawlers, or Maxilan's explosive bloatworm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Its active ingredient was 1.87% trestibinexocycline 5-Gamma. Other ingredients were forage products, thlank oil, and greel-root acid (as a preservative). It needed to be stored at ambient temperatures within the manufacturer's parameters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Application"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It could be spread across daily feed rations with a long-handled spatula or related tool. The formulation needed to be mixed with feed before consumption. It needed five standard minutes or until vapor was seen rising from the mixture before it could be mixed into the feed. The feed-slurry mixture would need continued stirring until it bubbled. The recommended dose for a happabore was every nine standard timeparts, taking into account mean weight of happabores, local parasitic activity and observed results. Monitoring of the consumption of the product was suggested to ensure proper balance of ingestion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Hazards"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The slurry could be hazardous to some species with sensitive olfactory glands. The vapor produced from the slurry could be maldorous and mildly corrosive to mucous membranes.
