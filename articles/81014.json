While working in the Klegger Corp Mining Facility in 19 BBY, Lellis saw the boy Kakan being chased by a dark figure wielding a lightsaber. Unaware of what the \"monster\" had done but knowing they needed to escape, Lellis grabbed Kakan and learned that the boy had not told anyone, including his Brood-Mother, where he had gone. As a distraction, Lellis opened the facility's repulsor vents to flood the area with toxic, psychoactive fumes, before heading up a ladder with Kakan. However, the boy was affected by the fumes, saw a spectre of their pursuer, and fell from the ladder. Many years later, Lellis would recount the events of that night to his nephew Tuttel and Tuttel's friend Giggek in an attempt to dissuade them from travelling to Fortress Vader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
