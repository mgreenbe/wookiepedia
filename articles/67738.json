Hidden in the fringes of the Ivax Nebula, it could only be reached from Ione on the Corellian Trade Spine via the Ione\u2013Isis hyperroute, a secret hyperlane that passed by the Mining World of Burnin Konn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isis' surface was covered with large translucent crystalline mountains and spires. The crystals refracted the incoming sunlight and filled the skies with countless rainbows. The canyons had an average width of 750m and a height of 12,500m. The crystal were rich in minerals and ores, but also disrupted all communications and sensors, even from orbit. Despite its unusual environment, the planet was hospitable to most sentient life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Owing to its location in the Ivax Nebula, the planet remained unknown to the rest of the galaxy for a long time. During the last years of the Old Republic, it was discovered and explored by an Alderaanian scouting expedition. Then-First Chairman Bail Organa foresaw the need for a hidden base in an eventual galactic uprising and kept the information about Isis to himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Civil War escalated, Isis became home to those who opposed the New Order, secreted away by Bail Organa. The colonists founded the city of Neskroff, the planet's only spaceport, located in a giant crystal mesa. Later engineers joined the colonists as well and the Human population soon reached over 100,000 people. The planet's natural resources were mined, refined and processed and manufactured into starfighters, making about 30% of the Rebel Alliance's starfighter production capability. In contrast to other safe worlds, the Isis colony enjoyed a relative high level of technology, even having a starport and with several hyperspace-worthy spaceships, including several squadrons of X-wing and Y-wing starfighters. The DP20 frigate Handree was also based on the planet. However, due to the crystal's disrupting nature, all communication had to be transmitted via fiber-optics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The native Gutretee were mostly befriended by the colonists and learned to speak basic.

The Imperial scout vessel Wanderer almost discovered the planet during the height of the civil war, but was intercepted by Rebel agents in time.
