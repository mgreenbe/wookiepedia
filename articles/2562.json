Due to its experimental armor, it was both faster and more durable than a standard AT-ST. It was painted in a dark color scheme, and at times a gray color scheme. It was fitted with twin rotating heavy laser cannons and was piloted by a veteran crew and excelled against most targets. A cold weather variant also existed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The AT-ST Mark III was originally created for Star Wars: Commander, a mobile strategy game developed by Disney Interactive and released on August 21, 2014 for iOS devices."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
