In 987 BBY, the bounty hunter tracked Salto Zendar to a hospital on Bandomeer in an attempt to win the substantial bounty which had been set forth by the InterGalactic Banking Clan. The Twi'lek arrived in the hospital and found Zendar shortly after another hunter, Lucia. He quickly shot Lucia in the stomach with his blaster pistol and knocked aside the nurse in the room, Serra, to get to Zendar. He dragged the fugitive out to a hallway, however, several other bounty hunters joined the attack. By the end of the skirmish, Zendar was dead, along with four of the attacking bounty hunters and several civilians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
