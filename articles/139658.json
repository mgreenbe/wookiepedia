The missing people were hikers who disappeared in the Thaos Mountains. The spacer questioned Angela, the wife of one of the missing hikers Ilyamo, to learn more about the trail. The spacer also interrogated Myron Beech who organized the hiking trail. The spacer later met Jareck Arned who was living a solitary life in the mountains and searched his home that was located on the hiking trail. However, another group of people suddenly disappeared. The spacer immediately went to the spot where the second group disappeared where he fought several cave-dwellers, an anti-government and criminal group. From a communicator found on a body, Commander Talte managed to triangulate a signal to a cave. Talte thus ordered the spacer to rescue the hostages before they were executed. Commander Talte's agents finally assaulted the cave and freed the hostages. The cave-dweller leader Raynod Menar was killed by the spacer during the attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Commander Talte appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
