In the year 5 ABY, he and reporter Tracene Kane filmed a statement from Chancellor Mon Mothma of the New Republic in the early morning on the planet Chandrila regarding allegations that she had been concealing knowledge of the Galactic Empire's presence on the planet Jakku from the public. Before the interview, Birt was the one to connect the hovering camera to the holoprojector platform and confirmed in Sullustese that the equipment was ready for the chancellor.
