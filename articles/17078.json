The binary programming language of those droids was similar to that of moisture vaporators. Type II loadlifter droids were frauds, being repurposed demolition droids prone to violence. Late in the Clone Wars, Rafa Martez was hired by Lokann and his business partner to build the Type II loadlifter droids. The work was done by Rafa's sister Trace and her new friend Ahsoka Tano, who eventually realized the danger of the droids. One of the droids went on a rampage through Level 1313 after Trace forgot to put a restraining bolt on it before activating it, leading her and Tano to have to chase it down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
