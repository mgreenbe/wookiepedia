During an intergalactic event known as the Clone Wars, which had begun by 22 BBY, the planet had aligned itself with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a major player in the war. It was eventually subjugated to an invasion from the Galactic Republic, the Confederate adversary, that saw the world covered in continual fighting.
