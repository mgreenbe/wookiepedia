He usually partnered with the Nelvaanian Skarl. They were two of the many bounty hunters who were hired to hunt down and find the Murakami orchid for Darth Scabrous. He tried to cheat him selling a false orchid but Scabrous uncovered the bluff, killing Skarl and serving his head to Dranok, promising he could leave if he ate his former partner's head. Dranok attempted to use the knife provided to attack Scabrous, but the Sith Force-choked him into submission and left him to his zombies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
