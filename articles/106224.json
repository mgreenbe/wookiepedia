After locating the Separatist's new secret weapon, the heavy cruiser Malevolence, in the Abregado system, Plo Koon led his fleet against the massive vessel. His fleet of three Venator-class Star Destroyers, including his flagship the Triumphant, were hit by an ion cannon followed by turbolaser fire. By the end of the battle, the fleet was annihilated save for one Republic escape pod containing Koon, Clone Commander CC-3636, Boost, and Sinker, which were eventually rescued by General Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano. Sometime after the fleet's destruction, the Malevolence was destroyed in the Battle of the Kaliida Nebula, and Koon was eventually given a another armada."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Complement"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plo Koon's fleet consisted of three Venator-class Star Destroyers, including the flagship, Triumphant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
