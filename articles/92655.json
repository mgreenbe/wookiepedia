The shielding was virtually impervious to harm. The underground chambers of the Royal Palace of Alderaan were equipped with mono-molecular plates, which protected them from the destruction of the planet. Extremely expensive and heavily regulated, mono-molecular shielding was only used on parts of the Palace to avoid Imperial attention and scrutiny."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
