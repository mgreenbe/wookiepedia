The blow consisted of a strike to your opponent's hub with an ion-charged shockmitt, which would either disable their shield or, if their shield was already disabled, ionize their armor, leading to them losing in an ion-out. A stunner to an unshielded hub could cause nerve-damage. The Calian shockboxer Lobar Aybock used a hub-buster to defeat the Esoomian Tontruk and the Barabel Tull Raine in different matches during his career."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
