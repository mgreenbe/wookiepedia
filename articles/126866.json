Smuggler Zeerid Korr went to Ord Mantell to meet the Human male Arigo to give him his cargo drop. When Korr got there, however, Arigo wasn't there and two other men were there instead. Korr figured out that they were not who was supposed to pick up the cargo, so he would not give it to them. Korr had to fight his way back to his starship, the Fatman, killing both men."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
