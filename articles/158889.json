They were as maneuverable as X-wings, though with more firepower. They could also fly in a complex dance-like pattern which made them difficult to hit. They were launched from a Paskla-class cruiser disguised as a Geroon refugee ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 27 BBY, the Vagaari used close-in fighters during a skirmish in the Crustai system and a battle near the Crustai base. Little is known about these fighters except that they were equipped with laserfire and missiles and that Commander Mitth'raw'nuruodo of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force was able to predict their firing pattern and therefore easily destroy them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
