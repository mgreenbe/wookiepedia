It was first announced on June 12, 2014 at the Variety Purpose Summit. Within the game, players are able to place various characters around famous scenes from the Star Wars films. Players can insert dialogue from the films, or record their own dialogue, and add various filters. Scenes can contain various animations, and camera angles. However, each scene can only last one minute. Once a scene is created, players are be able to share it with others via social media. As of August 2018 Disney has Star Wars Scene Maker on their official retired games, not allowing anyone to use the gameplay who never downloaded it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
