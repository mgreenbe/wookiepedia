It could be used to make moof milk yogurt, which was the type of yogurt recommended by Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs for his Roasted Kajaka Root recipe that was pictured in his cookbook with a purple yogurt topping. Moof milk was not to be confused with Moof Juice, a fruity beverage that shared its name with the moof species but was otherwise unreleated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Milking moofs was an occupation for some beings, though the term \"moof-milker\" was also used as an insult to another being's intelligence.
