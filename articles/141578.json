That night, he hears that voice saying \"Skywalker,\" and he goes to the Jedi Council Chamber, where he meets a dark-side entity who engages a lightsaber duel with him and tells him that he will turn to the dark side. At that point, some Jedi Initiates materialize asking Anakin for help, and the entity blasts him with Force lightning. An agonizing Anakin then starts thinking of Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who, whilst on Naboo, for some reason senses this, somehow making the entity disappear, together with the younglings. As Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda arrive, Anakin starts being weak, and the two Masters reflect about the few words Anakin says."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
