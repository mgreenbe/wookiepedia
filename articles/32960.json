DP20s were also heavily armed, boasting eight turret-mounted twin light turbolaser batteries, six retractable turret-mounted quad laser cannons, as well as two port and two starboard fast-loading concussion missile launchers which could target starfighters, enemy patrol boats, and corvettes. During combat, DP20s kept their shields balanced when encountered by enemy starfighters, but angled them in concentration to the enemy's angle of attack.

During the Clone Wars, it served the Republic Navy as a vessel to respond to the increased number of droid starfighters and pirate groups.

This large supply of starships meant they would be scrapped, but were then often stolen by the Rebel Alliance and other independent organizations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 0 ABY,[source?] at least two DP20s were used by the Alliance shortly before the Imperial Siege on Tureen VII. Those DP20s traveled in concert with an EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate that housed members of Alliance High Command, namely Commander-in-Chief Mon Mothma, General Jan Dodonna, and Admiral Gial Ackbar. A DP20 Frigate was later stationed as part of the Alliance Fleet above the planet Hoth while Echo Base was being constructed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point during the war, the Galactic Empire laid a trap in a starship boneyard by leaking information that a DP20 Frigate was awaiting to be decommissioned and was vulnerable for theft. Aboard the DP20, however, was a squad of elite stormtroopers behind shielded compartments that were ready to engage any shipjackers. At another point, a DP20 Frigate took part in a battle and its rebel captain was assassinated by a double-agent working for the Empire, sending the ship into chaos after the agent fled the bridge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Admiral Ackbar later sought to build up his forces for the upcoming attack on the Galactic Empire's second Death Star above Endor, the former Baron Administrator of Cloud City Lando Calrissian introduced him to various individuals that would be willing to join the fight, including a group of Alderaanian exiles that had four DP20 Frigates in their arsenal.
