His intent was to gather information about it, and to publish it on a website dedicated to Star Wars rare artefacts. According to Jamie Benning (aka Jambe Davdar on originaltrilogy.com), creator of fan-documentaries Star Wars Begins, Building Empire and Returning to Jedi, Stephen J. Sansweet (Lucasfilm Head of Fan Relations at the time) acknowledged the existence of the documentary, and provided further details: it was a production from the United Kingdom, mostly made with a French crew, and probably only aired once; Lucasfilm only had one low-quality copy that was shown at an Australian convention."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Footage from Parbot's documentary was used in European promotional material, according to Darth Neo.
