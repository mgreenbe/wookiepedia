Lacking technical know how, such as on the construction of a lightsaber, his vast knowledge of Jedi philosophy and tradition was stored on the holocron, allowing a student to learn new Force techniques or discover the intricacies of the Force as a whole."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This holocron was one of the few surviving storage devices of its era."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
