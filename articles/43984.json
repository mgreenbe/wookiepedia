Having extinguished this threat, Starkiller headed to Cloud City on Bespin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Four other Shadow Guards were sent to Cloud City with a squad of stormtroopers to assassinate both Starkiller and Master Kota but were forced to fight Starkiller in several duels, one of which where their bolts of Force lightning collided in a battle of wills whereas.
