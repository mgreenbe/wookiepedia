Answering Jedi Master Cilghal's call to detain Horn, Wan quickly went to help. However, Horn tossed a bust at the Falleen, causing her to hit one of the stacks and fall unconscious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Wan and Jedi Radd Minker were assigned to patrol the Coruscant Livestock Exchange and Exhibition at the Grand Event Center with Jedi Knights Leia Organa Solo and Jaina Solo. While viewing the Dangerous Animals exhibit, Jedi Wan was overcome by the same psychosis seen in the Horn children and Seff Hellin. Without notifying the Solo's (who she thought to be impostors), Wan quickly made her way to the control room, powering off the lights in the exhibit and locking all the exits. She than opened all of the exhibits, releasing the vicious and fierce animals unto the panicked crowd. In addition she dropped raw meat from the ceiling on to the walkway, and then began retracting the catwalk as the Jedi frantically attempted to cut open the doors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Wan was emptying the corrals, she used the Force to throw her voice to distract the \"fake\" Jedi.

Natua was visited later by Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo. The Falleen attempted to use her pheromones on Han, asking him to free her. However, the ysalamiri that were positioned in the Asylum Block prevented her efforts from working, and Solo declined her request. Later, Wan and the other infected Jedi were taken to Shedu Maad by Organa Solo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 44 ABY, Wan and the other Jedi suffering from the mysterious Force psychosis snapped out of their delusions in the aftermath of Luke Skywalker's first battle with Abeloth on Abeloth's planet. They were brought from Shedu Maad to the Jedi Temple by Zekk and Tekli. Wan participated in the rescue attempt of Jysella and Valin Horn as a member of \"Team Saav'etu.\" Disguised as exterminators, the team used foam coating to mask the cam bubbles of the facility and then breached the outer walls with thermal detonators. Inside, the team discovered thousands of prisoners frozen in carbonite alongside the Horn siblings. Despite fierce opposition from Galactic Alliance Security forces, the Horns were successfully rescued."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that year, in an attempt to show her that the Jedi still trusted her, Luke Skywalker and Jaina Solo tasked her with researching information on ancient Sith planets such as Korriban and Dromund Kaas in order to find Abeloth and Ship. On the last planet the Jedi searched with all their numbers, Upekzar, she was tasked by the Grand Master to explore the lava tunnels under the planet with Ben Skywalker and Vestara Khai. When they encountered a mutated Rhak-skuri and Ben fell unconscious, Vestara wounded Natua so the beast would feed on her instead of Ben. She was then taken by the beast and killed, her corpse being dragged deeper into the tunnels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
