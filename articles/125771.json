Over a century before Sadow's ascension to the Sith Empire's throne, Simus challenged a fellow warlord named Marka Ragnos for the mantle of Dark Lord.

As Ragnos pitted his adversaries against each other to ensure his hold on the throne, Simus advised the Dark Lord, faithfully serving the Sith Empire. When Ragnos died in 5000 BBY over a century later, Simus' apprentice, Naga Sadow, was one of two challengers for the mantle of Dark Lord. The other was Ludo Kressh, a Sith Councilor who wished to keep the Empire hidden from the Galactic Republic, which controlled much of the galaxy. Sadow, however, wished to expand the Empire's borders. Although the Sith Council was split on the matter, Simus mediated between its clashing warlords whilst also providing support for his long-time friend Sadow, backing his candidacy for the Sith throne."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Sadow's attempt to provide the other councilors with a reason to wage war against the Republic, Simus was killed by his apprentice with a Republic-issue blaster. Sadow proceeded to frame the Republic for the respected magician's assassination, inflaming the Sith to initiate their conquest of the galaxy. However, despite Sadow's efforts, the Sith Empire was repelled and defeated by the Republic. While the Golden Age of the Sith came to an end, just over a millennium later, within the fallen empire of the Sith Lord Revan, Simus was one of a few Sith whose names were used as part of a training program for Sith students."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Duel with Marka Ragnos"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Born several centuries before 5000 BBY, Simus was a Sith male who became one of the most powerful Force-sensitives of his time.

Although most Sith during Marka Ragnos' reign were ignorant of their ancient enemies\u2014the Jedi and the Galactic Republic that governed much of the galaxy\u2014Sadow was raised from birth to fight against purported threats of a Republic invasion and the replacement of Sith tenets with that of the rivalling Jedi Order's.

Sadow was supported by his master as well as several other members of the Council in his aspiration to expand the borders of the Sith Empire, while Kressh was a conservative contender with popular support, wanting to remain unchanged in their golden age; keeping the Empire strong and stable before seeking new frontiers, and to ensure that they retained their wealth and kept firm control over the Sith people. Nevertheless, before a feud could be waged between the Sith, the late Marka Ragnos had to first be laid to rest at the ancient Valley of the Dark Lords on the burial world of Korriban."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Procession on Korriban"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Simus attended the funeral of Marka Ragnos, where the burial ritual required all participating Sith Lords to space themselves evenly in a perfect circle. The ceremony was conducted by twenty individuals, including Ludo Kressh, who led from the coveted sixth position, whereas Simus was in the sixteenth position located directly opposite. After the tomb of Marka Ragnos was sealed, Sadow challenged Kressh to a duel for the title of Dark Lord before the tomb. While fighting, the combatants were interrupted by the appearance of a specter of Marka Ragnos, which told all the Sith present about the existence of their ancient foes, the Jedi, and that circumstances could soon change despite the current Golden Age of the Sith. Thus, before departing, the specter of Ragnos warned the Sith to choose their paths wisely."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the ghost of Simus' former rival dissipated, a foreign starship made landing on Korriban; after inputting random coordinates into the navigation computer of their scoutship, the Starbreaker 12, two hyperspace explorers from the Republic had inadvertently discovered the mausoleum world with a direct hyperlane between the Republic's Core Worlds and Sith Space. The off-worlders, Human twins named Jori and Gav Daragon, proceeded to declare their intention of coming in peace and told the Sith that they hailed from the Republic. Upon hearing this, in their fear that the two Humans' arrival was the harbinger of a full-scale attack from the Republic Ragnos' specter had warned about, the Sith Council immediately ordered the Daragons' imprisonment and convened to discuss the matter."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Dissension"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Simus, who was accompanied by his servant, and nine other members of the Sith Council held a meeting on Ziost, a world from where the Dark Lord of the Sith normally ruled. As a new Dark Lord had yet to be decided on, the Council's warlords vied for rulership of the Empire, leaving Simus to mediate between the power-hungry Sith Lords. Ludo Kressh claimed that the two Humans were spies sent by the Republic, and if the off-worlders were allowed to escape, the two would return with their forces to plunder all that the Sith had worked hard to build. Members of Kressh's conservative faction further said that they should kill the two explorers and remove all evidence that they were ever in Sith territory. Lord Simus then interjected, telling Kressh that he was overtaken by fear and constrained by irrational prudence. The dismembered Sith further told the council that the arrival of the Daragons was an opportunity\u2014one they should consider before destroying it forever."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sadow sided with his master and told Kressh that his mindset was still attached to the past times of Marka Ragnos, and that the Councilor was afraid of change. Yet Kressh persisted, saying that if Simus was wrong, they would lose everything, while if he himself was wrong, they would lose but the lives of two worthless Humans. Sadow responded with anger, saying that to kill the two explorers was to lose the chance to pursue glory and riches, capture thousands of new worlds, and conquer the entire galaxy.

The Council's tribunal sentenced the captives to immediate execution and resolved to discuss the foreign ship at the next meeting. Simus then traveled to the Daragons' prison cell within the cold depths of the Sith Citadel and, assisted by his servant, peered through an opening in the cell door and told the explorers of their fate as well as the Sith Council's rationale behind it. Gav Daragon protested that they had not even provided a testimony, but Simus dismissed him, replying that their information was irrelevant to the Council's deliberations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite political opposition, Sadow was determined to see out his plan and secretly placed a tracking device on the Daragons' ship. Later, Simus discovered a disruption in the cell block where the Daragons were being imprisoned on Ziost. Carried by his servant, the magician found Sadow, who stood facing away, alone in a corridor and surrounded by dozens of Sith corpses. Simus stated his concern for Sadow's wellbeing, believing that it had been a Republic raid. However, Sadow only turned towards his master and uttered the words \"sorry, my old ally.\" As he spoke, Sadow shot Simus with a Republic-issue blaster pistol he had taken from the Starbreaker 12, shattering the wizened Sith's crystal sphere and killing him instantly with a single blaster bolt also piercing through Simus' servant."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leaving the weapon as incriminating evidence against the Republic, Sadow left the scene of the murder.

The Sith declared the \"Republic agents\" monsters for having slain the veteran Council member, who was respected by even those who did not support his ideas. Sadow then burst in with the pretense of being oblivious to the goings on. Presented the remains of Simus by councilor Dor Gal-ram, Sadow delivered a eulogy for his late mentor and successfully called for the Council to unite and ready to strike at the Republic, securing his own place as the new Dark Lord of the Sith.

In the following weeks, the new Dark Lord of the Sith took Gav Daragon as his own apprentice, defeated Kressh, and allowed Jori Daragon to escape back to the Republic with a tracker in place. Thus, the Sith Empire's forces were united and provided a pathway to Republic space, allowing Darth Naga Sadow to launch the Great Hyperspace War, devastating the Republic with relentless, unpredictable tactics and his mastery of old and forbidden Sith magic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The war left the Sith defeated and their empire shattered, however.

The alleged Republic murder of the wizened and frail Councilor drew emotional reactions amongst his colleagues, inflaming wider support for attacking the Republic and leading most of the Sith Empire's warlords to pledge their domains to Sadow as their new Dark Lord.
