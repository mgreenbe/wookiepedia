They were one of the two most powerful of such groups, along with the Red Fury Brotherhood. Near-constant infighting and assassinations prevented either group from growing, absorbing other groups, or carrying out any plans against rival crimelord Nirama."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a brief armistice to negotiate a possible amiable agreement among the pirate group leaders in the Cularin system, both this group and Red Fury Brotherhood made a deal with Nirama to continue with their smuggling while the other pirates were busy in the talks. Nirama found their scheming amusing, but nevertheless he kept at least one of his four eyes on the pirate activity of the system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
