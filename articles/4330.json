It was the birthplace of the Jedi Order and held the ancient Jedi texts. Three decades after the Galactic Civil War, it served as the home of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker who went into exile seeking the first Jedi Temple after his temple and his Jedi students were destroyed by Kylo Ren. After the Resistance pieced together two map fragments to reveal Skywalker's location, Rey traveled to Ahch-To in the Millennium Falcon accompanied by R2-D2 and Chewbacca, in search of him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An uncharted world, located in the Ahch-To system within the Unknown Regions of the galaxy, Ahch-To orbited twin stars at a relatively great distance and supported a temperate climate and breathable atmosphere. Its climate was volatile and frequently caused salt spray, cold winds and violent storms. The surface of the planet was nothing but deep blue oceans. Dotting the oceans, however, were rocky island archipelagos covered with green trees and grass, where birds such as porgs would congregate. Moss, grass, and ferns also grew across the islands' rugged cliffs. The first Jedi Temple was built on one such island, known as Temple Island. By the time of the conflict between the First Order and the Resistance, Temple Island was dotted with Jedi ruins."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet was the homeworld of a large variety of creatures, such as the mysterious Lanai and the large thala-siren."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ahch-To was the birthplace of the Jedi Order. Nevertheless, before the Great Jedi Purge and the Age of the Empire, Jedi scholars argued that a number of locations could be considered the birthplace of the Order. The scholars argued that Ahch-To, Tython, Coruscant, Jedha, and Ossus could all be considered candidate worlds for the Order's birth and the location of the first Jedi temple. Despite such deliberation, however, the location of the first Jedi temple was a mystery by the time the Galactic Civil War came to a close."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke Skywalker made use of the Jedi star compass he had discovered in the Emperor's Observatory on Pillio. With a plasma-encased supraluminite lodestone at its center, the compass functioned much like the ancient wayfinders and was attuned to specific points in hyperspace. Through studying the compass, uncovered a path to Ahch-To the site of Temple Island and the first Jedi temple. With the help of Lor San Tekka, Skywalker finally put together the many clues and learned the location of the temple, keeping this information to himself.[source?] Following the destruction of his temple and the students of his Jedi Order, Skywalker vanished in his X-wing starfighter of the T-65B line and went in search of the first Jedi temple. He entered into a self-imposed exile on Ahch-To, landed his X-wing starfighter in a shallow inlet, residing on an island with stone ruins, and cut himself from the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Resistance began its fight against the First Order, General Leia Organa, Skywalker's sister, hoped to find her brother and bring him back into the fight against the dark side of the Force. She sent Commander Poe Dameron to Jakku, where he retrieved a partial map held by Lor San Tekka that gave part of the direction to Ahch-To, which he stored in his astromech droid, BB-8. Later, after the partial map was given to the Resistance, Skywalker's astromech droid, R2-D2, who had been in low power mode since Skywalker's exile, returned to full power and provided the rest of the map to Ahch-To. R2-D2 unknowingly had the map in his databanks for many years, having found it in the network of the Galactic Empire aboard the Death Star during the Galactic Civil War. Rey, a young Force-sensitive scavenger, took the map and traveled to Ahch-To, where she found Skywalker in his exile."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After training Rey, Skywalker opted to remain on the planet rather than travel to Crait to fight the First Order. After being visited by the spirit of Jedi Master Yoda, Skywalker projected himself to Crait to interact with the Resistance and with his fallen pupil Kylo Ren. Projecting himself required a massive amount of Force energy and ultimately led to his demise, although Luke found inner peace and purpose in his final moments as he gazed upon Ahch-To's binary sunset and became one with the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One year later, following her confrontation against Ren and the revelation that the resurrected Darth Sidious was her grandfather, Rey fled to Ahch-To in Kylo Ren's TIE whisper and intended to live out the rest of her days there in self-imposed exile as Skywalker had previously done, fearing that she would fall to the dark side of the Force. However, Skywalker's spirit appeared to her and encouraged Rey to not give up like he did and to realize that her blood would not define her legacy nor her actions. He gave her Leia's lightsaber, which he had kept hidden in his hut during his exile. Since Rey had purposely crashed the TIE fighter, Skywalker lifted his old X-wing out of the water for her to fly to Exegol. With Skywalker's starfighter and Organa's blade, she helped lead the Resistance and Citizens' fleet to victory in the Battle of Exegol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet Ahch-To first appeared in the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens.
