The facial markings were considered the equivalent of the blemishes left by the bursting of blood vessels on the faces of the Sisters.

With the help of a full coven of crafters, the shaman injected the energies of the Spirits into the Brother's bone and muscle, turning him into a warrior behemoth.

The Human Nightsisters discovered they could interbreed with those Zabraks, leading to the creation of the hybrid species known as the Dathomirians. The witches isolated their new slaves to a small area of the planet where they could draw from them at whim. While the Nightsisters had always kept \"malelings\" as labor units or mating partners, the Shaman of the Nightsisters Talzin restricted the use of males to the Zabrak Nightbrothers after becoming the leader of all Nightsister covens. She also thought it was best to keep them separated from the Sisters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith Lord Darth Maul was a member of the Nightbrothers before being taken by Darth Sidious to be trained as his apprentice. During the Clone Wars, the Nightsisters trained Savage Opress, who was Darth Maul's blood brother, to be Asajj Ventress' replacement as Count Dooku's apprentice. Ventress saw the Nightbrothers as \"adequate fighters\" but felt that they were \"ill-served in isolation\"; it was her opinion, contrary to Mother Talzin's view, that they could learn and achieve much more \"under the direct tutelage of a Nightsister.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Maul's full-body markings were originally Sith tattoos personally applied by Darth Sidious, but were later retconned into being a tradition of his tribe, the Nightbrothers, applied shortly after birth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
