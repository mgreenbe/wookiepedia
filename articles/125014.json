This imposing building was ancient and served as a shrine for the Voss Mystics healers with their incredible curative abilities able to knit bones, purge diseases and mend both the mind as well as the spirit. It was not a simple hospice but a monastery and retreat for the Voss Mystics. It had survived for ages and its rooms including entire floors had a purpose known only to the healers. The Shrine was protected by its own cadre of Voss commandos that patrol the nearby hills and were vigilant for any signs of Gormak."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the upper floors, the Voss conducted their Trials which were tests of faith and duty for the Mystics along with the most dedicated of outsiders.
