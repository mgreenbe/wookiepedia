Wessiri and Horn foiled several kidnapping attempts, including ones made on Siolle Tinta and Wynssa Starflare (although it wasn't until years later that they learned Starflare's true identity). After a harrowing raid on a glitterstim den, she and Corran nearly slept together.

Their relationship stalled out due to conflicting careers, only to reignite during a mission to bring the Outer Rim planet Adumar into the New Republic.
