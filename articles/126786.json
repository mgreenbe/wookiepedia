There, a number of stormtroopers attacked Jhor-Kai, who engaged them with his lightsaber. Jhor-Kai engaged the Imperials in order to buy enough time for his student Sha'lia and her pilot Goort to escape the planet. He managed to do so only at the cost of his life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
