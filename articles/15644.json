Bees had three main body regions: a head, a thorax, and an abdomen. Their heads featured twin feelers, a pair of large eyes and a proboscis. They had two sets of wings that were attached to the thorax; two fore wings and two hind wings. Their abdomen was large, amber-colored with black stripes and ended with a sting. The Human named Han Solo compared the pain of his mending bones after the Millennium Falcon's crash on Kessel to the sting of a bee. The humming of a IT-O interrogation droid was sometimes compared to that of a huge bee. Bees lived in oblong, dome-shaped nests called beehives, which hung from trees. Those flying creatures would bumble their way in the flowers, incidentally helping pollinate the plants that bore them. Bees could be seen in the Lake Country of Naboo.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Dark Nest I: The Joiner King, Han Solo refers to \"the birds and the bees\" when Leia Organa Solo and Alema Rar start talking about sex and flower pollination on Ryloth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, a bee can be seen in the flowery fields of the Lake Country on Naboo during a romantic scene involving Anakin and Padm\u00e9."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
