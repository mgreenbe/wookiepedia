She was one of several tauntauns utilized by the Rebel Alliance on the planet Hoth. Murra was used as a mount by Han Solo in his search for Luke Skywalker just before the Battle of Hoth. She was the mother of Riba, who had been taken out as Skywalker's mount; Murra hoped to reach her daughter and keep her warm. Unknown to her, Riba had been killed by a wampa, which had then taken away Skywalker. Murra died of exposure to the cold, leading Solo to cut open her corpse to keep Skywalker warm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
