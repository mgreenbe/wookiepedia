In 212 BBY, Bosbit Matarcher, a Human male from the planet of Delemede, purchased on his homeworld a starhopper that had malfunctioning relativistic shielding. Matarcher thought he got a good price on the ship, but when he activated the starhopper's jump drive and entered hyperspace to leave his home system, the faulty relatavistic shielding left the ship and everything aboard subject to time dilation, in which the ship experienced time at a slower rate than the rest of the galaxy. The starhopper, with Matarcher still alive onboard, did not exit hyperspace until the year 22 BBY, while he only experienced a two-hour trip. By that time, the starhopper was considered an antique. Matarcher's starhopper was mentioned in a HoloNet News article about Matarcher on 13:3:21, in 22 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Delemedian starhopper was first mentioned in the in-universe HoloNet News Vol. 531 48 article entitled 225-year Old Man's Secret?
