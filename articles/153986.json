Ruwee of the House Naberrie and his wife Jobal greatly helped establish that settlement, supervising both the physical construction of the village and the formation of its community. However, the couple eventually decided to leave their beloved mountains for the capital city of Theed in order to give a chance at a higher education to their young daughters, Sola and Padm\u00e9, both born in the village. When Padm\u00e9 became Queen of Naboo, she retained only one tradition from her native village, her white thumbnail polish."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A rare and beautiful species of flower grew near this village. It bloomed only once every eighty-eight years, heralding a time of special celebration. While obviously rocky, this region didn't feature any waterfalls, as Padm\u00e9 had never seen one before visiting Theed for the first time. However, several icy and clear streams flowed in the vicinity of the village, and the young Padm\u00e9 enjoyed swimming in them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
