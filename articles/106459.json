The Archduke was a warlord, and commanded the droid armies that fought against the Republic during the first and second battles of Geonosis, the latter of which he was captured and brought into Republic custody. Incarcerated for two years on Coruscant, he was later recruited by the Republic Special Weapons Group to assist in the construction of the Ultimate Weapon battlestation the Geonosians designed; however, later absconded to Confederate space after sabotaging the project.
