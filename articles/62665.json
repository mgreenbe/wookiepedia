Anakin then gives his lightsaber to Padm\u00e9 to show that he trusts her with his life. However, he has to hide, as C-3PO and Senator Organa enter the office. Padm\u00e9 quickly takes the lightsaber off of her desk and hides it in her sleeve. Organa informs Padm\u00e9 that they must meet in the lobby to discuss the Enhanced Privacy Invasion Bill. Meanwhile, after Bane and his crew take out the rest of the senate commandos, the team goes down to the control panel room and subdue the droids there, leaving Robonino to get the power down.

Senator Philo attempts to leave only to be shot by Bane in the back. He then communicates with Chancellor Palpatine, demanding the release of Ziro the Hutt from captivity. Palpatine refuses to do so. Unfortunately, Bane proves his point by locking down the entire building, severing all communication with the outside, and then takes each of the senators' comlinks. Before searching Padm\u00e9, Bane notices Anakin in the upper level, shooting at him, forcing the Jedi to flee.

As the hunters split up, Anakin follows the IG-86 sentinel droid and manages to bash it into submission. Alama comes back down to check, finding the droid's mangled remains.
