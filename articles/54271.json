Clad in Mandalorian armor colored in black, a color traditionally associated with the concept of justice in the Mandalorian culture, the Ghosts were based out of the Death Watch's hidden bunker on the forest moon of Endor. One member of the Ghosts was tasked with overseeing the entrance to Section A of the Death Watch base. Around the year 1 ABY, several Death Watch Ghosts engaged a number of spacers who attempted to intrude into the base. Vart was killed, and his pass key taken by the spacers to gain access to the areas formerly under his supervision."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ghosts first appeared in Star Wars canon in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies, beginning with it's updated release, An Empire Divided."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
