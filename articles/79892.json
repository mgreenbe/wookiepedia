The masks were made on islands within the warm oceans of Langoona where they were decorated with semi-precious gems and inlays of silver, gold, platinum and iridescent shells from the ocean. By the year 1 BBY, the masks were considered works of art worth a large amount. In 1 BBY, the Hutt leader of the Besadii Kajidic, Durga Besadii Tai, gave a Langoonan deathmask to the Hutt leader of the Desilijic kajidic, Jiliac Desilijic Tiron, as a sign of his intentions to kill her for having his father Aruk Besadii Aora murdered. Jiliac smashed the mask against a wall before Durga challenged her to combat under the Hutt Old Law and killed her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Langoonan death mask first appeared in Rebel Dawn the third book in the Han Solo Trilogy written by A.
