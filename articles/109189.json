According to rumor, the component had the potential to increase the sublight speeds of small starships by up to 20%, but had no effect when a ship was traveling in hyperspace. When the Nessem government learned of the component's development, they feared that once the existence of the fluxer was revealed, it would bring war to Nessem. However, despite their concerns, the government began making plans to sell the component's schematics to the highest bidder and they stored a copy of the plans aboard a capital ship that was docked with the Nessem Shipyards. The Rebel Alliance learned of the existence of the Quadronomic Fluxer and they sent a team of agents to the Nessem Shipyards, to obtain a copy of the component's plans. The Trandoshan mercenary Ssorku also learned of the fluxer's existence, and he stole a copy of the plans and concealed them inside a kloo horn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
