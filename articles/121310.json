But the jamming signal proved damaging to the Sea-dragons' and prompted them to attack the scavengers. The scavengers' technicians realized the damage their signals were causing and objected to their use, but their efforts were thwarted and they were exiled to the sea. But the technicians survived, and eventually developed a relationship with the Sea-dragons, and became to be known as the Dragon Lords, even though the relationship was between equals rather than one of servitude. As infants they resembled small lizards, and would spy on Quarg's city-ship to report the scavengers' intentions back to the Dragon Lords."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Crimson Jack and his battlecruiser entered the system at the direction of Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa, the scavengers tried to bring the huge craft down, but were unable to do anything but hold it in orbit.
