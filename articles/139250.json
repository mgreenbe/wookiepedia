All were welcome at Maz's castle so long as they followed the rules, which required no violence of any sort. As such, the castle saw visitors from all walks of life who could generally co-mingle without fear of attack. Kanata strictly enforced the rules personally with the aid of the ancient droid \"Emmie\"; those who violated them were forbidden from further visits. To this end, visitors to the castle were greeted by a sign which read \"All are welcome. (No fighting.)\" The mantra \"NO FIGHTING\" was a core rule of Maz Kanata's fortress, with the warning posted in various galactic languages. This meant that even those who were in grave trouble, such as having a bounty on their head, could find refuge at the castle. Such individuals, however, would only be granted one free night of food, water, and shelter, after which they would have to pay a heavy fee if they wished to remain. The groundskeeper of the castle was HURID-327."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Approximately thirty years after the Empire's defeat at Endor, the musicians of the Shag Kava Band, Sudswater Dillifay Glon, Infrablue Zedbeddy Coggins, Ubert Quaril, and Taybin Ralorsa, played there.
