Following the destruction of the Death Star at the Battle of Yavin, the starship was sent to the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Devastator to collect Death Star personnel who had survived and needed reassigning. Pilot Thane Kyrell was transferred to the Watchtower for reassignment to the planet Kerev Doi. As he boarded the ship he kissed his lover Ciena Ree goodbye, earning a whistle from several of the Imperial officers already onboard. Once on Kerev Doi, the shuttle's role was to provide a show of strength while ferrying the officials responsible for extorting the world's corrupt banking system. Kyrell was given the task of flying TIE/ln space superiority starfighters low over areas in need of intimidation, but eventually abandoned the Empire and fled Kerev Doi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Watchtower first appeared in the canon novel Lost Stars, which was written by Claudia Gray and released in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
