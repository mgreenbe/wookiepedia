This device was designed to emit a powerful sonic pulse. It was very useful for scaring off or stunning various wildlife. The emitter proved lethal for the several species of Firaxan sharks patrolling the waters near the Galactic Republic's secret Hrakert Station on Manaan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Normally it would have a very limited range, but in underwater environments such as on Manaan the signal would be amplified. The weapon was designed to be attached to an enviro-suit, and used when wildlife go too close. The Jedi Revan found one in the station and it proved to be a vital piece of equipment in order for him to reach the Star Map on the ocean floor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sonic emitters were also used on the planet Taris during the Cold War to repel wildlife from supply routes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
