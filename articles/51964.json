The Galactic Triumvirate was set up after the war to merge the various factions into one, cohesive government. The new government immediately set about restoring stability to the galaxy. Reconstruction efforts began on the planet Coruscant which had suffered damage during the battle to seize it from the Sith. The Imperial Mission, abused by Darth Krayt, was disbanded. However, efforts to improve the galaxy's infrastructure were continued beginning with a communications array that would link the Outer Rim Territories with the Core Worlds. Though not an especially costly project, it did cause political tensions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Government and politics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galactic Federation Triumvirate was formed to represent the various factions of the Empire, the Galactic Alliance, and the Jedi High Council.

The followup series, Star Wars: Legacy Volume 2 has used the Triumvirate considerably. Many details of its organization and setup are still yet to be revealed, such as whether or not the Galactic Alliance and Empire still exist separately or whether they have been unified. Due to the continuity reboot of the Star Wars canon, reorganizing the Expanded Universe into the cancelled Star Wars Legends, it is unlikely these questions will be answered in the near future."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
