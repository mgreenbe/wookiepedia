It was the most common Otoga variant, having been produced at the height of the line's popularity. The Otoga-222 performed heavy lifting and other jobs in spaceports and Podracer hangars, but was outperformed as a pit droid by the faster, more manic DUM-series. However, some Podracer pilots preferred the Otoga's steady hands and clear mind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Otoga-222 maintenance droid was originally created for the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. Designed by Doug Chiang, it was originally to stand about six feet in height but was shrunk down at the request of George Lucas, who thought the Otoga-222 would be more appealing if it were more childlike. Early concept art developed by Jay Shuster for the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones depicted an Otoga-222 pulling Anakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala in a rickshaw, a role ultimately filled by a RIC-920 rickshaw droid in the final film."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
