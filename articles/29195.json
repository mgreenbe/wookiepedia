They could end up on starships, causing power outages, and were treated as vermin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The conduit worm had no specific head, tail, or central body, and took the form of branching threads, with new threads grown whenever a new bodily organ was needed. These could grow to hundreds of meters long. Eyes and feelers existed at the ends of these branches, while electrical components such as capacitors, resistors, and batteries sprouted throughout the organism."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Conduit worms could detect faint electrical current from a distance, and if deprived of electricity (such as during a blackout) would seek out another source, often humanoid brains. The thought of a conduit worm's feeler slithering into one's ear was enough to make many Coruscant underlevel dwellers want to move offworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
