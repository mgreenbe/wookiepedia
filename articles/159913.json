During the Galactic Civil War, Jydor held a sabacc tournament at his casino, the prize for which was a valuable Tchine statue. Around the same time, Jydor's business manager Darim Chumu secretly plotted to frame Jydor as being responsible for the murder of the Devaronian noble Carisica Vanq. At the start of the sabacc competition, Jydor made a grand entrance and showed off the Tchine to the participating players. Later in the game, the Balosar gambler Zerba Cher'dak suggested that the statue was a copy, so Jydor showed the players the statue's certificate of authenticity, to reassure them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
