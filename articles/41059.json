They were present in the galaxy during the Galactic Civil War. In the year 0 BBY, several Druulgothans visited a cantina on the planet Toprawa. The cantina, Al The Alchemist's, was patronized by gun-runners, mercenaries, and bounty hunters from across the galaxy; the infamous Boba Fett among them. Also present in the cantina at the time was Havet Storm, a young Human boy whose grandfather had been a Jedi Knight. The patrons soon discovered that Storm was carrying a lightsaber, so the bar-goers\u2014Druulgothans included\u2014gathered around the boy and stared at him with hostility. Fett, who bore a grudge against the boy from a previous encounter, ordered the assorted patrons of the cantina to kill Storm, but the boy was able to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Druulgothans were created by Paul Cockburn, author of the pick-a-path adventure Jedi Dawn, published by Boxtree Ltd in 1993. The species is not mentioned in the adventure itself, but is only mentioned in the front matter immediately following the book's cover. The scene described here closely matches a scene contained in the adventure, which includes the same quotation from Boba Fett. In this scene, the reader is given three choices as to how to react to the situation. If the reader chooses to try to talk his or her way out of the confrontation, the lightsaber is snatched away by a \"a lizard-faced creature with a rasping voice,\" which could correspond to one of the Druulgothans. The Druulgothans are also mentioned in the front matter of The Lost Jedi Adventure Game Book, published in 1992, which collected Jedi Dawn and its sequel, The Bounty Hunter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
