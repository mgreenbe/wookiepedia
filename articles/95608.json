Renaming the planet Nathema, Vitiate kept his world isolated from the power plays of his fellow Sith over the next century, and his isolation spared Nathema from the Great Hyperspace War in 5000 BBY. The following year, Vitiate summoned the eight thousand remaining Sith Lords to Nathema in order to save the crumbling Sith Empire and dominated their minds, proceeding to combine their strength and a superweapon known as Zildrog in a complex ritual of Sith magic that granted him immortality while stripping the Force from the entire planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With only one exception, Ritual of Nathema instantly killed every living thing on the planet, which became a barren wasteland devoid even of droids and technology as Vitiate hid his past and the hyperspace routes leading to Nathema.

The terrestrial planet's agricultural fields were dotted with dozens of farming villages, though by the time of the Great Hyperspace War in 5000 BBY Medriaas had at least one city.

He then proceeded to take control of his village, torturing and killing with the Force those who refused to submit to his authority.

But in the aftermath of Sadow's defeat at Korriban, Vitiate emerged from his seclusion and began to manipulate the Empire's fear.

Three days later, Vitiate publicly announced the commencement of the ritual, and the Sith who had come to Nathema gathered in his palace. But to their surprise, the scholarly Sith turned on them and dominated their minds, binding all of them to his will and feeding on their strength as he began the ritual. At that point, Nathema's entire government came to a halt, as the Jedi Meetra Surik was unable to find any electronic records after Vitiate's announcement. To achieve his goal, Vitiate used the central computer of Zildrog, an ancient self-aware superweapon from the artificial world of Iokath that specialized in the transfer of life energies, to empower himself at the cost of consuming the life force of every living thing on the planet. The ritual itself took a week, by the end of which the entire planet was stripped of the Force. Vitiate absorbed the life force of every living organism on the planet, leaving behind piles of dust as Nathema's inhabitants, wildlife, and flora simply disintegrated. Cities, villages, vehicles, and other inanimate objects remained behind, though the ritual destroyed almost all of the planet's technology as power was ripped from the circuitry.

The only structure on the planet with signs of life, the Sanitarium was fashioned out of gray rock, with the bulk of the structure located underground, where Vitiate kept a vault of dark relics and artifacts.

The disadvantage of this process was that the Zealots became dependent on the void for their survival, becoming catatonic if they left the planet's surface. To extract some value from his failed experiment, Vitiate repurposed the Zealots as guards for the Sanitarium, the halls of which were also patrolled by mutated creatures from other worlds, genetically engineered to instill fear, terror, and obedience into the prisoners. The Sanitarium's day-to-day order was maintained by the specially trained Abyssin Keepers who served as its caretakers.

The Outlander decided Atrius' fate while Lana tended to Shan's wounds, determining that he needed to be immediately brought to Odessen for treatment. They then departed Nathema on a shuttle sent for them by Hylo Visz."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the Ritual of Nathema, the planet was home to millions of Sith, many of whom were farmers. Nathema's inhabitants lived in villages and cities across the planet and were ruled by an autocratic government headed by a single Sith Lord with many subordinates. The world was also home to a wide variety of creatures, including birds, fish, insects, and land animals, and its agricultural fields supplied a large amount of foodstuffs for the Empire. However, the ritual killed almost every living thing on the entire planet, leaving Nathema barren and lifeless. Other than Vitiate, only the voreclaw survived, though their hive mind was obliterated by the ritual, leaving their underground colonies mindless. When the voreclaws, driven by hunger, finally emerged onto the surface, radiation from Nathema's sun ravaged the insects, burning their exposed flesh and their chitinous shells. In the absence of food, the species was about to go extinct, when Vitiate captured the few remaining survivors and stored them in carbonite beneath the Sanitarium, using them as guards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the centuries following the ritual, the only permanent inhabitants of the planet were those who lived in the Sanitarium: the Nathema Zealots, who survived contact with the Force void through daily rituals and meditation that left them completely subservient to Vitiate, specially-trained Abyssin Keepers who maintained day-to-day order in the Sanitarium, and the prisoners themselves, powerful Force users who angered or opposed Vitiate, and were sent to Nathema as punishment. Vitiate's own daughter Vaylin was imprisoned in the Sanitarium for a time, where she was subjected to a mental conditioning and became the only inmate to ever leave the facility alive. After Nathema experienced rebirth, surviving Zealots began to settle in camps, sustaining themselves on the plant life that rapidly grew all over the planet after Vitiate's death. The rival, warring groups raided and killed one another over different theories as to what had occurred and beliefs on how to better serve their master, whose deaths they felt through the Force but were unilaterally unwilling to accept. The new landscape of Nathema also became home to dangerous predators and escaped the Sanitarium's destruction, among them corrupted versions of sleens, acklays and nexus, as well as the voreclaws, the only descendants of Nathema's original inhabitants."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nathema was first introduced in 2011, being featured in Drew Karpyshyn's novel The Old Republic: Revan, which revealed much of the backstory of Sith Emperor Vitiate and his Empire. The novel set up much of the plot for Act III of the Jedi Knight storyline in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, which was released by BioWare and LucasArts about a month after the tie-in novel. In the game, Nathema is mentioned by Lord Scourge in the beginning of Act III while he is describing the history of the Emperor, though he does not mention the planet by name. The Journal of Master Gnost-Dural, an in-universe reference guide released with the Collector's Edition of the game, mentions Nathema in the chapter where Gnost-Dural investigates the history of the Emperor, as do The Essential Reader's Companion and the Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia, both released in 2012. The regular updates of the Online Companion to The Essential Atlas placed Nathema and the Nathema system in the Chorlian sector of the Outer Rim, in grid square S-4."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The original 2011 release of the game only included a single mention of Nathema by name in \"The Ritual of Nathema\" codex entry, obtained from a datacron on the Imperial version of Balmorra. On October 7, 2016, a cinematic trailer \"Betrayed\" was released in advance of Knights of the Eternal Throne game expansion and depicted Vaylin's imprisonment in the Sanitarium, though at that point no connection to Nathema was made. The expansion itself, released later the same year, featured Nathema as one of the two new planets added to the game and the setting of Chapter VII: Into the Void, which also established it as the place where Vaylin was imprisoned as a child in the trailer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nathema was revisited in 2018 Update 5.9: The Nathema Conspiracy, being featured as the main setting of the flashpoint and storyline of the same name. The update depicted Nathema returning to life after Vitiate's death and served as the conclusion for the Knights of the Fallen Empire/Eternal Throne storyline. It also introduced a retcon to Nathema's backstory by revealing Zildrog's involvement in the Ritual of Nathema. This caused confusion among the players, as the ritual was previously believed to be performed solely by Vitiate. Writer Charles Boyd clarified the issue by highlighting player posts which noted that the Sith Emperor's ritual always required a mass death to be triggered by an outside source before Vitiate could use the life essences of the dead to empower himself, and adding \"y'all have it pretty much sorted here\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
