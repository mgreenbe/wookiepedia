During the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, the Alliance was forced to retreat from its failed Mid Rim Offensive, an operation by the Alliance and the Mid Rim revolutionaries to take control of the Mid Rim. The Alliance was forced to retreat from many worlds including Jeyell, Durkteel, Ord Tiddell, Charros IV, and Trasse. Several revolutionaries evacuated with Alliance forces, although many remained on their planets to harass the Empire, who was expected to take quick control over the former Alliance territories. The Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Overseer participated in an engagement at Pothor, that won it distinction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
