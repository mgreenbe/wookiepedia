By the year 21 BBY Argala had composed \"The Spring Symphony\", a soft piece of music which Bail Prestor Organa, senator for the planet Alderaan, played when Naboo senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala visited him on Alderaan with the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. Amidala suspected that Organa played the piece after remembering that she had once claimed Argala was her favorite of Naboo's music makers and also because he knew how homesick she was. At another point during the Clone Wars, Argala worked with fellow musicians Bongiovi, Augara Jowil and the Naboo Royal Advisory Council music Advisor Hela Brandes to persuade Beezar Pert, another famed composer, to come out of retirement for a charity concert. The concert was held in the Palace Plaza in the Naboo capital city of Theed and sold out, with all profits being used to support children orphaned by the Clone Wars on both sides of the conflict."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tofli Argala was first mentioned in Clone Wars Gambit: Stealth, a novel by Karen Miller which was released in 2010.
