Its scrupulous honesty did little to endear the droid to portworkers in areas such as Bothan and Hutt Space, where bribes were commonplace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Such flexibility was not a facet of the LE's programming, and so the droid saw nothing wrong with reporting contraband stashed beneath their freighter's deck plating\u2014thus leading many owners to decide that these droids were simply not worth the trouble."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This was partly the reason why Cybot Galactica ultimately retired the line, though many LE-series droids continued to operate in smaller starports and aboard short-hop corporate freighters. Eventually, continued work in such areas led to many LE droids shedding their prudish artificial personalities, and learn to make compromises where necessary."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like the design of C-3PO and other protocol droids in the films, the LE-series droid borrows heavily from the design of the Maria robot from the silent film Metropolis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
