However, Greck betrayed Pitareeze, stealing the plans for the Pitareeze Cruiser while the Baron slept and producing cheaper versions of the design. When the ships became faulty, Greck kidnapped the Baron's grandson, Nak, and forced him into making repairs. Fortunately Pitareeze's droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO, were able to save the boy and foil Greck's plans. An angered Greck blamed the ship's failure on the Baron's intervention."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
