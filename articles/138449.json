It enabled users to hook into a computer terminal and allow them access the system from a datapad. The comm attachment was installed into the master terminal, while a mobile unit connected to the datapad through the device's minor coupler ports. Popular with executives, it allowed them work without being forced to sit in front of a computer all day long."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TC-40 was used by Alliance technicians to slice into restricted files. However, the Padlink device had to be previously installed on the master system beforehand.
