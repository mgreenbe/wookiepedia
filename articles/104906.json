By presenting herself as a diligent member of the First Order who had eliminated a traitor, Phasma was able to avoid arousing General Hux's suspicion.

The character was originally intended to be played by a male actor, but Christie was cast in response to internet backlash against a perceived lack of female cast members. Phasma became the first leading female villain for the Star Wars theatrical film franchise, as well as the third female villain in live-action Star Wars films overall after Charal in Ewoks: The Battle for Endor and Zam Wesell in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. According to J.J. Abrams, Phasma was named after the Phantasm horror film franchise, due to her armor's reflective chrome status resembling that of the Tall Man's spheres. President of Lucasfilm Ltd. Kathleen Kennedy confirmed that Christie was slated to reprise the role of Phasma in Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, which was released in 2017. Later reports confirmed that the Phasma character would be back in a \"bigger role,\" which Christie expressing that she hoped that the role would lead to more opportunities for other women like her in such films. In her own words, she \"campaigned hard\" to be in The Force Awakens; the role interested her due to Phasma being a female character who was defined by her actions rather than her flesh. Christie was pleased that Phasma wore armor which wasn't sexualized and that her face was never revealed, which she felt was a modern and exciting concept. She has called Phasma a very progressive female character, which she believes is a large part of her appeal to fans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Phasma was first revealed in the second teaser trailer for The Force Awakens on April 16, 2015. Phasma's costume was created by Michael Kaplan, who felt it would be a good idea to have the character in silver armor. He initially intended the silver armor for Kylo Ren, whom he pitched as \"Lord of the Stormtroopers.\" Abrams felt the costume design was wrong for Ren, and the artwork remained pinned to the costume department's wall until Kathleen Kennedy saw it and decided to use it for Phasma. Dermot Power created some of the concept art for Phasma, which was featured in the reference book The Art of Star Wars: The Force Awakens as \"Stormtrooper Cloak Front Red Stripe.\" The Force Awakens director J.J. Abrams stated the costume design reminded him of the 1979 horror film Phantasm, in which the antagonist used a murderous silver sphere as his weapon, and as such believed it sounded \"really cool\" to name the character Phasma. Phasma has been compared to the bounty hunter Boba Fett, of the Star Wars original trilogy, for appearing as an armored and masked villain in a supporting role."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For Phasma's role in The Last Jedi, Christie and director Rian Johnson discussed the character, exchanging ideas. In fact, Phasma was originally meant to not be part of the film's story, as she was supposedly killed-off in The Force Awakens, but Marvel Comics' comic book series Star Wars: Captain Phasma brought her back in order to use her in the film. Johnson originally wrote a line for Finn's battle with Phasma in which Phasma was to reveal that she spent three weeks in the Starkiller Base's trash bin, so Finn was to ask her how she ate, but the line was cut because it would have been impossible as the base exploded the same day in which Phasma was thrown into the garbage. Daisy Ridley suggested the idea of Phasma's eye being exposed by her fight with Finn in the film, and Johnson agreed, feeling it would be disturbing to show that someone as cruel as Phasma was actually physically beautiful. Costume designer Michael Kaplan originally wanted to take off Phasma's entire helmet, but Johnson insisted to only show Phasma's eye, stating that Phasma's face was showing too much, needing to be mysterious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The duel between Phasma and Finn was to originally end differently: Finn ended up revealing in front of her surviving stormtrooper escort that Phasma \"squealed like a whoop hog\" about the base defenses for Starkiller Base, thus making her responsible for the base's destruction. The stormtroopers then tried to attack her when confronted with evidence of her treason, only for her to kill them, while Finn capitalized on the distraction by cutting her hand off. Phasma would have met her end when Finn blasted her with one of the stormtroopers blasters after the \"scum\" exchange between the two. Despite the character's death, Johnson, Kaplan, Mark Hamill and Christie implied the possibility that Phasma might have survived her duel with Finn and could return in Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, with Johnson jokingly adding that \"Phasma is the Kenny from South Park of this series.\" However, Christie then began to worry about not being able to explore Phasma's backstory in the ninth installment given the strong possibility that Phasma would not return.

Abrams regarding The Rise of Skywalker, Abrams was asked what the most surprising thing Johnson did in the The Last Jedi. Abrams responded by stating \"No one wants a character to die, and yet, I know that when we had Kylo Ren kill Han Solo, that was done because Harrison always knew that there needed to be utility for the character, and he had famously always wanted Han to die and serve that purpose. But it felt like this was a way to begin to define Kylo Ren, not just a way to kill a character. So I can see why Rian chose to do that with some of these characters. But I guess for me the biggest surprise, weirdly, was Phasma dying the way she did.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ellen Dubin voices Phasma in the LEGO Star Wars: The Resistance Rises series.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
