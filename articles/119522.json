They were bred from numerous different galactic specimens, resulting in sharp claws, keen senses, impressive jaw strength, and an aggressive demeanor. While effective, the Salky hounds were brutal and difficult to control. They would break handler control and attack targets with lethal force, resulting in several dozen deaths before the military recalled the hounds. The creatures were then sold on the black market by their creators. Though they were banned on the Core Worlds, rumors persisted that they have been purchased on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
