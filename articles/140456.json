When the Mandalorian Sabine Wren was young, her father, Alrich Wren, brought her to the statue to appreciate its history and legacy. During the Mandalorian Civil War of the Imperial Era, the Galactic Empire desecrated the statue and Vizsla's memory by constructing an outpost on it, covering various parts of the statue including its face. Not willing to allow the Empire to disrespect what it stood for, Sabine and her younger brother, Tristan Wren destroyed the outpost, bringing the statue back to its former appearance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tarre Vizsla first appeared in a flashback in the episode \"Trials of the Darksaber,\" the fifteenth episode of the third season of Star Wars Rebels which aired in 2017."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
