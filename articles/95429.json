The track weaved through the streets of Narmle and in the neighboring swamp. Legends said that this track retraced a route used by the local smuggler Trein Veltin, who tried to elude the authorities intent on his arrest. His escape was cut short due to a fatal collision with a flesh eating chuba. Since that incident many swoop racers have raced this track in his memory. Eventually it became a semi-formal track for an illegal street race."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dash Rendar and Kimmi Chyler run in the Narmle Memorial Rally after the Battle of Yavin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Race legs"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Narmle Memorial Rally appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
