They typically had blue and green crests and feather ridges along their backs, and were incredibly loyal and obedient mounts; varactyl were fearless steeds and were willing to jump down perilous slopes if asked to by their rider. With their strong, long strides and bounds, varactyls navigated even the uneven and vertical surfaces of their homeworld. The creature's soul was simpler and purer than that of a sentient. Despite this, the reptavian was still intelligent in its own way."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Varactyls in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originating from Utapau, this species of reptavians was also imported by the Iltan clan to have an edge in the Grand Hunt.
