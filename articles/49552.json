Leaf-tails were about thirty centimeters in length with a wingspan of roughly the same width. They possessed a membrane on the end of their tail that resembled the leaf of a gnarltree, giving the leaf-tail its name and allowing the rodents to camouflage themselves and avoid predators."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Flying leaf-tails were omnivores, and although they preferred berries, they could sustain themselves on insects and other smaller rodents. Individual leaf-tails posed no threat to sentients, but should an individual come across a leaf-tail nest, dozens of the rodents could attack in a swarm using their teeth. During the Galactic Civil War, the tiny handful of smugglers who occasionally traveled to Dagobah in order to capture jubba birds told tales of flying leaf-tails causing near catastrophic damage to starships by chewing through cabling."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the new Star Wars canon, flying leaf-tails were mentioned in Nexus of Power, a 2016 supplement to the Star Wars: Force and Destiny roleplaying game made by Fantasy Flight Games.
