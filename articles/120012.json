Bruck, who had aided the Dark Jedi Xanatos in infiltrating the Jedi Temple, was accidentally killed by Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Jedi Temple. He interrogated Obi-Wan, who was accused of killing Bruck intentionally, and fellow Jedi Bant Eerin, who was almost drowned intentionally by Bruck.

However, the Jedi were proven innocent despite his attempts."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Senator & benefactor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next few decades, Sauro became Senator of Eeropha.

He and newly elected Senator Bog Divinian began to make anti-Jedi accusations in order to dissolve the Galactic Senate's support of the Jedi Order. A vote was to be held in the Senate over whether or not the Jedi should be involved in Senate activities. This was all part of Omega and Sauro's master scheme. By leaking Jenna Zan Arbor's drug called the Zone of Self-Containment into the ventilation shafts of the Senate, as well as assassinating Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, Sauro's supporters could easily garner him a seat as the new Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. This would also give Omega unlimited power in destroying the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, thanks to the actions of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Siri Tachi, and Ferus Olin, this plot was thwarted. When the actual Senate vote came, Sauro turned his back on Bog Divinian, and sided with those who were against banning funding to the Jedi Order. His reasons for doing this were because he was offered the position of Deputy Chancellor by Palpatine himself, which quickly accepted high office, however, tempted Sauro with even more power. Palpatine's true motives for creating the new position were, of course, based on political expediency, in order to transform a rabid political enemy into a quick 'friend'\u2014but more to the point, to maintain a close eye on Sauro's actions, by having now reined him in."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Deputy Chancellor & office emblems"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his office, Senator Sano Sauro kept a broken lightsaber sold to him by a Duros and which was rumored to have belonged to Jedi Master Mace Windu. Sauro prized the claing-bush thorns as emblems not only of his planet Eeropha, but also of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Granta Omega, a native of the planet's moon. Four of the tall red thorns rose from the corners of Sauro's long but low Senate office desk, \"stabbing the air.\" And, upon Palpatine's appointment of Sauro to the position of Deputy Chancellor (done to keep Sauro on a leash), in a temporary garden in the exterior courtyard outside the Galactic Senate complex, twin horns of the bloodred bush could be seen towering above the exotic flowers there."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial strategist & prosecutor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under the emerging Empire, Sauro was already ingratiated into Palpatine's inner circle. Sauro hand-picked Imperial advisors and sent them to strategic planets in the Core Worlds. By 18 BBY, Sauro owned a ship called the True Justice which held speedy trials to quickly put people accused of political crimes in prison. Two of these prisoners were Roan Lands and Dona Telamark. During their trial, however, the two were rescued by the Jedi Solace, the Bothan Oryon, and Trever Flume, all friends of Ferus Olin."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Naval Academy schoolmaster"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Palpatine was aware of Sauro's plans to use Force-sensitive children to train pilots in hope of creating an invincible fleet. He allowed him to keep his plan\u2014for the time being. But when Sano tried to prevent Ferus' friends from escaping, the Emperor was asking to see him. Sauro soon found himself in a job as the headmaster of the Imperial Naval Academy, which he considered a demotion from his previous position as Senator. He was ordered by Darth Vader to find a cadet with undivided loyalty to the Empire on a need-to-know basis project. He decided to send Lune Oddo Divinian, the Force-sensitive son of his former protege Bog Divinian. He did this to take revenge on Bog, who had risen above him in the Imperial hierarchy by becoming governor of the Leemurtoo system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
