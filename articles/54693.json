According to a forum guide on the official Star Wars Galaxies discussion board, the quest to escort Ramani was bugged due to an inability to converse with the NPC. As a workaround, the guide recommended allowing the Imperial troopers to kill Ramani, so that the player could advance to the next quest. This article does not assume this outcome to be canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity, as Naberrie specifically requested that Ramani be safely escorted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because Gizda Ramani spawned under the generic \"rebel_trooper\" template, her appearance was randomized under one of six possible depictions. She could appear as a female Twi'lek, male Twi'lek, male Bith, male Sullustan, Human male, or as a Human female. Because the quest dialogue identified Ramani as a Human female, this article assumes that the Human female depiction is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity.
