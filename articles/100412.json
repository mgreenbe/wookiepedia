During the last days of the Galactic Republic, the mining moons of Naboo had difficulty balancing their need to meet production quotas with the rule of Naboo. As a newly-minted senator, Padm\u00e9 Amidala considered settling recently freed slaves on the mining moons. She decided against it, as jobs in the mines were far less likely to earn the former slaves enough to start a new life than farming jobs on the neighboring planet of Karlinus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around that time, there were multiple strikes as miners lobbied for a greater share of the profits from the mines, with some groups engaging in minor political violence that escalated to property damage on the surface of Naboo. When Senator Amidala narrowly escaped assassination in 22 BBY, Jedi Master Mace Windu suggested that the discontented miners from the moons of Naboo might have been responsible, although it was later proven untrue."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Vein of corruption"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 BBY, while the Naboo system was under the rule of the Galactic Empire, Princess Leia Organa began to undertake the three challenges needed to prove herself worthy as a successor to the throne of the planet Alderaan. As part of her Challenge of the Heart, Organa visited Onoam on a humanitarian mission, bringing aid to miners facing difficult working conditions. When she landed, protocol required her to visit Queen Daln\u00e9, as the young queen was in residence at her secondary palace. Organa invited Daln\u00e9 to join her on a visit to a spice mine on the moon where she planned to distribute safety equipment to the miners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When they reached the mine, Organa observed that conditions for the miners had grown worse since the previous generation's protests; the air was clogged with dust. Organa and Daln\u00e9 met with Brel Ti Vorne, the representative for the miners. Organa announced that they had brought enough equipment for five hundred miners, including safety belts, atmosphere masks, and portable force fields for purifying the air. To the girls' surprise, Vorne received the gift with dismay. He explained that the Imperial major in charge of the mines had a habit of confiscating useful equipment either as a punishment or with the claim that it was defective, then selling it off to line his own pockets. Organa and Daln\u00e9 promised to make sure the miners would get to keep and use their equipment."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The fuse is lit"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Determined to keep their promise to the miners, Daln\u00e9 and Organa considered their options. Daln\u00e9 recalled that she had the right to demand an audience from senior officials, and the two girls paid Moff Quarsh Panaka a visit. He agreed that while Imperial officers were given leeway to act to maintain order and economic means of punishment were preferred over violent ones, some officers abused the license and punished innocent citizens along with the lawbreakers. He agreed to Organa's proposal that he establish better oversight in the mines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unknown to Organa, members of Saw Gerrera's Partisans, a group affiliated with Organa's father's Rebel Alliance but acting without the approval of other Alliance leaders, had planted bombs at Panaka's chalet.

In the wake of the assassination, Organa realized that it might be a few weeks before a new Imperial officer could get through the lockdown and take charge of Naboo, and in the meantime Daln\u00e9 would be able to act freely as queen and help the miners, promising to rise to the challenge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The moon was home to workers who extracted spice from its mines.
