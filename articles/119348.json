The image shows few details beyond a grassy area with two banthas outside an arch leading into the outpost and states blue milk can be found at Bantha Tracks in the marketplace. Another card, called \"BLUE MILK DELIVERED FRESH FROM THE FARM,\" depicted a male human delivering containers of blue milk to a market stand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the card suggested a connection between Saka Homestead and the blue milk at Bantha Tracks, the theme park does not have a location with that name. Blue milk is instead sold at the Milk Stand which also offers a Bubo Wamba Family Farms souvenir drink vessel, and the stand's in-universe owner is Bubo Wamba. The Black Spire Outpost map which is available with the Barnes & Noble Exclusive Edition of Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire does not contain the names \"Bantha Tracks\" or \"Saka Homestead,\" but still includes the illustration of banthas. It is unknown if these all represent different locations or a change in the naming of the stand and farm before the park's opening."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
