After traveling to Ziro Desilijic Tiure's nightclub, which doubled as his palace, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala overheard Ziro conspiring with Count Dooku, leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. She was captured and taken to the palace dungeon where she was able to contact her protocol droid, C-3PO, and inform him that she was being detained. The droid contacted the Coruscant Guard, who dispatched a team, led by Clone Commander CC-1010, nicknamed \"Fox,\" to storm the palace with the primary objective of rescuing the senator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The raid saw the successful rescue of Amidala and the capture of Ziro. Through the use of Ziro's comm equipment, contact was also reestablished with Jabba the Hutt, who had been ignoring communications from the Republic during this time due to his mistaken belief that the Republic intended to wipe out his entire clan. This allowed Amidala to prove that the Republic was not plotting against Jabba by exposing Ziro's hand in the true plot against him, masterminded by Dooku. Assured of the Republic's innocence, Jabba agreed to a treaty between the Republic and his clan and allowed Republic forces safe passage through Hutt Space, giving them access to the Outer Rim Territories, which had been cut off by the Separatists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, Jabba Desilijic Tiure's son, Rotta, was kidnapped. The Hutt gangster sent a call for help to the Galactic Republic and the Jedi. Because the Republic was in need of the space lanes through Hutt Space to access the Outer Rim Territories, which had been cut off by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine agreed to send Jedi aid to rescue Jabba's son. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi was sent to negotiate a treaty for safe passage with Jabba, while Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his recently assigned Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, were dispatched to find and rescue Rotta. Jabba dictated that the Jedi had one planetary rotation to find and return Rotta unharmed to his homeworld of Tatooine, or there would be no treaty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After watching Kenobi leave Jabba's Palace, Count Dooku, leader of the Separatists, entered the palace and, by way of misleading evidence, led Jabba to believe that it was the Jedi who had kidnapped his son and were conspiring to destroy him along with his entire clan. After Dooku had convinced the Hutt of the Republic's betrayal, Jabba angrily refused to take any communication from the Office of the Supreme Chancellor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Republic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala went to the palace of Ziro Desilijic Tiure, which also served as a club for the Hutt's associates, on the galactic capital of Coruscant to sway him into contacting his nephew, Jabba. She hoped to explain that the Jedi were in fact trying to help, rather than harm Jabba and his son so that the treaty with the Hutt clan could be established."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ziro rejected Amidala's plea for aid, claiming there would be no treaty, and had her seized and escorted out of the palace. Amidala eluded her IG-86 sentinel droid escort and infiltrated Ziro's throne room, where she learned the kidnapping was orchestrated by Ziro and carried out by Dooku's Separatist forces. Amidala attempted to sneak out with the information, but she was apprehended by one of Ziro's sentinel droids. When Dooku advised Ziro that members of the CIS leadership would pay handsomely for Amidala, the Hutt had her thrown in the  palace's dungeon. From her cell, Amidala was able to trick her captors into activating her comlink, allowing her to inform her protocol droid, C-3PO, that she was being held captive and where she was imprisoned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The raid"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "C-3PO contacted the Coruscant Guard regarding Amidala's abduction and piloted the senator's H-type Nubian yacht to Ziro's club, accompanied by Clone Commander CC-1010, nicknamed \"Fox,\" and five other Coruscant Guards. Meanwhile, Amidala was escorted back to the throne room to face her captor. Ziro felt she was too dangerous to be kept alive after being informed of her call for help in the dungeon. Amidala was incredulous that Ziro would be so bold as to kill a senator on the Republic capital of Coruscant itself, but Ziro boastfully claimed to be unafraid due to friends he held in the Galactic Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that moment, Fox's rescue team blasted their way into the palace, destroying the B1-Series battle droids guarding the entrance in the process. In the ensuing commotion, Amidala freed herself and destroyed the IG-86 droid guarding her with an appropriated E-5 blaster rifle. Taking cover from return fire, the Coruscant Guards made quick work of the remaining security droids. After narrowly avoiding a blaster bolt, Ziro slithered off his dais, making for the exit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the last two battle droids were destroyed, Amidala demanded that Ziro stop where he was as the clone troopers surrounded the fleeing Hutt, cutting off his escape. Ziro begged his captors to believe that he was merely an innocent pawn of Dooku, professing to love Rotta, his grandnephew."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using Ziro's personal holocomm unit, Amidala was able to contact Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine and inform him of his uncle's treachery, forcing Ziro to confess to his nephew his part in Rotta's kidnapping. Jabba was furious at his uncle's treachery and vowed to have him punished severely, beginning with allowing Ziro to rot in prison on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unknown to Amidala until she made the call, her timely intervention saved the life of Skywalker and Tano, who had just returned Jabba's son safely to him. Jabba, who until that point believed the Jedi meant to destroy him and his clan, had them surrounded and about to be executed were it not for the information provided by the senator. Amidala was also able to forge a treaty between the Republic and the Hutt clan, which would allow Republic forces free and safe passage through Hutt Space, providing them desperately needed access to the Outer Rim Territories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Ziro's arrest, all of his possessions were confiscated by the Republic. This also included the Hutt's bartender droid, BU-11. Designed to serve elite clientele, BU-11 loathed serving the thugs that frequented Ziro's club and was relieved to freed from the Hutt's employ. After overhearing a pair of clones lamenting the bartender at the newly opened 79's, a cantina frequented by clone troopers, BU-11 volunteered and was immediately given the job."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, the Duros bounty hunter Cad Bane was hired by Jabba and the Hutt Council to free Ziro from Republic custody. They feared that if he remained incarcerated, Ziro might divulge sensitive information to the Republic\u2014a holo-journal record of illegal activities conducted by the Hutt Council members. Bane recruited a team of bounty hunters, infiltrated the Senate Building on Coruscant, and took a group of senators hostage, including Padm\u00e9 Amidala. In order to secure the safety of the captive senators, Chancellor Palpatine was forced to issue a pardon for Ziro, releasing him from the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The raid appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars film which was released on August 15, 2008, but was first depicted a month prior in two young reader books based upon the movie.
