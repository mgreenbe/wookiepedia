After defending a hill for three months, the Imperial forces were running low on supplies and were fighting in hard conditions. At that time, explosions began to shake the ground, and HJ-377 went mad, thinking it was the rebels. However, it was in fact Imperial dropships coming to assist the Imperials by bringing reinforcements, ammunition, medical droids, and food.
