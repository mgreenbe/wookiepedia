During his reign, the Shreeftut began having dreams of a cloaked Human: Emperor Palpatine, contacting him through the Force. Palpatine had discovered the Ssi-ruuk during a Force-meditation and was attempting to negotiate with the Ssi-ruuk. In exchange for the ceding of a small number of planets in the Outer Rim, the Shreeftut agreed to give the Emperor information on the entechment process, as well as information on their droid fighters. With the death of Emperor Palpatine at the Battle of Endor, the Shreeftut ordered an invasion of Bakura. However, the invasion was repulsed, and the fleet was soon recalled, as Lwhekk was under attack by the Chiss\u2014or the Household Phalanx of Grand Admiral Thrawn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
