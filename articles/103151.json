At eight years old, like all Dowutin children, he was kicked out of his nest. He nearly died the day he left after being attacked by a beast from his planet. That night he nearly died from the fever brought by his wounds and fantasized about killing and eating the creature. He soon would relish in his victory over his would-be killer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eyta later travelled to the nearest spaceport where he stowed away on a departing ship. He held a blade to the two pilots and ate them soon after. Eyta joined the Nihil, a group of anarchist pirates during its early days. He eventually became became a Tempest Runner whose Tempest was considered to be thinkers and flamboyant. This drew disgust and was considered contradictory by Nihil of other Tempests, especially by his fellow Runner Kassav Milliko."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Great Disaster"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 232 BBY, Eyta and his Tempest were assisted by the others in a raid on Ab Dalis after the Great Hyperspace Disaster. He then lead a feast at the Great Hall of the Nihil in No-Space to celebrate this raid. After congratulating the Nihil he ordered Zagyar, a Storm in Lourna Dee's Tempest who was blamed for partially screwing up the raid, to explain himself. It is unknown if Zagyar was punished or another Nihil. Afterward, the Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro summoned the other Runners and asked them to stop raiding until the Galactic Republic reopened the hyperspace routes. Pan Eyta was concerned for his Tempest but reluctantly agreed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "New leadership"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Eye and the Tempest Runners reunited in order to discuss what to do after Kassav Milliko accidentally destroyed Eriadu's inhabited moon. Pan Eyta was intimidated by Ro's attack on Milliko in a display of dominance. The Dowutin quickly fell in line with his new leader and unprofessionally asked Ro about what he wants Eyta to do much to the former's surprise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Kur the surviving Nihil gathered to the Great Hall. Marchion Ro gave a speech and demonstration on Milliko's Tempest's \"sacrifice\" that he had engineered which moved Eyta and the rest of the Nihil. Pan Eyta then took off his mask with the rest of the organization in an act of solidarity with their new leader."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Frustration and Defiance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a failed attack by Sarn Starbreaker, a Cloud from Eyta's own Temptest, on the Cyclor Shipyards, the Dowutin staged a public argument with Ro regarding the Nihil's recent inactivity following the Great Disaster. Ro eventually caught Eyta in a trap, and assured members of the Nihil assembled at the Grizal camp that their time would come."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eyta then joined the massive Nihil force that attacked the Republic Fair on Valo. Eyta remained on board the Elegencia during the attack, attacking ships in orbit and laying down a devastating final bow towards the end of the battle. He then ordered his forces to leave shortly after, leaving his fellow Tempest Runners and their forces to fend for themselves on the surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the successful attack, Eyta once again came to conflict with the Eye, who once again caught him in a trap, this time with a poisonous blade. He was given an antidote by Lourna Dee, who told him that she agreed with his frustrations with Ro's leadership. Dee told the Dowutin that another attack on the Cyclor Shipyards would catch the Republic off balance and vulnerable. Eyta agreed with this move, and moved to attack the shipyards alongside Dee's Temptest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving at Cyclor, the Temptest Runner was greeted by a large Republic and Jedi task force. Moreover, he discovered that Dee had sent him into this trap to rid herself of the other Temptest Runner. Eyta's temptest suffered major casualties during the ensuing battle, prompting him to make use of a secret escape ship within the Elegencia. Still wounded from Ro's poison, Eyta escaped into hyperspace dreading his return to Dowut."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pan Eyta, along with the rest of his Tempest, loved to live luxuriously and did so by wearing fancy suits and outfitting his ship, the Elegencia, with a fancy interior as well. Eyta also enjoyed visiting the opera and drinking fancy beverages such as spiced wine. Eyta and his people were considered thinkers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite enjoying luxury, Pan Eyta was no less vicious than any other Nihil and closely followed the rules of the organization. For example, he asked for permission from Lourna Dee before he dispensed justice on Zaygar because the Storm belonged to her Tempest. Eyta greatly cared for his Tempest since he was concerned for their well-being after Ro told them not to raid until the heat died down. Eyta was also shown to be very loyal to those who displayed dominance and a talent for leadership given how quick he was to follow Marchion Ro."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eyta would change as he became increasingly frustrated with Ro's leadership. He was prone to outbursts of disobedience and would commonly deride his fellow Tempest Runners. This only got worse after Ro's attempted assassinations on Eyta. The Dowutin would nonchalantly as well as personally kill any Nihil who questioned his methods. The nonstop abuse at the hands of Ro would lead to his desertion from the pirates he knew and was loyal to for over a century."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pan Eyta was dressed in a leather suit with pale turquoise lapels designed to set off of his yellow skin. Like all Nihil, he wore a mask which protected his identity and himself from the poisonous gas the Nihil frequently use. Eyta's mask has the stylized image of a Dowutin face with horns and a beard. He has a blaster pistol in a leg holster that has enough firepower to decapitate a being with a single shot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the upcoming audio drama The High Republic: Tempest Runner, Eyta will be voiced by Marc Thompson."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
