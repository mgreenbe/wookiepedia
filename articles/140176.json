During the Imperial invasion of the planet, Tarandon recommended that Decimus convert the offices of Corellia's Trade Tariff Service into a base instead of occupying the Legislature Building; Decimus followed Tarandon's advice and transformed the building into the structure known as Decimus's Rise. From the Decimus's Rise, Tarandon recruited an Imperial hero to secure a building formerly serving as the CorSec prison. Tarandon also proposed that the captured Republic Foundation Museum be converted into a celebration of Imperial culture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tarandon appeared in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
