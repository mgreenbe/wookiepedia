The spy was defeated and the attack on Dromund Kaas averted, but just as Evie began to celebrate her new life free of the Shroud, he interrupted her holocall with Darth Mortis. Leaving a double to be killed in his place, the Shroud survived and presented his parting gift to Evie. Whispering a single word - \"asunder\" - he triggered the neural scrambler secretly implanted in Evie's brain, sending her into unconsciousness. Upon awakening, Evie remained completely healthy physically, but all of her memories and personality were gone, leaving her a blank slate to be used by the Empire and preventing her from revealing any more of the Shroud's secrets.
