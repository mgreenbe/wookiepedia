Taming the wild beasts which flew to the planet from the Demon Moon of Dxun, the Beast Riders resided at the Kira Fortress and flew under the banner of Lord Modon Kira and his family. As they became stronger, the Beast Rider army flew against the city of Iziz in a conflict later known as the Beast Wars. Abducting the Princess Galia from the Royal Palace, Kira returned with her to the fortress where Galia were wed Kira's son Oron, not through force, but out of a love they both shared."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When King Ommin retook the city of Iziz after a successful raid by the Beast Raiders, the Jedi Knights Ulic Qel-Droma and Tott Doneeta were forced back to the fortress along with Kira and his bride, Galia. Fighting back against the Naddists in the city, the group eventually defeated Ommin and Oron Kira was crowned King of Onderon and leader of the Onderon Royal Family. Having brought the Freedon Nadd Uprising to an end, the Kira lineage became forever tied with the history of the planet and the fortress survived the many centuries as the historic family home of the Royal Family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As of 11 ABY, Onderon was ruled by a descendant of Kira, Modon Kira, named after his ancestor.
