Obi-Wan confronted Chewbacca, but Jedi Grand Master Yoda, who was also present, pointed out the object was a harmless toy. The sergeant then informed Obi-Wan that general Attimun, a Wookiee war hero, had arrived. The Jedi told Attimun that he needn't be scanned due to his status, however Attimun insisted all must be treated equally and so the sergeant scanned him which showed he was clean. Attimun had in fact smuggled a dismantled explosive charge launcher in and later attacked the conference speakers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wookiee sergeant first appeared in the comic Incident on Kashyyyk written by Mike W.
