Her scenes, however, were deleted from the film's final cut. Ling claimed that it was the result of her posing in the June 2005 issue of Playboy, but director George Lucas insisted that the cuts were made nearly a year prior to her posing for the magazine. Her scenes were later featured in the \"Deleted Scenes\" category on the Revenge of the Sith DVD.
