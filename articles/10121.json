The warships appeared above the Chiss homeworld and capital of Csilla from widely spaced hyperspace vectors and promptly attacked the Chiss defense platforms above the planet with their spectrum lasers. Within one minute, the Chiss Defense Force began returning fire. The attacking warships bombarded the Chiss capital city of Csaplar with missiles, but the defense platforms managed to intercept the missiles from orbit so they caused minimal damage on the surface. The Chiss warships were successfully able to destroy the invading warships within fifteen minutes of the attack's commencement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack took place on a day when the Syndicure was in full session. As a result, most of the Ascendancy's top-level Aristocra were gathered at the Cupola of Csaplar for high-level government business. The attack sufficiently frightened the Syndicure to request reinforcements from the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet at Csilla and other inner Chiss holdings, at the cost of recalling them from the border regions of the Ascendancy. Indeed, the reduction of forces at the periphery of the Ascendancy was a goal of the unknown enemy behind the attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The enemy behind the attack was really General Yiv and his Nikardun Destiny, who had launched the attack to cover up the attack on the edge of the Dioya system. This distraction was realized by Supreme General Ba'kif and Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo, though the Ascendancy blamed the Paataatus government, the force sent by the Destiny so they did not need to use their own craft. This led to a Chiss retaliation in the form of the attack on the Paataatus, but Thrawn continued his investigation into the true masterminds, leading to his discovery that the Nikardun were the true threat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the battle, Supreme General Ba'kif sent Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo, who was under treatment for injuries sustained in the Vagaari pirate operations at a medcenter on Naporar, to investigate what event might have happened that the attack on Csilla was meant to distract the Ascendancy from discovering."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From Thrawn's analysis of recordings of the attack, he surmised that the warships behind the attack were old and even \"slightly obsolete.\" Therefore, Thrawn told Ba'kif he thought the ships would not resemble the current ships being used by the enemy behind the attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack on Csilla serves as the prologue to the 2020 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising, by Timothy Zahn.
