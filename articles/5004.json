The Blankunas pretended to be rich entrepreneurs of the shipping business, wanting to hire some resourceful people to find their missing son Ree. In reality, the Blankunas had no children \u2014 Ree was involved in a plot to seize the control of crime in Ando Prime from the Hutts. The Blankunas provided their new employees with a datapad with information, which also contained a tracker so that Gamorrean mercenaries could find Ree when the independent agents did."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To cut out loose ends, the Hutts moved and renamed the Blankunas as soon as the interview was over, and cleaned out and sold the orbital mansion to Alderaanian Humans Jylle Tend and Sumda."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
