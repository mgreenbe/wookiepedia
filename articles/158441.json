As the aristocracy formed a ruling council, the Priamsta, a faction decided to eliminate the deposed monarch, brutally killing Uthorrferrell Cartha and his elder daughters, Kassen and Dullourr. The youngest daughter, Isplourrdacartha, escaped, but she herself was forced to kill her psychotic brother Harrandatha, when he tried to alert the killers to her position."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many years later, the Princess Isplourrdacartha was recalled by the penitent Priamsta to restore the monarchy and bring unity to strife-torn Eiattu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some confusion prevails over the exact structure of Uthorrferrell Cartha's family; while Plourr is said in dialogue to be the youngest of three daughters, a panel in the comic shows a younger child, younger than Prince Harran, who was in turn younger than Plourr. Either this is a younger son not mentioned in the text, or it is the child of one of her sisters\u2014the woman sitting beside the Emperor in this image may indeed be his eldest daughter, as no wife or consort is mentioned in the text, and it is said repeatedly that he and his daughters were slain by the Priamsta. This confusing situation may be related to a concern for bloodline purity in the royal family; they had apparently been genetically engineered for more than generations by \"royal life-engines\", and Plourr herself was betrothed from infancy to Count Rial Pernon, her father's first cousin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
