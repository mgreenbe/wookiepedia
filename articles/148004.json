It could provide a visual indication via a blinking green light if the item scanned was safe for consumption. It could also be set to vibrate when a poison was detected. A more expensive model was concealed in a bracelet or other piece of jewelry for maximum concealability."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
