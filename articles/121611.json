The Second Imperium had rejected the Bastion Accords signed between the New Republic and the Imperial Remnant as a sham and sought to continue fighting the New Republic. It was probably one of the shortest wars in galactic history, spanning only four important battles which were small in comparison to those in other more devastating conflicts like the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As an insurgency, the conflict was largely dominated by minor strategic raids with just one conventional battle. Though the raids were successful in their objectives of obtaining recruits and supplies, these only aroused the Jedi and the New Republic which resulted in a crushing defeat for the Second Imperium during the conflict's sole conventional battle which marked the climax of the conflict. While the insurgency was supposedly led and started by an incarnation of the late Emperor Palpatine, the conflict was actually masterminded by four Imperial Royal Guards who only sought power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Given Palpatine and the Empire's enmity towards the Jedi Order, the Second Imperium and the Shadow Academy sought to weaken and to destroy Luke Skywalker's resurgent New Jedi Order as a step towards bringing down the New Republic. Despite achieving successes in small raids against the New Republic, the Second Imperium and the Shadow Academy were effectively defeated and destroyed during a pivotal battle around and above the Jedi Praxeum on the jungle moon of Yavin 4."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Background"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The devastating Galactic Civil War had seen several important developments in galactic history including the deaths of a succession of Palpatine clones, the rise to prominence of the New Republic and a paralleling Imperial decline. Despite dogged fighting, the Galactic Empire had been reduced to a rump state consisting of a mere eight sectors known derisively as the Imperial Remnant. With the formal declaration of peace at the signing of the Bastion Accords between New Republic Chief of State Ponc Gavrisom and Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon in 19 ABY, some officers in the Imperial Remnant and \"replacement warlords\" in the Deep Core decided to take matters into their own hands, rejecting these accords as a \"sham\" and splitting off from the official Imperial Remnant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result of these factors, many Imperials longed for a return to the former glory days of the Empire. Four Imperial Royal Guards (who had formerly been Stormtroopers promoted by Admiral Daala to guardsman status) took advantage of this dissent, founding the Second Imperium. Using holograms of Palpatine, stretching from his earliest days as the Senator of Naboo to Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic to Emperor of the Empire, they impersonated him, creating a charismatic leadership figure to rally the Remnant dissenters. Blinded by their own aspirations and ambition, and given the Emperor's track-record of escaping death, many were all too eager to believe the ruse as true."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Between 19 ABY and 23 ABY, the Second Imperium grew steadily, following the path of earlier splinter movements, such as the Empire Reborn, in maintaining secrecy. Unlike the Empire Reborn, the Second Imperium discarded the old Imperial policy of humanocentrism in an attempt to maximize recruiting as in the case of Lowbacca. However, this proved unsuccessful and most of their members were still predominantly Human as late as 23 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among those recruited to the Second Imperium was the former-Jedi and Imperial spy Brakiss, disillusioned after the defeat of Kueller in 17 ABY by Luke Skywalker and the New Republic. Brakiss was tasked with creating a new cadre of Imperial Dark Jedi Knights to counter those of Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4. He used funds appropriated by the Imperium to construct a cloaked space station called the Shadow Academy to serve as a mobile academy for his Dark Jedi. It was equipped with training facilities not only for dark Jedi, but also for stormtroopers and TIE pilots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was Brakiss's hopes that these Dark Jedi would help maintain order across the faltering remnants of the Empire. He recruited heavily from the Nightsisters of Dathomir, forming a leadership cadre consisting of a number of the witches such as Tamith Kai, Vonnda Ra, and Garowyn. Initial recruitment began on the planet Dathomir, with prospective students shipped off to the Shadow Academy to begin indoctrination and training. Recruiting candidates was a simple matter after he had helped revive the Nightsisters on the planet Dathomir under the aegis of the Great Canyon Clan. However, by 22 ABY, the flow of recruits from Dathomir started to dry up. Additionally, Brakiss's sadistic methods of rooting out weak students in his academy claimed the lives of at least six students."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 ABY, the Second Imperium was joined by the TIE pilot Qorl, who had been eking out a life on the jungle moon of Yavin 4 since the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY. Qorl was placed in charged of the growing starfighter core of the Second Imperium. He also revealed information on Skywalker's Academy gleaned from the Solo twins Jacen and Jaina when he forced them to repair his damaged TIE Fighter before escaping into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though he had already known of the existence of the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4, the fact that Skywalker was training a new, powerful generation of Jedi Knights may have been news to Brakiss. Believing that their young minds would be easier to sway than those of adults, Brakiss decided that kidnapping students from the Jedi Praxeum would help his new order of Dark Jedi to grow. With this information, a daring plan was launched to kidnap some of these students. It was hoped they would prove easy to corrupt, and their disappearance would strike fear into the New Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First Strike"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brakiss's first targets were the Solo twins due to their enormous potential as potent Force-users and their significant sociopolitical status as the children of the New Republic Chief of State Leia Organa Solo\u2014leader of the Imperium's primary enemy. Just prior to the start of the raid, the Solos and their Wookiee companion Lowbacca had embarked upon a field trip to Lando Calrissian's GemDiver Station. It is not known how the Shadow Academy discovered that the three Jedi trainees would be on the space station, which orbited the gas giant Yavin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A force of four Skipray blastboats and one modified assault shuttle was assembled under the command of Tamith Kai. When the Imperial fleet arrived at the GemDiver Station, Calrissian and the three students had returned from an expedition into the lower atmosphere of Yavin. To prevent any reinforcements from arriving, the Imperial ships set up a jamming field."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the station's alarms were sounded and the guards were on standby, the crew aboard the station were taken by surprise and had no knowledge of the intent of that fleet. Jaina Solo, drawing upon her knowledge of starship design, identified the ships in the fleet as Imperial in origin. Using their talents, the Jedi trainees sensed a dark presence in the attack force and realized that they were the ones that the attackers were after."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the attack force approached the perimeter of automated defensive satellites, the satellites opened fire on the Imperials, but their lasers were unable to penetrate the heavy armor of the blastboats. The blastboats disabled four of the satellites with their ion cannons and then destroyed them with their lasers. Meanwhile, the assault shuttle moved in on the space station and attached itself to an airlock. It then used industrial-grade Corusca gems to drill through the space station's hull."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Tamith at their helm, a force of Stormtroopers swarmed through the hole. Though GemDiver Station's security forces used lethal force in their attempt to defend the station, the stormtroopers had been ordered to keep their blaster rifles set on stun, so as not to kill or injure their quarry. Four stormtroopers were killed outright when they boarded the station. Calrissian and the students made their way to GemDiver Station's shipping chamber. It was situated behind heavy, triple-armored doors and an airlock. Calrissian left them there and stepped outside. He was later stunned."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since they had not been allowed to construct their lightsabers yet and could not find an armory in the shipping chamber, the Jedi trainees were trapped. Stormtroopers managed to cut through the doors of the shipping chamber and cut through the doors with a heavy-duty laser. The Solo twins and Lowbacca were stunned and kidnapped."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Enter the Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The three Jedi trainees, as well as Lowbacca's droid Em Teedee were kidnapped and taken to the Shadow Academy where Brakiss and Tamith Kai attempted to indoctrinate them into turning to the dark side of the Force. In the immediate aftermath of the raid on GemDiver Station, Brakiss was pleased with the results. Figuring that Skywalker would be gone looking for his missing Jedi trainees, he planned more raids on the Jedi Praxeum. However, he didn't know how right he was."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jacen and Jaina both rejected Brakiss's teachings. Tamith Kai, however, made a bit more headway with Lowbacca, due to his somewhat short-tempered nature. Another aggravating factor was the reprogramming of Em Teedee to be more loyal to the Empire. Though Em Teedee had been annoying in the first place, he was even more so when he said things like \"The Empire is your friend.\" However, Lowbacca managed to keep Tamith Kai's sadistic training methods from turning him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After regaining consciousness, Calrissian informed Luke Skywalker of the disappearance of the trainees. He noted that the attack force had used industrial grade Corusca gems to drill into GemDiver Station's hull, and noted that, in an ironic twist, that his broker was the only person who the raiders could have bought the industrial-grade gems from. When Skywalker arrived, Calrissian gave the Jedi Master an old blockade runner named Off Chance so that he could travel incognito to Borgo Prime in search of the broker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the meantime, Calrissian and Lobot attempted to find ways to improve GemDiver Station's security, one of which involved using Corusca gems to defend the station. It is not known what the other ideas were, or if any were implemented. Skywalker and Tenel Ka embarked upon a mission to find them. Due to the nature of the Corusca gem industry, they managed to track down who bought the industrial-grade Corusca gems through Calrissian's unscrupulous broker. The trail led them to the planet Dathomir, where they found that the Nightsisters had been revived."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Passing themselves off as possible recruits for these new Nightsisters, Skywalker and Tenel Ka were sent to the Shadow Academy where the missing Jedi trainees were being held. When they arrived they found Jacen, Jaina, and Lowbacca were in the process of escaping the Shadow Academy. After a confrontation with Brakiss and Tamith Kai, the Jedi stole a shuttle and made it back to Yavin 4."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the escape, he had to move the Shadow Academy immediately so that New Republic scouts that had been dispatched to find the missing trainees would not find it. He also scuttled his plans to kidnap more trainees from the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin. Instead, he would focus on recruiting disadvantaged youths to his cause."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Subverting the Enemy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the Second Imperium could launch its battle to retake the galaxy, it needed first to fill its ranks with new recruits and procure basic equipment for the construction of a battle fleet. After the kidnapping of the Solo twins and the resultant debacle, the Shadow Academy was moved to the inner Coruscant system to fulfill both of these purposes. To fulfill the former objective, Tamith Kai, Vilas\u2014her apprentice\u2014and Garowyn were sent to the undercity of Coruscant. They were charged with finding Force-sensitive youths who could be easily swayed to the dark side. Youths who were not Force-sensitive could be useful as well, for they knew their way around a planet that was considered to be the heart of the New Republic and thus could be used as spies or saboteurs. They could also be trained to become stormtroopers or TIE pilots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among those youths who had been \"recruited\" was Zekk, who had been found to be considerably powerful in the Force. After some meetings with Brakiss, Zekk would come around to his point of view that the New Republic should be eliminated with a new Second Imperium rising from the ashes. Zekk would accompany Tamith Kai, Garowyn, and Vilas to the undercity once again to recruit the Lost Ones into the Second Imperium. He gave a speech while the other three used the Force to compel the Lost Ones to listen to the speech. All was going well until Jacen Solo and Tenel Ka barged in and confronted Zekk. However, a stun blast solved that problem quite easily. The Nightsisters, and Zekk made their exit with the new recruits in tow before Jacen and Tenel Ka regained consciousness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To fulfill the latter objective, the Second Imperium managed to collect enough data to ascertain that the Adamant, a bulk cruiser that was carrying many turbolasers and hyperdrive cores, was going to make a stop at Coruscant, prior to resuming its course to Kuat Drive Yards, where the components would be used to arm and equip a new fleet of battleships for the New Republic. As the Adamant exited from hyperspace and made its way toward one of the docking zones located near one of Coruscant Space Traffic Control's space stations, it was intercepted by several Imperial short-range fighters which had seemingly appeared from nowhere."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since the New Republic had recently made peace with the Imperial Remnant during the Bastion Accords in 19 ABY, Coruscant's security forces were taken by surprise and were unable to react quickly.The group of Second Imperium fighters wasted no time in using their ion cannons to disable the Adamant's meager defenses. An Imperial Assault Shuttle piloted by Qorl then boarded the disabled vessel by using a specially modified cofferdam to cut into the hull outside the bulk cruiser's bridge. An Imperial boarding party of Stormtroopers then boarded the bridge and quickly stunned the crew which included a prominent New Republic officer\u2014Admiral Ackbar who himself was knocked out by Qorl."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the incapacitated crew loaded into an escape pod, Qorl took command of the Adamant while the stormtroopers made their way back to the assault shuttle and detached it from the Adamant. Qorl would bring the Adamant in to dock with the Shadow Academy. The unloading of its cargo began in earnest. The data regarding the Adamant's cargo was accurate and it was estimated that the Second Imperium's military strength would be doubled with the use of these components. The escape pod that contained Ackbar and the bridge crew of the Adamant was successfully retrieved. Security patrols of the Coruscant system were increased in the interest of guarding against the chance of any further Imperial attacks upon shipping that traveled to and from Coruscant . Later, a cargo shuttle named Moon Dash collided with the cloaked Shadow Academy's upper docking tower as it accelerated to hyperspace; destroying the vessel and killing her two crew\u2014Captain Narek-Ag and her co-pilot Trebor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unaware of the presence of the Shadow Academy, the New Republic's Commissioner of Trade would seize upon this incident and use it to lobby Chief of State Leia Organa Solo to divert more resources to the charting of the space debris that had surrounded Coruscant since the Galactic Civil War. Leia was skeptical of the proposal, given that the New Republic's resources were already stretched thin. Her daughter, Jaina Solo, had overheard her conversation with Han Solo regarding the subject and volunteered herself and her friend Lowbacca to chart the space debris that surrounded Coruscant. The two of them would spend a significant amount of time while charting the debris. When Peckhum visited the Solos' quarters to see if he could learn anything about his friend Zekk's disappearance, Jaina decided that it would be easier to chart the debris from the Orbital Solar Energy Transfer Satellite that Peckhum would be stationed at during a later time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There, Jaina and Lowbacca resumed their task of charting the debris. At the time, Jaina was viewing a number of captured news images of the raid on the Adamant, trying to make sense of the fact that there seemed to be no base nearby, but there were a number of short-range fighters employed in the assault. Meanwhile, Lowbacca noticed an anomalous region within a debris field that was completely free of debris. Suspicious, Jaina persuaded Peckhum to focus the satellite's mirrors upon the anomalous area of the debris field while she told her brother to tell their mother to inform Admiral Ackbar of the anomaly, and her suspicion that it was the Shadow Academy. Her suspicion turned out to be true when the mirror was focused on the anomalous area of space.

The Academy then headed to the remote and inaccessible Deep Core which remained a refuge for the remnants of the Imperial replacement warlords. These \"warlords\" remained independent of Pellaeon's Imperial Remnant and were still hostile towards the New Republic. The region had not been heavily settled due to the heavy gravitational pull of the vast numbers of stars which made hyperspace travel difficult."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Faced with the Second Imperium's recent successes against the New Republic, Jedi Master Skywalker was forced to accelerate the training of his Jedi students; commanding them to build their own lightsabers with material they themselves had obtained.

Tenel Ka was whisked away to her homeworld of Hapes in the exclusive Hapes Consortium by her grandmother, Ta'a Chume's Ambassador, Yfra. Tenel Ka was greeted by her grandmother Ta'a Chume."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Tenel Ka refused to have the prosthetic replacement her grandmother arranged for her to have attached, and sought to enhance her physical abilities along with her Jedi talents to make up. Soon after, Jacen and the others arrived and sought to comfort Tenel Ka, and confronted her over why she hadn't told them she was a princess. In response, Tenel said that she did not think they would accept her on her own merits, even though they had. After apologizing to each other, they spent time together."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unfortunately, this peace was quickly interrupted by a bomb explosion at the Fountain Palace where they were residing. The bomb had been planted by the treacherous ambassador Yfra who intended to seize power. Fearful for their lives, the Queen Mother Ta'a Chume, her granddaughter Tenel Ka and the other Jedi trainees were spirited away to the reclusive Reef Fortress on a remote island in the middle of the ocean.

Outraged, Ta'a Chume had Ambassador Yfra arrested and put on trial for plotting to murder the entire royal household.

Before the entire assembled academy, Zekk and Vilas squared off with their lightsabers in the depths of a zero-gravity combat chamber littered with rubble.
