During the reign of the Galactic Empire, the officer was part of a small Imperial task force sent to the remote planet of Gibbela to conquer the planet for the Empire. Expecting little resistance, the taskforce landed in a Sentinel-class landing craft in the middle of a native's crops. The officer and several stormtroopers disembarked the shuttle and confronted a small, weak farmer, demanding surrender from the farmer. Angered by the Imperial's intrusion, the farmer transformed into a large, claw creature and attacked the Imperial troops, killing them all."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
