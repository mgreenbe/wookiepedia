As starship technology of the time was too primitive for most starships to possess onboard navigation computers, the beacons would calculate hyperspace jumps for passing ships. They would typically be placed at the ends of hyperspace routes. When technology advanced enough for every starship to have its own navicomputer, the beacons became largely obsolete. In the early days of the Galactic Republic, beacons were used to link the Greater Seswenna and the Core Worlds. During the Imperial Era, at least one hyperspace beacon was present near the Dene Gois Cluster, and Sana Starros hoped to navigate the cluster and reach it without being noticed by the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
