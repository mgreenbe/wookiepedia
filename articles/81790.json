LPP functioned independently of restraining bolts or other additional devices. They were not a 100 percent effective safeguard, but the probability of a droid going rogue was greatly lessened with enough sophisticated LPP. Manufacturing or selling a droid without life preservation programming was illegal without special government dispensation, but enforcement was lax in the Outer Rim."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to pursue a career as a bounty hunter, 4-LOM, a rogue protocol droid, required the removal of his LPP subroutines.
