They were designed to latch onto the hulls of starships and warp the local space around them in order to prevent them jumping to hyperspace before the mine could explode. Commodore Idel deployed a pair of gravity-based mines from his Star Destroyer when trying to capture the yacht Imperialis in the Castell system after it was stolen by the smuggler Lando Calrissian and a team of thieves. The mines were destroyed by the vessel's automated defense system before they could latch on."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
