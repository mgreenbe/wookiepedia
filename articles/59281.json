Jinkins then installed the cannon in place of Nym's destroyed prosthetic arm, which had been eaten by a relix. This allowed Nym, who chose the weapon over a giant hook being affixed to his arm, to fire the cannon at will. Made from an assortment of spare parts and weapons found on the sea cutter Sunrunner, it fired bursts of explosive ammunition. Kole, Nym's first mate, referred to it as Nym's and Jinkin's \"science project.\" The weapon proved effective against Sol Sixxa's Mere pirates until Sixxa severed it with his sword, causing Nym much physical pain. It was later replaced by a more conventional metal hand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
