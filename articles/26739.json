He has stated that Steve Ditko was perhaps his favorite comic book creator growing up, and that he looked up to the artwork of artists such as Alex Toth and Russ Heath. His earliest comics work was writing Evangeline for Comico Comics in 1984, on which he worked with his then-wife, the artist Judith Hunt. His big break came one year later, when editor Larry Hama hired him to write back-up stories for Marvel Comics' The Savage Sword of Conan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1986, he began working for Eclipse Comics, writing stories in their Tales of Terror anthology, before starting work on Airboy with artist Tim Truman in July of that year.

The mini proved popular enough to spawn two sequels - The Joker's Wild (1991) and Cry of the Huntress (1992) - which led to both an on-going monthly series, and to Dixon working on Detective Comics from #644-738 through the major Batman stories KnightFall & KnightsEnd, DC One Million, Contagion, Legacy, Cataclysm and No Man's Land."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While writing multiple Punisher and Batman comics (and October 1994's Punisher/Batman crossover), he also found time to launch Team 7 for Jim Lee's WildStorm/Image and Prophet for Rob Liefeld's Extreme Studios.

He launched Way of the Rat in June 2002, Brath (March '03), The Silken Ghost (June '03) and the Pirate comic El Cazador (Oct '03), as well as editing Robert Rodi's non-Sigilverse The Crossovers. He also wrote the Ruse spin-off Archard's Agents oneshots in January and November '03 and April '04, the last released shortly before CrossGen's complete collapse forced the cancellation of all of its comics, before which Dixon wrote a single issue of Sojourn (May '04).
