The blade of this sword was described as being ebony black in color and notched along its length to give the appearance of being cruel and jagged. It was also said to be very cool to the touch and that upon closer inspection a small insignia of a dark circle could be seen on the hilt. After speaking with the spirit of the Sith Lord, Revan identified this sword as being the true blade of Ajunta Pall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
