It was owned by the Hutt, Queen Jool, who lived in a swamp below the cantina. Jool enforced a strict no-fighting rule within, and had a cybernetic eye, with which she could monitor the goings on throughout. The bartender was Finn, a no-nonsense being who would not hesitate to use deadly force to enforce the house rules. A common fixture at Rik's was the gambler Naxy Screeger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Holoscreens transmitting podracing and live dancers entertained the clientele."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 137 ABY, Cade stopped by the bar before his attempt to infiltrate the Temple of the Sith and leave Jool instructions in case he did not return: to hand over the access codes to the Mynock to Jariah and Deliah.

After seeing Cade, they hoped to intimidate him into revealing his crew's whereabouts, but failed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nautolan Jak passed Cade as he entered the bar.
