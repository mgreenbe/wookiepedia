Nayama killed numerous Jedi throughout the course of the war, but was slain in the war's final battle on Yavin 4. Bindo blamed himself for the deaths of the Jedi that Nayama killed, and blamed the Jedi Order for failing to prevent the tragedy of his wife's turn to the dark side and her death. Bindo felt that he should have been punished for his actions, and when the Jedi High Council cited circumstances and chose not to punish him, it was too much for him. He abandoned the order and became a Gray Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
