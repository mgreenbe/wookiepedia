This pilot was assaulted by the former Imperial Security Bureau agent Romwell Krass Junior, who wanted to avenge the death of his family during a New Republic attack on the Hyborean Moon. The fight was broken up by the droid Emmie who took them to Maz's dungeons. In their cages, the two continued to insult each other until Maz intervened. She told Romwell to make peace with his past. The pilot apologized and Maz allowed him to leave her castle after Romwell had first left."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 2019 reference book Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition mistakenly states that the pilot was a Resistance pilot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
