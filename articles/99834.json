In 41 ABY, Rhea was appointed to be the Master of Sith Tyro Vestara Khai after Khai had encountered a Sith Meditation Sphere named Ship. Rhea and her new apprentice served in the Tribe's armada aboard the captured warship Eternal Crusader. After the members of the Tribe sensed Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker's presence in the Force two years later, Rhea and Grand Lord Darish Vol handpicked a strike team to bring down Skywalker and recover Ship, who had abruptly left Kesh. Using Khai's unique connection to Ship, the strike team, led by Rhea, tracked the Meditation Sphere to a planet in the Maw, where they encountered Abeloth, a female being who was able to control the world's deadly flora. She agreed to help keep the Sith safe while they searched for Ship. Meanwhile, the strike team's executive officer, Yuvar Xal, was plotting to overthrow Rhea and take command of the team for himself.

Due to Rhea's foresight, however, his betrayal failed, and he was killed by Khai, who was then captured by the Skywalkers.

She was trained in the ways of the dark side of the Force with the Lost Tribe of Sith\u2014descendants of a group of Sith whose starship, the Omen, crash-landed on Kesh in 5000 BBY while attempting to deliver a shipment of Lignan crystals to Dark Lord of the Sith Naga Sadow during the Great Hyperspace War. Rhea completed her training and became a respected member of the Tribe. By 41 ABY, she had achieved the rank of Lady on the Circle of Lords, the Tribe's ruling council.

After landing in the Temple courtyard in the Takara Mountains, it spoke through the Force with a Sith Tyro named Vestara Khai. The Circle of Lords decided that since Ship's expressed purpose was to train Sith apprentices, the Sphere's interest in Khai warranted her promotion to the rank of apprentice, and Rhea was chosen to be her Master. Ship then revealed to the Tribe that the Sith Empire had been all but destroyed, and now only a few Sith remained in hiding. Soon after, Ship informed the Tribe of a Damorian S18 light freighter that was traveling from the planet Eriadu. Ship called for five Sith to be part of a strike team to attack the vessel, and Rhea and Khai were chosen, along with fellow Sith Sarasu Taalon, Ruku Myal, and Ivaar Workan. They were carried by Ship to the freighter, and the Meditation Sphere attacked it, forcing it to land. The Sith landed in order to pursue and kill the six surviving crew members, and they decided to break into two groups\u2014Rhea and Taalon in one, and Khai, Myal, and Workan in the other. Rhea and Taalon soon cornered four of the crew members, while the other Sith killed the other two. When the Sith finished their hunt, Taalon called them back to the freighter to take inventory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the mission, the Tribe began to use Ship to attack and capture more vessels in an effort to form a new armada with the purpose of conquering the galaxy for the Sith Empire.

As a result, his name was whispered through the Force to the members of the Tribe. Ship revealed to the Sith that Skywalker was the Grand Master of the Jedi Order, and posed a threat to their planned conquest of the galaxy. An emergency meeting was held in the Circle Chambers in Tahv, and Rhea and the Tribe's leader, Grand Lord Darish Vol, handpicked a strike team to be led by Rhea, with the objective of hunting down Skywalker. However, during the meeting Ship abruptly left Kesh, following a call through the Force. The strike team was then assigned to find Ship, with the task of eliminating Skywalker coming second."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rhea served as commander of the strike team aboard the Eternal Crusader, with Sith Master Yuvar Xal serving as the executive officer. They took advantage of Khai's special connection with Ship, using it to track the Meditation Sphere. Discontent arose within the ranks of the strike team, however, as Xal became displeased with Rhea's leadership, voicing his dissatisfaction that they were forced to rely on the word of her apprentice. However, the team finally tracked Ship to a planet in the Maw. There, Rhea organized a search party to be sent down to the surface to recover Ship while the Eternal Crusader remained in orbit. The search party consisted of herself, Khai, Xal, his apprentice Ahri Raas, and several other Sith, leaving the ship under the command of Sith Saber Baad Walusari, whom Rhea trusted more than Xal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before long, however, several of the Sith were killed by the planet's many deadly plants. Rhea decreed that if any of the team's members were killed they were to die quietly, and if they did so, their families back on Kesh would be commended, but if they died dishonorably, their families would be punished. Rhea and Khai hung back in the search, sending Xal, Raas, and the others ahead. Eventually, they met a being who called herself Abeloth who was able to control the world's deadly plant life, and agreed to protect the Sith during their search for Ship. Also\u2014claiming to have been marooned on the world for thirty years\u2014Abeloth agreed to return with the Sith to Kesh. In reality, however, Abeloth was the voice who had called out to Ship, and was still forcing Ship to ignore Khai's calls for him to return. The strike team's search continued fruitlessly, and as the Eternal Crusader's supplies were exhausted, Rhea finally decided to leave. Abeloth, however, argued for them to stay, but Rhea believed that returning to Kesh with Abeloth would more than make up for failing to recover Ship. Just then, however, Khai caught a glimpse of Ship, and Walusari commed Rhea to say that he had found Ship and was tracking it from the Eternal Crusader. The search party chased after the Meditation Sphere, and as they crossed a river, Rhea was dragged into a whirlpool by a siphon reed. Despite Abeloth's warning, Khai attempted to save her Master. Khai caught up with her deep beneath the waters and used her lightsaber to cut open the reed holding Rhea. Rhea then used the Force to pull them back up to the surface, where they were drawn from the water by Raas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the hunt continued in vain, more and more Sith arrived in shuttles from the Eternal Crusader to join the search party, until at last the warship no longer had any crew left aboard.

The Sith broke into the station's control room, where they confronted the Skywalkers. After a short fight, the Jedi ran for the station's hangar in an attempt to get to their starship, the Jade Shadow, covering their escape from the control room with azetal gas and blasterfire, leaving three of the attackers dead. Meanwhile, Xal, Raas, Walusari, and Khai were set up at a junction in the station. Rhea warned them that the Skywalkers were headed their way, and as Khai and Walusari threw their grenades at the Jedi, Xal and Raas pushed the grenades back at them before throwing their own stun grenades at the Skywalkers. Rhea had foreseen this betrayal, however, and had given Khai and Walusari fake grenades to throw first. Khai then killed Xal, but Raas and Walusari were subsequently eliminated by the Skywalkers, and Luke quickly captured Khai. As the Skywalkers were ambushed a third time, Khai escaped, but the Jedi defeated the other Sith and made it safely to the hangar.

Rhea and Khai, however, jumped into the turbolift and began to duel him. They scored several glancing hits on Skywalker, damaging his vac suit. The Sith pressed their advantage, but the Grand Master deflected one of Khai's blaster shots back at her foot, and he proceeded to duel with Rhea, using the Force to keep Khai from maneuvering to attack him. Behind Luke, the exit panel on the lift finally opened to the hangar, and Ben\u2014in the Jade Shadow\u2014opened fire on Ship. The Sith were distracted by the sudden light, and the visors on their vac suits darkened, temporarily hindering their vision.

The Jedi were soon accosted by a Sith fleet under the command of High Lord Sarasu Taalon, who convinced them to form an alliance for a mission to defeat Abeloth. Khai's father, the Sith Saber Gavar, was allowed to board the Jade Shadow to speak privately with his daughter; and he confided in her that he, too, grieved over Rhea's death.

Rhea was known to be a strict teacher; however, she had a soft spot for her apprentice. On the planet to which they tracked Ship in the Maw, Khai grew frustrated with Rhea for failing to see how critical their situation was, and Rhea noted that such disrespect was something that apprentices never lived to do twice. She listened to Khai, however, and, realizing her apprentice was correct, spared her life.
