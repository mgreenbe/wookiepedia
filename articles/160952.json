When unrolled, it was held by two handgrips between which a display screen gleamed, and flipping through files was achieved by tapping controls. When not in use, the vidscroll could be rolled up. By the time of the Galactic Empire, vidscrolls were considered obsolete technology. Despite that, the Oktarian Mayvlin Trillick still owned one, which she put to good use during her adventures on Ushruu with the Wookiee Chewbacca and the Rebel droid K-2SO."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
