During the attack, Blit, one of Zagyar's Strikes, miscalculated a harpoon shot she fired at one of the convoy's six freighters, striking a fuel tank. This caused the freighter to explode, depriving the Nihil of its cargo and killing most of Zagyar's crew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath, the Tempest Runner Pan Eyta, who had been in command of the raid, held a banquet at the Great Hall of the Nihil in No-Space to celebrate. However, the rules by which the Nihil lived and divided their prizes required \"payment\" for the loss of the freighter, and Eyta had Zagyar called forward to explain what had happened. After Zagyar explained Blit's mistake, the assembled Nihil began howling for blood, and as a result, one of his crew was thrown to their death in the space outside the Great Hall as recompense for the loss. Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro, who witnessed the events, did not at the time know which one of Zagyar's crew had paid the price because he felt such sacrifices were distasteful and a waste, and did not look."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Zagyar served as a crewmember aboard a Spider Cruiser under Ro's command which travelled to the planet Trymant IV during an Emergence to pick up Tromak, a member of the Elders of the Path whom Ro wanted to acquire some information for him. However, a battle broke out between the Nihil and a group of Jedi who had arrived to provide aid. In the chaos, Tromak and Krix Kamerat, a young member of his sect who he had claimed was his assistant so he would be brought along, were hustled aboard the cruiser. Kamerat's friend Zeen Mrala, who was Force-sensitive, something against the sect's rules, asked Jedi Master Yoda to rescue her friend from the Nihil. Ro decided to leave, but Zagyar informed him that the approaching Jedi had somehow vanished."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zagyar was a male individual. When asked to explain the loss of a targeted starship during a raid in front of the assembled ranks of the Nihil, he did not dissemble or panic, coolly stating the events. He did not, however, appear to agree with the Nihil custom of sacrificing a member of a crew which had erred during raids, stating that he believed that Blit had already paid the price for the mistake because she had been killed. Zagyar wore a mask with large, curling horns over the ears and eyes which were thin white slits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
