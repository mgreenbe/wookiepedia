It could attain a maximum speed of 1,600 kph and accelerate at 1000G with its sail, and 30G if utilizing its backup repulsor engines. Additionally, it contained a Class 1.5 hyperdrive and featured 84 narrow tractor/repulsor beams for defense, and had enough room to hold ten people. Count Dooku instructed the Geonosians to add a solar energy-collecting sail to allow the ship to fly without fuel. When the sail deployed, the absorbed energy pulled the ship through space at sublight speeds. Continuing the aesthetic of other Geonosian vessels, the ship featured two bow prongs that extended beyond the cockpit orb. A single FA-4 pilot droid flew the craft while Count Dooku enjoyed an onboard databook library in a luxuriously decorated interior."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
