Somewhat of a troublemaker, Brayl was one of the many individuals on Gorse who came under scrutiny by the Transcept Media Solutions surveillance company. Shortly before the near-destruction of Gorse's moon Cynda in 11 BBY, Brayl became intoxicated and began harassing Zaluna Myder, an employee of Transcept Media Solutions, in the Pits area of Gorse City. Myder, who recognized Brayl from surveillance, told him to leave her alone and go home to his family. Brayl was surprised Myder knew who he was but remained undeterred, laughing at her. She then drew a blaster on the thug, causing him to stagger away and leave her alone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ketticus Brayl first appeared in A New Dawn, a novel written by John Jackson Miller and released on September 2, 2014."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
