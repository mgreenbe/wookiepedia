Because of Rivan's shy personality, no one in Rogue Squadron knew where he came from or why he fought with the Rebellion, but most assumed his parents were killed by the Empire and that he joined to get revenge. Rivan served as Rogue Squadron's rear guard, either in space or on the ground, always watching out for his squadronmates and racing to someone's rescue when needed, although his recklessness put his own life at risk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3.5 ABY, Rogue Squadron established a small temporary command base on the moon of Kile, orbiting the gas giant Zhar, in the Zhar system of the Outer Rim Territories. Rivan and the Rogues had sneaked into the system for a quick hit-and-fade mission against the Imperial Enclave on the nearby moon of Gall, where the Rebellion had learned the bounty hunter Boba Fett was holding the carbonite-encased Han Solo in preparation for delivery to the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. Rivan and the Rogues planned to attack the Imperial Enclave's naval forces in orbit over Gall to create a distraction that they hoped would buy enough time for a small team\u2014including Princess Leia Organa and Lando Calrissian in the Millennium Falcon, and the mercenary Dash Rendar, flying his starship, the Outrider\u2014to sneak in and rescue Solo from Fett."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Gall"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon the Millennium Falcon's arrival in the Zhar system, Rivan and Rogue Squadron escorted Organa and Calrissian, along with Luke Skywalker, flying in his X-wing starfighter, to the Rebels' moon base on Kile, where the group made their battle preparations. Although Skywalker temporarily joined the Rogues for the rescue mission as the thirteenth squadron member, flying as honorary Rogue Leader, they were vastly outnumbered, required to hold off two Imperial II-class Star Destroyers and their combined complement of 144 TIE starfighters. As the Rogues reached Gall and made their initial approach on the first Star Destroyer, Rivan erupted into an excited battle cry over the squadron's comm channel. Skywalker considered scolding Rivan to cut the unofficial comm chatter, but he refrained, knowing just how Rivan felt\u2014there was nothing quite like flying into combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the ensuing Battle of Gall, Rivan survived the first few waves of attacking TIE Fighters, complimenting Skywalker for his own fine performance in quickly dispatching several of the enemy, but his luck soon ran out. A TIE Fighter maneuvered its way below Rivan's X-wing starfighter and began firing at the exposed underbelly. Rivan tried to evade the attack by turning away to starboard, but he was too late. The X-wing exploded in a fiery blaze, killing Rivan instantly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rivan was the only Rogue to lose his life during what would prove to be an unsuccessful mission for the Rebellion.

Instead, Rivan treated the Rogues as his family, and he enjoyed the post-mission camaraderie of his fellow pilots, even if he listened far more than he spoke."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his duty as the squadron's rear guard, Rivan was always there to bail his friends out of trouble during combat, but he did not watch his own back as well as he should, which proved to be his undoing during the mission to Gall.
