It was headed by a group of joint Killiks/Joiners from each nest that were in turn led by Raynar Thul (UnuThul). This nest was known as the conscience of all the other nests, but in reality, the Unu was controlled by the Gorog, or the Dark Nest. Some also served as UnuThul's bodyguards, but they were killed when Luke Skywalker confronted Raynar and Lomi Plo above Tenupe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
