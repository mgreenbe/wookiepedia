They had two forms, rest and rage. In their rest form, Dazouri were short, hairless humanoids with large black eyes and vestigial horns on their upper forehead. When a Dazouri was wounded, frightened, threatened, intimidated or infuriated they transformed into their rage form. In rage form they appeared as huge hulking brutes with shaggy black fur, large claws and fangs, and horns on the forehead and cheek. In rest form they were shrewd, calculating creatures that appeared helpless but in their rage form they were homicidal maniacs that attacked everything around them. The Dazouri were native to the planet Gibbela, where they farmed native crops."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Dazouri were first mentioned in Planets of the Galaxy, Volume Three. Years later, a similar species appeared in \"The Value of Proper Intelligence to Any Successful Military Campaign is Not to Be Underestimated\", a two-page comic written by Ken Lizzl and published in Star Wars Tales 19. With respect to the Star Wars Legends continuity, Lucas Licensing regarded stories that weren't \"completely outrageous or intentionally comic\" in the first twenty issues of Star Wars Tales to be S-canon by default, until such time as they were referenced in a non-Tales source, at which point the material became C-canon. Gibbela and the events of the comic later received an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, thus raising the events to C-canon. A November 13, 2014 blog post on StarWars.com later confirmed that the species from the comic was in fact the Dazouri."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
