The Neimoidian pirate had green skin and red eyes common to the species, though a scar ran across the right eye. The pirate was on the bridge when the ship ambushed Noggox the Hutt's freighter at the Fondor Shipyards, and directed the vessel's firepower. When the Jedi Nuru Kungurama crashed the freighter onboard, the pirate informed Pundar of the infiltration. The captain then ordered the crew to abandon ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Neimoidian pirate appears in 2011's The Clone Wars: Strange Allies, a comic tie-in to the Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Secret Missions series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
