The Twi'lek Pilgrims' settlement of Kalikori village was built at the mountain's base, and Kolovish\u2014the pilgrims' original Matriarch, or leader\u2014resided in a retreat at the top of the mountain. Pilgrims and even Jedi Padawans participated in a ritual called \"The Thousand Steps\", where they ascended the mountain and lit the four signal fires along the path. If they made it to the top, they were granted an audience with Kolovish. However, the path was fraught with the native Flesh Raiders, who kept Cthon as slaves and weapons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
