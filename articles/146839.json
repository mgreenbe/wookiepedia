After the Battle of Yavin, Dabrini was part of Vladlun's gang, a minor criminal group led by Vladlun Travan. Circa 1 ABY, Dabrini and two other associates of Travan, Aztin Maru and Tiaba Charr, had earned a death mark. The bounty hunter Boba Fett therefore traveled to Rori in order to collect the bounties for the three criminals. However, after tracking them to Vladlun Travan's Hideout, Fett decided to let a spacer who was investigating the bunker do his dirty work and take out the bounty targets. Titus Dabrini was finally killed by the spacer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Titus Dabrini was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
