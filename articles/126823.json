During a meeting with Havac, the leader of the Nebula Front, the pirate Arwen Cohl stated that he would not allow Havac to use his men simply to distract the Jedi, knowing it would mean their deaths. Angered, Havac threatened Cohl, and then shot him and his allies Rella and Boiny. Rella was killed, and though Cohl and Boiny were wounded, they were able to track down Havac and kill him, though they both died afterward."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
