After losing the Outer Rim Regional Podracing Circuit to an amateur pilot, Bolt, the Trandoshan, and another Trandoshan, confronted the pilot and his team leader, Watto on the planet Bespin. When Watto attempted to talk the trio off, the Trandoshan used a stun baton to knock the Toydarian down. Before he could advance on the pilot, the other Trandoshan was knocked unconscious when the Nosaurian pilot Clegg Holdfast threw a folded DUM-series pit droid at him. Before the Trandoshan could react, he was similarly knocked down with a pit droid. Bolt drew a blaster pistol on Holdfast, but was disarmed and beaten. Bolt retreated, while the pit droids sat on the unconscious Trandoshans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
