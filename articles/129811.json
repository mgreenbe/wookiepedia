Splinter Pass was a large flat expanse of land dotted with spiked durasteel pillars and totems that were difficult to navigate. Pilots could easily lose track of where they were going and crash, and even the slightest bump from another racer could send a pilot barreling towards one of the sturdy pillars. During an intergalactic event known as the Clone Wars, the Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano was given a brief description of Splinter Pass by the Twi'lek Podracer Kidd Kareen. Tano later participated in a Maze qualifier and passed through the area while competing against other pilots, such as San Maxus and Raido. Tano, Maxus, and Kareen later passed through the area again during the actual Maze."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Splinter Pass first appeared in the comic book The Clone Wars: Crash Course, written by Henry Gilroy and illustrated by the Fillbach Brothers.
