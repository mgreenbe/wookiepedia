After the war ended the Sa Nalaor attempted to flee Republic space but ended up crashing on the planet Cholganna. Just prior to the ship crashing three Human and two Neimoidian crew members attempted to use the escape pod to avoid being caught in the accident. Whilst in the pod they received a message from the Sa Nalaor's captain, Rel Harsol, who condemned them for abandoning ship, after which they cursed the captain for bringing them to the edge of the galaxy, as well as Cratala, a passenger aboard the Sa Nalaor. The pod crashed into the surface of Cholganna at the bottom of a steep crevasse, where it half buried itself in the ground about five meters above a brackish pond. At least one Human member of the pod's crew did not survive the landing and their body was left strapped into its seat once the rest of the crew got out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many years later, during the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, the pod was heavily rusted and covered in reddish thorny vines, as well as infested with a species of green bug. Several skeletal limbs, damaged blasters, blood and scraps of Confederacy crew uniform as well as a Nexu skeleton were found around the pod, with the Nexu showing signs of having been killed by a blaster. The pod's records of the voice traffic between its crew and Harsol, its coordinates of launch and a hologram of the crew during flight, were still intact and retrievable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the pod was investigated by a group of spacers who had been hired by the tech salvage company IsoTech to find the Sa Nalaor.

It's designation of 34 besh was also written on the exterior. The pod was capable of keeping recordings of incoming and outgoing voice traffic as well as its coordinates of launch and a holographic recording of its interior during flight. There were several seats in the interior where crew could strap themselves in."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The escape pod first appeared in 2013 in Beyond the Rim, an adventure module written by Sterling Hershey for the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game, Star Wars: Edge of the Empire.
