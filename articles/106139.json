It was located near the planet's equator. Like the planet itself, there was no government or law system in place. Contrary to its name, Pleasant City was plagued by disease, as well as the dark side of the Force. Like most cities on Korbin, Pleasant City was jokingly given an upbeat name by the criminals who controlled it (such as in Happy, Joy, and Peace)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
