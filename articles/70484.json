As the project neared completion, the Empire began a series of tests in the region of space known as the Dreighton Triangle, using reports of unexplained events in the region ever since the Battle of Dreighton during the Clone Wars as a cover for their operations. Around this time, Jenn was tasked to lead a flight group of three T-65 X-wing starfighters, including one flown by Ensign Till, on a patrol mission around the Dreighton Nebula. At first the group's sensors failed to detect any signs of activity but Jenn ordered one more pass before returning to base. Moments later, a TIE Phantom decloaked behind her X-wing and opened fire, tearing the starboard S-foils from the fuselage and disabling her stabilizer. Unable to control her fighter, Jenn drifted to port and collided with Till's X-wing, destroying both fighters and killing both pilots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jenn was a professional officer who was brave, intelligent, and who possessed a good sense of humor.

Though not included in the game or its manual, the biography was adapted for use on the LucasArts website and the document was later printed in Rob Smith's Rogue Leaders: The Story of LucasArts. The version that appeared online places Jenn in her late twenties during the game whereas Lee's original version described her as \"late twenties to early thirties.\" Lee also made notes on the people he thought symbolized each character in the game, choosing actress Holly Hunter to represent Jenn. An early storyboard of the scene in which Jenn appears reveals that her flight group was originally called \"Gamma patrol,\" but the group was unnamed in the final game."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Props and costumes created for the original trilogy of Star Wars movies were used during the filming of Rebel Assault II.
