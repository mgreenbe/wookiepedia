As a teenager, Temmin could at times be moody and irreverent towards his mother Norra due to her decision to leave him to find their father and join the Rebellion. At one point, Temmin wanted to emulate the bounty hunter Jas Emari but settled on being himself at the advice of his mother. Temmin found a firm but sympathetic mentor in the form of Captain Wedge Antilles, who became his starfighter instructor. Temmin's moodiness at one point led him to flunk his starfighter classes. Antilles would eventually marry Norra. By their escape during the mission to Corellia, Temmin had come to view Antilles as his father."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Temmin was witty and quick-thinking. He managed to deactivate the computer system SOL-GDA by telling Han and Jas to disable the cord connecting it to prisoners, on whom it depended as an energy source. When Temmin found that his father Brentin was a shadow of his former self due to his experience at Ashmead's Lock, Temmin descended into a brief moody state which led him to rage at his mother and the galaxy; unfairly blaming them for his life's problems. Temmin was perceptive enough to discern that something was wrong with his father. Temmin's suspicions were proven right when he discovered that Brentin had been reprogrammed into an unwilling assassin of the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the age of sixteen, Temmin had started to grow a beard. Despite their quarrels, Temmin was devoted to his mother Norra. After Norra departed on a mission to Jakku to hunt down Grand Admiral Sloane, Temmin was determined to go back and rescue his mother. His stubbornness earned him the respect of both Han Solo and Wedge Antilles. Temmin encouraged Wedge to re-establish Phantom Squadron by appealing to Wedge's devotion to the Rebellion and past courageous acts during the Galactic Civil War. Temmin was overcome with grief after losing his best friend Mister Bones and father Brentin Lore Wexley. As a mark of respect for his fallen friend Mister Bones and good luck, Temmin carried the droid's personality template whenever he went into battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As an adult, Temmin grew a black beard and mustache and developed a pudgy physique. By 34 ABY, Temmin was regarded as an \"old-timer\" by younger Resistance pilots like Kar\u00e9 Kun. Poe regarded him as a friend and handpicked him and the rest of Black Squadron to search for Lor San Tekka. In Poe's absence, Snap took command of Black Squadron as Black Two. He cared for his fellow pilots and improvised tactics that gave them an edge over more numerous First Order TIE fighters. Temmin also developed romantic feelings for Kun and the two developed a relationship.

In his free time, Temmin Wexley liked to play the board game \"Galactic Expansion.\" He was also adept at maneuvering through drainpipes, navigating wire-mesh grates, or finding handholds in steep walls.
