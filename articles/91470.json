The mission, however, was a plot by Republic Commander Griebs Kishpaugh and Banks's fellow clone trooper, Ghost, to embroil the strategic planet and its native species, the Toma, in the war and allow both men to defect to the Confederacy. Throughout the mission, Banks lost most of his squad to both enemy droids and the treachery of Ghost. Nevertheless, Banks managed to foil the plot, killing Ghost and arresting Kishpaugh."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
