However, the player then either stabs or fire at the approaching Destha, killing the Guard and thus breaking a promise. Murthil is angered by the lying, and rallies her guards to down the Imperial. Whichever choice is taken by the player during this mission, the Selonian uprising is quelled by the Imperial strike team and all of Murthil's guards, including Destha, are killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
