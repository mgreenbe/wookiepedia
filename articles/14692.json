Luke briefly witnessed a Rebel scout ship nearby, although it disappeared immediately thereafter. The Rebel scout ship was later revealed to have belong to Vrad Dodonna, who was initially believed to have been killed during the battle. Vrad claimed that his ship ended up severely damaged, although Luke suspected that he actually dithered from battle, and then self-inflicted the damage to his ship to cover up his cowardice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
