In 1032 BBY, he was sent by Lord Odion to gather information on the Convergence Tactical Assault Vehicle being developed at the Black Fang research facility on Darkknell by rival Sith Lord Daiman, ruler of the Sith princedom known as the Daimanate. During the mission, he was overpowered by the Human Jedi Knight Kerra Holt who destroyed the datapad containing this information and stole his stealth suit, leaving him to be captured by Daiman. While in Daimanate captivity, Narsk was subjected to intensive torture and interrogation by Daiman, but refused to divulge his true employer. Thus, Daiman arranged for Narsk to be allowed to escape captivity by revealing information about a business deal involving the Quermian Sith Lord Ayanos Bactra transferring a mobile war university known as an arxeum to Gazzari. By allowing Narsk to escape, Daiman planned to lure the Bothan spy's true employer\u2014his rival Odion\u2014into a trap on Gazzari."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As planned, Narsk escaped with some \"reluctant assistance\" from his Jedi enemy Kerra and made his way back to the Odionate. Within two standard days, three rival Sith fleets assembled on Gazzari, a volcanic clouded in metallic ash. While Bactra's fleet observed the battle from space, Odion's ground forces landed only to be attacked by Daiman's forces. However, during the ensuing battle, Odion's forces gained the upper hand through the deployment of a siege tower known as the Death Spiral, which inflicted heavy casualties on Daiman's forces and destroyed the arxeum. In the middle of the battle, Narsk was contacted by his true employer\u2014matriarch Vilia\u2014who ordered the Bothan to transmit a message ordering Odion and Daiman to end their sibling rivalry and attack Bactra's forces since the Quermian Sith Lord was an outsider who had outlived his usefulness to the family. Thus, Narsk played a pivotal role in bringing about the collapse of the Bactranate, which was subsequently divided up by several Sith Lords including Odion, Daiman, Lioko, and Malakite.

Nearly every year, a new Sith Lord was taking over the planet and the Bothans always supported the new ruler without resistance. As a slave of the various successive Sith warlords, Narsk received assignments from various rulers. Once, he was harvesting rimebats from the caverns on Verdanth in a stealth suit. Later, he was tracking escapees, worked as a nonmilitary scout and as a saboteur. However, he never married nor had any children. Finally, when there was a power vacuum on the planet because two Sith Lords had destroyed each other, Narsk went into space and studied the balance of power there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the last decades of the Republic Dark Age, Narsk ended up serving under the Sith Lord Vilia Calimondra, the family matriach of a vast family of Sith warlords within the Grumani sector. Like other agents, Vilia needed him to gather information as well as to serve her grandchildren and to create challenges for them so that they are prepared for a future war against the Republic and the Jedi. From her, Narsk learned more about Sith space and the whole galaxy than most people. Due to tensions between her seven children over who would inherit a vast empire, Vilia proposed a competition known as the Charge Matrica where she would bequeath all her holdings to the heir that conquered the most territory. The Charge Matrica had begun in 1066 BBY and eventually descended into internecine fighting among Vilia's children after Xelian, the mother of Odion and Daiman, declared war on Chagras. In the end, Chagras triumphed and became the titular ruler of the Chagras Hegemony. However, Vilia still lived and maintained much of her empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 1042 BBY, Chagras was ready to challenge the Galactic Republic, which had been reduced to a rump state around the Core Worlds and Colonies. However, his death in 1040 BBY ended the shaky truce among Vilia's grandchildren who went to war with each other. This sparked the Second Charge Matrica with Vilia willfully perpetuating the conflict by encouraging her grandchildren to fight each other. She regularly held a series of bequests to resolve disputes and to distribute territories and assets to her children. Vilia was happy to maintain this status quo since it prevented the emergence of a strong claimant who could challenge her grip over family affairs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vilia also had an implant inserted into his head that enabled him to received coded transmissions while doing fieldwork. As an agent of Vilia, Narsk took up missions from several Sith Lords and his reputation grew over time. At at unknown time prior to 1032 BBY, Vilia also provided him a Cyricept Personal Concealment System, Mark VI stealth suit with an embedded tracking device. Narsk treasured this state-of-the-art stealth suit which had been developed on Coruscant, the Republic capital, and smuggled through secret networks into Vilia's empire. The Mark VI stealth suit had also been specially modified by Vilia's technicians to enable her to track Narsk's whereabouts.

For this operation, he posed as a machine tool operator from Nilash. After studying the traffic patterns and shifts of the guards, he sneaked into the facility multiple times with his stealth suit and loaded information about the ship onto his datapad. Finally, he installed a baradium thermal charger in the facility. But on leaving the building, he was chased by what he thought would be one of Daiman's Correctors on the rooftops. Narsk stole a speeder bike from the Personal Transport Assembly Shop but was eventually stopped by the Human woman who turned out to be the Jedi Kerra Holt who did not support any of the Sith Lords.

However, Daiman's Correctors were able to sense through the Force that he was lying and hiding something inside his mind. Narsk was himself interrogated by Lord Daiman who used mind-reading to discern that the Jedi woman Kerra had also infiltrated on Darkknell. Under pressure from Daiman's mental prodding, Narsk broke down and confessed that he had been near the Black Fang facility, but refused to divulge who he was working for."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After several more days of interrogating and torturing Narsk, Daiman had the Bothan suspended at the top of a large public arena in a circular gyroscopic torture wheel within the Sanctum Celestial.

Daiman and his entourage including his female Woostoid aide Uleeta were seated on a suspended platform at the center of the arena. When Narsk made a snide thought on Daiman's narcissism, Daiman sensed Narsk's thoughts and retaliated by unleashing Force lightning on the Bothan, enough to torment him but not to kill him. Daiman then taunted Narsk by telling the Bothan that if he and Kerra had intended to hurt him, they had failed to change his course.

In response, Bactra claimed to have no prior knowledge of the strike, or any recognition of the Bothan spy who had been partially responsible for the loss of the research facility. While referring to Narsk, Bactra also commented that his kind tended to meddle in things that were above them. In order to resolve the temporary weakness in the Daimanite defenses created by the loss of the testing center, Daiman requested that Bactra supply him with an arxeum, a mobile university devoted to the development of war sciences. Bactra agreed to the proposition, promising to hand over an arxeum to Daiman on the world Gazzari, in return for Bactranite forces being granted passage across Daimanite space to the world Vellas Pavo, for six weeks. Vellas Pavo was the site of mines extracting the superconductor Gadolinium, which were competing with Bactra's own superconductor interests. Daiman's aide Uleeta speculated that Bactra had planned to destroy the Vellas Pavo facilities for his own strategic interests."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout the meeting, Narsk's gyroscopic torture wheel continually rotated and slowed down at irregular intervals, causing the Bothan much discomfort. The Jedi Kerra Holt was also present during the holo-conference since she had used her newly acquired stealth suit to evade the security.

Narsk also heard Daiman discussing with Bactra his plans to visit the mobile research facility on his flagship Era Daimanos. At the end of the holo-transmission, Daiman had Narsk's prison platform lowered, and it landed on a cushion of anti-gravity force before striking the floor. Daiman then ordered his two Gamorrean sentries to move the wheel-like prison into a secluded maintenance area."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In reality, Daiman had planned to use the arxeum to lure his estranged older brother Sith Lord Odion into a trap on Gazzari. Throughout the holo-conference, Daiman had programmed Nark's gyroscopic torture wheel to slow down whenever anything important was said since Daiman had made secret arragements for Narsk to escape and leak the information back to his master Odion in order to lure him into a trap. As part of his plan, Daiman ordered his Gamorrean guards to loosen Narsk's bonds. During a subsequent military briefing session, Daiman addressed his generals and outlined his battle plans. Besides his regular military forces, Daiman also enlisted the services of several mercenary groups including the Human Jarrow Rusher, the Togorian Kr'saang, and the Toong Mak Medagazy. The specialist battalions would depart Darkknell at sunset, each making hyperspace jumps to different destinations. In four standard days, they would reassemble on Gazzari. Since Gazzari was a volcanic world shrouded in metallic ash, Daiman regarded it as a perfect site for an ambush. As part of the plan, Odion's forces would enter the Gazzari where they would be assaulted by Daiman's gun emplacements, which were hidden behind the volcanic ash. Daiman also had his flagship Era Daimanos prepared for a hyperspace jump."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Narsk encountered his Jedi adversary Kerra in the maintenance unit. When Narsk asked Kerra if she had come to return his stolen property, Kerra replied that depended on what information the Bothan told her and how quickly he disclosed it. Narsk agreed to trade the information in return for his freedom, stressing that he was not in the business of helping Jedi. Narsk quickly revealed that Daiman was going to Gazzari on his flagship. When Kerra inquired whether this trip was connected to Daiman's dealings with Bactra, Narsk only agreed to disclose this information once she had moved his gyroscopic torture wheel outside.

After taunting Narsk about his slim chances of survival down the chute, Kerra pushed the captive Bothan and his torture wheel down a long stone trough leading downwards from Daiman's palace. However, Narsk survived this fall and emerged in a junkyard. Narsk also managed to reach a spaceport where he found offworld transport on a freighter heading to a neutral planet in the Grumani sector, which was a regular destination for visitors from the Odionate. After two standard days, Narsk found his way back to the Odionate and in the presence of Lord Odion himself. While Odion was enraged at the loss of the information on the Convergence stored in his datapad, the Sith Lord spared the Bothan's life since he had succeeded in fulfilling part of the mission by destroying the Black Fang facility.

While reflecting on his dangerous mission to Darkknell en route to Gazzari, the Bothan spy realized that Daiman had spared his life to arrange for a battle with his estranged older brother Odion. Both Narsk and Daiman had realized that Odion's nihilistic beliefs meant that he savored a battle more than anything else in life. Narsk also realized that Daiman had allowed his escape to occur in order to report news of the deal over Bactra's arxeum back to Odion. Thus, Daiman hoped to lure Odion into a trap on Gazzari by using the unwitting Bothan spy as a means of accomplishing his goal of beating his estranged sibling once and for all. While Narsk suspected it was a trap, Odion was not worried since he knew that traps were a trademark tactic of his younger brother. Due to his nihilistic philosophy, Odion was willing to sacrifice the lives of his men to fulfill his goal of ending all life in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving in the Gazzari system, Odion ordered his Givin navigator, Jelcho, to search for Daiman's forces. Although they saw no trace of Daiman's fleet in the system, they did spot about a dozen of Bactra's ships near Gazzari's sun, where they could observe the events on the planet from a safe distance. Bactra had already arrived on the planet with the arxeum, which landed in the crater along with four transports filled with hundreds of students, impoverished younglings who had been recruited from the Daimanate. Although Odion knew that Bactra had just delivered the arxeum, he ordered his fleet not to fire on the Quermian's forces since he intended to attack his estranged younger brother Daiman, whom he regarded as his main rival. He also intended to track down his perennial Jedi foe: Kerra, whom he regarded as a dangerous threat to his nihilistic ambitions. After sighting Bactra's fleet, Odion contacted the Quermian, and Bactra informed him that the deal with Daiman had taken place, and that the Bactranites were no longer concerned with the fate of the arxeum. Bactra's fleet then remained in the Gazzari system, observing the battle between the Daimanites and the Odionites."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For this engagement, Odion had deployed a quarter of his own home fleet including elements of his elite Thunder Guards. During the early stages of the battle, Odion's home fleet formed an orbital perimeter around the planet and awaited the arrival of his most important weapon, a massive siege tower called the Death Spiral. Once the Death Spiral exited hyperspace behind Odion's fleet, the Sith Lord ordered his Thunder Guard units to their transports. Narsk was present on the bridge of the Sword of Ieldis where Odion had outlined his battle plan. Prior to the ground assault, Odion ordered both Narsk and Jelcho to accompany on his personal transport. While the two Odionites served the same Sith master, the Bothan Narsk detested the Givin whose entire species he regarded as physically unsightly due to the large numbers of holes in their skulls. Within the Odionate, Lord Odion had a policy of assigning individuals jobs based on their species' skills specifications; with Bothans being utilized as spies, Verpines as engineers, and Givin as navigators.

In the subseuquent fighting, Odion's forces engaged Daiman and his mercenaries, destroying all four transports and significantly damaging the arxeum. The mercenaries bombarded the Death Spiral with cannon fire, but were unable to destroy the tower, which deployed several speeder bikes, airspeeders, and walkers from its base. Unable to withstand the firepower of the Death Spiral, Daiman's mercenaries were forced to retreat and the Death Spiral inflicted heavy casualties on Daiman's mercenaries. In the midst of the fighting, Narsk's Jedi adversary Kerra resurfaced. The Jedi woman had managed to infiltrate Gazzari by stowing aboard Daiman's flagship Era Daimanos.

By then, the tide of the battle had began to turn in Daiman's favor. A fleet of Daimanate warships had emerged from hyperspace, trapping Odion's fleet within the Gazzari system. This confirmed Narsk's suspicions that the engagement with Bactra on Gazzari was a ploy to lure Odion into a trap. At that moment, Narsk received a signal from his true master, family matriarch Vilia Calimondra. The Sith Lord wished for her two grandsons Odion and Daiman to end their sibling feud and unite against Bactra, who was still observing the battle from space, and she ordered Narsk to deliver her message to them. However, the Bothan's comlink was not working due to his proximity to the Death Spiral's energy shield. Convincing Jelcho to leave him and join the battle against Daiman, Narsk made his way south of the Death Spiral, where he hoped the reception would be clearer. However, he waited to deliver the message, as both Odion and Daiman were on the battlefield, approaching each other and preparing for a duel. With both Sith Lords engrossed in the battle, the Bothan found it unlikely either of them would receive his message."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Jelcho entered the fray on a speeder bike only to be intercepted by the Jedi Kerra Holt, who had been evacuating the students aboard the transports. She used the Force to telekinetically slam the bike to the ground, knocking the Givin unconscious. Kerra then used a bandolier to secure Jelcho to the bike before jamming its accelerator and sending it into the Death Spiral's speeder bays. This created an explosion which destroyed the siege tower. While wading through the battlefield, Narsk witnessed this explosion and survived it by hiding inside a derelict airspeeder. He also discovered Kerra's presence on Gazzari but did not pursue her since he was already preoccupied with Calimondra's new maverick orders.

However, Holt and Rusher found that the planet's entire population were slaves to the Sith twins Quillan and Dromika, and as a battle broke out, they fled, kidnapping Quillan. Since Quillan was linked to a mental telepathic network which enforced a mental grip on the population, his incapacitation caused the collapse of the Dyarchy into total anarchy. The planet was then captured by Sith Lord Arkadia Calimondra, Vilia Calimondra's granddaughter and the older sister of Quillan and Dromika.

However, the Brigadier was unwilling to balance the lives of a thousand student refugees with that of one person. Still, Rusher tried to assure himself by dismissing his anxieties as not being part of his job. Narsk convinced the Brigadier that following Arkadia's orders would pose a danger to his crew by citing the developments that occurred during the Bequest. The Bothan added that they could use explosives to damage the tractor beam emitters at Calimondretta, allowing the Diligence to escape the Arkadianate.

Narsk modified the settings on Rusher's comlinks, allowing him to relay the instructions to Lubboon while evading detection from Arkadia's sensors. In return for Rusher's cooperation, Narsk paid him by giving him half of the coordinates that led to a safe hyperspace lane which ended at a jump-point in neutral space leading to the Galactic Republic. Narsk also presumably explained to Rusher that the earlier coordinates which Arkadia had presented earlier was actually a one-way death trip ending in a black hole.

Since the Bothan lacked the Force abilities and lightsaber combat skills of a Force-wielder, Narsk's weapon would consist of a remote-controlled nerve toxin pods. These nerve toxins had been harvested from Synedian alga, a flora indigenous to the planet Syned. Upon arriving on Vilia's world, he would slip out of the vessel unseen, shadowing Quillan. Once he located both Quillan and Vilia, he would activate the nerve toxins hidden in the chair; killing both targets and plunging her empire into anarchy.

The Duros mercenary had managed to smuggle the lightsaber past Arkadianate security by hiding it within the left arm of his spacesuit. Lubboon claimed that his left arm had been injured during a fall and was given permission by Arkadia to leave for the infirmary for medical treatment. Arkadia's experiences with Lubboon's clumsy antics gave her a poor impression of Rusher's mercenaries, leading her to reject their services earlier.

He explained that he wanted to help the young Jedi woman because he was working for someone opposed to Arkadia's plan and that he also needed someone to create a diversion. Since the planned assassination of Vilia would destabilize the Grumani sector's political order, she had assembled several military parties for strategic attacks on the Arkadianate's neighbors.

Kerra and Narsk were unable to free most of the other prisoners at the Impound since they had already been exposed to Chagras's Blood and succumbed to the effects of the bioweapon within minutes.

Narsk quickly realized that Arkadia had planted a fail-safe so that the nerve toxin would still be released even if Narsk failed or abandoned his assignment. When Arkadia asked Narsk what had kept him away so long, the Bothan claimed that he had to run his stealth suit through some diagnostics on the pretext that the Jedi woman had not taken care of it properly.
