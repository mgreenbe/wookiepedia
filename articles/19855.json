The enclave was destroyed in 18 BBY by Imperial forces, although the majority of the refugees escaped the planet. Several systems in the region had ties to slavery, including the Garnib, Ossel, and Brodogon systems.

With its new territory, the Bozhnee sector's boundaries extended to abut both the Senex and Juvex sectors. At least three trade routes passed through the Bozhnee sector\u2014the Velga Route, which started in the Juvex sector in the Velga system; the Anturi Reach, which connected the Senex sector to the Nothoiin Corridor; and the Belsavis Run, which connected the planet Belsavis in the Bozhnee sector to the planet Tekurr'k in the Senex sector. Stellar phenomenon in the area included the Greeb-Streebling Cluster, which was a mass of dust and protostars, and the Noopiths."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bozhnee sector contained a myriad of planets and star systems, several of which were home to sentient species. The most prominent planet was the icy world of Belsavis, which sat at the end of the Belsavis Run, and exported vine-coffee and vine-silk. Settlements on Belsavis were located in volcanic valleys, although they were sealed in domes to protect them from the frigid climate. Tens of thousands of years prior to Galactic Civil War, the Infinite Empire ruled a large portion of galaxy. Belsavis was one of the planets under their control, and the Empire established a prison on its surface that housed the most dangerous prisoners in the galaxy, secured within vaults and stasis fields. Although the Infinite Empire eventually fell, the prison remained. Around fifty years prior to the outbreak of the Great Galactic War in 3681 BBY, the Galactic Republic discovered the prison with the inmates still contained. The Republic stationed forces on the planet in an effort to contain any threat the inmates posed once the containment systems inevitably failed, and established a new Republic prison known as \"The Tomb\" on the surface. During the Great Galactic War, The Tomb was used to incarcerate captured Sith Lords, Mandalorians and Sithspawn. Although the Republic attempted to keep the location of the prison secret, Imperial Intelligence discovered the information, prompting the Sith Empire to send ground forces to the planet in an attempt to free their imprisoned brethren resulting in pitched battles being fought in and around the prison. Thousands of years later, Belsavis was home to a humanoid species known as the Mluki, and\u2014following the Great Jedi Purge in the aftermath of the Clone Wars\u2014became a temporary refuge to Jedi younglings who survived the massacre of the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two planets, Garnib and Ossel II, were originally located in the Ninth Quadrant, and were used by the Lords of the Senex-Juvex to procure slave species to be used throughout their holdings. With the forced annexation of the Quadrant by the Republic, the native species\u2014the Balinaka and the Ossans respectively\u2014came under Republic authority, although slave-breeding farms had been established on other worlds within the Senex and Juvex sectors. Garnib was another icy planet, and its main export was the highly prized, and possibly addictive, Garnib crystals. Run by the Garnib Crystal Corporation, the world was a haven for artists from all over the galaxy. Garnib was also the adopted homeworld of the Vernol, who emigrated to the planet in large numbers after their own homeworld was rendered uninhabitable. With the rise of the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, Garnib came under Imperial rule. The planets Hultomo, Mastala, and Coomputu were also located within the Garnib system. Mastala later lent its name to a DP20 frigate that served the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. Ossel II was a swampy, high-gravity world that exported syp wood. The native Ossans regularly traded the syp wood for indentured service aboard trader vessels, refusing to take any other form of credits or barter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jankok was a warm planet that was home to the Srrors'tok species.

The planet underwent a cataclysm that destroyed the planet at some time, although the Sibilaari managed to survive by building shelters in the most stable parts of their world. When the planet was destroyed, large chunks of the planet survived, many with shelters containing Sibilaari safely ensconced within.

The region had been annexed by the ruling Ancient Houses of the region in 700 BBY to provide a buffer zone against the creeping political and industrial influence emanating from the planet Eriadu that threatened to end their self-imposed isolation from the Republic. It was named the Ninth Quadrant since the original territories claimed by the Houses of the Senex-Juvex had been eight in number, four in each of the Senex and Juvex sectors. In the century following the marriage of the warlord Osted Picutorion to Princess Farasa Anturi\u2014deranged heir to one of the weaker Senex houses\u2014in 553 BBY, the Senex-Juvex region underwent several internal changes as the Houses realized that their isolationist nature had led them to fall behind the wider galaxy technologically. The alliance between Picutorion and House Anturi led them to defeat the combined forces of Houses Vandron and Petro, free the Hutlarians from slavery, and occupy the planet Karfeddion. With the so-called \"Crimson Days\" of conflict at an end, the Senex-Juvex had to deal with several crises. House Mekuun, noted for its rebellious nature, dissolved itself with the intent of reconstituting its holdings as a Republic sector and\u2014more damagingly\u2014the Republic was able to forcibly strip the Ninth Quadrant from the Senex-Juvex region, integrating it into the Bozhnee sector. However, the Houses of the Senex-Juvex still considered the Ninth Quadrant and its worlds to be part of the Mid Rim, while official listings assigned the region to the Outer Rim Territories.

When the planet was destroyed, large chunks of the crust were thrown into space, many carrying comatose Sibilaari secured within the shielded areas.

The Jedi had led the Grand Army of the Republic as its senior commanders, and the majority of Jedi were killed across the galaxy by the clone troopers that they commanded in battle, although some managed to flee into hiding. A group of refugees, mainly younglings, headed to Belsavis, where the Ho'Din Jedi Master Plett had lived for some seventy years. Despite the younglings being under Plett's protection, the Empire learned of the enclave in 18 BBY. Originally, Emperor Palpatine commissioned a battlemoon, the Eye of Palpatine, to destroy the refuge. However, the superweapon was stopped by a pair of Jedi Knights in the Moonflower Nebula. A wing of Imperial starfighters assaulted the enclave as a contingency, but the attack only caused minimal damage and the refugees were able to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the reign of the Empire, Garnib came under Imperial rule.

For the most part, the Imperial presence on the planet was low key; it was considered a safe and easy posting. Despite the Balinaka's pacifism, an anti-Imperial movement did take root on the planet. During the Galactic Civil War, these fighters attempted to assassinate Gam Rothwall\u2014an Imperial Advisor who had ordered the kidnapping and execution of several important Garnib Crystal Corporation officials\u2014during a surprise inspection tour to the world.

They had no other orifices. Sibilaari had the ability to metabolize sound to generate energy, so the areas immediately around them were completely silent. This ability also allowed them to absorb light to a limited degree, and made them sensitive to the Force. As a result, they could survive in any environment that contained either sound, light, or the Force. Their connection to the Force warned the Sibilaari about an impending threat that could have destroyed their homeworld.
