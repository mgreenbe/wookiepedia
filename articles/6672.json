It offered connections to other cities on the planet, such as Mos Eisley. Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, Luke Skywalker offered to take Obi-Wan Kenobi there before making the decision to join him on his journey to Alderaan before the murder of his aunt and uncle at the hands of the Galactic Empire. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Tusken Raiders had gathered in large enough numbers to attack the outskirts of small towns such as Anchorhead. Also, during this time, an Imperial installation, Fort Ironhand, had been erected near Anchorhead. The facility was commanded by Captain Kosh and the 68th Legion. It was destroyed prior to the Battle of Hoth by the Tatooine rebel cell. Its destruction marked the liberation of Tatooine from the control of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
