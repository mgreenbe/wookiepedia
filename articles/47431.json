Fef's thick atmosphere and hot temperature contributed to its teeming variety of lifeforms, all of whom had relatively short life-spans. The Fefze, who formed intelligent group-minds (called \"swarms\") of 10 to 100 individuals, were able to digest all forms of carbon-based organic matter. Due to the abundance of food available to the Fefze and their lack of dexterous manipulative appendages, they never developed technological skills and had few exports. Fef received tourists who came to view the famed Fefze dance swarms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
