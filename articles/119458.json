Its name meant \"oasis.\" During the Clone Wars, its inhabitants wished to stay out of the conflict, though war would eventually reach the backwater planet. Although Republic forces were able to drive the Separatists from Saleucami, it became the site of an invasion and one of the final battles of the war. Jedi Master Stass Allie was killed on her BARC speeder bike by Commander Neyo at the start of the Great Jedi Purge. It was the homeworld of Sergeant Warda Gojun of the Galactic Empire's 71st GAV Battalion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Saleucami was a temperate world with a mix of environments including arid deserts and swamps."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, clone trooper Cut Lawquane and his gunship crashed on Saleucami. There, Cut deserted from the Grand Army of the Republic when the battle droids executed his fellow troopers and fled. Cut then married Suu Lawquane, made a home for them and her two children there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Confederate General Grievous and his fleet went to Saleucami along with his prisoner, Jedi Master Eeth Koth. There, Grievous awaited the arrival of Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. While Kenobi fought Grievous, Skywalker and Adi Gallia rescued Koth from Grievous's Recusant-class light destroyer. Despite Skywalker and Gallia rescuing Koth, Grievous was able to escape from his duel with Kenobi. Grievous and his forces then attempted to land, but debris from Kenobi's light cruiser caused him and his battle droids to crash-land in Saleucami's wetlands aboard escape pods."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grievous and what remained of his forces then regrouped and searched for intact escape pods. Kenobi landed several detachments of the 212th Battalion and 501st Legion to find Grievous. While Kenobi and Cody took the AT-TEs to find the escape pods, Rex and his men then took their BARC speeders through the wetlands. They then came under attack by two droid commando snipers. Rex was badly wounded and his men had to leave at the Lawquane farmstead. It was there Rex met Cut and believed that he should turn him in for desertion. However, when Cut's family and home came under attack by droid commandos, Rex decided to leave him with his family. Kenobi on the other hand, was unable to capture Grievous when he found an escape pod and made his escape.

Later during the war, the Separatists launched an invasion of Saleucami, which the smuggler Has Obitt narrowly missed. A world nominally under the Confederacy's control, it was nevertheless valuable to the Separatists, making Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine dub it a part of the Triad of Evil. When the Siege of Saleucami occurred during the Outer Rim Sieges, the lengthy campaign resulted in a Republic victory towards the end of the war.

As the Imperial Military began to lock down Saleucami, Lawquane planned to move his family off of the planet before he was discovered as a defector. The day after Rex departed, Clone Force 99 arrived. Introducing Cut to their new companions, CT-1409 \"Echo\" and Omega, Hunter wanted to learn how Cut had stayed hidden so well, as his squad were fugitives.
