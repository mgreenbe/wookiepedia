Over the subsequent millennia, the Cell of Imu became buried under the rising skyscrapers of the Petrax Quarter. At some point, however, Humat's legendary chamber was uncovered when a construction droid razed one of the tall buildings, allowing archaeologists to access the Cell of Imu and the artifacts contained within."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Humat was mentioned in the 2003 sourcebook Coruscant and the Core Worlds, which was published by Wizards of the Coast for use with the Star Wars Roleplaying Game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
