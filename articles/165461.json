Four meters long, the prototype had a flight ceiling of 50 meters and could achieve 1,300 kilometers per hour. However, usage placed the rider under unhealthy G-forces. As a result, the vehicle was never put into production. The sole prototype was sold to Blizz Pinnix, who named it Black Raptor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
