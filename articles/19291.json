It was during a boqeri that Ikree devised the basis of that religion. After the corruption of her beliefs by the ruling praefects, it is likely that the practice of boqeri faded away, as it was inconsistent with the xenophobia dogma of the state. It was still, very rarely, practiced, though many of these mendicants never returned to Nazzri. The future Jedi Qrrrl Toq rediscovered the concept of boqeri when researching the origins of his religion. He decided to follow Ikree's example and explore the galaxy. Eventually, his travels brought him to Ulda Frav, where he was convinced to join the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
