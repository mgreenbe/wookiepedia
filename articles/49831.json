When used against a darksider, Force light would weaken the darksider's connection to the Force. With the light of the Force, a Jedi could either purge or contain dark side manifestations or nexus points, whether in places, spirits, or even living persons, though sometimes to detrimental effect. By channeling the Force into withering blasts of light-side energy, the darkness can then be diminished or destroyed permanently. Force light could also be used to sever the bond between a Sith battlelord and his or her followers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Master Yaddle was known to possess this ability, having learned it when studying Jedi holocrons as head of the Librarian Assembly.
