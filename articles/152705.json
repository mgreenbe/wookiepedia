The fighter then appeared in The Mandalorian Season Two debut \"Chapter 9: The Marshal,\" which was directed by Favreau and first aired on Disney+ on October 30, 2020. The Gamorrean was played by Barry Hanley, who was credited as a stunt performer but later confirmed his and fellow stunt performer Matthew Blake Shadden's roles as the two fighters in the episode on Instagram."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gamorrean was made to be more leaner than the ones found in Jabba's Palace in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. The prop team led by property master Josh Roth made both the fighters' axes hollow aluminum with an electric mechanism to present sparks every time the two axes clashed. For the Gamorrean fight, Favreau wanted it to be similar to a Muay Thai fight to lean the atmosphere of the episode into more of a gangster movie in contrast to other themes presented throughout The Mandalorian. Stunt coordinator Ryan Watson helped direct the fighting, intending to present a strong and clumsy style in respect to other styles of fighting in the Star Wars universe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
