They were disdainful of drones and other species, and very competitive, using their armies of soldier drones and battle droids to fight each other. The drones were the lowest caste of Geonosians, born to work."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Subcastes amongst the drone population divided them further into pilots, soldiers, farmers, and so forth.
