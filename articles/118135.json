Perhaps because Tantor's mission was only a cover for his capture by the Empire in which he had lost faith, the insurrection was still ongoing when Brenn Tantor returned to the planet as a Rebel several months after his brother's assignment. Tantor freed Beri Tulon from Tarkin Detention Facility and conducted an information raid on the computer complex at Sounder Flats."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
