They're saying that Vilmarh Grahrk has gone soft, that he's working with the Jedi, that Villie has gone...legit. Our Devaronian rogue wants to set the record straight and he gives HIS somewhat jaundiced side of what has happened. The Devaronian Version, first of two parts, is a fine place for new readers to come on board as well as setting the stage for the next year of stories. Oh, and if you actually BUY his side of the story, Villie has a nice moon called Nar Shaddaa that he would LOVE to sell you!"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a Cantina on Nar Shaddaa, Vilmarh Grahrk overhears a conversation about him. Upset by rumors that he has gone soft, and even worse, that he is working for the Jedi, Villie decides to set the story straight. Villie relates the story of how his client, \"Bobo\", sought him out as an assassin to kill Jedi. Villie claimed that Bobo was after the \"secret treasure of the Jedi\", which he promised to share. Supposedly, Villie was instructed to start a war as a distraction, so that Bobo could enter the Jedi Temple in search of the secret treasure. Grahrk finds the perfect race to start the war, a non-Force-sensitive race called the Yinchorri, and decides to goad them into a war with the Republic. However, the Yinchorri council refuses to let Grahrk to dictate their actions unless he marries into one of their clans. Villie strikes a deal, and offers his nephew Olmar (who he claims is his son) in his place. After the wedding, which makes the Grahrk clan honorary members of the Yinchorri clans, Villie outlines his plan to bring the Yinchorri into the galactic community by stealing ships from the Golden Nyss Shipyards. However, after leading the assault and capture of the shipyards, their plan backfires when the Yinchorri destroy the station. Though they are warlike, it turns out they take quickly to interstellar travel, and within weeks have built a strong armada with which they attack many worlds. However, according to Villie, \"Bobo\" is not happy with Villie's actions, stating that his plan is taking too long. Villie informs Bobo that two Jedi have been sent as emissaries to talk to the Yinchorri, and that with their deaths, phase two of his plan begins."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
