However, Confederate Head of State Count Dooku, displeased with General Grievous's recent failures in the war, used a Republic homing beacon to lure the Jedi and clones to the general's castle on the third moon of Vassek as a test for Grievous.

The viceroy was kept under heavy guard by Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and Padawan Ahsoka Tano; however, Gunray was able to escape with the help of Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress and turncoat Senate Commando Captain Faro Argyus. The Confederate agents stole a Republic frigate to make their getaway, and the ship's homing beacon allowed the Republic to track the stolen cruiser.

Grievous had failed in several recent operations, resulting in Confederate defeats at the Battle of the Kaliida Nebula and the Battle of Bothawui, as well as the loss of the listening post Skytop Station. As Dooku's Sith Master, Darth Sidious, demanded more dead Jedi, Dooku decided to arrange a trap for Grievous in order to reassess the cyborg's abilities. The Sith Lord remotely deactivated the general's personal IG-100 MagnaGuard bodyguards in his castle on the third moon of Vassek and deployed the Republic tracking beacon from Gunray's stolen ship to the general's lair, seeking to lure the Jedi to the castle so that Grievous would be able to hunt them for sport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Bait for the Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fisto took his Delta-7B starfighter and his astromech droid, R6-H5, and followed the signal of the Republic beacon to the Vassek system, deep in Confederate-held space. The Jedi Master contacted Unduli and Tano at the Outer Rim Command Center, and they reported that Fisto's former Padawan, Nahdar Vebb, had also tracked the beacon to the system. Vebb had already arrived on Vassek's third moon\u2014where the beacon had been located\u2014with a shuttle and several clone troopers.

While Vebb and Fil intended to use lightsabers and thermal detonators, respectively, to forcefully open the entrance to the building, Fisto was able to find a secret switch that activated a mechanism that opened the castle's door. Approaching the sanctum overlook chamber of the castle, the Jedi and clones overheard a hologram of Gunray giving orders to a squad of B1-Series battle droids, led by a Lieutenant, from behind a high-backed chair. Unaware that Gunray was not actually present, Fisto and Vebb led the attack on the droids and were able to eliminate their opponents.

As the Jedi and clones walked through the castle, rooms opened along the way; inside the rooms were statues of Kaleesh warriors\u2014some featuring cybernetics\u2014that resembled Grievous himself. The group finally entered Grievous's secret armory and workshop, and deduced that the castle belonged to the general. While inspecting Grievous's trophy room, home to a collection of trophies from the Jedi that the general had murdered, Fisto received a report from Bel and Niner that Grievous's personal starfighter, Soulless One, was approaching the castle.

The two Jedi were forced to break the bladelock as they avoided being slashed by the extra weapons, and Fisto ordered the clones to fire their blaster rifles' cables at Grievous.

The general jumped back up, and one of the clones holding the grappling hooks was thrown backward, while the other was pulled toward Grievous. The general batted the dead clone against Fisto, forcing the Jedi Master backward, before throwing the trooper on top of Vebb.
