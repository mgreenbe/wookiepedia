Aragon\u00e9s is a delusioned Star Wars fan, who always carries a toy lightsaber and asks the Lucasfilm employees about meeting characters such as R2-D2 and Jabba the Hutt. During Aragon\u00e9s and Evanier's visit, the original Star Wars trilogy reels are being digitized for modern projectors. While Aragon\u00e9s is looking at the digitizing equipment, an independent filmmaker (who entered the building disguised as George Lucas) sabotages the electricity while installing a bomb and causes Aragon\u00e9s to be transferred into Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aragon\u00e9s then arrives at the Rebel base in Yavin 4, where he is mistaken for Biggs Darklighter. After meeting Luke Skywalker (\u201cYou are prettier than the action figures! And taller too!\u201d), he goes to a rendezvous where the Death Star attack is being arranged. Aragon\u00e9s at first is afraid and tries to escape, but his lifelong crush, Princess Leia Organa, convinces him otherwise. While checking the digitized movie, Evanier recognizes Aragon\u00e9s among the Rebel pilots, and after Aragon\u00e9s' X-wing is destroyed, Evanier tells the projector staff to shift to another scene before his friend dies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The scene shifts to Dagobah, where Aragon\u00e9s talks to Yoda before getting picked up by the Millennium Falcon. Han Solo and Chewbacca take Aragon\u00e9s to Bespin, and the trio jumps off the ship as they notice a tractor beam is attracting them to Cloud City. Han and Chewie are shot by Darth Vader who proceeds to attack Aragon\u00e9s. After the ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi contacts Aragon\u00e9s to use the \u201cFarse\u201d (\u201cNot 'The Force'! You can't use the Force! It has elevated standards!\u201d), he proceeds to use a pencil to draw funny pictures of Vader, which embarrasses the Sith and causes him to collapse. Unfortunately, this happens just as George Lucas himself is showing the digitized movie to international distributors, who proceed to complain about the film being ridiculous and get away. Security then beats Lucas as he is mistaken for the impostor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The digitizing experts decide to download Aragon\u00e9s out of the film, just as Leia is about to kiss the cartoonist during a medal ceremony. Security then notices the saboteur, who reveals a remote control, which if pressed will trigger the explosives set around Lucasfilm. Aragon\u00e9s materializes and tackles the saboteur, who is then taken by security. Aragon\u00e9s picks up the remote and accidentally presses the button, causing the entire building to blow up. Aragon\u00e9s and Evanier are fired from Dark Horse (\u201cI asked when we could work for them again.
