He spent all his spare time researching it and learning about new pilots to the sport. When he turned 18, he joined the Alderaanian military, where he trained as a pilot. He became skilled at his job and planned to become a podracer when he finished his tour of duty with the military."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following his discharge, he made his way to the Outer Rim Territories in search of his new career.

To confuse them, Impeveri placed Force illusions on three of her minions: Tot, Aeios and Naren, to make them all resemble Delos.
