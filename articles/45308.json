When Anakin Skywalker, who she still tries to turn over to her side, expresses his reluctance to serve her and points out her submissive role to Dooku, she decides that he should not attend their meeting and gets him to surrender his lightsaber before she goes to meet the Count. Once the queen is gone, and with the aid of R2-D2, Anakin gives his guards the slip and proceeds to find and liberate his Padawan Ahsoka Tano. Once it is done, he sends her out to secure their ship while he goes after the queen to question her about Obi-Wan's and Rex's whereabouts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Queen Scintel explains her ambitious plan to the Count, who is not, however, quite as impressed as she had hoped and demands instead that the Jedi be executed.

Finding himself outnumbered and outgunned without his lightsaber, Anakin picks up the dying queen and flees from the palace and onto their ship. With her last breath, Scintel returns the lightsaber to Anakin and reveals the location of Obi-Wan's prison before she dies in his arms, admitting: \u201cYou were right, Skywalker. I am a slave, just as you are.\u201d"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Kadavo prison facility, Obi-Wan and Rex are brought into the warden's command center, where Count Dooku converses with the Jedi through a holo comlink, announcing their impending execution. Just then, Anakin, Ahsoka and R2 land inside the prison, but the security systems destroy their ship and hold them up long enough for Dooku to attempt to make Anakin cease his assault, or the Togruta slaves will be put to death. Unfortunately for the villains, Anakin has thought of summoning reinforcements in the form of a Republic Star Destroyer and light cruiser and the Wolfpack under the command of Plo Koon. The prison guards scramble to repel the attack, but in the confusion Obi-Wan and Rex manage to shake off their electronic shackles and attack the warden's guards. Out of pure spite, Agruss activates the deathtrap set for the slaves in order to plunge them to their doom and then smashes the controls, rendering immediate rescue impossible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ahsoka and Anakin penetrate the facility and split up; Anakin brings down the prison's defense turrets, and Ahsoka devises a plan to have the Republic light cruiser fly underneath the deathtrap and retrieve the prisoners by having them slide down cable lines. In the command center, Obi-Wan and Rex finish off the remaining Zygerrians and Obi-Wan retrieves his lightsaber, seemingly with intent to strike down the defenseless but loathsome Agruss. The keeper sardonically reprimands him, secure in the knowledge that a Jedi cannot kill an unarmed man. Unfortunately for him, he fails to take Captain Rex, who is not bound by such laws, into account and at an implicit nod from Obi-Wan, Rex hurls a guard's electrostaff with such force that it goes right through the keeper's fat body and out the back of his chair which then goes out of control and splatters him against a console, killing Agruss. With the slaves clear, the Wolfpack opens full fire on the prison's support struts, sending the hub plummeting into the caldera and killing any remaining Zygerrian slavers still inside. Once safely aboard the Republic cruiser, Roshti expressed his thanks to Ahsoka for rescuing them, but also that with their feeling of safety shattered by this experience, and in full trust towards the Republic, that the people of Kiros will give up their neutrality and join the Republic's side."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Obi-Wan's time toiling in the slave mines, several screams and cries from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom can be heard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Queen throws down her glass after getting angry with Dooku and Atai Molec, the sound of shattering is heard, and yet when the glass is seen after Anakin enters the room, it is intact."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Anakin is cutting a hole in the door of the Kadavo facility, the position of the cut changes place several times before he finishes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The episode's Director's Cut was included in The Complete Season Four DVD."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Temple Archives feature on The Complete Season Four Blu-ray includes the deleted scene \"The Queen and Dooku.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
