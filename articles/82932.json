In 8 ABY, Domaz was assaulted by TIE bombers from the Imperial Ton-Falk-class escort carrier Kathol Protector. The attack was in retaliation for the population of Kolatill overthrowing their Imperial governor in the wake of the New Republic's liberation of the nearby planet of Kal'Shebbol. With the city devastated, Bennor began to organize relief efforts from a park that had been converted into an emergency aid station. He accepted help from the crew of the New Republic vessel FarStar\u2014who had responded to a distress call from the planet\u2014in providing medical assistance and enlisted their services to retrieve more supplies from a bombed-out hospital."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lon Bennor was a male who resided on the planet Kolatill in the Kathol sector in the Outer Rim Territories, and lived in the capital city of Domaz. In 8 ABY, the New Republic liberated the planet of Kal'Shebbol, the sector capital. As a result, the local Imperial Moff, Kentor Sarne\u2014who had set himself up as a warlord following the death of Emperor Palpatine at the Battle of Endor four years previously\u2014was forced to flee his capital with the majority of his forces. When news of the New Republic's victory at Kal'Shebbol reached the population of Kolatill, they staged a popular uprising, overthrowing and imprisoning their Imperial governor, Tetrum, and reinstating the Kolatill Council to lead them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after this act of rebellion, the Imperial Ton-Falk-class escort carrier Kathol Protector arrived in-system and used TIE bombers to assault Domaz. Bennor survived the devastation wrought on his home and immediately began to organize relief efforts from a park at the heart of the city that had been converted into an emergency aid station. He blamed the Kolatill Council for the attack, since they had publicly declared allegiance to the New Republic after being reinstated into power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Four days after the attack, the crew of the New Republic CR90 corvette FarStar arrived to assist in relief operations. Bennor was not particularly pleased to see them, as they were representatives of the government that had indirectly been the cause of the attack on Domaz. However, he did accept their assistance and medical supplies, since his priorities were saving as many lives as possible. Bennor also requested the assistance of FarStar crew members when he went to a bombed-out hospital to retrieve much needed medical supplies. With their help, he was able to overcome collapsing floors, fires, and other hazards to recover the supplies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lon Bennor cared greatly for his home city and thought nothing of volunteering his time and skills to assist it and its people in their time of need. Despite his youth, he was a capable leader, organizing relief efforts and missions to retrieve needed supplies. However, his anger and frustration at the situation affected his judgment, leading him into tense situations. Even though he was not enthusiastic about the arrival of crew members from the FarStar due to their association with the New Republic, he was not too proud to ask for their help if it assisted him in saving the lives of his fellow citizens."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lon Bennor's only appearance was in the roleplaying adventure Omens, which was written by Bill Smith and included as one of the scenarios in The DarkStryder Campaign published by West End Games in 1995. The gamemaster was not obliged to use Bennor in the adventure, but the character could be used to assist the players in roleplaying their own characters in a tense situation since Bennor was not overly friendly to the New Republic, and as a hook for a minor adventure to a bombed-out hospital."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
