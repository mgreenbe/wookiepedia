After an interrogation, one of the crewmembers of the shipyards admitted that the Resistance had arrived, but he refused to offer them any assistance. Supreme Leader Kylo Ren reminded him that simply having had contact with the Resistance was an act of treason, and thus this \"contact\" with the enemy gave Ren an excuse to formally put the shipyards under First Order control, something the \"lenient\" Empire should have done. The crewmember protested that Fondor had always been independently run, which even the Empire respected, but Ren executed him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
