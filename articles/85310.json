The ridadi, a species of star-locust, navigated by following magnetic pulses, including those emitted by a star in a system near the planet Shuraden. When the space station Starlight Beacon was launched in 232 BBY, it broadcast a signal at the same frequency as the pulses the ridadi listened to, confusing the giant insects and causing them to threaten a Ximpi city on Shuraden. Jedi Padawan Keeve Trennis discovered the problem while undergoing her Jedi Trials, with information retrieved by Jedi Master Estala Maru. Informed of the issue, Maru recalibrated the Beacon's frequency, while Trennis programmed a Jedi Vector to replicate the signal and fly into space, leading the ridadi away from Shuraden."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
