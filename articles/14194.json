Her mission was to create twenty DSD1 dwarf spider droids and 20 OG-9 homing spider droids. It sounded like a simple mission, but a Republic taskforce under the command of Jedi General Jor Drakas arrived at the platform and the mission quickly turned into a battle. However, Tann's forces were able to infiltrate the Republic base and destroyed their ships, making Jor Drakas contact reinforcements from a nearby fleet. Soon, Tann's new droid army was finished and Dooku sent Geonosian transports to ship the new forces to Tatooine and Raxus Prime before the Republic captured and reclaimed the orbital platform."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After they escaped the station, Tann sent the DSD1 dwarf spider droids, the OG-9 homing spider droids and the heavy hailfire droid along with the Geonosian army back to Raxus Prime to reserve them for the conquest of Sarapin and its defense.
