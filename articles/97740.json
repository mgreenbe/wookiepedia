He plotted with Count Dooku to bomb Coruscant in an effort to halt peace talks between the Galactic Senate and Separatist Parliament before they started. He was also secretly an agent of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the session, Senators Dod and Saam met with Card, who was upset that the bill had been unable to pass immediately. Dod cast the blame on Senator Amidala, whose interference he did not expect; although Saam suggested that someone be hired to assassinate her, Senator Dod dismissed the idea as too difficult to accomplish. Dod and Card were in agreement, however, that the business of their respective organizations was violence in this case. The Muun suggested that they bring the war directly to Coruscant to spur the Senate to pass their legislation\u2014he argued that a thousand years without a direct attack on the capital had given its residents a false sense of safety. Card contacted Count Dooku for assistance in carrying out the plot; Dooku tasked the cyborg General Grievous with overseeing the transfer of disguised demolition droids to Coruscant to wreak havoc and force the Senate to act."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the infiltration units could succeed in their mission, Amidala traveled to the Confederate capital of Raxus and convinced Separatist Senator Mina Bonteri to initiate a call for negotiations between the warring governments within the Separatist Congress, a motion supported by a majority of its senators. With the resolution passed, Dooku contacted the three conspirators on Coruscant, who were troubled by the development and wanted to know what had happened to the demolition droids' mission. The Count did not share their concern; he knew that once the droids carried out their programming, the move for peace would be halted and the war would continue. When the time came for the Republic Senate to vote on the peace initiative, the demolition units succeeded in destroying a Coruscanti power generator, knocking out power to the Senate District and setting off a series of explosions that injured many of the planet's citizens. Senator Saam used the situation to his advantage, prompting several members of the Senate\u2014including Supreme Chancellor Palpatine\u2014to call for the deregulation of the banks to secure the money necessary to finance the increase in troop production. Card briefly attended a Zygerrian Slavery Auction. He also arrested Padm\u00e9 Amidala for espionage and arrested the Core Five on charges of corruption."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Amidala's liberation, the Core Five blamed Card for his failure to prevent her from uncovering information, which proved their corruption had almost caused the bankruptcy of the Banking Clan but Card defiantly stood his ground saying on record that it was the Core Five who allowed these events to happen. In his private office, Card contacted Darth Sidious and informed him that their plan was ready. His benefactor then eased his concerns by assuring him that he would be protected."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Scipio which resulted in the death of Clovis, Nix Card ceded control of the banks to the Office of the Supreme Chancellor thus directly into the hands of Palpatine as the Sith Lord had intended from the start."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Card was voiced by Corey Burton, who also voices Separatist leader Count Dooku and Hutt crime lord Ziro Desilijic Tiure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
