This bantha appeared different from the common bantha in that it had much shorter fur, leaving its facial features and limbs distinctly visible. It also had a short, stubby tail. This bantha had been bobbed and shaven by its owner for unknown reasons, or might represent a distinct breed of bantha. Unfortunately, the Pera's bantha was accidentally shot in a fight that erupted when a number of spacers tried to prevent the borg's burial."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
