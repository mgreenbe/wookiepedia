He was a logistics expert. In 21 BBY, Sirty took part in a demonstration of a JK security droid at the T'Chuk Colliseum on Coruscant. He was quickly defeated by the JK in under forty-two seconds. Because of this brief encounter with the bio-droid, CT-96/298 recruited him as a fellow squad member on a mission to destroy the JK droids' manufacturing plants on Ord Cestus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
