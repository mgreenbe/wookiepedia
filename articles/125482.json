The Volpai sous-chef Robbs Ely used a hint of sikoroot while making a sauce to served with bantha meat at the castle of the pirate Maz Kanata shortly before his death at the hands of the BD-3000 luxury droids J'Nell and Carly. While investigating Ely's murder, the castle's head chef Strono Tuggs recognized the hint of sikoroot while sniffing a portion of the sauce that had been left as fingerprints by one of the droids on the keypad to Ely's quarters. The chef Jom Jarusch then used Robbs Ely's recipe book to create the same sauce with sikoroot during a cooking competition that Tuggs set up to catch Ely's killer, leading Tuggs to believe Jarusch was the killer when in fact the chef had simply stolen the book."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sikoroot first appeared in the short story \"A Recipe for Death\", which was written by Landry Q.
