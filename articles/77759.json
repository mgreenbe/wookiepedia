Using his ceremonial executioner's blade, Renge eliminated hundreds of his master's enemies, but soon grew fearful of the Emperor's power and tried to betray him. The Emperor turned his servant's blade upon its own wielder, breaking the sword and burying a fragment in Renge's chest. After the wounds healed, Renge was then cast into the depths of the Dark Temple on the planet Dromund Kaas with the fragment still within his body, and he died sometime between 4980 BBY and 4606 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Koval Renge was first mentioned in the Codex entry for the Blade of the Sith Executioner in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a 2011 video game released by BioWare in which Renge's skeleton and the Blade were originally slated to appear before being cut."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However the position of Sith Executioner would live on in the game as the Emperors' Wrath, a chosen executioner who only answers to the will of the Sith Emperor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
