The Task Force was on its way to rendezvous with Imperial-class Star Destroyer Grey Wolf, but Zaarin had sent the Immobilizer 418 cruiser Maelstrom, TIE Avengers and TIE/D Defenders in an attempt to destroy the task force. But the attempt was thwarted by Tan Maarek Stele. However, the task force was hopelessly behind schedule and Maarek had to stop Zaarin's attack on the convoy that the task force was supposed to arrive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
