Yularen's fleet, consisting of Invincible-class Dreadnaught Heavy Cruisers and Venator-class Star Destroyers, served as a base of operations for the raids. The raids were part of the Listehol Campaign, in which Imperial forces attempted to drive Tervig slavers, along with Zygerrian slavers and Sikurdian pirates, from the hyperlanes known as the Listehol Run and the Shaltin Tunnels. However, Tervissis was intractable, and resisted the Imperial raids. The failure of the Imperial raids at Trevissis led to the end the Listehol Campaign, and an Imperial invasion of Tervissis in 13 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle was first mentioned in The Essential Guide to Warfare, an extensive guide dedicated to the conflicts in the galaxy, written by Jason Fry and Paul R.
