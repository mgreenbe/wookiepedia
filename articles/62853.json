Throughout history, House of Panteer put more kings and queens on the Alderaanian throne than all other families (such as the House of Organa or the House of Thul) combined. For ten generations before the break of the Cold War, the crown of the Panteer had adorned the head of every ruler of Alderaan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Panteer kings and queens had traditionally been patrons of the arts, but they accepted that a lie, a betrayal or even violence could be a political necessity. During the later years of the Great Galactic War, at the time of the Sith invasion of Alderaan, the last uncontested ruler of Alderaan, a proud Panteer queen was assassinated. Her son Gaul Panteer, heir to the throne and Senator to the planet, was killed as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The resulting political instability caused the remaining noble houses to break into civil war. When rival house patriarch Bouris Ulgo declared himself king of Alderaan, House Panteer contested his rule, but were driven to hiding in the mountains. Different factions of House Panteer enlisted the assistance of the Republic and the Empire for defense and revenge. Understanding that they would be unable to reclaim the throne, House Panteer promised to support the candidate favored by the faction that succeeded in defeating Ulgo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
