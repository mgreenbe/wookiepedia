A member of the Chattza clan, he was killed when he, along with a group of other henchmen, attempted to assassinate the Jedi Knight Ki-Adi-Mundi during a skiff ride through the Jundland Wastes. The only one brave enough to face the Jedi, Hoonta boasted that he did not fear his \"magic\", but he was quickly dispatched by the Cerean Jedi. Immediately before bisecting the unfortunate mercenary, Ki-Adi-Mundi noted that his unfortunate lack of faith in the Force was only matched by his lack of skill in combat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
