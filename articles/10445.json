This planet was a member of the Association of Free Trade Worlds and only had as much government as necessary to stave off total chaos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Geography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet consisted of mostly marshes and cities where almost anything, legal or illegal, could be had for a price. Arriving visitors ran a gauntlet of gaudily lit stores known as Trader's Plaza, designed to hook new arrivals and separate them from their credits as soon as possible. With little regulation, Atzerri was a world of grandiose free market policies and utter corruption. Atzerri Air Traffic Control guided people arriving and leaving. The red-light Pemblehov District was a common hangout for drug addicts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 23 BBY, after the Battle of Antar 4, many Gotals fled to Atzerri.

Tricking Skywalker, Akanah conceived a tale that Luke's mother was located on Atzerri. In reality Akanah was searching for her father. Abandoning him in the Trader's Plaza, Akanah searched, in vain, for her father."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bored, Skywalker roamed the sprawling market, discovered the nightclub Jabba's Throne Room. In here, Skywalker was amused to find a not-so-perfect representation of the galactic gangster's intimidating headquarters.
