The route was named after the human explorers Gav and Jori Daragon who first discovered the hyperlane in 5000 BBY. The Daragon Trail ran from Koros Major, which was later renamed Empress Teta, in the Deep Core to Korriban in the Stygian Caldera of the Outer Rim. The remarkable part of this discovery was that the Daragons made it the entire way from Empress Teta to Korriban in a single, uncharted jump. It is the longest blind jump to have ever been made successfully."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A part of it later became the Carbonite Run.
