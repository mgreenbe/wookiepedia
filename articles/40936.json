Drop-brambles had poisonous barbs that could trap unsuspecting prey. When a wyvarl was caught in a drop-bramble in 44 ABY, the plant caused the reptile to ooze yellow froth from its nostrils and have violent muscle spasms. Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker saw the wyvarl and put it out of its misery by using the Force to put it to sleep and then shooting it with a blaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
