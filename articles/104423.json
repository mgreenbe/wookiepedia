It caused the unfortunate victim to laugh uncontrollably, a spell that could plague its victim forever and would temporarily affect any who went near them. Only the tears from Mount Sorrow could cure the spell. The Ewok poet, Teebo, was once affected by the spell, but was eventually cured by Mount Sorrow's tears."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
