The Cartel tried to take control of the business in planet Cularin from the Federation's hands, by exposing the Federation's unfriendly policies and by competing with them.

However, the Cartel was losing money and its tactics angered the other species allied with it. The Cartel then attempted to buy off the pirates, which at first did not work. When the Trade Federation lost the Battle of Naboo, however, many believed they would lose their trade franchise. The Cularin pirates shared in this belief, and being convinced they would not be paid, switched sides, effecting ending the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Trade Federation lost its monopoly in Cularin and was completely driven out of the system.
