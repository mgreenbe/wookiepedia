Directly after the invasion, the Trade Federation began attacking villages to subdue resistance. Two Security Force pilots destroyed the Federation droids which were attacking his village. The village elder, Rohan Wayside suggested they meet Deviss. Deviss joined the two pilots in his personal N-X Police Cruiser."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Deviss knew they could find a smuggler, Borvo the Hutt, in the mountains. They found the smuggler's transport and escorted it past attacking Federation tanks. After protecting the smuggler's base, Borvo gave the pilots new starfighters and they launched an offensive against the Trade Federation Droid Army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Deviss' wingmate Gavyn Sykes stole a gunboat to aid in liberating Federation slave camps, Deviss held back until he could proceed. After Sykes disabled the camp's anti-air defenses, Deviss performed a strafing run against a deflector shield generator and freed the rest of the prisoners. Borvo sent in transports to pick up the prisoners. The next day, after Sykes escorted more prisoners up the Andrevea River, their flight leader Captain Kael was shot down. Deviss joined in the search, although it was his wingman Lutin Hollis who ultimately located the captain's downed N-1 starfighter. With his dying breath, Kael informed the crew that Borvo had betrayed them and was going to sell the prisoners. Sykes swore revenge against the Hutt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Flanking the Hutt's position on Porso Hill, Vedd and Hollis held off opposing starfighters while Sykes engaged the mothership, destroying it.
