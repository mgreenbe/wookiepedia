Dyur was going to order him to go down to the surface of Ziost in one of the freighter's TIE fighters and kill Ben Skywalker, after fellow pilot Keldan had failed. However, it was in fact the Chev Ovvit, another Boneyard pirate, who encountered Skywalker, subsequently killed as the young Jedi brought tons of rocks crashing down on his craft. Myrat'ur most likely died when the Boneyard was attacked and possibly destroyed by Skywalker in the Sith Meditation Sphere he had used to escape the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
