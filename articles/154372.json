He infiltrated the Black Heth gang on the planet of Coruscant but was discovered and captured. The Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi was sent to rescue the informant from the construction site he was being held at. At the beginning of his infiltration, Kenobi was contacted by his Jedi Master, Qui-Gon Jinn, who cautioned the younger Jedi to not raise any alarms, as the Black Heth might kill the informant; Kenobi could monitor the informant on his comlink. Kenobi then fought his way down into the facility, eliminating the Black Heth thugs and their droids before they could set off an alarm. At the time, the Quarren was being interrogated to discover his identity. Kenobi was able to rescue the informant before his impending execution. The informant thanked the young Jedi and reported that the Black Heth was importing weapons. The two then left the facility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Quarren was referred to as a \"brave friend\" by Master Jinn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Quarren informant appears in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Obi-Wan during the game's first chapter in the mission The Informant.
