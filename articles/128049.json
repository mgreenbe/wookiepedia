Legends later claimed that Soa, leading an army that included his creations, the Annihilation Droid XRR-3 and the alchemical monster Gharj, conquered a thousand planets in his time, and he earned the title \"Infernal One.\" Among those worlds was the planet Korriban, whose native Sith he ruled. Sometime after the Sith King Adas's uprising against the Rakata, Soa and his Infernal Council of traitorous Sith were imprisoned with their army in the Eternity Vault on the planet Belsavis; legends said that it took an army of Rakata and other ancient species to stop him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Millennia later, conflict between the resurgent Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic during the Galactic War unintentionally caused Soa to reawaken. Both sides, somewhat aware of what they had awakened, sent a strike team to eliminate Soa before he regained enough power to become a threat to the entire galaxy. It is unknown which team accomplished their task. The strike team faced Soa's creations and allies, and eventually made their way to his imprisonment chamber. When they arrived, he finally broke free from his restraints and fought them, taunting them and claiming that he could not be defeated. The strike team, however, proved him wrong and finally brought an end to the Infernal One after 20,000 years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soa had an ego to match his great size and power.
