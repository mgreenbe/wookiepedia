With his help and that of several fellow officers recruited into the Alliance, Rebel military doctrine was transformed from the vague idealism it had been founded on into that of a true fighting force. Starkiller rose to become one of the highest-ranking members of the Rebel Alliance. In this time, he participated in a number of field missions with a young tactical genius named Risiev Credal.

If their expertise was needed again, they were prepared to give whatever information and analysis the commanders of the front-line fighting needed.

After his second retirement, Starkiller did not seek to return to full-time service, content to allow the next generation of officers to come into their own. His experience was nonetheless considered invaluable by the New Republic, and along with his fellow officers Starkiller's knowledge of tactics and strategy made a significant difference in the war against the reborn Palpatine.
