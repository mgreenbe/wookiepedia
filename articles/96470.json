The Nestt had a fairly short cruising range, but was a little higher than average on cargo tonnage. Its major weakness was that it was not designed to carry weapons, nor did it have surplus power for adding them later (an addition intended to keep the Empire from squashing the project). To add weapons systems required an upgrade of the power core, generally considered to be more trouble than it was worth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
