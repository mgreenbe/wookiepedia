As the fighting broke out across Mandalore, he chose to send his daughter, Satine, to the Galactic Republic capital world of Coruscant, in order to keep her safe and allow her to undergo diplomatic training. Though renowned as a powerful warlord, Kryze eventually perished in the course of the Great Clan Wars. In a move that some saw as a betrayal of his memory, his daughter Satine later joined the pacifistic New Mandalorian sect upon her return to Mandalore, becoming the faction's leader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The father of Duchess Satine Kryze was first mentioned in the 2013 young reader's book Darth Maul: Shadow Conspiracy, a tie-in to the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series, authored by Jason Fry as a novelization of the show's fifth season episodes \"Revival,\" \"Eminence,\" \"Shades of Reason,\" and \"The Lawless.\" Further mention of Kryze's father and his role in Mandalorian history came later that year, in the source booked entitled The Bounty Hunter Code: From the Files of Boba Fett, written by Fry in conjunction with Daniel Wallace and Ryder Windham."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
