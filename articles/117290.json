In 22 BBY, Ithh was on the planet Coruscant, where the Ithorian visited the Outlander Club. Ithh stood near the Gran Nic Whoma in the club, and while they were there the bounty hunter Zam Wesell entered the club, pursued by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker. Wesell attempted to attack Kenobi, but was caught by Skywalker, who then assured the club's patrons, including Ithh, that they were on Jedi business. While at the club Ithh wore a red and brown robe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ror Ithh first appeared in the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, in which the character was played by an uncredited extra.
