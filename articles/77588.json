The creatures laid dormant for extended periods of time, and were only awakened by the commands of the deceased Sith Lords' spirits or the disturbance of Graush's crystal in order to eliminate any intruders or would-be tomb robbers. The zombies' limited intelligence allowed them to wield weapons, and this attribute, coupled with their intimidating presence, ensured that few sentients prevailed during an encounter with the creatures. In 3997 BBY, self-declared Jedi Knight Exar Kun survived an encounter with the guardian zombies while exploring the Valley of the Dark Lords, as did a group of Jedi Knights and their respective Padawans nearly four millennia after Kun, during their pursuit of a galactic criminal.

As time progressed, it became apparent that these humanoids were capable of creating more of their kind through biting their victims.

Moreover, their original features were distorted depending on damage sustained during battle and by the ravages of time, as the zombies were capable of laying dormant for extended durations.

Others had observed that the zombies were little more than half-rotted husks that emanated a horrid stench and moved with an odd shuffling gait."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the metamorphosis into a zombie, the creature gained heightened visual acuity in the dark and strength superior to that of living beings. Furthermore, it was impossible to halt a zombie's advance with normal physical damage.

The creature was left with an overwhelming need to feed on the flesh of living sentient beings, although the zombie was able to dampen its appetite with bodies buried in the tombs. When presented with the opportunity to feed on living flesh, a zombie worked relentlessly to make the kill. Its limited intelligence allowed it to wield blaster pistols and thermal detonators, among other weapons, depending on its former species.

Due in part to the sheer amount of raw material available to him, Graush's experiments with Sith alchemy and magic led to his discovery of a method of reanimating these corpses, thus forming a zombie army. Furthermore, during this time, Graush, using Sith magic and the most advanced technologies, had his heart replaced with a dark side, Force-sensitive crystal jewel that was imbued with over a thousand Sith spirits. After Graush was later assassinated, the spirits of his zombie army were captured in his heart, and the crystal was buried along with Graush's mummified remains in his tomb in Korriban's Valley of Golg.

Nadd's spirit appeared at Kun's side and disclosed that Kun was seeing the remains of those who violated the will of the Dark Lords and their resting place.

Moments later, dark side energies\u2014created by magic and machines at the time of the building of the tombs\u2014whirled around the corpses, reanimating them. The zombies advanced on Kun, calling him a defiler and stating that they were the guardians of the tombs.

In 23 BBY, a group of four Jedi Knights and their respective Padawans, which included Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, were forced to battle Korriban zombies during their pursuit of galactic criminal Granta Omega. Due in part to his obsession with the Sith and his hatred of the Jedi, Omega had obtained the support of a mysterious Sith Lord in his endeavors to destroy the Jedi Order and wreak havoc within the Galactic Republic. Once the connection between the two had been discovered by the Jedi, Omega traveled to the Valley of the Dark Lords to meet with his Sith benefactor, the Jedi in pursuit. Having tracked Omega to one of the tombs, Kenobi and Skywalker, at the forefront of the search, plunged deeper into the tomb while the other Jedi were held up near the entrance. Soon, the two were assaulted by a horrific stench mere moments before the Korriban zombies lurched out of the depths of the tomb and charged. Skywalker had been momentarily stunned by the appearance of the zombies, having read about the undead but never expecting to encounter them. The Sith Lord had reawakened the zombies to guard the tombs\u2014considered to be sacred Sith ground\u2014and to defend Omega and his partner in crime, Jenna Zan Arbor. The creatures attacked the Jedi viciously with blasters and detonators.

According to the logs\u2014the time codes on the logs indicating that the first recording had been made exactly six months before the Battle of Yavin\u2014the freighter had been disabled by an Imperial scout patrol and had been forced to make a crash-landing on the planet, near the Valley of Golg. The captain of Jynni's Virtue, Naz Felyood, explored the valley in search of treasure to plunder and came across Graush's tomb. Determining that Graush's sarcophagus most likely contained great treasure, the Captain removed the Heart of Graush from its resting place. Felyood became possessed by the spirit of Dathka Graush, thereby reawakening the zombie army that was now under his control. Felyood sent the undead to lay siege to the Virtue, and, soon after, First Mate Babbnod Luroon realized that she and the remainder of the crew were unlikely to survive. Luroon ordered Deksi Fivvl, the ship's engineer, to rig the Virtue's engines to blow up the freighter. The resulting explosion destroyed the majority of the zombies laying siege to Jynni's Virtue, as well as disintegrating the vessel and crew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to finding the recordings, the Jedi researchers found a brief hand-written message believed to be penned by Naz Felyood. In the letter, Felyood recounted the destruction of the Virtue and his subsequent loss of the Heart of Graush. As such, he was no longer possessed by the spirit of Graush; however, he was cursed to wander Korriban, forever immortal, in search of the jewel. The researchers were unable to find any evidence of the Heart or the zombie army and considered the return of Graush's zombie army a threat to anyone who would have landed on the planet. Many also considered it fortunate that Emperor Palpatine\u2014the Sith Lord ruler of the Galactic Empire\u2014had never discovered the secrets to creating or reawakening the undead, thereby leaving the zombies confined to Korriban."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Notable appearances and development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Korriban zombies made their first appearance in the Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 3 comic, the third issue of the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith story arc, published by Dark Horse Comics in 1994.
