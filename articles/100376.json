They often gave the impression that their head was on upside down due to the curious positioning of their facial features and long, tapered head. Among their many curious physical attributes were two eyestalks, which emerged from either side of their head, and a lipless mouth above their four nostrils. Despite their unusual appearance, many Ongree were considered to be even-minded individuals and could be found as diplomats and negotiators throughout the galaxy. The Jedi Pablo-Jill was a member of this species, as was as Jedi Master Coleman Kcaj. The Anklebiter Brigade member Urk G'lar was also an Ongree."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
