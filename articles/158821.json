He was given this name because Thaal had the droid's vocal synthesizers removed when she bought him so that she wouldn't have to listen to him whenever he served her. Vacuum may once have been shiny gold, but since he was bought by Thaal, he had been speckled about with colors from his owner's old-fashioned palette and paint brushes in her apartment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
