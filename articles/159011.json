It was located on the planet Tatooine, southwest of the city of Anchorhead. Circa 1 ABY, Barada, Jabba the Hutt's chief mechanic, hired a spacer to investigate the bunker because he suspected the Valarian podracer pilots to cheat. The spacer was tasked to find some samples of the fuel cells and fuel dispersion tubes from Valarian's crew chiefs and mechanics. Barada eventually ordered the assassination of Doane Watki, Lady Valarian's podracer champion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
