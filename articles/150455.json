She wants the group to travel to Ryloth and convince Twi'lek Jedi Master Vhiin'Thorla to return with the heroes to the Almas Academy to take up the position of lightsaber instructor left vacant by the death of Kirlocca. The heroes travel to the Ryloth city of Bashka, and begin tracking down the Jedi Master. In the popular cantina known as the Fungus Pit, the heroes take part in a fight with a group of slavers who try and take captive a number of the cantina's barmaids. Appreciating their help, one of the barmaids, Jacynith, decides to help the heroes. Thorla is her brother, so she leads the heroes out to where he is living in the Ryloth Barrens. There, Thorla has established an enclave for freed slaves. While the heroes try to persuade Thorla to leave, the enclave is attacked by slavers who had tracked Jacynith. Together, the slavers are successfully repelled, but it is apparent that the work Thorla is doing on Ryloth is very important. Consequently, the heroes return to Cularin without the Jedi Master."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
