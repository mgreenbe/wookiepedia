At some point during the time of the Galactic Republic, a merchant set out to transport a cargo of skrannix to the Bollin Exotic Animal Emporium on the planet Cularin, and stopped en route at the city Nub Saar on the planet Genarius. However, Nub Saar was hit by a radiation storm, which mutated the skrannix and made them more aggressive.
