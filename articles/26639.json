Taking the planet gave the CIS access to the Corellian Run, as well as a world full of minerals. The CIS were expecting the Republic to strike back however, and as such created a 30 ship blockade of the planet under the command of Admiral Trench. The fleet also served the purpose of trapping Senator Bail Organa, Organa's relief mission, and cutting off supplies from the outside. The Republic did soon arrive, launching the Battle of Christophsis. The blockade engaged the Republic Navy several times throughout the battle, before the blockade was finally defeated when Republic reinforcements led by Jedi General Yoda and Admiral Wullf Yularen arrived."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Complement"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The blockade featured at least one Providence-class Dreadnought, the Invincible, which was the flagship of Admiral Trench. It was also made up of least six Lucrehulk-class Battleships, at least 23 Munificent-class star frigates and at least eight C-9979 landing crafts were deployed from the vessels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
