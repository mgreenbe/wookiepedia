Designed to load and unload ordnance systems, the droids had extensive knowledge of the material they worked with. Although most BT-series droids had stiff and business-like personalities, some developed a more cavalier and daredevil attitude when dealing with explosives. During the Galactic Civil War, some BT-series droids served with the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The BT-series ordnance droid was a very simple loader droid with a design consisting of a tapering, slab-sided, rectangular body with a five wheeled tread on two of the sides. The body was sturdily built and covered in thick, brown and silver ferroceramic armor. At the front of the BT-series had a prodturding block with a yellow sensor. Atop the body, the droid was equipped with a powerful arm that could extend up to three meters, with two broad grasping claws at the end. The droid also possessed three smaller, retractable arms mounted in its chest. These smaller arms were equipped with dexterous fingers which allowed for delicate work or tool manipulation. On the side of the main arm, the droid had its counterweight, which had a single red sensor and an antenna. BT-series droids were also equipped with a built-in toolkit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid was designed for loading, unloading and maintaining ordnance and ordnance delivery systems. It was capable of working with anything from common shoulder-fired missile launchers to sophisticated starship proton torpedo launchers. To aid in this role, the droid had a built-in ordnance loading computer programmed with an exhaustive knowledge of a variety of specialized information required to work with heavy ordnance. Most BT-series droids had stiff and businesslike attitude, especially those that received regular memory wipes. Those that did develop a personality tended to make their colleagues extremely nervous, as the droids often became cavalier and jocular, gaining a daredevil, risk-taking attitude that was especially apparent when they were dealing with explosives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The BT-series ordnance droid was constructed by Baktoid Fleet Ordnance and could be found toiling away in military hangars and motor pools.
