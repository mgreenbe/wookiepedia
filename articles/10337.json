Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi succeeded in infiltrating the factory and sabotaging its powerful force field, paving the way for a trio of Venator-class Star Destroyers under the command of Captain Trask to open fire on the facility. However, the assault was halted by the arrival of the Separatist warship Starcrusher, which destroyed the three Star Destroyers before they could attack. Jedi Jyl Somtay, piloting a T-6 shuttle, picked up Skywalker and Kenobi and escaped as Admiral Kirst ordered a tractor beam, however, the shuttle managed to enter hyperspace leaving the weapons factory undamaged."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
