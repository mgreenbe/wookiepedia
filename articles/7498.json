It was produced by the Bith-owned company, ColuChem. They developed the chemical to protect items on their planet that were installed outside of the hermetically sealed cities. It was designed to deeply penetrate materials and was difficult to be buffed out or polished off. It would dye anything it came in contact with a shade of sickly blue. It was often used to protect repulsor coils. The chemical could be applied in either gel or spray form."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
