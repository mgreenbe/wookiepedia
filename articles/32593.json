Once, a group under Cracken's command, including D'kar, were captured by lizard men and held in the hold of a stock light freighter. Scrounging in the hold netted them a positive flow detonator and a member of the group, Briggs accessed the engine system and obtained a negative power coupler. They intended to create a bomb by fusing the two together and blast a hole in the side of the ship. Lots were drawn to see who would try to detonate the jury-rigged explosive, and D'kar was chosen. The plan worked, but D'kar was killed in the explosion with the rest escaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
