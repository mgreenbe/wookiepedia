Using his tracking computer, C-3PO reports that the stolen ship was abandoned somewhere in the vicinity. Admiral Ackbar smells out their own starship under a pile of paper. C-3PO then has memories about the battles, betrayals, and other events that took place on Coruscant at the end of the Clone Wars. Shortly later, C-3PO and Ackbar are approached by an Multi-Troop Transport carrying several B1-series battle droids, who have been reprogrammed as garbage collectors. C-3PO asks whether the droids have seen R2-D2 but they deny."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While sitting nearby on a fallen statue of the Emperor, the two travelers reminisce the old days. While Ackbar talks about how he first bought the Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor Daisy Mae from a dealer, Threepio convinces him to let him continue the story about his and R2-D2's involvement in the Clone Wars. C-3PO begins with the story of how R2-D2 thwarted General Grievous and Count Dooku's plans to obtain the Galactic Republic's battle plans on Coruscant. Darth Sidious passes the secret plans to Grievous, who is shortly later ambushed by Obi-Wan Kenobi, and several Clone troopers. Grievous' ship is destroyed but he manages to commandeer Senator Bail Organa's ship.

R2-D2 then manages to broadcast a recording of Dooku and Grievous with the secret battle plans. With the Republic's safety at stake, the Jedi Council and Anakin travel to Geonosis, (and in a comedic fashion, everyone in the room jump out through the window, including Yoda). At the Separatist Council chambers, Dooku screens a recording of the stolen battle plans. However, R2 has substituted the real disc for another one showing a video of Ewoks dancing and singing to the Yub Nub song.

In the process, R2 gets stuck in the gears, causing the factory to overheat and triggering a chain reaction that destroys the Separatist factories and headquarters. R2-D2 and C-3PO escape and bring the plans back into the hands of the Republic.

While Ackbar tends to his stolen ship, 3PO asks a gatekeeper droid if he has seen R2.

Skywalker confides his unhappiness with Kenobi and the Jedi for not seeing his \"awesomeness\" before going on to discuss the name of Padm\u00e9's unborn child.

Dooku thinks that he and his master Darth Sidious will be able to defeat the Jedi together. However, Palpatine betrays Dooku and exhorts Anakin to defeat the Separatist leader. During the fighting, Dooku and Grievous are sucked out the window of the Wizard's Tower into space.

Frustrated and unhappy with his seemingly restricted lifestyle as well as though he were being treated like a child, Anakin walks angrily away from the wreckage, but is stopped by Palpatine, who sows discord between Anakin and Yoda by telling him that Yoda does not see his full potential, but he can. When Palpatine's head swivels between himself and the identity of Darth Sidious, Anakin comes to the conclusion that Palpatine is a Sith Lord. Mace Windu decides to investigate.
