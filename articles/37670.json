Upon contact with exposed skin, the gem caused extreme blinding pain, making the gem a valued device of torture. The gemstone also had the potential to release poison, should it come into contact with a victim's bloodstream. Garris Shrike wore a ring with a single such gem. In addition to this, sometimes the jewel was ground down into a powdered form, and then administered into molten metals to be formed into blades and swords. Said Devaronian edges created unendurable pain just by touching the blade to skin, and should the blade break the skin, not only would the unendurable pain last until the wound was healed, but the edge also had the chance of releasing the jewels infamous toxins into the bloodstream of an opponent."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
