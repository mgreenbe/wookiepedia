They were operated by droid brains that received orders from designated controllers, but, unlike in a slave circuit, the droid brain could make snap decisions to preserve the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The gas hauler was long and tubular and resembled a shiny metal cylinder, with engines at one end and a cockpit at the other. Auxiliary metal canisters, some as large as a starfighter, decorated the hull at odd intervals and acted as secondary storage areas for the tibanna gas. They had lines of blue and green lights on either side of the hull, which flashed at regular intervals, as a warning to other ships of the dangerous cargo that they contained."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
