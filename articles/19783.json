As they pass by a doorway, the Mandalorian and rebel operative Sabine Wren is lying in wait. Sabine distracts the stormtroopers with a yellow paint bomb and then kidnaps Leia by lassoing her. Before the guards realize that Sabine has kidnapped the Princess, she shuts the gate. The stormtroopers call for reinforcements. Inside, Sabine introduces herself and tells Princess Leia that she has been sent to \"capture\" her and to collect the data-tape. Leia tells Sabine that she has hidden the data-tape to prevent the Empire from discovering that she is working for the rebellion. The stormtroopers use an arc welder to cut through the blast door. With time running out, Leia and Sabine retrieve the data-tape from an interface unit. Leia tells Sabine that the data-tape contains the locations of several Imperial bases. Before they can escape, the two are cornered by the bounty hunter droid IG-88, who pursues them with his blaster. Sabine manages to blow up a second paint bomb which splatters IG-88 with purple paint. The two then return to the blast door and Sabine hides in a corner. The stormtroopers break in and Leia tells them to blast the bounty hunter droid. While the stormtroopers exchange fire with IG-88 and drive him into a corner, Leia and Sabine sneak outside. Sabine thanks Leia before Leia heads back to the building. Sabine tells the Princess to keep fighting on the inside while she fights on the outside. Leia responds that she hopes that one day they can fight together."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
