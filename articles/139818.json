In 1032 BBY, Gub hired a Human woman named Kerra Holt to help take care of Tan, and neither of the Sullustans realized that Holt was secretly a Jedi Knight who had infiltrated the Daimanate capital. Since he was too preoccupied with his state job of doctoring documents to show the Daimanite alphabet, Gub had delegated the tasks of tutoring his granddaughter to the Human woman. His legs had also been crippled by a vat collapse during an industrial accident during the Chagras Hegemony era. During Kerra's stay on Darkknell, the two girls shared the same room and they became close friends. Due to her undercover work as a Jedi infiltrator, Kerra was often missing for many hours.

Kerra's problems were compounded by the lack of adequate numbers of refreshers since the former liner had been designed for male Devaronians.

She praised them for helping her to bring the defeat of the former Dyarchy while deriding the late Regent Calician as the \"evil\" mastermind who had manipulated her two younger siblings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly later, they were joined by Narsk Ka'hane, the Bothan spy whom Kerra had encountered earlier on Darkknell. During this meeting, Kerra and Rusher would learn that the Bothan was an independent operator who worked for various Sith Lord. Narsk demanded the return of his stealth suit but Kerra explained that she had already give it to Tan. Kerra attempted to ask Tan to return the suit but the Sullustan girl had already gone on an official tour of Calimondretta with Trooper Lubboon. Thus, Narsk would have to wait until Rusher sent somebody else back to the Diligence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From the beginning, Tan took a personal liking towards Arkadia. Arkadia was pleased by the Sullustan girl's optimism and claimed that Calimondretta had a lot to offer her and her fellow refugees. Tan was still unaware about Arkadia's secret conspiracy to use Kerra to assassinate her grandmother Vilia Calimondra, the family matriarch. Arkadia also planned to deploy the biological agent Chagras's Blood, a nerve toxin extracted from Synedian algae, during a planned expansionist campaign. Arkadia also instructed her Twi'lek aide Warmalo to provide Rusher with food supplies for the Diligence. This ploy also succeeded in winning Rusher over. Finally, Arkadia arranged for the friendly Herglic mother Seese to take Kerra on a tour of her capital. Meanwhile, Arkadia herself would take Tan and Beadle on a tour of her capital, intending to win her guests over so that they would be willing to join her Sith regime as new subjects."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arkadia succeeded in winning Tan, Lubboon and Rusher due to her charismatic personality and her successful propaganda display. However, the Jedi Knight Kerra still distrusted the Sith Lord due to the historic animosity between the two Force Orders. Kerra also rightfully suspected that Arkadia wanted to exploit them for her own cause. During Tan's tour of the Arkadianate capital, the Sullustan girl came to admire her host's personality and her supposedly well-run and \"enlightened\" society particularly its well-run Promisoriums."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In these state-run schools, children throughout the Arkadianate were indoctrinated into becoming \"productive\" and loyal subjects of Arkadia. Tan was amazed by the wide range of subjects taught at these schools including calculus, genetics, and stellar cartography. By contrast, many children back in the Daimanate were denied access to education and were forced to work as cheap labor. The Promisoriums were a cornerstone of Arkadia's policy of continually rotating her subjects through different jobs throughout their lives. Officially, this was done to encourage flexibility and versatility among her subjects. In reality, this policy served as an insurance policy for Arkadia's rule by preventing anyone from gaining enough influence to challenge her rule."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the tour, Tan shared with Arkadia about her childhood growing up in the Daimanate. She explained that she had also been selected for a munitions training course by Industrial Heuristics and that the students would be limited to one subject for the rest of their lives. Even Arkadia was shocked by the constricted nature of Daiman's education system. At some point, the clumsy Duros Trooper Lubboon accidentally fell down an escalator that was designed for Herglics, a large cetacean species. Each of the escalator's steps were two meters-long. While Lubboon survived the fall, his forehead was grazed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the tour, Tan encountered Kerra who had also finished her tour of Calimondretta. The young Sullustan girl was excited about life in the Arkadianate and extolled the virtues of Calimondretta's education system. Due to her impoverished background growing up in the totalitarian Daimanate, Tan had little exposure to other parts of the galaxy and thus initially believed that the Arkadianate was a utopian paradise in lawless Sith Space. Kerra and Tan were both pleased by the well-run state of the Promisoriums. After returning to Patriot Hall, the teenaged Sullustan gave Arkadia a hug, which pleased the Sith Lord but caused Kerra to wince. Arkadia saw this as an opportunity to promote a favorable image of her realm by inviting Tan to tell her friends aboard the Diligence about the supposedly \"good life\" waiting for them in the Arkadianate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Tan and Kerra encountered Rusher who had finished acquiring supplies for the Diligence and had been won over by Arkadia's propaganda. In return for his services, Arkadia promoted Warmalo from being the storehouse manager to the director of metallurgical operations on Syned. Tan and Lubboon were allowed to leave on a transport heading to the Diligence which carried all the food supplies.

After allowing Kerra to attend a session of the Bequest where the Jedi Knight learned about the intricate political dynamics of the Grumani Sector, the Sith Lord Arkadia tried to recruit Kerra as assassin. She intended to assassinate her grandmother and family matriarch Vilia Calimondra in order to seize power in the sector. The plot involved Kerra couriering Quillan to Vilia's secret location and then killing the matriarch. However, Kerra refused to work for the Sith Lord and Arkadia had her imprisoned, intending to execute her. She then ordered Rusher to deliver the passengers aboard the Diligence to Patriot Hall where they would be integrated as Arkadianate subjects."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bothan spy Narsk took up the offer to courier Quillan to Vilia and then assassinate the matriarch. However, he was actually a double agent working for Vilia and received orders from the matriarch that ordered him to work against Arkadia's plot. Vilia had somehow learnt about her granddaughter's plot and sought to countermand it. Narsk managed to convince Rusher to work against Arkadia's plans by promising to give him half of the hyperspace coordinates that would lead into a jump point in neutral space. Narsk also managed to free Kerra from her prison before she could be exposed to the nerve toxin Chagras's Blood. In return for helping to create a diversion, Narsk gave Kerra the second half of the coordinates. Rusher kept to his side of the bargain by hijacking an icecrawler that had been dispatched to transport the refugees to Calimondretta. Rusher then used the vehicle to infiltrate Arkadia's capital and assault it. This created a diversion that allowed Narsk to escape with Quillan on a shuttle to Vilia's secret location."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kerra also fought with Arkadia and managed to escape, stealing the Sith Lord's prized twin-bladed lightsaber. She was rescued by Rusher who brought her back aboard the Diligence. The ship's 1,717 student passengers were also joined by about 500 Arkadianate refugees who had grown weary of Arkadia's dictatorial rule. These included the Twi'lek Warmalo, the supply clerk who had been promoted to the position of metallurgist. These defections dealt a blow to Arkadia's rhetoric that the Arkadianate was an \"enlightened Sith regime.\" Tan and many of the other students were excited by the news that the Diligence was finally heading to the Galactic Republic itself after several weeks of rough living.
