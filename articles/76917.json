The Sunstar was later destroyed during a battle against the Imperials and the Griagh near Endor shield generator bunker.

The Quorks then presented Wicket and the harvested wood as gifts to their king, Marlox. The king ordered Wicket to build a glider for him, but Wicket refused and insulted the king. Wicket was then sentenced to solitary confinement in a cell with no food or water. Left behind, Kneesaa and Teebo searched for Wicket.

The couple soon discovered the ship of the foonar-capturing invaders, and Wicket quickly climbed up the outside of the ship and observed the goings on inside. But the ship's thin viewport was not only unable to block sound waves, but it also could not withstand the weight of a small Ewok, for Wicket shattered the window and fell though it and into the ship. After a quick skirmish with the aliens, Wicket was able to escape through the window from which he came. The aliens decided that one Ewok was no threat to them, but they had underestimated Wicket Warrick. He knew all about the aliens' plans to utilize the foonars to power their \"harvester\" to cut down the trees of the forest. Wicket and Kneesaa wasted no time in hijacking the harvester machine, and while Kneesaa was fighting the alien invaders, Wicket demonstrated his technological prowess by engaging the blade and pointing the machine towards the invaders' own ship.
