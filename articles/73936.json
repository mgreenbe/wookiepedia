Later, when Daala ordered Mandalorians to besiege the Temple, Asari tried to negotiate with the Mandalorian commander, Belok Rhal. However, he simply noted that she was neither Saar nor Altamik, and shot her at point-blank range, killing her, much to the shock of the Jedi. After Asari's death, Galactic Alliance Chief of Staff Wynn Dorvan carried her body from the Temple steps after his routine lunch with Jedi Raynar Thul."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
