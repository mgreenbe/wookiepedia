The fowl had a small body, with a tail several times its length. This was divided into three, circular-tipped, central tail feathers. The bird had two, long wings, each terminating in two-digit, bald, pink claws. The body, wings, and tail were all covered in pink plumage. The species had a small, bald head, with a pink comb between its eyes. These eyes had a white sclera and black pupil, and were placed one on each side of the head. The species' beak was pink and ridged, and had an overhanging maxilla."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, four birds of this species were disturbed from grasslands when the youngling, Owen, ran away from the clone trooper Aiwha Squad shortly after the conclusion of the Battle of Garqi.
