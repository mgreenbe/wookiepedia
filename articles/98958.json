They \"nipped\" with their mouths located inside their shells, and would jump out of the water at whatever seemed to be prey to them. The nyork's main predators included the otta, the pikobi, and the blarth. Gungans also ate nyorks, usually wrapping the meat in nave leaves. Jar Jar Binks was eating a nyork when he was rescued by Qui-Gon Jinn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
