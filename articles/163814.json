The Gran Jedi Master Maks Leem took him on as her Padawan learner. One of Whie's gifts was the ability to see the future in his dreams and meditations; premonitions. At first, this frightened him, but he learned to live with it by taking to heart that the future was always in motion; nothing was set."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His homeworld, Vjun, was a barren world where poison rain fell from the sky. Whie's family was one of the wealthiest on the planet, and lived in a castle: the Ch\u00e2teau Malreaux. The better families on Vjun traditionally had very high midi-chlorian counts, which was a mark of status among them. After a trade route was set up with the Galactic Republic, the Jedi became involved, wanting to take away the Force-sensitive babies for Jedi training."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Whie's father, the Viscount, was extremely interested in the midi-chlorian phenomenon, and tried to genetically enhance natural midi-chlorians in Vjun's population. The experiment was only a partial success; the people went mad and started killing each other.

The Jedi Master selected a small group of Jedi to come along with him to Vjun. Whie was among them, as was his Master Maks Leem, fellow Padawan Scout, and her Master Jai Maruk. During the mission, Whie dreamed his own death in a vision."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Yoda confronted Count Dooku, Scout and Whie ran into Asajj Ventress. Both Padawans were captured and Scout was held by a Force-grip. Ventress, sensing Whie's feelings for Scout, tried to tempt Whie to the dark side by telling him to kiss Scout. Holding the life of Scout in her hand, she forced him to choose. Whie was in doubt, but Scout managed to say that he would make the right choice, upon which he did."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yoda was able to escape from Dooku's trap, and Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi came to the rescue. Ventress stole a shuttle and escaped. The Jedi returned to Coruscant together, but Whie couldn't tell if he would ever feel at home again in the Jedi Temple. Yoda told him that he would always be home if he could feel the Force around him."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Order 66"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Whie was one of the Padawans in the Jedi Temple during the execution of Order 66. He was sparring with Bene when Darth Vader entered the Room of a Thousand Fountains in the Temple. Whie did not survive his encounter with the newly-named Sith Lord as he charged and was cut across the chest just as he had seen in one of his dreams.
