They were very small, able to fit into the palm of an analysis droid's hand. The devices were circular in shape with green plating, and could be attached to walls to silently observe, though they were capable of producing a type of audible speech to communicate with other droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Padm\u00e9 Amidala's mysterious death in 19 BBY, the senator's former handmaiden Sab\u00e9 broke into Amidala's apartment on the planet Coruscant to gather surveillance footage, leaving a scout transmitter behind. In 3 ABY, the Sith Lord Darth Vader and his forensics droid ZED-6-7 entered the apartment and encountered the droid while looking for clues relating to the senator's death. ZED-6-7 analyzed the scout to determine whom it was working for, though the transmitter protested. The data they extracted from the droid led them to a compound on the planet Vendaxa, where they came face-to-face with Sab\u00e9."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Scout transmitters appeared in Darth Vader 1, the first issue of the comic-book series Star Wars: Darth Vader.
