At some point, the world was inhabited by the B'omarr Order. However, by the time of the Clone Wars, their castles were abandoned, though some would be converted by the Hutts into formidable strongholds. Some distance from the B'omarr monastries and the Tomb of Ziro the Hutt's father, an area of mysterious rock formations could be found on the surface of Teth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet Teth was located in the Teth system of the Baxel sector, which straddled the Outer Rim Territories and Wild Space, with Teth seated in the latter at grid square U-12 on the Standard Galactic Grid. The planet orbited its system's singular star and was orbited by two moons. On the surface was a mix of rocky ground and tangled jungle, all cast in shades of deep purple to light mauve by its atmosphere, which was comfortably breathable for Hutts, humans and other species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The trees that populated the jungles had serpentine trunks which twisted and coiled upwards, and were bedecked with thick vines. The heavy canopy turned the space beneath into a gloomy, dark place filled with the sounds of a myriad of different species, and were further obscured by the perpetual mists that cloaked the planet. Wherever there was a break in the canopy, the thick ground would cover thrives as tall rock columns thrusted upward from the lowland jungles. Carved out millennia ago by wind and water, the columns were topped by flat areas, the largest of which carried jungles of their own. Due to their elevation above the dangers of the lowland jungles, the tops of the pillars made for good sites for individual dwellings of those that made Teth their home."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of the planet's location, visits to Teth was uncommon, and was one reason why the reclusive B'omarr monastic order established a monastery on the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once colonized by monks of the B'omarr Order, their empty monasteries later fell under Hutt control."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mission to Teth"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In approximately 40 BBY, the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi were sent on a mission to Teth to investigate the possible involvement of the Hutts in the disappearance of agricultural shipments on the Triellus Trade Route. The mission proved problematic due to the poor teamwork between Jinn and Kenobi, resulting in Kenobi's capture as a hostage. Ultimately, however, Jinn was successful in scaring the Hutts away from making further attacks on the shipments, at least for the time being."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Separatist leader Count Dooku's assassin, Asajj Ventress, brought Jabba the Hutt's infant son Rotta to the abandoned B'omarr monastery after she kidnapped him from Tatooine. Several bounty hunters and two ARF troopers, one of whom was a lieutenant, followed her to the monastery. The bounty hunters were killed and their severed heads sent back to Jabba, but the two ARF troopers were able to report back to Galactic Republic forces about the whereabouts of the kidnapped child and leave unnoticed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, and Torrent Company then led a mission to rescue the Huttlet from the battle droid battalion that guarded the monastery.
