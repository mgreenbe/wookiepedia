During the battle, Screed lost his left eye to a Biskaran vibro-ax, leaving him scarred. Screed opted to have an advanced cybernetic replacement fitted in place of his missing eye, instead of a more aesthetically-pleasing prosthetic.

Screed became increasingly concerned about the growing threat of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, believing that the Jedi and various planetary forces were insufficient to protect the Republic, and that a unified military force was needed. Therefore, when the Military Creation Act, proposing the creation of a Grand Army of the Republic, was put before the Galactic Senate, Screed became one of its most outspoken supporters, and spoke passionately on the subject to HoloNet News. When the tension between the Republic and the Separatists eventually led to the outbreak of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, Screed saw the conflict as an opportunity for \"house-cleaning\" to put an end to the decadence of the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the war, Screed played an active role in the Republic's war effort.

The Victory Fleet's first assignment was far from a casual shakedown cruise, as they were dispatched to stop a Confederate fleet under Dua Ningo, which had recently broken through the Republic's blockade of the Foerost Shipyards and launched a series of attacks throughout the Galactic Core. In a campaign that would decide which side controlled the Core Worlds, Screed and Dodonna's fleet clashed with Ningo's forces in battles at Ixtlar, Alsakan, and Basilisk, before a final confrontation above Anaxes. Dodonna took his task force into battle against Ningo, suffering heavy losses but drawing the enemy commander's flagship into position for Screed to launch an ambush. Screed's forces emerged from hyperspace and launched a broadside fusillade against Ningo's Unrepentant.

Separatist forces had fled from Muunilinst and Mygeeto and joined forces with pirates and Thalassian slavers in the Ciutric sector. Based out of Axxila, Screed's fleet formed part of Crimson Dagger Command, which was charged with eliminating this threat. Screed worked closely with Imperial Army General Hurst Romodi during the campaign, and the pair developed a mutual respect while achieving victories in the Kanz, Tragan, Ciutric, Nijune, Sprizen and Quelii sectors. After Screed's forces defeated the Separatists at the Battle of Vinsoth, the Muun leadership fled to Binquaros. Screed left Romodi's ground forces to fight the Muun while he pursued a combined InterGalactic Banking Clan, Commerce Guild and Thalassian fleet to Bimmiel. Screed eliminated the Separatist fleet, but while he was engaged at Bimmiel, pirate and Mandalorian forces driven from the Salin Corridor by another Imperial task force overcame his rear guard at Botajef. Joining forces with mercenaries from Serenno, they broke Romodi's siege and fled to the Unknown Regions with their allies from Binquaros. Acting on intelligence from a pirate captain, Screed and Romodi intercepted the Separatists at Vardoss and finally defeated them.

The Western Reaches Operation captured the imagination of the Imperial citizenry, with battles at Ord Vaug, Halm, Pendaxa and Ichtor becoming famous throughout the Empire. After Holt was killed and Romodi injured during an Iska pirate ambush at Bryndar, Screed's forces defeated the pirates at Fanha.

The New Order saw the rise of Human High Culture and an increase in non-Human slavery. For a short time Screed took the Twi'lek Boc Aseca as his manservant, until Inquisitor Jerec discovered the slave was Force-sensitive and demanded that Screed hand him over for execution. He was also known to have owned at least two more Twi'lek slaves in his lifetime, and recommended the species as good slaves in a report on slavery for the Imperial Security Bureau years later. Screed was regularly invited to appear at fetes in the Core Worlds but rarely spoke in public. Instead, the admiral increasingly spent time on his flagship, the Gladiator-class Star Destroyer Demolisher, devising increasingly-corrupt economic schemes in the Outer Rim to increase his personal wealth. Nevertheless, by 15 BBY, Screed was still an important figure within the Empire. That year, he traveled to Boonta to represent the Empire at the Boonta Speeder Race, watching Thall Joben's victory from a private viewing box."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Biitu mining operation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Screed discovered the husk of a giant Abominor droid known only as the Great Heep at the Braltzamir Museum of Antiquated Machinery. After a team of students from the Imperial Engineers Academy found a way to revive the Heep, Screed formed a partnership with the Abominor to establish a droid-operated mine to exploit a newly discovered source of fuel ore on the agriworld of Biitu. The Empire, however, was not the only interested party, and Mungo Baobab had traveled to the world to establish his own mining operation for the Baobab Merchant Fleet. While Baobab saw the mine as a source of income for the native Biituian population, Screed and the Great Heep planned to drive them away from their homeworld, and seize the planet for the Empire. To this end, Imperial forces, led by the Heep, went to Biitu and constructed the \"moisture eater,\" a tower that drained all moisture from the atmosphere, causing a drought that threatened to kill the natives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperials soon had control over Biitu and established the mine under the Heep's supervision. Mungo Baobab was captured during the invasion, along with his droids C-3PO and R2-D2. While Baobab was imprisoned, C-3PO was set to work in the mine and R2-D2 was sent to the Heep's droid harem, along with numerous other astromech droids, which the Heep planned to drain of power in order to recharge himself. Eventually, Screed arrived aboard a cargo ship to take possession of the first shipment of fuel ore. Screed was met by the Great Heep and was taken to Baobab's cell where he informed the prisoner that he would be taking him to the Emperor the following day\u2014to ensure that his valuable prisoner was not harmed, Screed planned to have him put into hibernation for the journey."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The following morning, Screed, along with two stormtroopers and an interrogation droid, went to Baobab's cell to give him the injection that would put him in hibernation for the trip. Unknown to the Imperials, Baobab had acquired a saw from the Biituian Fidge Tadrazan and had spent the night sawing through one of the cell bars. Screed's arrival initially stopped Baobab from making his escape, but when Tadrazan arrived outside and began throwing rocks at the Imperials, Screed ordered his stormtroopers to capture the young Biituian, and Baobab used the distraction to kick away the weakened bar and escape his cell. Screed pulled his blaster and fired after Baobab, but both the merchant and Tadrazan were able to escape down a nearby pipe into the tunnel system below the Imperial installation, sealing the entrance behind them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the setback, Screed proceeded with the loading operation. Knowing that Baobab might attempt to get aboard his vessel, the admiral ordered his stormtroopers to watch for Baobab, and to only allow droids aboard the ship. C-3PO, meanwhile, had assisted R2-D2 in escaping from the droid harem and the two rendezvoused with their master. After disguising himself in old droid parts, Baobab and the two droids were able to sneak aboard Screed's ship, posing as part of the loading crew. Baobab's plan was to use the ship against the moisture eater, but as R2-D2 attempted to access the ship's computer, the droid activated a silent alarm that alerted Screed to the intruders. Screed returned to his ship with a squad of stormtroopers to apprehend Baobab but they were delayed at the entrance ramp by an apparently disgruntled droid. Only when the droid's hand fell off, revealing the Human hand below, did Screed realize that the droid was Baobab in disguise, attempting to delay them while R2-D2 took control of the ship. As Screed's stormtroopers moved to capture Baobab, R2-D2 succeeded in raising the ship off the ground, leaving both Baobab and C-3PO behind."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Screed quickly responded to the new threat, ordering his troops to man the mine's laser turrets and shoot down the captured vessel. However, the situation deteriorated further when Tadrazan arrived in a stolen vehicle that he used to disable the turrets. The Biituian was also joined by dozens of astromech droids from the harem, which began attacking the stormtroopers. Screed was attempting to get the situation under control when the Great Heep arrived. The Abominor blamed the apparent chaos on Screed, who in turn accused the Great Heep of failing to keep control of his droids. However, their bickering was soon ended when R2-D2 opened the ship's cargo doors and dropped its cargo of ore containers, forcing Screed to take cover. Seeing the danger above, the Great Heep attempted desperately to stop the ship before it could destroy the moisture eater, but R2-D2 sent it on a collision course with the tower before abandoning ship. As the cargo ship collided with the tower, Screed could only watch helplessly as the stored moisture was released in a torrent of rain that extinguished the Heep's furnace and left the giant droid deactivated. With the Heep gone, Screed and the other Imperials found themselves outnumbered by the natives and were easily rounded up. The Imperials were forced to help restore the destroyed crops, leaving a humiliated Screed to vow revenge on Baobab."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Search for the Roonstones"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Screed eventually left Biitu and returned to his duties with the Empire. Although the incident on Biitu was disastrous enough to have nearly toppled his career, he nonetheless rebounded from the failure. While searching for new opportunities for Imperial expansion, Screed dispatched a probe droid to the distant Cloak of the Sith region to look for planets ripe for conquest. When the droid returned to the Demolisher, it brought a holographic message from Bisad Koong, the governor of Tawntoom province on the planet Roon. In his message, Koong explained that he was seeking an alliance with the Empire. Though Screed viewed Koong's proposal with disdain, the governor's gift of a valuable Roonstone, the source of which was of great interest to Palpatine, was enough to convince the admiral to meet with him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving in the system, Screed took a Lambda-class shuttle to Koong's new Umboo Lightstation to meet with the governor.

Baobab had arrived earlier, seeking to establish the first trade route between the Empire and the Roon system, only to be mistaken for an Imperial representative by Koong. His true identity revealed, Baobab attempted to flee, but was soon caught by Koong's aide Gaff while Screed's stormtrooper guards captured the droids.

Their negotiations were cut short by a sudden explosion\u2014Baobab and the droids were attempting to escape with the assistance of fellow prisoner Noop Yeldarb and several crates of Nergon-14 had exploded in the ensuing chaos, damaging the ship's engines. As the lightstation began to drift into the nearby asteroid belt, Koong ordered an evacuation. Screed led the Imperials aboard Baobab's ship, the Caravel, joined by Koong and Gaff, escaping shortly before the lightstation was destroyed.

In exchange for providing the Empire with the precious gems, Screed promised Koong an alliance and access to Imperial resources including stormtroopers and a Star Destroyer. In truth, however, the admiral had no intention of making an alliance and only sought the Roonstones to present to the Emperor. Proceeding to Roon, Koong attempted to show Screed that his world had more to offer than just the Roonstones. Screed was unconvinced but agreed to accompany the Tawntoom governor to the Roon Colonial Games after hearing that Koong's forces had intercepted and destroyed Baobab's ship.

Gaff's efforts met with mixed success\u2014the Umboo Drainsweeper riders Gee Long and BIX were incapacitated before the race, but Baobab was able to survive an attempt to eliminate him. After Baobab and C-3PO agreed to join Auren Yomm in place of the missing riders, the Umboo team was once again able to win the Drainsweeper event, and take overall victory in the games.

Baobab had also been unable to locate the source of the Roonstones and was preparing to leave, but when his visitors presented him with one, saying that it had come from an old prospector known as \"Old Ogger,\" he decided to pay the hermit a visit.

Koong's plan was to poison Umboo's population by releasing the deadly rooze germ over the province. Screed, however, saw the plan as foolhardy\u2014the Empire's previous use of rooze had caused as many deaths among its own forces as the enemy. The admiral's concerns were proved well-founded when a leak in the rooze containers allowed the deadly germ to enter circulation on Koong's ship. While Screed's stormtroopers were protected by their armor, the admiral used a breath mask to keep from breathing the germ.

Meanwhile, Mungo Baobab traced his captured friends to Koong's Fortress of Tawntoom, built atop a volcano in an otherwise frozen wasteland, and mounted a rescue effort. During the rescue, Baobab discovered that the volcano itself was the source of the Roonstones he and Screed had sought. The admiral was leading his troops aboard their shuttle as the stricken Koong made one final attempt to persuade him to stay, when Gaff arrived in pursuit of Baobab and the escaping Yomms. Screed's stormtroopers moved to attack Baobab but were stopped by Koong when the governor saw that Baobab carried the cure for his illness. While the Yomms attempted to start the engines on Baobab's captured Caravel, the merchant proposed a deal to the Imperials\u2014he would provide both the cure and the source of the Roonstones in exchange for safe passage and peace with Umboo.
