During the larger conflict, he was part of a Separatist Movement on Ord Mantell that started a conflict known as the Separatist War in order to overthrow the planet's government, which was backed by the Republic. By the year 3643 BBY, Vyru had risen to the rank of commander and was in charge of one of the Separatist cells fighting against the Republic's armed forces on Avilatan, an island on Ord Mantell. By that time, he had gained a reputation with the Separatists and was viewed by an officer named Dalern as one of the group's greatest heroes. That year, Vyru went to coordinate operations and the transfer of troops between the various cells at a Separatist base on Mannett Point, a small island off the coast of Avilatan. While they were there, the base's security was increased dramatically with additional guards and the installation of a force field generator to the entrance of the meeting area."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, while Vyru had his meeting with two other Separatist cell commanders named Bol and Saphrro, the heavily defended base was infiltrated by two members of the Republic Special Forces unit known by the name Havoc Squad, Captain Zora and a newly recruited sergeant, who had come to the base looking for a stolen ZR-57 orbital strike bomb. When they did not find the bomb after disabling the force field, they interrogated Dalern and learned that Vyru and the others were present at the base. After learning the information, Lieutenant Aric Jorgan of Ord Mantell Infantry Command instructed the sergeant to eliminate Vyru and the other separatist commanders as priority-one targets as well as to obtain the information they had about the location and strength of Separatist forces.
