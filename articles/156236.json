When the Great Hyperspace Disaster threatened the Hetzal system with large numbers of hyperspace debris, the Hetzalian government issued a system-wide evacuation order. The stress of the evacuation caused the daughter to have a seizure, leading Jedi Knight Rah Barocci, assisting in the Galactic Republic and Jedi Order relief effort, to assist the family. Barocci was able to calm the daughter's crisis, but later fell to his death off of the tower farm while assisting in an effort led by Jedi Master Avar Kriss to use the Force to prevent a liquid Tibanna tank from colliding with one of the Hetzal system's three suns, which could have wiped out all life in the system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The daughter was first mentioned in the 2021 novel The High Republic: Light of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
