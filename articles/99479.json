After Ab Dalis was struck by one of the Emergences of the Great Hyperspace Disaster, the company's chief executive, Larence Garello, ordered his workforce and their families to evacuate on a convoy of Garello Technologies' freighters, with Odabba commanding the Arbitrage as the front of the convoy. As the convoy escaped Ab Dalis, however, they were attacked by the Nihil, who destroyed two of the vessels before boarding the Arbitrage. Odabba attempted to arm the bridge crew with weapons to defend themselves, but the Nihil breached the bridge hatch. The Nihil filled the bridge with poisonous gas, intending to kill the crew that were aboard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
