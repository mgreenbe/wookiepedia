It grew especially heavy in the Etyyy region of the planet. At the height of the Galactic Civil War in 1.5 ABY, the Wookiee Dr. Cheyerooto tasked a spacer with collecting five samples of the root from the Etyyy hunting grounds. Cheyerooto hoped to use the root to cure a group of Wookiees of an unknown disease which had driven them insane. The spacer collected the root samples and returned them to Cheyerooto. The Wookiee was pleased and rewarded the spacer with 10,000 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
