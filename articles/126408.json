The harsh environment on the planet ensured that the world was rarely visited and left in isolation, much to the contentment of the natives.

The Skakoan representative Wat Tambor led the Techno Union away from the Republic and to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, for which Skako was expelled from the Republic. When the Clone Wars erupted, Skako was a member world of the CIS, but was placed under the watchful eye of the 1st Sector Army of the Grand Army of the Republic. After Skako fell to the Republic and Foreman Tambor was murdered on Mustafar with the rest of the Separatist Council, the Confederacy collapsed and the Galactic Empire replaced the Republic. Heralding a new era of Human High Culture, the Empire crushed the Techno Union and persecuted the Skakoans for their involvement in the war. Retreating to Skako to resume their isolationist stance, the Skakoans avoided the destruction of the Yuuzhan Vong War by remaining distant from both the New Republic and the Galactic Alliance. By 130 ABY, Skako had been enveloped by the Empire of Darth Krayt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
