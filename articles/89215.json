Allied with the Separatist Alliance during the Clone Wars, the spaceport was off-limits to Republic freighters, but was nevertheless serviced by smugglers like Has Obitt, who developed a strong rapport with spaceport control. It was within close proximity to a laboratory complex, also controlled by the Separatists.
