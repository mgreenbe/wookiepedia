Introduced at some point prior to the Battle of Hoth in the year 3 ABY, it had a blocky cockpit module with an entrance hatch at the top, two stabilizer wings, two laser cannons, and landing gear. There existed a modified version fitted with a close-range impact hammer, which was used to batter enemy fortifications. In keeping with the Galactic Empire's preference for subdued colors, the hulls of INT-4s were painted a light gray."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The INT-4 Interceptor made its first canonical appearance in Star Wars: Commander, a mobile strategy game which was developed by Disney Interactive and released on August 21, 2014 for iOS devices.
