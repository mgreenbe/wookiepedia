Their skin was extremely tough and could be used to make body armor, clothes, and furniture. Several efforts to breed them on other planets failed. They stood almost two full meters tall, and were built with powerful muscles. Their mouths were massive, with flat teeth used to crush wood and grass to pulp. Kudana had incredible strength, and sharp hooves used for defense and for digging for roots. A very select group of hunters are allowed to hunt them, but only at a great fine. Kudana were very easily spooked, trampling and crushing anything in its way."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
