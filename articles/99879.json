The grassland was dotted with clusters of large purple crystalline shards, which jutted up out from the green grass of the region. In the year 2 ABY, the Mandalorian bounty hunter Boba Fett ambushed the Strom brothers, Edo and Rolu, while they were passing through the prairie in a landspeeder. Fett destroyed the landspeeder and took the artifact known as the Arachedron sculpture, which the brothers had been carrying, and destroyed it. The sculpture, which had been a fake, was designed to contain a hologram of the true artifact's location. Fett then made the brothers chain themselves to their burning speeder and left them in the prairie, although they eventually escaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Old Hallet prairie first appeared in Star Wars Adventures: Boba Fett and the Ship of Fear, a graphic novella written by Jeremy Barlow, penciled by Daxiong, and released in 2011 as part of the Star Wars Adventures series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
