During the Clone Wars, several clone troopers bore tally marks on their helmet to signify their kills. Captains CT-7567 \"Rex\" and CC-5576-39 \"Gregor\" were some clone officers that possessed tallies, however Rex stated he didn't keep track. Other troopers that had tallies included Waxer and Buzz. Rey also used tallies to mark how many days went by before her parents returned. The rebel ship, the Ghost, had tally marks of how many TIE Fighters they had shot down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
