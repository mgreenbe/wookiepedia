Because of Odarr's engineering expertise (and dissatisfaction with the company), agents from Cybot Galactica were able to provide suitable enticement to defect. Odarr was promptly put to work finding new uses and modifications for the popular PK-series worker droid. The result was the Recon-PK series, perfect for corporate and military espionage. The droids found less savory use among slave-owners in Mos Espa on Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
