In 3956 BBY, the Aqualish and a Human bounty hunter were sent by Kang to collect a 100-credit debt from an elderly merchant, who had failed to pay it on time. The two bounty hunters confronted the merchant in the Upper City and tried to extort the money from him. The merchant, however, had only half the necessary sum, which he offered as a down payment and asked for more time to find the rest. The bounty hunters did not agree to the man's terms and prepared to take him to Kang, who would kill him as an example to others who did not pay their debts. Frightened, the merchant cried for help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fortunately for the merchant, his cry was heard by the Galactic Republic soldier Revan, who was searching for the Jedi Knight Bastila Shan on Taris.

This article follows the canonical light side walkthrough, although the player, controlling Revan, can deal with the bounty hunters in the game in several ways. The player may simply attack them out of spite or opt not to intervene in the argument. In the latter scenario, the bounty hunters take the merchant to Kang. Should the player approach the bounty hunters while wearing Sith trooper armor, they mistake Revan for a Sith and remind him that Kang has made a deal with the Sith, according to which both sides do not interfere in each other's business. If Revan continues to impersonate the Sith and orders the Aqualish and his fellow bounty hunter to release the merchant, they attack him, stating that they take orders from Kang only."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
