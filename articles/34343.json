Not much is known about its armament, but it was able to make strafing runs against the beleaguered Jedi Knights fighting against Ommin's Army during the Second Battle of Onderon of the Freedon Nadd Uprising. Apparently, their appearance was similar to that of Galactic Republic assault shuttles of the time, as Jedi Knight Ulic Qel-Droma mistakenly identified one as being sent from the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
