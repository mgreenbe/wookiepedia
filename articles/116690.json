Many of the people he \"accidentally\" injured included Rebel Alliance operatives and contacts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once his service as a Braceman was finished, Tag realized that he would not be content to live off the subsequent allowance by itself.

He worked for some time in that capacity and then began working for the Hutts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While leaving Hutt Space, Tag met fellow bounty hunters Arcuse and Kiran Tatch, who had been blacklisted by the Hutts. Tag joined them simply to travel together. Soon afterward, Arcuse met Callandri, a professional assassin who was trying to form a bounty hunting team, specializing in Rebel captures. She convinced Arcuse that it would be a good team to join, and Tag and Tatch followed. Since then, Tag continued to work as a full-time bounty hunter for the Granse Confederacy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to his training and constant exercise, Tag became very muscled even for an Iotran.
