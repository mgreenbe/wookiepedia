During the last decades of the Galactic Republic, he worked as a military clerk. At some point before the last year of the Clone Wars, his father died, prompting Tahn to leave Republic service and enter the family trade as a mortician. It was he who, at the conclusion of the Clone Wars, prepared the body of Padm\u00e9 Amidala, senator and former queen of Naboo, for burial. Shortly before her death, Amidala was pregnant with twins, whose father was none other than Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight who had turned to evil. Amidala had managed to give birth to her children, who were spirited away so Skywalker would never find them. Tahn, as a mortician, was tasked with doctoring the corpse to make it appear that Amidala was still pregnant. Thereafter, he decided to retire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nearly twenty years later, Skywalker, who went by the Sith moniker of Darth Vader, learned that he had a son. Commodex Tahn received a visit from Aphra, an agent of Vader, who tortured him into confessing. Tahn, however, only told Aphra what she already knew, that Amidala had given birth to a boy. The mortician, however, resisted mentioning the existence of a second child, a girl. Despite his confession, Tahn was killed by Triple Zero, a sadistic droid who worked with Aphra."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
