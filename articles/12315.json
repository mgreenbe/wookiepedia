He was friend with Kyran Silene. After the Battle of Yavin, a group of Corellian slavers operating near Tyrena captured Kyran Silene and enslaved him. Circa 1 ABY, Silene and a group of slaves managed to escape the Corellian Slaver Bunker. Kyran Silene contacted Bandor Mokk but the Bothan was watched by Faye Patrick, a member of the slave ring, who threatened his life. Because of that, Mokk, along with Faye Patrick, were suspected to be involved in the increase of missing persons on Corellia. CorSec Major Alana Walden was investigating the case, and pleaded with citizens to report Mokk's location to CorSec."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kyran's wife, Madison Silene, later recruited a spacer to investigate the disappearance of her husband.
