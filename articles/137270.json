During the Cold War, it was held by the Duros Stantorrs. Millennia later, before the end of the Clone Wars the Senate enacted the Security Act amendment making Chancellor Palpatine Supreme Commander. It gave him constitutional authority over the Republic Armed Forces, stripping it away from the Jedi and the Senate. This authority allowed Palpatine to issue Order 66, and remain as the commander-in-chief of the Galactic Empire as the Emperor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
