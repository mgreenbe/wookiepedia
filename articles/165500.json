Armed with two pairs of laser cannons, XS stock light freighters were used for a variety of purposes, including smuggling and deploying soldiers. Despite becoming outdated, XS freighters saw continued use through the Clone Wars and Imperial Era.

The vessels had a saucer-shaped body, yellow plating, and a blunt cockpit with a narrow viewport that jutted forward from the ship's center. The aft of the freighters featured a heavily armored hull with a pair of sublight engines, and the craft were armed with two dorsal and two port-side laser cannons, although the lateral weapons were not present on some models. XS freighters were smaller than YT-1300 light freighters, and they had a capacity of at least two passengers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite being classified as freighters, XS stock light freighters were versatile, used for both smuggling and deploying soldiers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The XS freighter was designed by Corellian Engineering Corporation (CEC) well over a century before the Galactic Civil War.
