Many pirates were sent there as the Empire cracked down on criminals in the Outer Rim. Around the time of the Battle of Scarif, an HCVw A9 turbo tank appeared near the premises of the labor camp, used as a prisoner transport. This tank was carrying Jyn Erso as a prisoner. Erso was incarcerated there until being broken out by Extraction Team Bravo of the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
