Their membership included Humans and Kubaz. They were the first pirate gang that Corran Horn, in his \"Ghost Jedi\" guise, frightened into fleeing Courkrus and abandoning the Invids in 11 ABY. After badly beating a trio from the crew, the Jedi declared that he would kill any Fastblasters he saw from then onward. The Fastblast fled three days later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
