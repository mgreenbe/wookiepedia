Yeep was able to communicate his name to Ryna, but the space-farer was not entirely certain what the word \"Yeep\" meant, and considered the possibility that it referred to the stowaway's species, or perhaps his chest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, Ryna brought Yeep to the city of Pyre Folas on the planet Teyr and entered him in the annual \"Mobquet Presents: Fastest Land Beings\" event. Yeep was a late entrant in the competition's biped race, which he easily won by putting on a burst of speed and outdistancing all of his opponents. As he was a being of \"unknown origins,\" Yeep's victory was protested, but the event's judges declared him \"adequately sentient\" and awarded him the prestigious biped title, which came with a medal.

Like other members of his species, Yeep could run at a considerably fast speed.
