Woern operated as a pirate during the Galactic Civil War, commanding a pirate fleet consisting of several small assault ships and over a two hundred pirates of various races including Humans, Rodians, Gamorreans, and Elomin. He set up a base in the Drup's Star system's asteroid field known as Woern's Asteroid. Raids by Woern's pirates were indiscriminate, targeting starships from the Galactic Empire, New Republic, and civilian alike. The targets were usually lightly defended cargo fleets, unarmed passenger liners and large civilian cargo transports. However, Woern began to turn his attention specifically towards the New Republic; his last eight strikes were against New Republic assets. Reports placed Woern on the planet Korbin, in the Atrig system, where it was believed that he was purchasing information on New Republic trade routes from spies within the government. The New Republic posted a reward of 25,000 credits for Woern's capture on the charges of piracy and theft; the Elomin Council, considering Woern's actions a disgrace to the Elomin people, offered an additional bounty of 10,000 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Laerron Woern was an Elomin male who stood 1.75 meters tall.
