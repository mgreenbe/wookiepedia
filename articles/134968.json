The ground floor of the tea bar was ran as a \"fast food\" operation, where tea and snacks could purchased from over a counter, to go or to eat on the bar's canteen-style tables. The first floor was different, with a lounge that opened up onto a veranda that overlooked the square. It was more beautifully furnished and upstairs patrons were served at their tables."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stardust operated during the waning years of the Galactic Republic and was owned by the Wookiee Shrandhnrignh."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
