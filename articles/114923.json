Working closely with Security, Retrieval was responsible for taking individuals targeted by Security as suspected infiltrators and proving their innocence or guilt. To do this, Retrieval would carry out a surveillance operation, interview family and friends, place listening devices, and, in some cases, interrogate them. Suspects who were found innocent were freed with no stigma attached to them. Guilty suspects\u2014or those whose innocence was not proven\u2014were either imprisoned, turned into a double agent, or simply killed. While Retrieval did not terminate suspects unless absolutely critical, they had no compunctions about doing so if the act meant saving the Alliance from being severely damaged by leaked information."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
