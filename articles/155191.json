During that conflict, this Troxan was part of a delegation from the planet Troxar to visit Count Dooku at Ch\u00e2teau Malreaux, on the planet Vjun, in a bid to win more support for the world's resistance to the Galactic Republic. The diplomats tried to convince Dooku that they were planning to surrender to the Republic unless more battle droids arrived in their system. Dooku used a mind trick to convince them to keep fighting, that reinforcements were on their way\u2014but not to surrender. This was part of a bid by Darth Sidious to make Troxar a resource sink for the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
