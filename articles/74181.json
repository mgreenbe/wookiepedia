During the war between the First Order and the Resistance, the First Order annexed Tevel, taking control of the bacta plant and leaving behind forces led by Major Kander Varak. The Tevellans were forced to work for the First Order, with their children held hostage under armed guard.

While the First Order was not fooled by the disguise, they played along in order to find out who on Tevel had betrayed the First Order. Major Varak gave the two Resistance agents a tour of the bacta plant, during which they passed by Karkan and his Tevellan co-conspirators. The Tevellans rode a hover platform to the top of tank seven, attempting to use a vial of formula to contaminate the bacta supply and render it useless to the First Order. Upon noticing the Tevellans, Finn slipped away from Varak, climbing the tank to meet with them.

Karkan demanded to know where their vial was, learning it had been taken by Major Varak.

Karkan and the other Tevellan workers surrounded the downed walker, while Dameron incapacitated Varak.
