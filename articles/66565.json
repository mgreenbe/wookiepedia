To infiltrate a target, they initially appeared as sweeper/maintenance droids. Once past an installation's outer defenses, they morphed into large, heavily armed, and blaster-resistant battle droids to secure a demolition point. Finally, they would go to another demolition droid in sweeper form and combine themselves to make a bomb to complete their mission. They appeared to have two models: one featuring vertical photoreceptors and three secondary photoreceptors, and the other model featuring horizontal photoreceptors with two extra photoreceptors. This distinction only appeared when the droids were in battle-droid form. Their armor color also varied: some droids were green, others were orange. One of each of the two models was used in the creation of the bomb form. They also had communication capabilities, and their main photoreceptor doubled as a holoprojector.\nThe transforming demolition droids had stenciled on their domes \"CSD,\" for \"Coruscant Sanitation Department.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 21 BBY, Count Dooku ordered General Grievous to destroy a critical Coruscant power generator utilizing six covert demolition droids.
