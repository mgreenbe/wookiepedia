Around the same time, a light infantry platoon of scout troopers was transferred to the 439th Legion on the planet Byss. Although they were reputed to be a well-equipped and effective military division, the scouts were unable to socially integrate with the 439th and soon became the source of much hostility between themselves and the rest of the unit's soldiers. They shared a strong sense of solidarity with each other, but also made a habit of being extremely abrasive and anti-social toward anyone who was not part of the scout trooper program."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to their blatant contempt for other branches of the Stormtrooper Corps, the scout troopers began racing on their speeder bikes in the Legion's barracks throughout the night with the intention of disrupting the other troopers' sleep. The regular stormtroopers of the 439th became aggravated to the point where reports suggested that the scouts needed to be segregated from the rest of the Legion for their own personal safety."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 439th Legion was mentioned in the Scout Troopers' Databank entry in the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the 2010 video game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
