Around 20 BBY, Jedi Master Yoda used the starfighter to go on a series of missions to Dagobah, a mysterious planet inhabited by the Five Priestesses, and Korriban accompanied by the astromech droid R2-D2. Like the Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor, it had hexagonal panels at the end of its wings, and, like Raith Sienar's TIE starfighter, it had a compact, sphere-shaped cockpit. His personal crest adorned the wings of the starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
