During the Clone Wars, Centax-2 had been a military staging ground for the Grand Army of the Republic and, more secretly, the location of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's Spaarti cloning cylinder-created second clone army. These clones, grown in just a single year, were trained at the facility prior to being deployed in the field. Following the establishment of the Empire, clone commandos from both Delta and Omega Squads were stationed at the center, tasked with assisting in the training of the Empire's Spaarti-grown clones."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
