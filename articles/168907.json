Imprisoned on Belsavis by the Galactic Republic, Zyyskel was forcibly drafted into the Project Noble Focus, which forced alien inmates of different species to compete against each other to learn their strengths and weaknesses. However, around 3641 BBY a riot broke out and many of the prisoners involved in the project got free. In particular, Zyyskel and his fellow Gand went insane, hunting down those responsible for their torture. They captured many colleagues of Doctor Everis, on whose behest a Republic citizen freed the prisoners and killed the Gand, including Zyyskel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zyyskel appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Boss during the heroic mission \"A Lesson is Learned\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
