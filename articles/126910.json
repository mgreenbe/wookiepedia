The Jedi Padawan Revan returned to the station for the third and final time on his mission and in conversation with Tan was forced to battle the pirates who cloaked themselves in order to reach Tan undetected.

Tan travelled often to Yavin 4 where he would scavenge whatever he could find that could prove to be useful and would then trade the salvage to Trandoshan pirates or smugglers that would pass through. Tan provided them with the salvage in exchange for food and supplies so as to keep the station running. Tan also did business on occasion with the Exchange crime lord Davik Kang while Kang's death on Taris prompted the Trandoshan presence to grow agitated sensing a power vacuum that made their actions grow bolder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Padawan (and former Sith Lord) Revan traveled to the station sometime after he left Dantooine (upon completing his re-training) when he found coordinates to the station in the navicomputer on the Ebon Hawk (the ship he stole from Kang following the latter's death). He arrived on the station and met with Tan (who learnt about Kang's death) while Revan returned a second time around the time he learnt about his Sith past. It was on his second visit that he interrupted Trandoshan pirates threatening and intimidating Tan who accused him of holding out on them in terms of their arrangement and that the pirates wanted to change the deal. But Revan intervened and forced the Trandoshans to leave who vowed that their business was Tan was not concluded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The skirmish"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Revan returned to the space station after he departed from Korriban and when he docked went to meet with Tan. But their conversation was short-lived as the Trandoshan pirates revealed themselves and said that their cloaking devices enabled them to board the station and reach Tan undetected.
