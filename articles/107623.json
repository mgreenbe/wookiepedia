It was once a moon rich with ore, but because the ore was too deep to mine, the moon was destroyed by an explosives engineer. The largest moon fragment then served as a base for mining operations, which provided its materials to the First Order. Shortly before the attack on Tuanul village in Jakku, Captain Phasma suppressed a strike at the mining colony there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pressy's Tumble first appeared in Before the Awakening, a junior novel written by Greg Rucka and published in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
