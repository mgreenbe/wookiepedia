In exchange, Beadle was recruited into Rusher's Brigade and became a crew member on Rusher's troopship Diligence. Through his involvement in Rusher's Brigade, Beadle became locked into Lord Daiman's plot to eliminate his estranged older brother Odion.

He also recruited a thousand students for the university from throughout the Daimanate who would serve as bait during the attack. Finally, Daiman enlisted the services of several mercenaries including Rusher's Brigade. These mercenaries would set up their positions around a volcanic caldera.

He and Tan managed to escape after Kerra convinced the enslaved Celegian know as \"One\" to rebel against his Sith master Regent Saaj Calician.

She also offered to shelter the student refugees\nin the Arkadianate where they would be integrated as loyal Arkadianate subjects. During his time in the Arkadianate, Lubboon accompanied Rusher and Kerra to the Arkadianate capital city of Calimondretta on the icy planet of Syned.

Following the Charge Matrica which began in 1066 BBY, Darkknell had been ruled by the Sith Lord Chagras, the titular ruler of the Chagras Hegemony. Following his death in 1040 BBY, the Chagras Hegemony split into several feuding states including the Daimanate. During this period, Daiman created a personality cult that revolved around himself as the \"Creator\" of the Universe. He believed that all other sentient beings, whom he dubbed the \"Encumbered\" were little more than automatons created to serve his will. During this period, the various Sith Lords of the Grumani Sector fought a succession struggle over control of the region known as the Second Charge Matrica."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lubboon lived in Xakrea, the planet's largest city and the capital of the Daimanate.

These hydraulic accumulators enabled starships to lift-off planetary locations prior to embarking on their travels. Rusher ran an independent mercenary operation known as Rusher's Brigade, which worked for several different warlords.Wanting a better life for his son outside his position as a laborer, Lubboon Senior persuaded Rusher to recruit and train his son as a mercenary."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lubboon's mother also added that she wanted her son Beadle to be in a place that \"challenged\" his skills and talents.

To the embarrassment of his parents, Beadle leaned against a cart carrying several pails of dirty water which toppled over."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the ensuing watery mess, Beadle ended up with a barrel stuck to his head and took almost a minute to remove it. His clumsiness gave a poor first impression to his recruiters.

Rusher concluded that Beadle would probably be lucky not to take out an entire ammo magazine. After Beadle had extricated himself from the mess, Rusher assured Beadle that war was not a \"talent show.\" After receiving assurances that his son's well being would be looked after, Lubboon Senior allowed Rusher to enlist his son as a new recruit in Rusher's Brigade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rusher then attempted to purchase a new hydraulic accumulator unit from Lubboon Senior's plasteelworks.

After finishing the transaction, Beadle accompanied his new employers Rusher and Dackett back to their flagship Diligence which was undergoing repairs at the city's spaceport.

However, Daiman's enemies\u2014his estranged older brother and Sith Lord Odion and the lone Jedi Knight Kerra Holt obtained intelligence on the Convergence project and sought to sabotage it. Odion dispatched the Bothan spy Narsk Ka'hane to obtain its military secrets and to destroy the complex. Meanwhile, Kerra also sought to destroy the complex in order to sabotage the Daimanate's war effort. During the Darkknell mission, Kerra intercepted Narsk and destroyed the datapad containing the data before destroying the building with baradium thermal charges.

However, Narsk refused to disclose the identity of his employer. Despite Narsk's denials, Daiman rightfully suspected that Odion had a role in the bombing and concocted a scheme to lure Odion into another trap on Gazzari. Daiman approached the Bactranate Quermian Sith Lord Ayanos Bactra with an offer to buy an arxeum\u2014a mobile university dedicated to war research\u2014from Industrial Heuristics.

However, he got the vehicle stuck in a mire of mud which only reinforced his reputation for clumsiness and incompetence. While Brigadier Rusher regarded the new recruit as a disappointment, he sensed that the Duros teenager's true talent was stealth. Shortly afterwards, Bactra's arxeum landed in the caldera.

Riots quickly broke out across Byllura's major centers including Hestobyll as the inhabitants vented out their fury on the old order.["}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the collapse of the Dyarchy, Byllyra was invaded by a fleet of Arkadianate warships led by their older sibling and Sith Lord Arkadia Calimondra. Arkadia's warfleet quickly disabled the Dyarchy's battleships and her flagship New Crucible captured the Diligence in its tractor beam projector. Arkadianate forces rapidly occupied Byllura and annexed the former Dyarchy. Following the battle, Arkadia took her younger brother and sister into custody but kept them separate from each other.

Following the Battle of Byllura, Arkadia Calimondra surprised Kerra and Rusher by welcoming them as guests and offered to provide shelter for the passengers aboard the Diligence. She also provided them with coordinates to her capital of Syned, a remote icy planet in the fringes of the Grumani Sector. While Kerra was initially apprehensive, Rusher accepted the offer because the Diligence was already overcrowded and running low on supplies. There, Arkadia convinced Kerra and Rusher to hand over her brother Quillan into her custody."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After some discussion, Kerra and Rusher complied and returned aboard the Diligence to bring Quillan. They were then transported to her capital city of Calimondretta by a trundle car that had been provided by Arkadia. For this visit, Beadle Lubboon and Tan Tengo also accompanied Quillan. Despite his clumsy nature, Rusher had brought Trooper Lubboon along for this meeting since he wanted to give the impression that they were not a threat to Arkadia. While Beadle pushed Quillan's brown hoverchair, Tan had been permitted by Kerra and Rusher to join them since they needed her to calm the adolescent Sith Lord. After the meeting, Arkadia's aides took Quillan into custody. Satisfied with her guests.

While Beadle survived without any serious injuries, his forehead was grazed. While Arkadia did not witness the incident, she was later told by witnesses that it was an interesting incident. Beadle subsequently received medical treatment. While his clumsy disposition helped convince Arkadia that Rusher's mercenaries were not a threat, she gained a bad impression of Rusher's Brigade and declined to hire Rusher's services, claiming that she was not interested in \"specialists\" since it conflicted with her policy of continually assigning her subjects to different jobs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite her warm reception, Arkadia's tours were in reality a propaganda stunt used to promote a favorable image of the Arkadianate. She succeeded in convincing both Tan and Rusher that the Arkadianate was a utopian paradise. After impressing the Sullustan girl with Calimondretta's well-run Promisoriums, she offered to give the Gazzari students a new home in her realm. There, they would be educated and trained as \"loyal\" Arkadianate subjects. Arkadia also used her scholarly outlook and feminine charms to win over Rusher.

Vilia had also orchestrated two succession conflicts known as the Charge Matrica and the Second Charge Matrica in order to preserve her own rule by keeping her children and grandchildren preoccupied with fighting each other.

Prior to the planned Siege of Calimondretta, Rusher used an encrypted comlink to contact the Diligence. He planned to send one of his mercenaries to bring both Narsk's stealth suit and Kerra's lightsaber. Finally, Rusher would hijack an icecrawler and used it to attack Calimondretta from the inside.

If questioned by anyone, Beadle would claimed that he had sustained a broken arm.

He then sent the Diligence to fly over the museum to confirm that it was the top of a deep and massive dome. Rusher then used the cannon \"Bitsey\" to fire a precision shot at the museum.
