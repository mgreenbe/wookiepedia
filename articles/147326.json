Those who had served Kressh during his life remained on Athiss in the tomb and their descendants became known as the Tomb Dwellers. When Galactic Republic survey team six-eight-nine-mark-one landed on Athiss they accidentally discovered the tomb and were driven mad before being attacked by the Dwellers. Both the Republic and the Sith Empire then put together strike teams to investigate the area where the survey team had gone missing, and one of the strike teams arrived at the tomb and fought their way through the guardians and disciples with in before reaching the Prophet of Vodal Kressh, leader of the dwellers. The team fought and killed the prophet and then recovered a group of Sith artifacts located in the tomb."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Battle of Yavin thousands of years later, it was rumored that the Republic had destroyed Kressh and his followers, but that a dark cult still protected his tomb."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
