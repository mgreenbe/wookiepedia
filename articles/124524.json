Shilly flew there in a custom speeder that she owned, but she and her fellow couriers found the rendezvous point to be deserted. However, they were then ambushed by enforcers that were working for the Hutt Riboga. Shilly and Gust Toruna, one of the other couriers, fled in the speeder, but were pursued by gunmen on speeder bikes. The bikers were eventually able to blow up the speeder, killing Shilly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
