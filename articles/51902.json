The cantina had a large green sign towering over the structure that read, in Aurebesh, \"Cantina\". Stormtroopers and Moffs alike relaxed on their breaks. The bar was high-tech and capable of synthesizing almost any drink in the known galaxy, as well as over 16,000 well-known recipes. The building also featured a soundstage for live entertainment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leland Chee has stated that, while most items, like the supercoaster and Ferris Wheel are entered for fun, much of the other information is included in the Holocron continuity database, and is canon.
