The tidal pull of Hoth's three nameless moons caused fissures in the ice-layers of the massive frozen ocean in Hoth's southern hemisphere, sending jets of ocean water into the freezing air. The intense cold froze these jets into spires of ice, suspending primitive ocean algae in these tall columns and glaciers. The iceworms would carve their way through the ice to feed on the algae, leaving odd tiny holes in the ice. When Hoth's winds blew through these iceworm tunnels, they produced an eerie musical sound."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
