An ancient scroll, it recorded a time in the history of Bright Tree Village when Morag, the Tulgah witch had sent her pet Mantigrue to destroy the Ewoks crop of sunberry trees. Without the plants and their harvest of sunberries, many Ewoks fell sick, hurting the welfare of the tribe. Logray was eventually able to discover a way to trick the Mantigrue by hiding the trees with help from his invention of shadowroot soap, which made the trees invisible. The scroll of the Mantigrue was kept in order to remind the Ewoks of the danger posed by the Mantigrue and how they needed to be vigilant in order to prevent another time of misery that had resulted from the Mantigrue's first attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 3 ABY, Morag attempted to send her Mantigrue after the Ewoks sunberry trees once again. After the creature had succeeded in destroying two sunberry trees and bringing them back to its master, Morag told her pet to get a good night's rest in order that it might go out the next morning to destroy the rest of the Ewoks' crop. However, through the use of his crystal image spinner, Logray was able to discover Morag's plan. After the young Ewoks, Wicket Wystri Warrick and Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka questioned Logray about the beast that was loyal to Morag, the Ewok Shaman retrieved the scroll of the Mantigrue and told the two Ewoks the story of the Mantigrue's attack that had taken place before their time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
