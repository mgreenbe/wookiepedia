They were also able to detect traces of poison in a wide area, such as a poison gas or contact poison on a datapad. The detectors were often built into jewelry for maximum subtlety, and if a poison were detected the device would either vibrate or use a colored indicator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
