During the Cold War between the Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, he was assigned to the planet Taris, then in a middle of a restoration effort. He investigated the activities of the smuggler Beryl Thorne, but failed to find any solid evidence on her. Soganti approached another smuggler - the future Voidhound - with a goodwill offer to sell Thorne out. Instead, the smuggler informed Beryl that Soganti was after her, allowing her to flee. The smuggler later escaped Taris by slipping right past Soganti with the help of some forged documents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Cold War, Agent Soganti was assigned to Taris by the Republic Customs Office to watch for attempts to smuggle contraband on and off of the planet.
