The daughter of Ruwee Naberrie and his wife, Jobal Naberrie, Padm\u00e9 was publicly known as Amidala, Queen of the Naboo following her ascension to the throne in 32 BBY.

With the Galactic Senate unable to intervene, Amidala forged an alliance between the Royal House of Naboo and the Gungan High Council in order to end the occupation of their shared homeworld. In the aftermath of the Naboo\u2013Gungan victory, Amidala completed her term in office before stepping down from the monarchy. However, at the request of her successor, Amidala assumed the post of senator, becoming her people's representative on the galactic capital of Coruscant. After the first battle of the Clone Wars, Amidala had fallen in love with Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker, and the two were married in a private ceremony on Naboo despite the Jedi Order's stance against attachment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their marriage remained a secret throughout the conflict and ultimately culminated in the conception of twins\u2014a son and a daughter, Luke Skywalker and Leia Amidala Skywalker.

As a result, Amidala died from a broken heart, having lost the will to live. In addition to the Gungans and Naboo citizens who mourned their one-time queen, Amidala's family attended her funeral ceremony. Her children were separated and sent into hiding in order to protect them from their fallen father.

Having chosen a life dedicated to civic duty, she became the elected sovereign of the Royal House of Naboo and adopted \"Amidala\" as her name in office. Shortly after her coronation in 32 BBY, the Queen of Naboo lost control of her world to the Trade Federation. The Invasion of Naboo was illegal; however, the Federation's Neimoidian leaders attempted to coerce Amidala's cooperation, but the Jedi Order's intervention caused them to lose their royal hostage. The queen journeyed to the Core World Coruscant, capital of the Republic, and beseeched the Galactic Senate to lift the siege of her homeworld. On the advice of her close advisor, Senator Sheev Palpatine, Amidala called for a Vote of No Confidence in Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum, hoping that his successor would be more swift to take action on Naboo's behalf."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After returning to Naboo, Amidala formed an alliance with the leaders of the Gungan race, hoping to use the Gungan Grand Army against the Trade Federation's droid forces.

The Naberrie family was among those who paid their respects to the former queen.
