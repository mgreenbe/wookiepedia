Protecting the chest, back, and shoulders, the exterior of the armor was made from a rubbery material filled with thousands of tiny reflective crystals in a semisolid gel. These crystals both diffused blaster energy, and absorbed the intense heat generated by blaster bolts. The gel, meanwhile, absorbed significant kinetic impact, protecting the wearer by dispersing impacts caused by punches, kicks, falls, and bludgeoning weapons. The combination of rubber exterior and gel interior drastically slowed vibrations from vibroblades, seriously diminishing the effects of such weapons - and effectively protecting the wearer against piercing and slashing attacks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This type of armor was utilized by the Naboo Security Guard, who were assigned to protect the Naboo Palace in Theed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
