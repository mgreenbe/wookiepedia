Distinguished by the curved spines found along the dorsal and ventral ridges of their bodies, rollerfish were named for the way in which they captured and killed their prey. After grasping prey with their toothy mouths, rollerfish then rolled their bodies around the prey, piercing it with their spines. The primary prey of the rollerfish was the sea-mouse. In 22 BBY, Jango Fett would occasionally take his son, Boba, fishing off the platform ledges of Tipoca City. To get a fish, one must spear it. Hitting a certain area will instantly stun the fish, making for an easy catch."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
