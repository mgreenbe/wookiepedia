Limited industrial presences, such as mining concerns, were permitted on these worlds, but were regulated so to be low-impact only. Several planets in the Western Reaches, including Samovar and Wadi Raffa, were considered legacy worlds until their appropriation by the Galactic Empire. Lyra Erso visited several of these worlds in the years before the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
