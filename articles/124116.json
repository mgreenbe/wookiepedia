Republic forces take Gar Saxon into custody, as Bo-Katan Kryze watches. A gunship lands nearby, and the hatch opens revealing Ahsoka Tano, with Maul bound behind her. Kryze tells Tano she is impressed that she managed to capture Maul. Ahsoka replies it is what the Council wanted, and Bo-Katan agrees, saying that Ahsoka has succeeded where many have failed. Ahsoka says she learned from the best and that includes her, and Bo-Katan says she wishes she was good at something other than war, as she looks down at the wreckage of Peace Park. Ahsoka suggests that the Mandalorians need a new kind of leader, but Bo-Katan says her sister tried that and she never understood her idealism."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rex approaches, saying that the Jedi Council is waiting to speak to Ahsoka. She asks if he was able to contact Anakin Skywalker, and he says he was in the meeting when they asked for her. Bo-Katan says she can handle it from here and urges Ahsoka to go. Inside a mobile communications unit, holograms of council members Mace Windu, Ki-Adi-Mundi, and Yoda, along with Aayla Secura, discuss the situation. Windu tells the others that he senses a plot to destroy the Jedi, and that the dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor. Mundi says that Palpatine must give up his emergency powers after Grievous has been destroyed or be removed from office. Windu replies that the Jedi would have to take control of the Galactic Senate to ensure a peaceful transition."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ahsoka and Rex enter, and Ahsoka confirms her mission was a success, that they have captured Maul and she will escort Rex while he transports Maul to Coruscant.

Ahsoka muses the war could be over soon, and Windu replies that it depends on the Chancellor. She asks for more information, but Windu denies her request because she is only a Republic citizen and not a member of the Council. Ahsoka says she understands and the council members leave, except for Yoda, who remains and asks if she has a message for Skywalker. Ahsoka pauses and says she will tell him herself when she sees him.

Ahsoka is impressed at the device, saying she doubts even Maul could escape.

Ahsoka stares into hyperspace deep in thought, and Rex asks what's on her mind. She notes that she was trained as a Jedi to be a keeper of the peace, not a soldier, but since she was a Padawan she has only been a soldier. Rex says he has also known nothing but war, but without the Clone Wars, the clones would not exist. Ahsoka replies that at least some good has come out of the war, since the Republic couldn't have asked for better soldiers or she a better friend, and throws him a salute that he returns. An officer tells Rex he is needed for a briefing. He asks Ahsoka if she would like to listen in, and she declines, telling him it is probably more good news.

Rex starts shaking, and he drops his helmet. The other troopers on the bridge receive a message, and they turn around, training their rifles on Ahsoka. Rex tells them that he'll do it, drawing his pistols on Ahsoka and telling her to stay back. He tells Ahsoka, \"find him\u2026 Fives\u2026 find him!\" before opening fire. Ahsoka leaps over him, drawing her lightsabers and sealing the door, but more troopers led by Jesse enter from the other side. They surround Ahsoka and fire at her, but she deflects their blaster bolts into the ceiling, then leaps up through the hole. Rex orders two troopers to proceed to the detention level and execute Maul. He then tells the others that the Jedi have been marked for summary execution for treason against the Republic, and that any soldier who does not comply with the order to execute the Jedi will also be executed for treason.

As they raise their rifles, Ahsoka enters and incapacitates them. She releases Maul, telling him not to make her regret this. Maul is impressed she has survived, but denies any involvement, saying he was not privy to his master's plan. He also tells her that they have both felt what has happened though the Force, and Sidious has turned the Jedi's own army against them. He says she has done the right thing coming to him, but she says she is not here to team up with him; all she needs is a diversion, and Maul is good at causing chaos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clones report to Rex, telling him they have swept the detention level and that both Tano and Maul have escaped.

She activates three astromechs: R7-A7, RG-G1, and CH-33P. She asks R7 to patch into the Republic central computer and retrieve any files on clone trooper CT-5555, better known as Fives. The files contain medical records and a hologram of the Kaminoan medical scientist Nala Se, who states that a defect had been found in the trooper's inhibitor chip, and that the findings had been accepted by the Jedi Council and a Senate committee. However, she also notes that a grievance report was logged by trooper CT-7567.

The troopers report to Rex that Ridge is down and Maul is headed toward the main hangar. Rex orders them to close the blast door, which they do; Maul, however, pulls one trooper's arm through the door, severing it.

Rex trains a pistol on R7-A7 and demands to know where she is. Ahsoka appears behind Rex; as he turns around, R7 shocks him, knocking him out. Ahsoka and the droids carry Rex to the medical bay, sealing doors behind them. A medical droid runs a scan on Rex, but it finds no anomaly. Ahsoka puts her hands on Rex's head and recites the Guardian's Mantra: \"I am one with the Force and the Force is with me,\" with the unconscious Rex joining in. Suddenly, the scan detects the chip and R7 sends Rex into the surgery chamber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clones manage to manually override the door. Ahsoka draws her lightsabers and deflects their blasters as they open fire, but is slowly overwhelmed. Her left wrist is shot, causing her to drop her shoto lightsaber and defend with only one lightsaber in hand. Behind her, Rex recovers and draws his pistols, opening fire on the clones as G-G re-seals the door. He tells Ahsoka he is okay, apologizing for almost killing her. Ahsoka asks Rex about how widespread the inhibitor chips are, and, to her horror, Rex states that they are in all of the clones. He slowly adds that the entire Grand Army of the Republic has been turned against the Jedi.

The conversation between the Jedi Council members prior to Ahsoka's arrival occurs the same as it did in the movie. Later, Ahsoka senses Anakin's fall to the dark side, even hearing the dialogue between him, Mace Windu and Sheev Palpatine in the latter's office right before Anakin cuts off Windu's hand (the scene uses archival dialogue from Revenge of the Sith).

However, this episode shows that Rex didn't remove his chip and he attacks Ahsoka at first, before she subdues him and removes the chip herself, restoring Rex's free will.
