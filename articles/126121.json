The chamber had jagged walls that sloped inwards and at the center the Sith Lord would crouch and focus his dark side powers that allowed him to amplify his intentions and send them out over great distances to control his armies and ensure victory for his forces. Thanks to the Sphere, the Dark Lord could create Illusions and make them real enough to cause damage, giving him an edge in battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his chamber he was able to see the whole galaxy laid out and monitor the progress of his minions.

The ship rejected the philosophy of the new Sith order and departed for Kesh to make contact with the Sith there and help build a force to invade the galaxy and strike at the New Jedi Order. Upon the emergence of Abeloth, Ship was forced to do her will, and was hunted by the Jedi in hopes of finding and defeating Abeloth once and for all."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
