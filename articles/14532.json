The Republic clone troopers made use of a weather-control machine, and created an artificial cloud cover over their position which screened them from the Confederate forces. When the Confederate battleships emerged from the clouds, the Republic forces opened fire, causing heavy casualties and the Confederates soon retreated. During the Battle of Murkhana later in the war, the Confederates tried to use a similar tactic, but it was less successful."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Paarin Minor was first mentioned in Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader, a novel written by James Luceno, and released on November 22, 2005."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
