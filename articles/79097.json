A Jedi Starfighter and an ARC-170, piloted respectively by Obi-Wan and Anakin, prepare to assault the Trade Federation droid control ship from The Phantom Menace. The camera then cuts to the control ship's interior, where Count Dooku uses a remote to rotate a chair around, revealing General Grievous, sitting in it. He rises to do his master's bidding. The sequence then shifts back to the battle in space, as enemy ships appear."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The camera shifts to Anakin Skywalker's craft (an ARC-170), copiloted by a clone trooper and a clone rear gunner. Anakin turns left and the ship goes upside down and the camera shows Anakin and a scared clone pilot flying down the trench to engage the enemy fighters, a reference to Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. A droid tri-fighter fires on Anakin, but misses. Anakin goes away and the two flanking fighters explode from friendly fire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another enemy fighter aims at Anakin's craft and fires an orb, which hits his ship. Out of the orb comes a maniacal buzz droid,  which attaches itself to the ARC fighter. The rear gunner uses \"Buzz Spray\" to repel it, but the coughing droid simply flies over to Anakin's window. Anakin presses a little blue button, activating the windshield wipers to get rid of the pestering machine. The buzz droid avoids them, however, and attaches itself to the fighter's starboard engine, and begins to cut into it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Count Dooku is watching a TV screen but gets only static. General Grievous acts as an antenna. Dooku points his LEGO finger at Grievous to Grievous at the exact position that shows a clear picture of the battle outside. The movie then shifts to another sequence. Obi-Wan Kenobi's Jedi interceptor flies into view as a vulture droid fighter fires two missiles at Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan uses the Force to disassemble his starfighter into separate bricks to avoid the missiles. The projectiles hit two other vultures instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The camera shifts to Anakin. Turbolasers from the control ship shatters Anakin's ARC fighter. Anakin exits the remains of the craft, floating in space. He rebuilds his fighter with the Force. Realizing that he created a bi-plane, he demolishes the plane and rebuilds it again in a speeder-like fighter (he is still exposed to the vacuum of space). One of the clones is onboard as well. (There is no sign of the other who probably died.) Anakin uses the Force power to control the buzz droid to cut an opening into the Trade Federation droid control ship. Inside the flagship, droidekas fire at Anakin from a platform, trying to stop his advance. Anakin uses his lightsaber to destroy the platform the droidekas are standing on, while the clone trooper desperately clings to the side of the fighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sequence shifts back to Obi-Wan's craft. A tri-fighter fires on Obi-Wan and takes out his starboard wing. Obi-Wan uses his Force powers to demolish the enemy craft. Obi-Wan then pulverizes another tri-fighter and two vultures. He then uses the pieces to remodel his fighter into a Y-wing. Obi-Wan advances on the control ship and destroys some of communications devices the on top. The sequence shifts to Anakin leaving the flagship, clone trooper still clinging to the side. The flagship explodes. Anakin and Obi-Wan then proceed to Kashyyyk."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle on Kashyyyk"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Kashyyyk, Yoda spots some battle droids. The droids also notice him and surround him. Yoda disassembles several droids with the Force, mixing their parts in the process. Yoda then brandishes his lightsaber and destroys more droids. A Turbo Tank arrives with Mace Windu and clone troopers. The Wookiees join the clone army in the fight with Chewbacca leading them. Anakin and Obi-Wan soon arrive and join the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clone troopers and Wookiees keep fighting valiantly. A Clone AT-RT is destroyed in battle. Chewbacca is attacked by a Confederate tank droid and is almost run over. He assembles a rocket launcher from shattered bricks just in time to fire a rocket just as the tank turned around to run over him. The damaged vehicle skids to a stop near him, and he faints from the shock of it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Almost all the clones and Wookiees have been neutralized. Anakin, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Mace and Chewbacca are the only ones left, and are surrounded by battle droids.

They drop missiles and destroy many droids and tanks, forcing the droid army to retreat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next sequence begins with the bar scene reminiscent to the Mos Eisley Cantina scene in A New Hope. Everyone is here (Grievous is the bartender, apparently having quit his general job. Ponda Baba and some Jawas are present, and although you only get a fleeting glimpse of him, so is Count Dooku and a Droideka. R2-D2 rolls past Yoda who uses the Force to steal the drinks R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) is carrying on a tray attached to his back. Mace, Obi-Wan and Anakin are at the bar. Chewbacca takes a picture of Anakin and Obi-Wan. Chewbacca sees the picture of Darth Vader and Old Obi-Wan in a lightsaber battle (reference to A New Hope) instead of Anakin and Obi-Wan standing together, happily. Chewbacca collapses. Greedo, who is playing darts and has missed 5 times despite standing 2 feet away from the board, is standing behind him, and watches him fall and the mini-movie ends. The end credits roll as Darth Vader uses his lightsaber as a baton in conducting a stormtrooper orchestra, which is playing The Imperial March."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Count Dooku is trying to tune his television, the screen intermittently shows a test pattern similar to the Indian Head test card, with the words \"Please stand by\" and \"Treehouse\" along with bullseye images and horses."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Presentation style"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mini-movie is a very tongue-in-cheek look at the important happenings of Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, and is presented in a 3-D computer animation format, as is Treehouse's specialty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Chewbacca uses the camera to take a picture of Obi-Wan and Anakin, the picture comes out as Darth Vader in a lightsaber duel with Ben Kenobi, referencing Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The spoof features stylized versions of the LEGO Star Wars Episode III building toys in fantasy situations, portraying the interactivity of LEGO in various hilarious scenes.
