She and Hugo Cutter worked together on a mission against Pentastar Trust and Safety Assurance Bank. They entered a branch of the bank and cuffed a clerk to his desk so they could get access to his terminal. Ivey deposited a million counterfeit credits and wiped the bank's inventory control program so the financial institute would have to shut down to clean up its records. She escaped with Cutter as he set off smoke bombs to cover them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ivey was on Entralla with the rest of the Red Moons. The group planned on disrupting the Lunar Night festivities. After saving Reina Gale and Rollo from the local authorities, Ivey used a portable computer and comlink to give false orders to the pursuing patrols and draw them away from the group. She later confirmed that the credits that Gale was carrying had been reported as stolen and were worthless until they had been electronically cleaned of their register codes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
