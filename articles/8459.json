While en route to Biitu to deliver the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO to Mungo Baobab, the Argo Moon was boarded by sludgegulper droids working for the Great Heep, an Abominor who had formed an alliance with the Empire to establish a mining operation on Biitu.

A raised ridge ran down the center of the hull on the top of the ship. The engines were located at the rear of the ship, and it was equipped with a hyperdrive to allow it to travel at lightspeed. The logo of the Baobab Merchant Fleet, a family crest showing two rainbow comets, was located on the dorsal ridge, and was also displayed inside the vessel. The cockpit had a crew of two, and seating for at least one passenger. The crew was joined by at least two astromech droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Argo Moon served as a transport in the Baobab Merchant Fleet during the early years of the Galactic Empire, under the command of its pilot, Captain Cag. In 15 BBY, the ship traveled to Biitu to deliver several items, including the droids C-3PO and R2-D2, to Mungo Baobab, who was attempting to establish a trading post there. The ship left hyperspace and approached Biitu, unaware that the Empire had established a mining operation on the planet under the command of the giant Abominor droid, the Great Heep."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Argo Moon was preparing to land on the planet, it came under attack from another vessel, which launched dozens of sludgegulper droids toward it. The droids attached to the Argo Moon and proceeded to tear through the hull, piercing a hole into the cockpit, through which they sprayed a powerful sleeping gas. Cag was unable to reverse the cabin pressure in time and he, along with his co-pilot, was rendered unconscious. The sludgegulpers continued to break through the hull, and abducted all the droids aboard before returning to their vessel with the captives. The Argo Moon was left in orbit while the stolen droids were taken to serve in the Great Heep's mining operation below."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The effects of the sleeping gas wore off some days later and Cag contacted Baobab to check on the situation on Biitu.
