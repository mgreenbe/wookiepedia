But when his father finds out that his son is hanging out with the political competition, he tries to put a stop to the relationship. At the same time, King Veruna abdicates and Amidala is elected Queen of Naboo. She has to devote her time to her people now, and has no time for a boy such as Ian. Heartbroken, and with his father out of a job, he leaves Naboo and never returns. Ian vanishes into the galaxy, never seen nor heard from again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Events from A Summer's Dream were later included in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia and Darth Plagueis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
