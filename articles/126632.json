When the Queen's two Jedi protectors, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn, and their new friend Anakin Skywalker, intervened, the Sun Guard and its allies tried to assassinate them. Half of the Coruscant mercenaries, led by a Sun Guard, kidnapped the Queen, while the rest attacked the Jedi. The Queen was soon released by Captain Quarsh Panaka, and the mercenaries were all killed by Kenobi, Jinn, and Mace Windu, who had joined the fight. The leader of the thugs was killed in a duel with Panaka, resulting in the failure of the plot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The events in this article are from two distinct missions from the video games Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace video game and Star Wars: Episode I Jedi Power Battles, both released in 1999.
