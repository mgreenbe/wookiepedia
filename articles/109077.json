In 45 ABY, he accompanied the Qreph-hired Mandalorians Scarn and Jakal to the Red Ronto aboard Brink Station to extort Omad Kaeg's share in the mining cooperative he was involved with. When Han and Leia Organa Solo, who were meeting with Kaeg at the time, called the Mandalorians out on their bluff, the confrontation erupted into violence that resulted in Scarn's death, Jakal seriously wounded, and Qizak himself lost both his arms. One of them was taken by Han for a partial examination as to what a Nargon is biologically."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
