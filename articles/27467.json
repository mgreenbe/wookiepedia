Reprinted from the original Marvel Star Wars series, this is the second of two newly colored, prestige-format issues bringing the first Star Wars movie to comic books. Thrill to the adventures of Luke and Leia, the swashbuckling Han Solo and his trusted companion Chewbacca, the dastardly Darth Vader, and the faithful droids Artoo-Detoo and See-Threepio. The fact that this is the first time in over a decade this has seen print and the cover by fan-favorite Adam Hughes ensures that this will be a brand-new comic for today's fans!"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collected issues"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}]}
