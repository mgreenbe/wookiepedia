The ZeHethbra inhabited either ZeHeth's urban sprawls or rural dens constructed amid the roots of their homeworld's trees. Due to their planet's varied ecosystems, the ZeHethbra developed at least eighty distinct cultural, racial, and ethnic groups, with the ZeHethbra inhabiting ZeHeth's northern hemisphere commonly having brown or red-colored fur and the natives of the planet's southern polar region being blue-white in color. Around 25 ABY, the population of the ZeHeth system numbered between 500 million and one billion. The ZeHethbra eventually traveled throughout the galaxy, settling many other worlds and becoming well-known as a species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "ZeHeth was first mentioned in the 1994 The Last Command Sourcebook, written by Eric Trautmann for West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.
