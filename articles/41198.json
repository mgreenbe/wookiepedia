In reality, all Koon wanted was to kill the new Sith Lord.

The former Jedi was however, able to break free and brutally kill the Cthons, and turn his attention towards Koon herself. A lightsaber duel broke out and Koon was able to slash Vader across the chest, before Vader gained the upper hand and finally killed her by impaling his saber in her after gripping her throat with the force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In her dying moments Koon experienced a vision where she saw the redemption of Vader and the rebuilding of the Jedi Order, and with that vision she died in peace.
