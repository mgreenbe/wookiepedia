Most Wanderer-class transports were stripped-down Thranta-class corvettes. The Daybreaker, a transport under the command of Captain Dal in 3643 BBY, served as a Navy medical frigate, and the Esseles was a civilian transport that was attacked by Grand Moff Rycus Kilran in an attempt to capture the Twi'lek ambassador Vyn Asara."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
