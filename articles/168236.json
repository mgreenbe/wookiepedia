In 5000 BBY, the Zeta Five was sent on a run to deliver supplies and components to a mining colony on Goluud Minor, in the Goluud system. Kahorr chose to send the Zeta Five along the Goluud Corridor, a newly-discovered hyperlane that passed dangerously close to the system's unstable red giant star, Primus Goluud. The Zeta Five reached the Goluud system without incident but arrived to find Primus Goluud in a violent phase of stellar activity. The ship was subsequently destroyed by a massive solar flare, although not before it jettisoned its message pod, which had recorded the events regarding the ship's destruction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Zeta Five was a Cha'a drone ship and was used as a freighter. The ship was colored brown on the exterior, and on the top of the hull were three solar sails. The Zeta Five also had three engines located on its back end. On the underside of the ship, ten apparatuses protruded from the Zeta Five, five on each side. It did not require any sentient beings be aboard to operate it, and the navicomputer could calibrate hyperspace jumps by itself. The log was recorded in a Cha'a message pod, which would be jettisoned for later recovery if the ship was damaged or destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Zeta Five was owned by Ssk Kahorr, a Cha'a merchant lord, as of 5000 BBY.

That year, Kahorr sent his ship to the Goluud system to deliver components and supplies to a new mining colony on Goluud Minor.
