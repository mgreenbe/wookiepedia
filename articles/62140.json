Sound capability typically doubled the cost of a handheld holoprojector. The device had a limited storage capacity, but this could be expanded by connecting it to a holorecorder. A personal holoprojector weighed roughly 0.5 kilograms, and from 32 BBY to 8 ABY, it cost around 1,000 credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic maintained a large holoprojector in his office in the Republic Executive Building, from which he could view reports from Senators, Republic agents and Jedi across the galaxy. Succeeding galactic governments, from the Galactic Empire to the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, made use of holoprojectors. In particular, the Alliance to Restore the Republic used these projectors to view holographic recordings that were produced by cameras installed on their starfighters. They would study these recordings for tactical purposes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable models"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
