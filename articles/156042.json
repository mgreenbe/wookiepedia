He accompanied Secura and her clone trooper commander Bly to the forest moon of Endor around 19 BBY, the final year of the war. Previously, a detachment of Galactic Republic clone troopers had been sent to the moon in order to root out a base set up by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. However, contact with the clones was lost, not only with the clones, but with the confederate base as well. Landing a gunship at the Confederate base, the group was unable to find much of the clones, though they found many destroyed B1-Series battle droids. The clone trooper walked out on his own and soon found the remains of the clone trooper detachment. The clone deduced that a struggle had taken place, but that the droids and clones may have not been fighting each other. The clone pointed out the absence of any bodies, and all that remained of the clones was the armor that they had been wearing. Secura ordered Bly to secure the area while she would set out to find the cause of the attack. With the help of native Ewoks, she discovered that a monster was responsible for the destruction. Secura set out to kill the monster and succeeded. She returned to the clone troopers, wondering aloud why the Confederate armies were building so many remote bases. She figured that they would report the Endor investigation after their mission to Felucia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
