The old Deep Core Mining facility on Ebaq 9 made it the ideal location for a base of operations to serve as lure, resulting in the Battle of Ebaq in which the former Fosh Jedi Knight Vergere perished, sacrificing herself in order to eliminate the Yuuzhan Vong warriors throughout the moon in order to save Jacen Solo's life. With the exception of Tsavong Lah, the entire force was killed almost instantly. The warmaster, who had had an ooglith cloaker placed on him by one of his subalterns, would be slain in a duel with Jaina Solo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wizards of the Coast refers to Ebaq 9 as a green world with jungles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Essential Chronology incorrectly states that Tarkin's Fang was a base on the surface of Ebaq 9, as opposed to a planet itself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
