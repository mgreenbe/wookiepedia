When Wilhuff Tarkin was governor of Eriadu, which had a shipbuilding lommite economy, he arranged a competition with InterGalactic Ore for Lommite Limited. The competition was a race to deliver ore to Eriadu. Both competed well, but the barges were sabotaged by the Toom clan and crashed into each other. The Trade Federation quickly took over both companies and merged them into Dorvalla Mining in 33 BBY. Its executive officer was Jurnel Arrant and its chief of field operations was Patch Bruit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
