It marked the beginning of a disastrous campaign for the Republic's forces, and sees the capturing of both Alpha-class Advanced Recon Commando Alpha-17 and Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For nearly a month the Republic forces under Obi-Wan Kenobi assaulted the lines of Jabiimi outposts spread across the battlefront. By day twenty of the battle, they were capturing multiple defensive positions per week.This conquest of the Jabiimi posts was intended in a strategy developed by the Confederacy of Independent Systems and Jabiimi in order to lure the majority of the Republic forces from Shelter Base, the main operations outpost of the stationed Republic forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With their communications water-logged and being at least a day's trek from Shelter Base, the Jedi realized that they had led themselves into a trap. Shelter Base was attacked by a swarm of Nimbus commandos and Confederacy battle droids. Taking the base defenders by surprise, a hailfire missile easily brought down one of the few AT-AT walkers stationed at the base. The explosion also spread to kill numerous clone troopers and Jedi General Rallcema Bylissura."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The assault was massive, and numerous Jedi and clones were slain. Alto Stratus, the Jabiimi leader, single-handedly defeated Sana-Jis Ilowa with his vibroblade while she was attempting to move an AT-TE that was mired in the mud with the Force, before moving on to wreak havoc through the Republic ranks with his forces. However, the timely arrival of Obi-Wan, Alpha-17, and Anakin Skywalker, along with their large number of men swarm into the battle, rammed the flanks and rear of the enemy division."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stratus retreated to his main contingent after a brief encounter with Skywalker, prompting the overall retreat of the Confederacy forces. Using their remaining walker to pound the Separatist's artillery droids, the Republic easily beat back the retreating forces. An ending to the slaughter was only made when a squad of Nimbus planted charges on the forward leg of the AT-AT, sending it to the ground and creating a massive explosion.\nObi-Wan, A-17, and Jedi Master Sirrus (Aubrie Wyn's Master) boarded the smoking walker in an attempt to rescue the crew still trapped inside. However, the walker violently exploded, leading to the assumption that all three perished in the flames. Sirrus was killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shelter Base was destroyed during the ensuing conflict, leaving the most well-fortified outpost on Jabiim for the Republic's forces as Cobalt Station. Anakin Skywalker and the other master-less Padawans regrouped and set out with the remaining forces to Cobalt. Meanwhile, Jedi General Norcuna's forces were wiped out near the city of Choal leaving Jedi Knight Leska as the highest-ranking officer on Jabiim."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
