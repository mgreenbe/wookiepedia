Designed by BlasTech Industries, the Mod VII was the seventh\u2013and first successful\u2013attempt made by the company to create a realistic limb that also functioned as a long-range weapon. The enhancement cost 4000, and was made using outsourced limb components combined with BlasTech's own design of light blaster pistol. The device looked and functioned like a normal limb most of the time, but could split open to reveal the weapon component at a speed quick enough to surprise most opponents. The weapon was favored by bounty hunters and assassins and could not be dropped or removed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Cybernetic Weapon Enhancement Mod VII was first mentioned in the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2013 and written by Sterling Hershey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
