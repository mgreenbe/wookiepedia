The character was given the moniker \"Hoover\" by the creature shop of Industrial Light & Magic, from as early as 1981. The nickname was perhaps acknowledging his resemblance to the Hoover vacuum cleaner. A second nickname found in Attark's original design sketches was \"Dogephant.\" The puppet was to be operated by puppeteer Swim Lee's arm through the floor. A dummy maquette shows that propmakers considered painting him a light purple with red spots on his back, before later being colored brown. The maquette ended up in the Lucasfilm Archives sporting a blonde wig."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Early reference works, such as 1983's Return of the Jedi Monster Activity Book, 1994's A Guide to the Star Wars Universe and 1997's Star Wars: Chronicles, treated Hoover as the character's name, leaving his species unidentified. In 1998, the character was first identified as Attark, of the Hoover species, for a card in the \"Jabba's Palace Limited\" expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game. In 2008, The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia gave entries for both Attark and Hoover; however, it treated Hoover as a member of the Hoover species, and a separate character from Attark. This article assumes the Hoover entry is in error."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
