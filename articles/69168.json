The short, crudely-made knife could be held in one hand and it dealt physical damage to objects it struck. The Janta's knife blade was gray in color, while the knife's handle was brown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Janta knife first appeared in Sony Online Entertainment's 2003 MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. In the game, the knife was a melee weapon that dealt kinetic damage, and it was randomly placed in loot that players could find on some enemies that they defeated. The Janta are a tribe of Dantari on the planet Dantooine that appeared in Star Wars Galaxies, but the description of the Janta knife did not mention whether the knife was used or created by them. The weapon had the same in-game model as the stone knife, but the game did not say that the Janta knife was made of stone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
