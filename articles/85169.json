On their return from the ruin, the witches agreed to help Pavan to access the secrets of the holocron of the Sith Lord Darth Ramage, which would only activate after being provided with a large quantity of blood from a Force-sensitive being, and Drashi, Aidu, Djo, and Pavan all donated blood to allow the Jedi to open the holocron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, after having confronted Darth Vader using the knowledge of the Sith Holocron, Pavan returned to Dathomir in order to be cleared of his dark knowledge by the witches and to propose an apprenticeship to Drashi, who had previously showed an open mind about Jedi teachings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
