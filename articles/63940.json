Scouts across the galaxy were attempting to discover new hyperspace routes, and the Navigators Guild rewarded them for that information. Once the existence of a new route has been reported, the process of verifying the safety of the route began, and the guild invested large amounts of resources and time to make sure that the route was safe and would remain in existence for the long-term. Once a lane has been verified, the Hyperspace Navigators Guild passed the data on the route on to the Space Ministry, from which point the coordinates were distributed throughout the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gav and Jori Daragon while living on Cinnagar, worked for the Navigators' Guild, finding new safe-routes in their ship, Starbreaker 12, prior to the Great Hyperspace War.
