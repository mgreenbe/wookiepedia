When Jabba said a certain phrase, the bomb would explode, killing Ree-Yees and any one next to him.

When the criminals known as the Sand Splitters stole a book, a bell and a prototype warhead in the Palace, Ree-Yees tasked a spacer with recovering the stolen items and eliminate their leaders, Erib Kurrugh and Saul Rouse. In the meantime, Ree-Yees was associated with the White Thranta Shipping Company, a front for illegal activities of Jabba the Hutt's criminal organization."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ree-Yees and Tessek were conspiring to plant a bomb on the Khetanna in order to assassinate Jabba.

However, when the last and most vital component, the detonator, went missing, the plan seemed to be doomed. Bubo, angry at his mistreatment at the hands of Ree-Yees, had eaten it, thus ensuring Tessek's plot would fail. Tessek, however, planted another thermal detonator on the barge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ree-Yees didn't let his disappointment stop him making a few bets with his companions when the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker was thrown to the rancor's pit after he had enraged Jabba. Much to everyone's surprise, Skywalker killed the beast. Ree-Yees was at Carkoon onboard Jabba's sail barge when Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca were to be fed to the sarlacc. When Princess Leia Organa was strangling Jabba, the Hutt triggered the hypnotic trigger to make Ree-Yees grab Leia and self-destruct. However, Jabba died before he could complete the sequence. Feeling very triumphant, Ree-Yees kicked Jabba's corpse and insulted the Hutt. Unable to escape before Leia and Luke fired the barge's cannon, Ree-Yees was killed during the sail barge's explosion shortly afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ree-Yees's name is a play on the words \"three eyes.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the \"Return of the Jedi Creature History with Pablo Hidalgo\" blog entry at StarWars.com, writer Tim Veekhoven revealed that creature performer Tim Rose \"remembered that Ree-Yees was originally meant to be the Admiral of the Rebel Fleet, but that George Lucas himself appointed Ackbar\".

In Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy, the Gran were appropriately named but still had oversized hands.

Ree-Yees was also included in a Star Tours Boarding Party action figure set with the three-eyed camera seen in the video; the packaging confirms his identity. Since the events of Star Tours take place after the Battle of Endor, this may present a contradiction with Tales from Jabba's Palace and the former StarWars.com Databank, both of which confirm that Ree-Yees died in the explosion of Jabba's sail barge (as seen in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi).
