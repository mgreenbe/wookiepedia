Its creation was accidental after Talus test-fired a prototype with a faulty focusing aperture. While the blaster could still fire, it could also emit a bright flash of light, and instead of replacing the aperture, the engineers decided to study it, and pushed to see how bright the flash could be while it also maintained its lethal beam cohesion. The result was the XL-2 Flashfire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sold to special weapons units within law enforcement agencies, the XL-2 was popular with Corellian Security Force terrorism and hostage response teams. The Flashfire could support a variety of modifications and customizations\u2014which were appreciable by law enforcement. The flash was capable of temporarily blinding targets, which made it a favorite of those that breached fortified rooms, and even if the first officer to breach the door missed, the dazed targets were easy targets for their allies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
