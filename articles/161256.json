Obsessed with power, Shesh rose to prominence as the representative of Kuat in the New Republic Senate. When the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong invaded the New Republic in 25 ABY and inflicted heavy defeats upon the government and the military, Shesh soon decided that her best chances of survival lay with the winning side. Over a two year period, the Kuati senator passed vital information and military intelligence to Yuuzhan Vong spymasters with the intention of encouraging the invaders to spare Kuat and provide her with a position of power in their administration."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A skilled politician, Shesh managed to secure herself the position of administrative senator for the Senate Select Committee for Refugees, whereupon she channeled millions of displaced persons to worlds she knew would be targeted by the Yuuzhan Vong, such as the planet Duro. When Warmaster Tsavong Lah, the military leader of the Yuuzhan Vong, came to spearhead the invasion, Shesh maintained personal contact with the fierce warrior, unaware that she was being used and was ultimately intended to be discarded. A vocal opponent of Master Luke Skywalker's Jedi Order, Shesh aided the warmaster in his vendetta against the Jedi by pushing for their exile from the New Republic and championing the betrayal of the Order to the invaders in return for peace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The full extent of the Kuati woman's collaboration with the Yuuzhan Vong went undiscovered and, although the suspicions of her colleague Leia Organa Solo led to Shesh's loss of her seat on the refugee committee, she remained prominent in the Senate, presenting herself as a rival to Bothan Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya. Warmaster Lah later promised Shesh the position of puppet Chief of State with the proviso that she arrange the assassination of Fey'lya. Shesh's attempt failed and she was soon thwarted in her efforts to divide the New Republic Senate by Luke Skywalker, who formed an alliance with Fey'lya and the New Republic military in opposition to her anti-Jedi policies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kuati politician was forced to turn to espionage and abduction to prove her worth to Tsavong Lah, becoming increasingly distanced from her life as a high profile senator. Under Lah's orders, Shesh targeted Han and Leia Organa Solo, as well as their nephew Ben Skywalker. A bungled attack on the Solo residence, however, resulted in the revelation of Shesh's identity as a Yuuzhan Vong spy to the New Republic and the Kuati politician was sent fleeing into Coruscant's underbelly. In a last gamble to appease the Yuuzhan Vong, Shesh attempted to kidnap Ben Skywalker while the warmaster's armada attacked and conquered Coruscant in 27 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shesh was foiled in her scheme shortly thereafter and was left with little choice but to present herself to the Yuuzhan Vong empty handed. Openly known as a traitor to the New Republic, Shesh was of no further use to Tsavong Lah and was sentenced to execution by the warmaster. Providing the warrior with advice in return for her continued survival, Shesh spent a short time acting as Lah's spymaster, directing Yuuzhan Vong agent Tam Elgrin to spy on a New Republic base on the planet Borleias before being dispatched to the ruined surface of Coruscant to hunt down Jedi alongside a team of Yuuzhan Vong warriors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The former senator spent the last days of her life clinging to survival, alternately pursued by a deranged Dark Jedi or monitored by Yuuzhan Vong warriors assigned to ensure her obedience to Tsavong Lah's directives. Traveling across Coruscant's despoiled cityscape in search for a means of escape, Shesh's chances were further complicated by the arrival of Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker, along with a New Republic insertion team. When she was finally outmaneuvered and confronted by her numerous enemies, Viqi Shesh chose to commit suicide, plummeting to her death in the shadows of Coruscanti buildings that she had helped to topple."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rise to power"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Viqi Shesh was born into a wealthy shipbuilding family on the prosperous world of Kuat, a planet famed for its shipyard industries. Shesh's opulent lifestyle ensured that the Human woman became used to the trappings of luxury and her upbringing led her to believe that power was her birthright. The Shesh family, in whose veins ran the blood of Kuati royalty, had strong ties to Kuat Drive Yards. Their heavy involvement with the shipbuilding industry brought tribulation, however, when the head of Kuat Drive Yards, Kuat of Kuat, committed suicide in 4 ABY, destroying 20% of the planet's orbital shipyards in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the subsequent reconstruction efforts, Shesh's family lost social and political status and turned to the New Republic, secretly forging ties with the new government, which installed itself on Coruscant in 6.5 ABY. By the time the New Republic wrested Kuat and its shipyards from the Galactic Empire in 8.5 ABY, the Shesh family's secret betrayal of Imperial interests reaped vast dividends. Deluged with offers from eager clients affiliated with the New Republic, the Shesh family became accustomed to contracts worth upwards of a billion credits. The young Viqi Shesh was able to find a job in Kuati corporate marketing and, despite her indifference toward the work, learned much about society and how beings could be manipulated by their fears and hopes. Ultimately, however, Shesh's apathy with her corporate post encouraged her to seek a career in the public sector. She desired power and influence and had the ambition and resources to attain both."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 ABY, Shesh began a political campaign to become elected to the New Republic Senate as the representative of Kuat, utilizing her family's wealth for funds. Shesh's inexperience as a senator, rather than being viewed as a weakness, was taken up by the media as a sign that the Kuati woman was a new breed of politician who could breathe life into the New Republic's political system. Prominent at Shesh's side was Staff Chief Victor Pomt, who aided the senator in day to day life as her aide, keeping track of her schedule and helping to arrange her political appointments."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 23 ABY, four years after Shesh entered galactic politics, the Bothan politician Borsk Fey'lya had won the election to the position of Chief of State, replacing the Human Jedi Leia Organa Solo. Two years later, Shesh had manipulated the media into portraying her as a fair-minded, just and caring woman, largely due to her encouragement of broad coverage of her efforts on the behalf of refugees. Countless new stories arose of which Shesh was the subject, mostly concerning her economic patronage of impoverished worlds and her concern for the less fortunate citizens of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Along with a seat on the Security and Intelligence Council, Shesh was also closely tied with the running of the Coruscant Planetary Defense Force. The Kuati senator also had a seat on the Senate Select Committee for Refugees (SELCORE), although Shesh was not known within SELCORE circles for providing much in the way of aid. Nevertheless, the senator from Kuat was considered the rising star of the New Republic and due to the vast media attention paid to her, Shesh became almost as well known as Chief of State Fey'lya himself. For her part, Shesh remained amused that she had cultivated an image so far removed from her true desire to attain power at any cost."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Choosing loyalties"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25 ABY, Shesh was present at a convocation of the New Republic at which former Chief of State Leia Organa Solo, acting as an envoy from the Outer Rim world of Dubrillion, delivered a report which claimed that a hitherto unknown alien species had launched an extragalactic invasion. Despite Organa Solo's willingness to provide evidence of the invasion and her vocal statements concerning the danger faced by the New Republic, a bloc of non-Human senators, including the Quarren Pwoe and the Sullustan Niuk Niuv, ridiculed the former Chief of State for what they assumed was an attempt to regain political notability. Little support was provided by Chief of State Fey'lya, who was highly dubious of Organa Solo's claims that this unknown species utilized advanced biotechnology. With Caamasi senator Elegos A'Kla acting as Organa Solo's only supporter, Shesh watched as the Human woman left the chamber in disgust. Contrary to what Pwoe and Niuv believed, Organa Solo was not making a bid for power; the threat of the alien Yuuzhan Vong was real. This fact only became obvious over the next months, as a host of planets in the Outer Rim Territories were lost to the seemingly relentless advance of the Yuuzhan Vong fleet. The greatest shock came with the destruction of Ithor, a well-known planet on the edge of the Mid Rim."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Senator Shesh began to take stock of the situation as she observed the New Republic slowly mobilizing itself to take action against the invaders. Despite the New Republic's ratification of the Universal Conscription Bill and the galvanizing of, among others, the Kuat shipyards, Fey'lya's government appeared unprepared. Anti-Jedi sentiment was rife, as Luke Skywalker's Jedi Order were often blamed for taking matters into their own hands, and rumors circulated of a rogue Bothan admiral, Traest Kre'fey, who operated with impunity and without Senate guidance. Shesh soon came to the conclusion that the New Republic would lose the war and that if this happened, she would lose everything she had fought to gain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kuati woman began to look toward alternative means of holding power. As one of the six members of the Security and Intelligence Council, Shesh had access to a wealth of knowledge on the New Republic's defense capabilities, from the strength of planetary shields and the disposition of fleets to the top secret workings of New Republic Intelligence. The Kuati politician also remained prominent in the New Republic Senate, paying heed to the progress of the invasion and deciding on her course of action."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the fall of the library world Obroa-skai, Bel-dar-Nolek, Director of the Obroan Institute, traveled to Coruscant to address the Senate in the Grand Convocation Chamber. The irate director made vocal condemnations of Fey'lya's handling of the war, claiming that the New Republic Defense Fleet was not being deployed to protect worlds such as Obroa-skai and that instead the government was defending the Core Worlds. While Sergeant at Arms Mif Kumas attempted to keep order, Shesh saw her opening for publicity and intervened in the discussion. She reminded Bel-dar-Nolek that a wealth of cultural documents had been saved from libraries of Obroa-skai and that the Defense Fleet was maximizing its defense of strategically important worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bel-dar-Nolek refused to be mollified and spoke of a separate peace with the Yuuzhan Vong before turning to anti-Jediism and blaming Skywalker's Order for exacerbating the conflict with the extragalactic invaders. As Fey'lya and Bel-dar-Nolek argued angrily, Shesh decided to make her move, delivering a short address on the importance of unity and solidarity, vocally lending her support to the Jedi. In this way, Shesh gained political credibility and trust, inveigling her way further into the confidence of Fey'lya and the public. All the while, however, she was keeping an eye out for opportunities. Before long, news was received that a Yuuzhan Vong defector, a priestess known as Elan, had been taken into New Republic custody following a skirmish in the Meridian sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Elan was transported to Wayland, a little-known New Republic world that was nevertheless soon attacked by the Yuuzhan Vong in an attempt to retrieve Elan from the hands of New Republic Intelligence. A meeting of the Security and Intelligence Council was called in order to discuss the defection and how Elan and her companion could be returned to Coruscant for debriefing. New Republic Intelligence Operative Belindi Kalenda delivered a report on the attack on Wayland; the senator paid careful attention to details. Elan was at that time located on Myrkr, where NRI operatives were preparing to transport her to Coruscant. The route to be taken was from Myrkr to Bilbringi, thence to Jagga II, Chandrila and finally to the galactic capital. More importantly to Shesh, Kalenda spoke of an organization known as the Peace Brigade that was pursuing a collaborative relationship with the invaders. The senator saw a possible opportunity to approach the Yuuzhan Vong through this medium and asked whether NRI was observing the group closely. The files on the Peace Brigade and one of its leaders, the mercenary Reck Desh, were made available to Shesh. As the meeting continued, Shesh asked Kalenda what the defector wanted in return for the information she carried; the NRI operative informed the council that Elan had asked for a meeting with the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke Skywalker, who was present at the meeting along with his nephew Anakin Solo, was interested by the notion; when Kalenda informed Shesh and her fellow council-members that Elan had provided information on the Yuuzhan Vong fleet's next target, Ord Mantell, the senator became convinced that by facilitating Elan's return to the Yuuzhan Vong through the medium of the Peace Brigade, she could initiate her plan to open contact with the invaders. Once the Yuuzhan Vong attacked Ord Mantell and were repulsed by New Republic forces, Shesh decided to contact Reck Desh and inform the Peace Brigade of Elan's impending transfer to Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before she took the step of contacting Desh, Shesh had the New Republic Intelligence's network sliced into and made sure that surveillance on the Peace Brigade was discontinued. The senator then contacted Desh via comlink anonymously, requesting that the collaborator travel to Kuat City and meet with someone who could furnish the Peace Brigade with vital information. The location of the meeting was to be the Nebula Orchid, a popular Kuat diner with several private booths. Equipped with an expensive voice scrambler and disguised as a Kuati telbun, Shesh waited for the ex-smuggler to arrive, keeping a cautious eye on her surroundings. The eatery was bustling and, as Shesh had made certain, similarly attired telbuns were all around, enabling her to vanish into the crowd should the need arise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seating herself in booth seven, the senator waited until Desh had sat down in booth six before revealing that she was his contact and telling him to order the two associates he had arrived with to stand down. Desh was cautious and demanded knowledge of the senator's true allegiance, identity and purpose, but Shesh was not forthcoming. She informed the collaborator of Elan and that the Yuuzhan Vong would doubtlessly pay a high price to see the defector returned. In return for the information, Shesh asked her new contact in the Peace Brigade to keep her apprised of any of the organizations dealing with the Yuuzhan Vong. Having passed over the top secret information concerning the route by which Elan was scheduled to be transported and explained her motives for doing so, Shesh warned the ex-smuggler to refrain from passing on knowledge of the meeting even to the Yuuzhan Vong. With that, the senator left the diner and walked out into a courtyard filled with identically clad telbuns, easily throwing off Desh's attempt to follow her.\nConfident that she had taken the first steps towards a possible collaborative relationship with the invaders, Shesh returned to her duties as a senator. Before long, Desh and his cohorts acted upon her information and attacked the Queen of Empire, the passenger liner transporting Elan, on the outskirts of the Bilbringi system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The true nature of the defector, however, was something for which Shesh could not have accounted. Elan was in fact an assassin, dispatched as a false defector to eliminate members of the Jedi Order. The entire scheme, the defeat in the Meridian sector and the losses at Ord Mantell, had all been a ploy to lend Elan's defection credibility. This was proven during the Battle of Bilbringi, during which NRI learned, as did Senator Shesh, that the Yuuzhan Vong vessels had not attempted to retrieve Elan. Nevertheless, Shesh's actions had not gone unnoticed by the Yuuzhan Vong, while on the New Republic end, Desh's death during the battle at Bilbringi and Shesh's earlier precautions in contacting the Peace Brigade meant that the senator's involvement went undiscovered. Despite the failure of her plan, Shesh's attempts to send out tentative feelers to the Yuuzhan Vong were far from finished. Due to her prominence in the Senate and her parlaying of Kuat's wartime importance, she was elected onto Borsk Fey'lya's Advisory Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chief of State came under fire for appointing Shesh, as elements of the media felt that their favorite young Kuati senator would become Fey'lya's corrupt stooge and that she had been elected due to the Bothan's desire to keep Kuat on his side. Shesh took the Advisory Council position, along with a spacious office overlooking Commerce Way and the New Republic Obelisk, as it enabled her to provide further aid to the invaders. It soon emerged that the Hutt race, a species traditionally known for its amorality and criminality, had forged a separate peace with the invaders, exchanging Yuuzhan Vong access to their territories for amnesty. The Yuuzhan Vong struck at Gyndine from their new holdings in Hutt Space, causing further panic and prompting the question as to which system would be the next target. Shesh observed the progress of the war, paying particular attention to the rearming of Centerpoint Station, an ancient space station in the Corellian system with vast destructive capabilities."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Communicating through conflict"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While arranging the decoration of her new office, the senator received a visit from Commodore Brand of the New Republic Defense Force. The Defense Force wished to entice the Yuuzhan Vong to send a fleet to attack the Corellian system, whereupon the invaders could be trapped and routed. In order to do so, Brand and his superiors needed Corellia to appear undefended, a falsehood to which they hoped to lend credibility by encouraging the Advisory Council to direct fleets to protect the Bothan sector, among other worlds. Shesh cottoned on rapidly; she was being asked to tip the Advisory Council vote towards sending the fleets to protect Bothawui, leaving Corellia apparently under-defended and ripe for a Yuuzhan Vong attack. The senator also realized that she was being offered an opportunity to forewarn the Yuuzhan Vong and essentially save the invaders an entire fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Feigning allegiance to Brand's scheme, she not only promised to swing the vote towards Bothawui, but also claimed that she would visit Consul-General Golga Besadii Fir, a Hutt politician still present on Coruscant, and inform him that the Yuuzhan Vong would benefit from an attack on Corellia. Shesh and Brand agreed that the consul general, whose Hutt masters were in league with the Yuuzhan Vong, would then inform the invaders. Ostensibly, Shesh's visit to Golga Besadii Fir was therefore in the interests of the New Republic Defense Force and its scheme. In reality, Shesh intended to use the consul general as an intermediary by which she could communicate her collaborationist intentions to the Yuuzhan Vong."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile in the military theater, the Inner Rim world of Tynna fell to the Yuuzhan Vong, following the suspension of Hutt spice deliveries to the Tynnani system. The NRDF leadership believed that the next system to which the Hutts suspended spice deliveries would be the target and, when Bothawui and Corellia both exhibited evidence that the spice trade had slowed, Brand and his cohorts realized that the time to lure the Yuuzhan Vong to Corellia had come. Shesh traveled to the Hutt consulate, located in the penthouse of the Valorum Tower, and asked to meet with Golga, who granted her an audience despite his imminent departure for Hutt Space. Discussing the treaty that the Hutts and the Yuuzhan Vong had made, Shesh became convinced that she could use Golga, who was a relative of the Hutt leader Borga Besadii Diori, as a means by which she could contact the invaders. As the consul general was essentially being hounded off Coruscant by an irate New Republic government and its citizens, Shesh saw no harm in informing him that the Defense Force wished to lure the Yuuzhan Vong to Corellia in order to destroy them with a reactivated Centerpoint Station. She asked him to deliver this information to Borga the Hutt, whom she hoped would in turn communicate with the Yuuzhan Vong, along with a message that she was \"righting an earlier wrong\"\u2014 a tacit reference to the Elan affair. The Hutt realized that the senator intended to provide information to the Yuuzhan Vong and asked Shesh if this was the case. The Kuati woman easily dodged the question and left the consulate, reporting to Brand that her meeting had gone well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unfortunately for Shesh's designs, she had not made her message for the Yuuzhan Vong detailed enough with regards to Centerpoint Station. Her information was received, but the full extent of the ancient construct's destructive capabilities remained unknown to the Yuuzhan Vong, who were in any case intending to attack neither Corellia nor Bothawui, having instead set their sights on the shipyards at Fondor. Shesh, the Hutts and the New Republic remained ignorant of this fact, however, and the Kuati senator prepared to play her role as the meeting of the Advisory Council was convened in order to discuss the redisposition of the Defense Force fleets. Shesh traveled to the evening meeting several days later to hear Brand's report along with the other members of the Advisory Council. Chief of State Fey'lya was openly skeptical and dismissive of Brand's opinion that the fluctuations in the Hutt spice trade signified anything of importance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Defense Force Commodore broached the subject of fleet redisposition and called for a task force to be put together to defend the Corellian system, Fey'lya became outraged, just as Brand and Shesh had predicted, and accused the Defense Force of abandoning Bothawui and trusting poor intelligence. Before long, Fey'lya was railing against Jedi involvement; Shesh watched as Fyor Rodan of Commenor and Niuk Niuv of Sullust sided with the Chief of State on behalf of Bothawui, motivated mainly by anti-Jedi sentiment. Arrayed against Fey'lya's bloc were Chelch Dravvad of Corellia, the Alderaanian Cal Omas and the Wookiee Triebakk of Kashyyyk. As the matter of which world should be defended was put to the vote, the two blocs voted for Bothawui and Corellia respectively."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quarren councilor Pwoe, hostile to the Bothan shipbuilding industry and the competition it posed to Dac's own shipyards, voted for Corellia's defense, while the Rodian Navik lent his support to Bothawui due to Rodia's proximity to the Bothan sector. As there were nine councilors, it fell to Shesh to deliver the deciding vote. True to her promise to Brand, Shesh tipped the vote to Bothawui's favor and Fey'lya promptly ordered Brand's task force to be dispatched to defend the sector, leaving Corellia undefended as planned. Shesh had succeeded, therefore, in gaining allies among Fey'lya and his bloc, the New Republic Defense Force and the Yuuzhan Vong in one move. The fruits of Shesh's labors revealed themselves over the next few days but, as with Elan, she had once again misjudged Yuuzhan Vong designs. The invaders ignored Kuat, Bothawui and Corellia, instead launching a devastating attack on Fondor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Furthermore, Shesh's warning to the Yuuzhan Vong commanders, delivered via the Hutts, was not informative enough; the reactivated Centerpoint Station was fired upon the Yuuzhan Vong fleet at Fondor in a last ditch attempt to save the shipyards there. The resulting shockwave wiped out half of the invaders' armada, along with a Hapan warfleet that had been acting as New Republic reinforcements. The result of the Defense Force's careful scheming had been a disaster and the Senate Justice Council was convened to investigate the situation and determine how the sneak attack on Fondor had come about. Some blamed the Jedi and their intelligence sources, others sought to condemn the senators involved, and many attacked the Defense Force for its handling of the situation. Admiral Sien Sovv\u2014Commodore Brand's superior\u2014was forced to inform the Justice Council that the Advisory Council meeting precluding the battle had been a farce and, in light of this evidence, Shesh was asked to appear before Justice Council chairman Ta'laam Ranth and give an account of the briefing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two weeks after the Battle of Fondor, the time came for the inquest. With a trio of legal representatives and instructions to allow her lawyers to do most of the talking, Shesh planned to answer sparingly. The hearing was a closed-session but a sizable crowd was present in the amphitheater where it took place; Shesh responded deftly to Ranth's questions, revealing only that she had discussed scenarios with Brand and had spoken with Consul-General Golga Besadii Fir in order to acquire information from the Hutts. Fortunately for Shesh, court protocol stipulated that she could respond only to a narrow range of questions and she was able to exonerate herself of any blame for the blunder. As her questioning reached its conclusion, Shesh was asked to comment on the Jedi. Having attained a great amount of power through her maneuverings thus far, the Kuati senator made her break with pro-Jediism and stated that Skywalker's Order was not infallible. As she left, Shesh was mobbed by the media but only gave a couple of interviews, refusing to answer most questions, before she made her way back to her office. Once Shesh had returned to the office, she watched a holorecording of herself being interviewed outside the hearing, pleased that she had gained more publicity from the episode. Her entertainment was interrupted by the arrival of a man identifying himself as Pedric Cuf, whom Shesh instructed her secretary to send through into her office."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cuf introduced himself as a businessman and, with subtle references to the process of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, indicated that he was in fact a disguised Yuuzhan Vong agent. As this became clear, Shesh became excited by the fact that her long attempts to contact the invaders had been successful, but remained cautious, in case Cuf was a New Republic Intelligence agent. When Cuf made reference to Shesh's good-faith involvement in the Elan affair, the senator feigned ignorance and Cuf prepared to leave. It was only his mention that he had learned of her goodwill toward the Yuuzhan Vong through a meeting with a Hutt that encouraged Shesh that Cuf was genuine. She invited the Yuuzhan Vong agent to remain and talk a while, insinuating that she should be provided with a similar disguise to that which Cuf was wearing so that she could begin her work as a full-blown collaborator. Cuf, in reality Yuuzhan Vong spymaster Nom Anor, had other Yuuzhan Vong agents furnish Shesh with ooglith masquers, which she soon began to use to move around incognito, despite the pain their attachment caused to her skin. The senator was also provided with a communications device by which she could contact a high-ranking Yuuzhan Vong warrior, Warmaster Tsavong Lah. For her services, Shesh was offered payment in credits that had been obtained by the Yuuzhan Vong, which she directed to her personal accounts through convoluted channels to disguise their source."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Duro and the Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having finally obtained direct contact with the invaders, Shesh made use of her various political positions and the resources available to her in order to facilitate the Yuuzhan Vong advance. Maneuvering her way to a position of political primacy in SELCORE, the senator was able to direct the rising flood of refugees to whichever worlds she chose. Working alongside the Yuuzhan Vong, Shesh arranged for the refugees of hundreds of planets to be directed to Duro, a polluted planet on the outskirts of the Core. In return for attempting to restore the ruined ecosystem, the refugees were promised asylum by the Duros High House in settlements on the surface. As the administrating senator of SELCORE, Shesh in fact did little to help the refugees, largely due to the fact that she knew of the planet's impending fate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The refugees were to be sacrificed to the Yuuzhan Vong gods and the Duro Starshipwright Shipyards were to be destroyed. Before long, corruption had riddled SELCORE's system contractor, CorDuro Shipping, whose leadership began to collaborate with the Yuuzhan Vong and the Peace Brigade as well. Shipments were frequently delayed or rerouted, communications problems were rife and defense shortfalls multiple. As the Yuuzhan Vong fleet advanced up the Corellian Run on the way to Duro, seizing Falleen, Druckenwell, Kalarba and Kubindi in a series of swift conquests, criticism was also directed against Chief of State Fey'lya and his management of the war. Once Rodia had fallen to the invaders, a meeting was convened at which members of the Defense Force, along with Jedi Masters Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker, discussed the situation. For her part, Shesh remained silent as she gleaned information."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Corellia was being discussed, Chelch Dravvad informed the Advisory Council that Centerpoint Station had been rendered inactive following its latest firing. As Fyor Rodan and Borsk Fey'lya criticized rogue Jedi activity, Shesh noted Luke Skywalker's response that many Jedi, such as his nephew Jacen Solo, were in fact pursuing a pacifistic approach to conflict. The Kuati senator noted both pieces of information for future reference but ultimately decided to withhold the knowledge of Centerpoint Station's inactivity from the invaders. Worried that the Yuuzhan Vong would strike at Coruscant before Shesh had earned herself a position of power under their administration, the Kuati senator instead promised the invaders that she would set agents at work to ensure that Centerpoint Station was disabled."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was only a couple of days later that Shesh was in fact contacted by both Jacen Solo and his sister Jaina from Duro, who wished to locate their mother, Leia Organa Solo, on the planet. Shesh feigned interest and politeness, earning Jacen Solo's scrutiny as she did so, and promised to use her resources to find Organa Solo. The transmission was interrupted on the Duro end by a Hutt, Randa Besadii Diori, who urgently beseeched Shesh to send troops to aid the Hutts, currently fighting for their lives against the Yuuzhan Vong following the failure of their treaty. The senator cut the transmission off but before long was contacted by Warmaster Tsavong Lah for the first time on Yuuzhan Vong communications device\u2014known as a villip\u2014that she had been given. Shesh was surprised and shocked to witness the full extent of the warmaster's mutilations but regained her composure and set about making herself clear."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The advance on Duro was not an issue for the senator, but Shesh found the proximity of her native Kuat to the Duro system worrisome and wished to ensure that the warmaster would not subsequently attack the Kuat shipyards. She made apparent her desire for peace and requested that Lah reassure her of the impending cessation of the invasion. Mollified by the warrior, Shesh was reminded that she would be greatly rewarded when the time came and the Yuuzhan Vong stood victorious. When Lah brusquely brought matters to a close, Shesh decided to gain further favor with the warmaster by announcing that she would be able to orchestrate the abduction and delivery of a young Jedi Knight who was present on Duro, as she was aware of the warmaster's military interest in Force-sensitives. Shesh was referring to Jacen Solo, and although she mentioned that the young Human was not making use of his abilities, the Kuati senator did not mention Solo by name. Once Shesh had revealed this information, she was silenced by the warmaster and the transmission was ended. The senator continued to lead her double life, maintaining cautious measures to ensure that no knowledge of her duplicity ever leaked."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Her servants swept the office three times a day for listening devices and she ensured that, other than her contact with Tsavong Lah, her illicit affairs were coordinated through third party contacts. Due to this approach, Shesh's carefully cultivated reputation remained intact. The senator did maintain a pretense of interest in the doomed refugee efforts on the surface of Duro due to her lofty position in SELCORE. Contacted by a Tynnan and a Human pair of technicians from Gateway settlement, Shesh was discussing matters of the colony when the transmission was once again interrupted by Randa Besadii Diori. The excitable Hutt informed her that a Yuuzhan Vong agent was operating somewhere on Duro and that she needed to send support urgently. Shesh immediately asked whether the Hutt had actually succeeded in unmasking the infiltrator; once he admitted that he had not, she fobbed him off with the promise that she would have Leia Organa Solo, whom Shesh had learned was the administrator of Gateway, investigate the claim."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the Hutt had left, Shesh concluded her business with the communications technicians and contacted Tsavong Lah to inform him of what had occurred. A short time later, the warmaster advanced his forces upon the planet. Jedi liaison Kenth Hamner came before Borsk Fey'lya to plead the case for a defense of Duro. As the last step in the process of sealing the planet's fate, Shesh delivered a persuasive address stating that no warships should be spared to aid Duro as this would weaken the defenses of other worlds. Unknowingly aiding her and the Yuuzhan Vong, the Quarren Pwoe also reminded the senators that false alerts had been called in on Duro before. Fey'lya and his council voted against Hamner's proposal. The warmaster's armada struck at Duro with overwhelming numbers, destroying all but one of the Duros population's orbital cities along with the shipyards. The vast majority of the refugees whom Shesh had directed to the world were captured or killed. In an unexpected turn of events for the Kuati senator, however, Jacen Solo rescued his mother from captivity, injuring and humiliating Tsavong Lah in the process. Outraged, the warmaster issued a galaxy-wide address to the New Republic, proclaiming that the invasion would stop at Duro, so long as the Jedi Order was surrendered to the invaders. Emphasis was put on the capture of Jacen Solo. All over the galaxy, a fearful citizenry responded to the warmaster's demands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shesh and Kuat remained closely connected to the activities of the Peace Brigade, who were central in the pogrom against the Jedi.

Alongside her continued support of other collaborators, Shesh put a new plan in motion to eliminate the threat of the Jedi on behalf of her Yuuzhan Vong masters. Despite the success of the Peace Brigade and other factions in turning individual Jedi over to the invaders, the senator recognized that she was well equipped to strike at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Order with the power of the New Republic government, if she could accrue enough support in the Senate. The Kuati woman began to agitate increasingly vocally against the Jedi, aided in her campaign by her Staff Chief, Victor Pomt. Shesh drew up an outline for the Peace Vote, a Senate motion that would outlaw the Jedi and mobilize the New Republic judicial system against the Order, allowing the Yuuzhan Vong to neutralize the threat with ease. First, however, Shesh was determined to eliminate Leia Organa Solo, whom the senator believed had witnessed too much of the corruption that had riddled CorDuro Shipping and the possibilities of Shesh's duplicity to be left alive. She entrusted the task to Staff Chief Pomt who mobilized resources against the injured Jedi, whom Pomt soon learned had been taken to a hospital in Coronet, the capital city of Corellia.

Unfortunately for Shesh, the Solos evaded the assassination attempts and made their way to Coruscant, retaining the evidence of Shesh's close ties with CorDuro Shipping. As the Duro corporation had been openly outed as a collaborationist organization, which Shesh had contracted in her position as administrative senator of SELCORE, the implications risked exposing the Kuati woman. Furthermore, Leia Organa Solo contacted Senator Kvarm Jia and called for a meeting of the Corruption Panel to investigate Shesh. The Kuati woman was under pressure to accrue enough support for the Appeasement Vote to prevent the results of the hearing from impacting adversely upon the anti-Jedi movement. As such, she continued to solicit support and instead sent Staff Chief Pomt before the Corruption Panel and its chairperson, the Bith senator E'noro. Before doing so, Pomt initiated a last ditch attack on the Solos as they approached Coruscant that resulted in failure. The Solos arrived at the Senate Inquiry Room for the Corruption Panel hearing in time to present the evidence of Pomt's assassinations attempts to E'noro; Pomt scorned the accusations, but the damage was done.

Shesh was asked to procure some of these creatures for study; the senator duly dispatched a number of captured vornskr to the Yuuzhan Vong, whose scientists were able to crossbreed with the fero xyn to create voxyn. Bred specifically to hunt Jedi, voxyn were unleashed on space stations and planets across the galaxy, whereupon they tracked and killed Force-sensitives. Four Jedi were eliminated in quick succession. To complement the voxyn scheme, Warmaster Lah arrayed a billion refugees in orbit over the planet Talfaglio, demanding the surrender of the Jedi and the location of their secret base in return for the safety of the refugees.

The warmaster asked her to recount the information to Cuf and Shesh did so obediently, exaggerating her role in the NRMOC proceedings. Lah decided to send an envoy, selecting Nom Anor, whom Shesh still did not know was the undisguised Pedric Cuf. On Coruscant, the Kuati woman was asked by the media to comment on the envoy's impending arrival in the Senate; Shesh used the moment to reiterate her stance against the Jedi, whom she blamed for placing their own safety above those of the Talfaglion refugees.

Once Elgrin contacted her and informed her that Solo's starfighter had been affixed with one of the tracking bugs, Shesh ordered him to apprise her of the garrison's reaction to Solo's capture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As it happened, the Yuuzhan Vong forces in the Pyria system, where Borleias was located, were unable to capture the young Jedi and a few days later, an attack was launched on Domain Dal from the outskirts of the Coruscant system. Lah had Shesh brought before him and ordered the former senator to discover how the Borleias garrison had seemingly fired a powerful laser beam at Domain Dal from the Pyria system. Shesh in turn instructed Elgrin to find out this information by breaking into Danni Quee's office on Borleias and communicating the results of Quee's research to the Yuuzhan Vong. Once the intelligence was returned to her, Shesh went before the warmaster, alongside Supreme Commander Maal Lah, to deliver her report. With visual evidence of Quee's research provided by Elgrin, Shesh posited that the laser beam had been fired by a superweapon constructed by the New Republic in the Pyria system, through Quee's apparent merging of New Republic and Yuuzhan Vong technology. Silenced by the warmaster for this statement, as the discussion of hybrid machine and organic technology was considered heresy for the Yuuzhan Vong, Shesh allowed Maal Lah to continue. The supreme commander informed Lah that such a merging of technology was possible and the warmaster subsequently communicated with his father, Czulkang Lah, who was commanding Yuuzhan Vong forces in the Pyria system. Lah, trusting Shesh's report, ordered his father to launch a full scale attack on the garrison."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack failed.

Shesh's assignment had resulted in failure, although the ex-senator's time as Lah's agent had not yet come to an end. Before long, Shesh was brought before the warmaster again. In the face of her expectations, Shesh discovered that her concocted story about Lah's shapers and priests conspiring against her had actually been true. The warmaster had weeded out the conspirators and, as such, Shesh's bid for time had brought her less than she had wanted. The former senator had no escape plans in mind as such and, as Lah informed her of her next assignment, Shesh became even more terrified that her death was soon to be upon her. Believing that Jedi were active on the surface of Coruscant\u2014which had undergone a vast terraforming process and now consisted of a ruined cityscape overgrown with Yuuzhan Vong growths\u2014Lah ordered Shesh to travel down the surface of the planet along with Denua Ku, a search party and a pack of voxyn, in order to locate, kill or capture the Jedi.

Raglath Nur, the Yuuzhan Vong warrior in charge of the hunting party, continually called upon Shesh for advice; the former senator used her rudimentary knowledge of explosive devices and Coruscanti architecture to guide Nur and his warriors, all the time fearful and searching for a means of escape. Eventually, the party found themselves on the trail of what seemed to be, according the behavior of the voxyn, a group of Force-sensitives. Forced to run alongside the hunting party, Shesh became increasingly incensed about her dire predicament. Before long, she noticed a room full of dead bodies floating in stagnant liquid. Perceiving that one of the corpses was in fact a living Human feigning death as the search party passed, Shesh ordered Denua Ku to drag the young male out of the liquid for interrogation. Shesh demanded to know where the Jedi were; the young man claimed that he knew nothing and in his panic passed her a small remote, before the voxyn scented their prey and the hunting party went on the move. Denua Ku snapped the young man's neck and Shesh was left with a remote for which she did not know the purpose.

Despite the compulsion issued through the Force to attack the being, Shesh's instinctive desire for survival triggered her desire to flee. Pursued by the Force-sensitive, Shesh escaped the manufacturing plant in a state of pure terror. Dashing through ruined buildings with her pursuer close behind, Shesh came face to face with two fugitives who held her at blaster point and discussed killing her and eating her remains. The not so distant pursuer caught up with her, however, and Shesh scrambled to escape while the two fugitives were torn to pieces by his lightsabers. The former senator escaped into a maintenance shaft and climbed as fast as she could. Compelled by her fear and terror, Shesh managed to elude her pursuit before collapsing exhausted in one of the tunnels and falling to sleep for a time.

Over the next days, the former senator worked at removing the debris that blocked the Ugly Truth's escape chute and studied the starship's controls, eager and desperate to escape the ruins of Coruscant. Always cautious to go about her days quietly in case she attracted undue attention, especially from the coralskippers she observed on patrol in the skies, Shesh was shocked when she was accosted by Denua Ku in the apartment. Ku revealed that he had tracked her down by means of an organic subcutaneous implant known as a nisbat, which had been inserted into Shesh's body in case she escaped. Having assumed the warrior dead at the hands of the rampaging Force-sensitive, the former senator was forced to lie to explain why she had not contacted the Yuuzhan Vong since her disappearance.

As she escaped, however, she was seized by Kell Tainer and Garik Loran, two New Republic operatives who had accompanied the Skywalkers to Coruscant.

Preparing to board the spacecraft and seek clemency, the Kuati woman was shocked when Denua Ku once again appeared behind her, mortally wounded and vowing that he would kill her. The former senator for Kuat realized that she could never reach the spacecraft hatch in time and, determined to exercise the last power she had remaining, voiced her opinion that her death rested in the hands of one person alone\u2014herself.
