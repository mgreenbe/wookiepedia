However, by the time following the Battle of Yavin, he was part of the group of CorSec troopers and agents who left CorSec in pursuit of a more criminal lifestyle. Along with Mtara Vinram, Hiram Bish became one of the commanders of the Rogue CorSec. Circa 1 ABY, Bish and Vinram elaborated a plot to discredit the Diktat, Daclif Gallamby, and his government. As part of the plot, they created evidences that the Diktat himself was smuggling illegal spice in the Coronet Capitol. The plot was finally foiled by a spacer recruited by CorSec Lieutenant Mack Jasper. The spacer infiltrated the Rogue CorSec Base to find proof of the Diktat's innocence. Hiram Bish and Mtara Vinram were killed during the assault."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hiram Bish appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hiram Bish was added to the game with the expansion Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan, released on November 1, 2005.
