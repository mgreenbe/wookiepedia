In about 21 BBY, two relics believed to be rare Mandalorian artifacts were discovered on the moon Korasa and taken to the Jedi Research Facility to be studied, though the artifacts were in fact fake. Word of the discovered reached the galactic criminal underworld and two rival squads of bounty hunters ventured to the facility to steal the artifacts. After releasing some buzz droids to stage a diversion, the bounty hunters Boba Fett, Bossk and C-21 Highsinger made off with the relics, while their rivals Dengar and Latts Razzi were captured by the research facility's guards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
