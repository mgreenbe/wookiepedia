Shortly after a group of bounty hunters, under the command of the Duros mercenary Cad Bane, rescued Hutt crime lord Ziro Desilijic Tiure from his imprisonment in the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center on Coruscant circa 21 BBY, the Neimoidian and his frigate were patrolling a sector of the Outer Rim Territories in which the planet Florrum, home to a base of Weequay pirates, was located."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Neimoidian captain was informed by a battle droid lieutenant that an unidentified Flarestar-class shuttle\u2014piloted by the Weequay Shahan Alama, a member of the group that freed Ziro\u2014was approaching their frigate. Though the battle droid's original report of the unidentified vessel did not help the captain, the Neimoidian vaguely recalled the importance of the craft. He ordered the lieutenant to obtain the threat files for their current sector. After reading the records of Separatist leader Count Dooku's brief stay as a captive of the local Weequay pirates, the Neimoidian rationalized that Dooku would want vengeance brought upon the pirates, and ordered the droids to fire upon Alama's craft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nearby, under the command of Twi'lek Jedi General Aayla Secura and Clone Commander CC-5052, \"Bly,\" a Republic Acclamator-class assault ship was performing a scouting mission. After watching the Separatist frigate engage the Weequay craft via hologram, Secura had Bly perform a quick reconnaissance, telling the commander to take a squad of LAAT/i gunships to determine the situation and only fire on the enemy if they were attacked first. One of the Republic gunships was spotted by the Separatist frigate; on the frigate's bridge, the droid lieutenant informed the Neimoidian of the enemy's presence. The captain ordered squadrons of Vulture droids, Hyena bombers, and Single Trooper Aerial Platforms to attack the Republic craft. Noting that all of the dispatched forces were droids, he announced that he would not have to worry about sharing credit for what he presumed to be an imminent success. However, Bly's gunship dealt with the majority\u2014if not all\u2014of the droids dispatched, and the Republic craft also managed to shoot down Alama's ship, denying the Neimoidian captain his two victories."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dressed in purple robes and wearing a similarly colored miter, the Neimoidian was the commander of a Separatist frigate assigned to patrol duties in the Outer Rim. He believed that a good Neimoidian commander made his own opportunities. Holding a contemptuous attitude toward the droids under his command, the captain was almost continually finding fault in the reports of his battle droid lieutenant. He did not believe in sharing with them the glory that he believed he would receive after successfully dealing with both the Weequay pirates\u2014who had previously held Confederate Head of State Count Dooku\u2014and the Republic forces on reconnaissance in the area.
