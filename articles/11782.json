The Badawans proved to be too unruly for Dooku, Darth Maul, Asajj Ventress, and Poggle the Lesser to handle; forcing them to seek the help of Darth Sidious. Darth Sidious traveled to Mustafar and began disciplining the Badawans. However, his lesson was interrupted by the arrival of Galactic Republic and Jedi forces including the former Sith clone Jek-14, who had allied himself with the Jedi. The Badawans and their Sith masters were defeated by Jek-14 and left on a magma rock."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
