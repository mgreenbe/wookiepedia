In the proximity of droids, members of the sentient Gotal species could experience fierce headaches, as their conical horns made them sensitive to electromagnetic fields.

After the formation of the Galactic Empire, the genetically defective clone Wrecker began suffering increasingly severe inhibitor chip-related headaches after sustaining a series of head injuries."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
