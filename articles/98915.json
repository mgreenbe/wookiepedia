Shortly after the Battle of Hoth, she met with representatives of the Alliance to Restore the Republic and asked them to aid in confronting the Imperial presence on Jaresh. After initially refusing, Rebel leader Princess Leia Organa agreed to help and asked Nyessa if there was a barn they could hide in before the battle began. Nyessa suggested Grimshaw's as it overlooked the corral being used by the Imperials to hold the locals' livestock and claimed that Grimshaw could be trusted, despite being her cousin. During the battle, two of the Rebels rushed from the barn to attack the Imperials, while the commando Lokmarcha remained inside and provided cover fire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
