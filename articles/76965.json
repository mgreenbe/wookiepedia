Adhering to the ways of the Ren, a philosophy epitomized by the lightsaber, the Knights roamed the galaxy causing wanton destruction as devotees of the dark side of the Force.

They were an enclave of masked elite warriors wielding distinctive weapons for ranged and closequarter combat, making them the elite and fearsome enforcers of Kylo's will. The Knights hailed from the galaxy's Unknown Regions where their name and reputation inspired centuries of cautionary tales about the dangers lurking in uncharted space. Though local folklore warned of the marauders known as the Knights of Ren, the exact origins of their modern incarnation remained mysterious, for they were either directly connected to that ancient tradition or wrapping themselves in the legacy of legends. Nevertheless, the New Republic-era Knights of Ren were a force to be reckoned with. Their martial prowess was without equal, and they thrived in violence and strife."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Knights of Ren were neither Jedi nor Sith, but a new generation of warriors imbued with the power of the Force, though not to the extent of the aforementioned Jedi or Sith. As such, the Knights only allowed Force-sensitive beings to join their ranks. Even if a non-Force user was more inclined to their way of thinking than a potential recruit, the Knights would sooner kill them than accept one who could not feel the Force. Aside from the requirement of Force-sensitivity, admission into the group necessitated that a personal sacrifice be made. Another Knight known as \"Ren\" once asked a candidate for the Knights to kill his own brother, and Snoke warned Ben Solo that the price of entry was steep. Ultimately, the path to becoming a Knight of Ren ended in only one of two outcomes: succeed and join the Knights, or fail and die. Not many individuals sought out the Knights of Ren, and those who did regretted it quickly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Knights' connection to the Force was muted by a lack of formal training, whereas Kylo himself had the potential for limitless power, being gifted with the raw strength of his bloodline. Nevertheless, the dark side of the Force was with them. When other Force users sensed the Knights' presence, they would feel the cold touch of the dark side emanating through the Force. In past generations, the Knights would have been considered perfect stock for the Galactic Empire's Jedi hunters, the Inquisitorius, if they could be tamed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In combat the dark side surged through the Knights despite possessing only slight Force abilities. Jedi Master Luke Skywalker was unimpressed by their battle skills and basic use of the dark side. According to Skywalker, who fought six of the seven Knights with the Force as his ally, the group was clumsy and untrained. He compared their use of the dark side to the way one used a hammer, whereas Skywalker, the last fully-trained Jedi Knight, wielded the light side as a blade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Knights were served by Albrekh, an eccentric Sith alchemist and metalsmith known for his dexterous, steady hands. An alien whose sensitive ears could tell the heat of metal from the tone it made when struck, Albrekh made use of an ancient Sith forge for the purpose of repairing and improving the Knights' battle gear. His additional equipment included a series of four poseable arm mechanisms with magnetic forceps and reverse-repulsorlift grav-focused bases. The device was used in conjunction with a compressed air cooling nozzle and a molten Sarrassian iron application tool."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Knights traveled aboard a customized starship known as the Night Buzzard. A modified Oubliette-class transport manufactured by Osseriton Assemblages, the Night Buzzard was originally a dungeon ship from Osseriton, a penal world in the Unknown Regions. The Knights appropriated the transport for their personal use and altered its appearance to fit with their dark style. Additionally, they made crude modifications to the vessel's engine systems, generating greater thrust but at a cost to its insulation baffles. This resulted in the Night Buzzard spewing a trail of thick, noxious smoke."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite Kylo Ren's ties to the First Order, the other Knights were not aligned with the Imperial remnant, as Kylo and Supreme Leader Snoke were the only Force-sensitive members of that regime. They were an independent, mobile group whose aim was to spread chaos and violence wherever they went. After Snoke was killed by Kylo, the Knights' presence became more common within the First Order's ranks. Where they once traveled the galaxy as marauders and mercenaries, the Knights became enforcers of Kylo's reign as the new Supreme Leader. However, only Kylo had the authority to command them, as the Knights would answer to no one else. This singular devotion to one individual created friction between the Knights and the members of the Supreme Council. After Kylo was redeemed to the light side of the Force and became Ben Solo once more, the Knights did not follow him. In spite of the fact that he had come to view the Knights as his faithful brothers, they had never truly been loyal to their so-called master because, while they were not Sith themselves, their true master had always been the Sith Lord Darth Sidious."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Membership"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aside from the leaders of the group, the Knights of Ren consisted of six members: Vicrul, Cardo, Ushar, Trudgen, Kuruk, and Ap'lek.

Every victim felled by his weapons augmented Vicrul's power in the dark side, which was muted by his lack of Force-training.

His latent Force talents, though unbidden and uncontrolled, manifested themselves in heightened reflexes and the power to magnify the fear in his prey."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cardo created wide swathes of destruction, whereas his fellow Knights preferred to strike with exacting precision.

While those who fought back earned his respect, Ushar would kill them all the same, but faster as they had earned a swift death in his view."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kuruk was the most solitary of the Knights. In addition to his role as the group's rifleman, he served as the pilot of the Night Buzzard.

While Kuruk's helmet was designed to focus his attention on his target, his aim was further sharpened by concentrating on the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ap'lek reveled in deception and strategy, employing feints and misdirection to trap an opponent. In this he differed from the other Knights, who preferred a straightforward and violent approach to eliminating their targets. His nascent Force abilities allowed Ap'lek to peer through the smoke screens that he would create to obscure an enemy's vision and disrupt sensors. As a warrior, his preferred lethal weapon was an ancient Mandalorian executioner's vibro-ax."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the rise of Kylo Ren, the Knights followed the aforementioned leader who was also known by the name of \"Ren,\" although he insisted that the group did not follow him but rather their way of life. Nevertheless, Ren was the spokesperson of the group, as he would introduce them by name to enemies and potential allies alike. A devotee of the dark side, he followed the Knights' guiding principle, the Ren, and believed in it on a personal level."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After renouncing the Jedi path, Kylo Ren became the archetype of this new generation of dark side warriors that emerged to fill the void left by the Sith's demise. Adopting the title master of the Knights of Ren, his ability to use the Force granted him many impressive combat skills. Despite his Jedi training and knowledge of arcane dark side lore, Kylo was neither Jedi nor Sith, but a combination of both sides' teachings. This created an imbalance within him, however. Though gifted with the raw power of his grandfather, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, Kylo struggled to overcome the light side within himself. Following his ascension as Supreme Leader of the First Order, Kylo called on his Knights to serve as his personal bodyguards in the same way that the Elite Praetorian Guard protected his predecessor, Supreme Leader Snoke."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Philosophy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Knights of Ren lived by a code, to which they were flexible in following: living life the way they wanted, taking what the galaxy gave them, and consuming what the dark side sent them. The Ren, a lightsaber possessed by Kylo Ren's predecessor, also known as Ren, epitomized the Knights' code. The nature of the Ren, according to Ren, was that it just existed. It had no conscience, neither acknowledging or expressing concepts such as morality, regret or concern for what it might destroy. Ren believed in this principle on a deep, personal level to the point where he did not consider himself the Knights' leader. All of the Knights, including Ren himself, followed the lightsaber and what it represented in their view."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their devotion to the way of the Ren was matched only by their allegiance to the shadow\u2014the dark side of the Force. The Knights did not search for just any Force-sensitive individuals to join the ranks; they wanted those who had a strong affinity for the shadow. This led Ren to consider a mass murderer and a child for membership, having sensed the shadow's presence in both of them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Knights believed that they had a right to take anything and everything they so desired, particularly Jedi artifacts. As such, they held no regard for Luke Skywalker's claim on all properties of the Jedi Order. Ren's understanding of the Jedi Code was limited, though he suspected that the ideological differences between his Knights and the Jedi were severe, making coexistence impossible in his view. Although their ways failed to impress Skywalker, their lawlessness and power appealed to his young apprentice, Ben Solo, who thought of the Knights for years before ultimately leaving the Jedi Order to join their ranks."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Armor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Knights of Ren wore battered, hand-crafted armor that, combined with their weapons and battle helms, added to the aura of dread surrounding them. Being well acquainted with violence and strife, they wore the scars and implements of such on their armor. They appeared intimidatingly unified at first glance, but on closer examination each Knight was distinct, expressing preferences in combat style and tactics. All of their gear was custom, created through a combination of originality and heavy modification upon capture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ap'lek wore lightweight plastoid armor beneath his tunic and a water-shedding oiled cloak. His gauntlets and greaves featured raised teeth to assist in parrying and pinning edged attacks. He also wore a smoke canister on his belt. Cardo's coat was flame resistant and made from the hide of riftiaworm. His accessories included a blaster pistol holster on his left leg, tri-braced plasteel-armored greaves, a chest strap to carry concussion grenades, and plasma bolt shells on his lower chestplate. Kuruk's attire was made of a sound-dampening susurra-weave fabric. He had soft-soled boots for silent tread and collar rings to carry his plasma bolt shells. Trudgen's robes consisted of a heavy weave tabard and hood. It was accessorized with armor plates that were taken from his fallen enemies. Ushar wore ironweave vambraces, which made for a crushing backhand. Vicrul's coat was made from the skin of an unknown, monstrously large reptile."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like the other Knights, Kylo Ren was dressed in black robes and armor. His cowl was a remnant from his early training, the attached cape was singed from multiple battles, and the robes concealed his padded armor. He later replaced his old cape and cowl with a hoodless cape that was made of static-dampening fabric, grounding electrical interference. After seizing control of the First Order, Ren donned a treated cloak that was flame retardant."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Helmets"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Knights concealed their faces beneath ominous masks, echoing the helmet of Kylo Ren himself. The Knights purposely shielded their features with masks and battle helms, using theatricality to enhance their fearsome appearance and generate greater levels of terror in their opponents. They believed that anonymity equaled intimidation, for their victims would project the most terrifying nightmares into the absent faces of the Knights who struck them down. The purpose of their masks predated Kylo, as the Knights had been concealing their faces since the time of Ren, their original leader. In situations where intimidation did not suit their purpose, the Knights would remove their helmets, as Ren did for Solo, who, later as Kylo, revealed his own face to the scavenger Rey. General Armitage Hux hated that the Knights covered their faces with masks, but speculated it was to hide that they were hideous and scarred beyond recognition."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each helmet was unique to the individual Knight. Cardo's helmet was the most basic of the Knight helms; it was a blast furnace plate molded into a mask and included a neck protector. Ushar's helmet featured an impact crumble left by an opponent, and had breathing tubes as well as anti-ox filters suggesting that Ushar or his mask was of non-human origin. Vicrul's case-hardened helmet was made of pastillion ore and featured synth-leather ear flaps to conceal its opening seam."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The patchwork helmet of Trudgen, the Knight who collected trophies from his victims, incorporated a fragment of a death trooper's helmet into its design. Kuruk's helmet had a breath screen and vocoder grid as well as blinder flannels designed to focus his vision forward and recesses cut for peripheral line-of-sight. Ap'lek wore a patchwork mask that he created by cobbling together pieces of broken armor. The faceplate was molded into the shape of an unsettling, sinister face of a trickster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like his fellow Knights, Ren wore a helmet that concealed his features. Red markings adorned the helmet's faceplate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kylo Ren's helmet was patterned after the battle gear of the Knights of Ren; it served the twofold purpose of concealing his identity and enhancing his imposing demeanor. Servomotors were attached to the helmet, controlling articulated arms that separated the face mask from the helmet, which allowed Kylo to remove his helmet revealing the uncontained malice in his expression. The silver inlay visor radiated from the eyes as a symbol of power, and the helmet's integrated vocabulator projected Kylo's voice. Beneath the mask's theatrics, however, he was still Ben Solo\u2014son of Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa. In a fit of rage, Kylo smashed the battered combat helmet until nothing but shards remained."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once free of Snoke's rule, however, Kylo reclaimed his shattered helmet and gave the fragments to Albrekh so that it could be reconstructed. The eccentric metalsmith applied his skills in Sith alchemy to fuse the shards back together. The reforged helmet symbolized the breaking and rebuilding of Ren's own identity. It was also stronger than before due to the alchemical lattice of Sarrassian iron that Albrekh painstakingly applied throughout the helmet's cracks. As a side effect, the helmet now featured a webwork of luminous red Sarrassian iron holding the shards together."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Weapons"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each Knight was armed with a unique and lethally effective weapon, suited to both close-quarter and long range combat. Ushar and Ap'lek favored primitive melee weapons, such as weighted clubs and axes, with crude technological enhancements. The muscle-power of their wielders alone was enough to ensure that these weapons delivered crushing blows. However, with the flick of a switch or the twist of a dial, they took on additional attributes that could make the difference in battle. Ushar's war club had a kinetite charged end with concussion vector vanes and was held with a firm grip on the blunt, studded end. The war club had a studded pummel and a concussion absorption head. Its ability to build up a concussion charge in a kinetite generator could be released in a sudden shockwave. In addition, Ushar carried a vibromachete in an inverted sheath on his torso as well as three thermal detonators. Ap'lek's long ax was an antiquated executioner vibro-ax of Mandalorian origin. The weapon was modified with various upgrades, such as an ultrasonic generator cable, making it a conduit for ultrasonic energy, and therfore, vibrating its sharpened end to enhance its cutting power through armor and bone. It was also equipped with vibro-insulator plates to protect the handle. The blade was made from beskar with gore channels cut into the surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vicrul and Trudgen wielded blade weapons, both of which featured ultrasonic vibro-tech settings that increased their lethality to the point where even glancing hits could cause fatal lacerations. The blades were made of crucible steel saturated with phrik or beskar filaments, granting them considerable strength and durability. Though a lightsaber could cut through these weapons, it required a greater application of pressure from the wielder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vicrul's scythe featured an annealed phrik vibro-scythe blade, with carved ultrasonic echo channel along the chine of the blade, and was shaped into a sawtooth crook for catching enemy blades. The blade was connected to the ultrasonic generator chamber on the opposite end by an insulated handle. Trudgen's vibrocleaver was his signature weapon. Though the enormous vibrocleaver was a traditional, primitive weapon, its add-on modification caused the blade edge to rapidly vibrate through ultrasonic technology, granting it extra cutting power. Trudgen also carried a secondary blade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike the other Knights who favored melee weapons for closequarter combat, Kuruk and Cardo brandished blaster weaponry\u2014heavily modified and customized to their personal preferences. As such, Kuruk's blaster rifle and Cardo's arm cannon were unique  hodgepodge constructions. The blaster rifle had three firing modes across two barrels, including a pump-action plasma bolt launcher that fed specialized ammunition into the larger firing chamber. It had a rapid-fire barrel with a cooling sheath, an upper sniper barrel with a direct line-of-sight feed to the macroscope, a pump-action bar, a vented stock for recoil reduction, and a tibanna bulb spikes laser output."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cardo's over-powered arm cannon made him the equivalent of a one-man turret. The weapon pod's uppermost barrel was a rapid-fire repeating laser cannon. The same channel was also capable of launching plasma bolts, which were hand-fed into a receiver. The bolts were primed by a separate trigger, allowing the next trigger-pull to release it. The lower barrel was a flammable gel projector. The laser cannon featured an air-cooled barrel; its front view had piezoelectric flame projectors flanking the recessed gel spinneret and a forward handgrip and trigger selector. The weapon's bolts had casing to contain the plasma charge and rifling grooves for increased accuracy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to their primary weapons, Vicrul and Cardo had holstered blaster pistols that were almost standard with the exception of the removal of safety circuitry, allowing them to expend their ammunition more quickly and dangerously. The pistols' accessories included a backflash suppressor housing, power level indicator lights, and a stun setting toggle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The warrior known as Ren carried a red bladed lightsaber during his time as the original leader of the Knights of Ren. Ren's saber was equipped with a kill switch that would, when activated, cause the weapon to detonate if it left his hand.

Its crude appearance suggested it was constructed by an inexperienced hand. However, Kylo preferred its unstable, volatile nature and could have repaired his lightsaber if he so wished. Its partially exposed inner workings allowed for easy modification and upkeep."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like all Jedi lightsabers, Kylo's saber was powered by a kyber crystal but one that was damaged, making the weapon dangerously unstable. The stressed, bifurcated crystal was located within the shaft and could barely contain the power of the weapon, necessitating the lateral plasma vents that produced the crossguard blades or quillons as tributaries of the central blade. The quillon blades vented the kyber crystal's excess power. The resulting weapon was a crossguard lightsaber, modeled on an ancient design dating back thousands of years to the Great Scourge of Malachor. The primary plasma blade and quillons in the kyber field matrix had the appearance of serrated blades due to the cracked kyber crystal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The crossguard blades emerged soon after the main blade snapped into existence, helping to balance the power of Kylo's lightsaber. Its unstable serrated plasma blade left a trail of embers with each swing. The quillons were created through an array of focusing crystal activators served to split the plasma stream into perpendicular blade energy channels. The emitter shrouds on the crossguard protected the bearer's hand from the smaller blades.

Having learned of Karrst through a friend of the Knights, they spent some time looking for the siblings, who were almost captured by Sector Security when the dark gang found them. The Knights immediately descended on the lawmen, pushing them back and establishing a secure perimeter around the brothers. Using their weapons and Force abilities, the six Knights slaughtered the SecSec team while their spokesman, the warrior known as \"Ren,\" approached the would-be prisoners. Ren assessed the situation and concluded that SecSec was determined to apprehend Karrst and Filin, who were responsible for killing at least a hundred people. Though the Knights were also after them, they did not wish to capture or kill them. Instead, they wanted Karrst to join their ranks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Karrst was like the Knights, possessing an inherent sensitivity to the Force or \"shadow\" as the Knights referred to its dark side. Karrst was able to demonstrate his natural ability with telekinesis. His talents impressed Ren and demonstrated proof of what the Knights learned about him from their contact\u2014that Karrst could touch the shadow. Filin pledged his allegiance and that of his brother to the Knights, promising to follow Ren if the Knights helped them to escape from the SecSec forces. However, Ren clarified that it was not he whom the Knights followed, but rather his lightsaber and the way of life that it represented. Ren devoted his life to living by the Knights' code; immersing himself in the shadow, he fought its battles, preserved its artifacts, and consumed the power it gave him. He invited Karrst to do the same, but first they required a sacrifice: the murder of his brother."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before Karrst could make his choice, Filin fatally shot his older brother. In doing so, he believed the Knights would let him join their ranks in Karrst's place. While Ren applauded Filin's actions, respecting his willingness to commit fraticide in order to survive, he ultimately killed Karrst's younger brother who was not born with a strong connection to the Force. Trudgen noted that the mission did not go as planned, but it was of little consequence to Ren, who believed that their master would eventually find someone else for them to recruit.

The Jedi of the time used it as a storage site, and having never returned to gather their items, it was more of a treasure trove than an outpost. Among its artifacts were Jedi holocrons and exotic weapons. Ren and his Knights intended to raid the outpost and take everything of value. However, the outpost was also visited by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, his young apprentice Ben Solo, and the explorer Lor San Tekka. In addition to mentoring his nephew in the ways of the Force, Skywalker scoured the galaxy searching for arcane lore that could aid his quest to rebuild the Jedi Order.

As the Knights and Skywalker prepared for battle, Ren was musing on how it was almost be a shame to kill the last Jedi, as it would be the first and only Jedi he would ever get to kill. Regardless, he gave the order to attack, causing the Knights to spring into action. With the exception of Ren himself, the other Knights charged in unison, assuring themselves that one man who stood alone against six warriors could not win. Though Skywalker conceeded that he was indeed one man, the Jedi knew that he was not alone with the Force as his ally.
