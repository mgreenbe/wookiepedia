The plant consisted of resin-covered vines, and once a being was caught in the vines, the plant was able to react to the victim's movement by tightening around limbs in order to hinder and prevent movement. In 44 ABY, the Sith apprentice Vestara Khai was blinded by pollen and subsequently caught in a bloodvine that hung over the edge of a cliff. She cut herself free with her lightsaber, and Jedi Knight Ben Skywalker carried her back to the ground with the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
