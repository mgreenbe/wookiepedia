They were mass-produced during the Dark Nest Crisis and used against both the Chiss Ascendancy and the Galactic Alliance. There were two main variants: one with a rocket-powered engine, the other with an ion drive. The latter became much more common as the Gorog assumed a more active role in the Colony and began making preparations for war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two types of fuel seem to have been used on the rocket-powered dartships. The Qoribu nests for a time used methane. Jaina Solo believed the colony's reluctance to switch to hydrogen was because the Killiks produced the methane themselves. It was later deduced by R2-D2 that a swarm of the craft that attacked the Millennium Falcon were powered by hydrogen, as they had a far greater performance ratio than normal dartships. These fighters were later revealed to belong to the Gorog; however, ion propulsion found prevalence among the Dark Nest as it tightened its grasp on the colonies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These fighters were also notorious for their ramming tactics which was used around Qoribu when dartships en masse rammed a Chiss Ascendancy Star Destroyer and destroyed it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dartships also carried payloads of \"primitive\" chemical explosives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
