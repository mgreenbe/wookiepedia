Despite being a famous tourist attraction, it was not discovered to be a Jedi temple until Jaina Solo visited it in 44 ABY, as its makers caused its Force signature to be hidden as protection. While there, Jaina discovered the Sakuub Holocron in the ruins, as well as entered a skirmish with a Sakuubian criminal named Pharika."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
