They were sold by the Sullustan slaver, Thila and made her very rich. In reality, however, the holos were clever fakes; Thila was actually Dawn Arkanian, an operative of the Alliance to Restore the Republic who bought slaves and then transported them to Rebel safe worlds. The holos were part of her cover as a sadistic slaver."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
