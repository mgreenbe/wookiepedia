The Sith were also searching for Shan on the surface of the planet, and had blockaded Taris to prevent her escape. Revan, seeking to rescue the Jedi, made an agreement with Gadon Thek, the leader of the Vulkars' rival gang, the Hidden Beks, and entered the swoop race on their behalf.

Shan was wary of trusting the mercenary, but sensed no deceit from him. She and Revan infiltrated the base with the assistance of the droid T3-M4 Kang had commissioned from Janice Nall, and managed to steal the codes after defeating the Sith Governor that Malak had placed in charge of Taris. Ordo then took Shan and Revan to Kang's base, telling Kang that they were potential recruits.

After only a few weeks, Revan had recovered a great deal of his former skill and power with the Force.

While searching on Tatooine for clues about the Star Forge, Shan would be reunited with her estranged mother, Helena. She was saddened to learn that her father had been killed while hunting a canyon krayt dragon for its pearl, which he thought would provide enough credits to pay for the treatment of an unknown fatal illness that Helena suffered from. With Revan's encouragement, they were finally able to reconcile. Shan gave her mother 500 credits to pay for treatment from a doctor on Coruscant.

She soon found herself admiring his passion and unrivaled power and, despite her best efforts, began to slowly fall in love with him. She resisted such feelings, partly because it was forbidden for Jedi to fall in love and partly because she was unable to come to terms with whom he really was. Shan later noted that it caused her a great deal of pain and guilt. Though he was now a true Jedi and a good, honest man for whom she cared deeply, he could still return to the dark side of the Force. If that were to happen, Shan would be forced to stop him before he could rejoin Malak. Shan also worried about what would happen when he found out whom he really was.

He told Revan about his former life as the Dark Lord, and Shan was forced to come clean to him, telling him about his mind-wipe by the Jedi Council. Malak told Revan that he had been a mere puppet of the Jedi Council. Revan struggled to understand with both Shan and Malak giving him a different story. Malak made it seem as though Shan was using Revan to indulge her own interest in the power of the dark side, while Shan told Revan that she was trying to redeem him and save the galaxy. After Revan told her that he understood and forgave her, Malak was enraged, and used Force stasis on Shan and Onasi, preventing them from helping Revan while Malak engaged him in a duel.

Shan beckoned Revan to join her, to reclaim the Sith Empire and take revenge on Malak. Revan demanded to know how he could trust her after she had already betrayed him. Shan informed him that she need not deny herself anything anymore, and would stand by his side gladly as his lover and apprentice. Claiming that she would be \"utterly yours,\" she told Revan that they could defeat Malak together. Revan calmed himself, made the choice of a true Jedi, and rejected Shan's offer of power.

Realizing she was no match for him, Shan yielded, pleading with him to quickly end her life for her betrayal. Revan refused, however, telling her that she could return to the light side. Shan didn't believe that she was strong enough, feeling there was too much anger, hatred and fear inside her to ever find peace in the Force again. Revan persuaded her to use their bond, to take her strength from him, and confessed to Shan that he loved her. Shan admitted that she harbored feelings for him as well, and despised herself for keeping the truth about his true identity from him, but asked what good was love in her situation.
