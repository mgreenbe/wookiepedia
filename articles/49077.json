When the flashstick made contact with a target, the weapon emitted a powerful and blinding flash capable of blinding a target for hours. This was especially effective to the native Drall, who were extraordinarily sensitive to bright light - essentially incapacitating them completely. It was less effective on other species of humanoids that did not possess a sensitivity to light: the subject was blinded, but not incapacitated. The device weighed one kilogram and was widely available."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
