The level was a maze of pipes, sluices and catwalks located underneath the compactors of the shady Level 1997 and the open abyss of Level 1995. Shortly after the destruction of the planet Alderaan, Anandra Milon and Santigo Milon, two children originally from Alderaan, fled to Level 1996 in an attempt to escape a pair of Imperials. Once they reached the level, Anandra told Santigo to keep running while she delayed their pursuers and when a stormtrooper chasing them arrived on the level via turbolift, he found Anandra waiting for him on a catwalk. The trooper first tried to get the girl to surrender, but the pair ended up fighting until a Herglic criminal arrived from Level 1997 and threw the trooper to his death below in Level 1995. The Herglic then told Anandra that she would find help on Level 1782 before leaving."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Level 1996 first appeared in \"One Thousand Levels Down\", a short story written by Alexander Freed and published in Star Wars Insider 151 in 2014."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
