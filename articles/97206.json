He moved to subjugate the planet Tandankin, a world within his domain, and conscript its population as workers for the Empire, but his efforts were thwarted by the members of the Alliance Rogue Squadron.

Following the Battle of Endor, a significant Rebel victory in the Alliance's war against the Empire, Nivers became a warlord, just as several other Imperial officers had in the wake of Emperor Palpatine's death. A few weeks after the Battle of Endor, Nivers moved to take control of the planet Tandankin, an Outer Rim world located in the region of space under his authority. After claiming the world in the name of the Imperial government, he announced to Tandankin's citizens that they would either serve the Empire as workers or face severe consequences."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His speech was cut short, however, when the X-wing starfighters of the Alliance's Rogue Squadron suddenly appeared in the skies above Tandankin and opened fire on Nivers's forces, much to the excitement of the planet's beleaguered populace. After a relatively short engagement, which saw the destruction of the Grand Moff's force of TIE fighters before they could even deploy, the Rebels managed to capture Nivers and the remaining Imperials. The Grand Moff's short-lived occupation of the planet, less than a day old, was brought to an end. Nivers's rival, Warlord Zsinj, absorbed what was left of the Grand Moff's territory into his own domain, while many of Nivers's followers eventually joined up with the forces of self-proclaimed Supreme Commander Ennix Devian in the Spawn Nebula."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A white-haired Grand Moff of the Empire who became a warlord after the Emperor's death, Nivers controlled an area of space that included Tandankin.
