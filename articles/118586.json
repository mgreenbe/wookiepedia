She had what appeared to be a personality quirk: an obsession for pazaak. She was a regular at the Pazaak Den next to the Nar Shaddaa Refugee Sector cantina. One reason she was so popular was because, despite having a passion for the game, she was very bad at it, and would often lose large sums of credits on wagers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By chance, S4 met Meetra Surik, who was looking to draw out the infamous Champ. However Surik became suspicious of her personality quirk, and discovered that the supposed faulty programming that had compelled S4 to come to the cantina and play, was in fact a cleverly disguised routine for gathering sensitive information by remote. To further her goals, Surik fixed the programming and S4 lost interest in the game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "S4-C8's first and only appearance was Obsidian Entertainment's 2004 Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords video game.
