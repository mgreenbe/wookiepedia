Arbeloa's message warned them about the extragalactic invaders known as the Yuuzhan Vong, whose fleet had obliterated his homeworld. At the same time, the Pythea's long-range scanners detected the incoming fleet. The crew attempted to send a transmission to Artorias, the first inhabited planet in the fleet's trajectory, but they were too far away for it to be received. Deciding that it was more important to get closer and warn Artorias than it was to escape, the crew of the Pythea edged the ship toward the Yuuzhan Vong fleet and rerouted all power to the transmission. Noticing the vessel, the Yuuzhan Vong sent several ships commanded by Azca to intercept the Pythea."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the Pythea could defend itself against the incoming vessels, Yorik-Vec ships began to fire on the exploratory ship. While the Yuuzhan Vong began to breach the Pythea's hull, the transmission finally reached Artorias. Panha and Sarkkin informed Dulac, the transmission's recipient and friend to the planet's king, of the fleet and sent to him all of the data that they had gathered on the armada as well. After Dulac received the information, the Yuuzhan Vong successfully penetrated the Pythea's hull and warriors began to board the vessel. The boarding party was killed by the crew, and\u2014realizing that the Yuuzhan Vong wanted to take them alive rather than kill them\u2014Panha and Sarkkin rammed the Pythea into a Miid ro'ik cruiser. The impact destroyed both the cruiser and the Pythea, as well as several Yorik-Vecs nearby. The Pythea's sacrifice became one of the first strikes against the Yuuzhan Vong during their invasion of the galaxy. The warning to Artorias, however, was in vain, as Dulac, the being who received the message, was in reality a Yuuzhan Vong spy. Because of this, the Yuuzhan Vong attack on Artorias took the planet's population by surprise, allowing the invaders to conquer the world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Commanders and crew"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Pythea was owned and operated by Panha and Sarkkin until their deaths and the ship's destruction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Pythea first appeared in Refugees, Prologue, an online preview of Star Wars: Invasion, a comic series published by Dark Horse Comics.
