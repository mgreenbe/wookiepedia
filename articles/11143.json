His primitive world was occupied by Imperial forces and he fled with a group so they could train and arm themselves to take back their world. However, while he was off-planet, the Battle of Endor occurred and the Empire removed their forces from Kalzeron. Khell returned home but was labelled as a coward for fleeing the planet. Ostracized, he left and worked as a mercenary during the First Galactic Civil War. He eventually was employed at Executive Results and was recommended to work for Saujutta-Ok-Topii directly. He was tasked with eliminating rivals to Saujutta-Ok-Topii's power."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
