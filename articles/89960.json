During the time of the New Republic, Mayfeld was recruited by the criminal Ranzar Malk to lead a team to rescue the prisoner Qin from Bothan-Five, a New Republic Correctional Transport.

After Davan was killed, the team reached Qin's cell, before they betrayed Djarin by trapping him in the cell. However, Mayfeld and his allies were defeated by Djarin after he escaped the cell, proceeding to deliver Qin to Malk alone. Mayfeld was later sentenced to 50 years of service at the Karthon Chop Fields for his involvement in the mission. Djarin later sought him out for assistance in tracking down Moff Gideon's ship, a mission which took them to an Imperial remnant refinery on Morak. While there, Mayfeld killed his former superior Valin Hess and caused heavy damage to a substantial section of the refinery.

During that time, he also became a wanted New Republic criminal. Around 9 ABY, Mayfeld was selected by Malk as the leader of a team tasked with rescuing the Twi'lek criminal Qin aboard the New Republic Correctional Transport Bothan-Five located near the Dilestri system alongside the Devaronian Burg, the droid Q9-0 \"Zero\" and Xi'an, Qin's sister. While aboard the Roost space station, Mayfeld was introduced to an additional member of the team by Malk, the Mandalorian Din Djarin, Mayfeld was also informed about Malk's prior work with the Mandalorian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Walking around the station's hangar, Mayfeld took notice of Djarin's personal ship, the Razor Crest, which was to be used to transport the team to Qin's location.

A fight soon broke out between Djarin and Burg after the Devaronian attempted to remove his helmet. Burg accidentally opened a compartment after being knocked back, revealing a child named Grogu inside."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Surprised at Grogu's existence, Mayfeld proceeded to ask multiple questions about him and picked him up.

Tensions grew between Djarin and the team over deciding whether or not to kill Davan.

As the team proceeded to make their way back to the Razor Crest, Zero contacted Mayfeld and informed him that Djarin had escaped, before the Mandalorian began closing the doors around them via the control room. Mayfeld and Qin were separated from Burg and Xi'an when a door closed in between them. After Xi'an and Burg left to hunt for Djarin, Qin ordered Mayfeld to get him off the prison ship and leave Burg and his sister behind.

There, Mayfeld and Djarin commandeered a Imperial Combat Assault Transport designated Juggernaut Five that was carrying rhydonium and disguised themselves as Juggernaut Pilots.

After Djarin went to the terminal in his place and was questioned by Hess, Mayfeld stepped in to cover for him, at the risk of Hess recognizing him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hess invited them both for a drink to congratulate their success on the transport delivery. While talking, Mayfeld became increasingly agitated with how willing Hess was to throw away lives, referencing Operation: Cinder and the atrocities committed on Burnin Konn.

As they flew away, Mayfeld asked Djarin to hand him a cycler rifle. Mayfeld then used it to ignite the rhydonium on the juggernaut they had commandeered earlier, destroying the juggernaught and causing significant damage to the refinery, telling Djarin that it would help him sleep at night. Once they were in the clear, they rendezvoused with Dune and Shand. Mayfeld prepared to be taken back to the shipyards as a prisoner, but Dune commented on the unfortunate \"death\" of Mayfeld in the refinery explosion, telling him that he could walk free on Morak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A human male, Migs Mayfeld was bald and had a red hair beard, light skin, and blue eyes.

Mayfeld was capable with a variety of weapons. He was able to use Boba Fett's cycler rifle with great accuracy to destroy rhydonium shipments on Morak while standing aboard a boarding ramp of a moving Slave I.
