They were cybernetic constructs that were implanted into the body and created a link with the user's brain. Through this link, the implant would provide data on the battle which included information on weapon specifications, troop estimates and other important tactical information. These were provided at the user's request which allowed them to make informed decisions based on what the implant provided them on the battle. Though very useful, they were difficult to produce, expensive and experimental which limited their usage. Scouts were commonly trained in the use of such implants despite their experimental nature."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
