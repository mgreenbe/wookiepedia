However, unlike the Revanchists, these rogue masters began covertly sabotaging the Galactic Republic war effort under the direction of the maverick ex-council member Dorjander Kace. Having come to believe that the Republic was corrupt beyond redemption, Kace and his followers embraced the Mandalorian way of life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After his removal from the Jedi High Council, Dorjander Kace came to the conclusion that the Galactic Republic was irreparably corrupt and that the Mandalorians were far better suited for galactic dominion. Gathering a group of like-minded Jedi Knights and Masters, Kace became a double agent in the Mandalorian Wars for a brief period, serving as part of Revan's movement in appearance only, before his intentions were revealed by the Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick. Kace and his newly-christened Mandalorian Knights ultimately joined Mandalore the Ultimate and his Neo-Crusaders as the Mandalorians' counterpart to the Jedi Order in the war. During his long-awaited infiltration of the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine in 3962 BBY, the Mandalorian Knights surrendered and were returned to the Core Worlds for trial."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
