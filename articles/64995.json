The spacesuit was used for carrying out extravehicular repairs in the vacuum of space. The standard, back-mounted tank could provide life support for up to eight hours, although larger, additional tanks could be added to extend this time to four days. The spacesuit opened at the back which allowed the wearer to put the Model 10 on in under two minutes, with the detachable helmet and textured gloves fitting via sealed locking rings. A control panel on the front of the suit adjusted the life support system. Smuggler Han Solo kept at least three Immediac Model 10's aboard his YT-1300 light freighter, the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
