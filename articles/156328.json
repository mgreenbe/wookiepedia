At one point during said time, the stormtrooper became intoxicated and attempted to devour fifty Spiced Mynock Wings. As a result, a dropship was put out of commission for several days due to the smell caused by the mess he made. Eastern Arch Platoon Leader Ton E'rau used the intoxicated stormtrooper as an example in an official reprimand to the stormtrooper's leader, TK-934.
