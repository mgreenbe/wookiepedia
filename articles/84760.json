It was 1.6 meters tall and vaguely resembled a Human female. It came equipped with a medical database of 50,000 illnesses and a medical support link, maintaining direct communication links with whatever medical facility was nearest, using planetary communication grids to carry out two-way data transmissions. The droid monitored health remotely using video, audio, and vital statistic relays. During emergencies, the droids could independently diagnose and stabilize patients until summoned help arrived.
