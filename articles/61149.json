The space station and its crew of scantechs logged starship traffic in and out of the star system. During the High Republic Era, several anomalies from hyperspace entered the Hetzal system, and the two scantechs aboard the station sent out a system-wide alert. Before the scantechs could escape, another anomaly exited hyperspace near the monitoring station, colliding with it and atomizing the station and its crew."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
