When he arrived there with two members of the Exploration Corps, a Givin astrogator Staguu Itincoovar and the Human pilot Telloti Cillmam'n, the archaeologist started examining a few carving on the walls. He allowed Cillmam'n to look around the place while Itincoovar was searching their starship's database. A bit later, Ryelli found the pilot in another room, wearing an ancient suit of armor which he felt was infested with the dark side of the Force. Cillmam'n then confronted Ryelli, blaming him for giving up the fight after what happened on Geonosis. The two men engaged in a fierce lightsaber duel, and although Ryelli seemed to get the upper hand, the other took the high ground by using a secondary blade from his lightsaber's butt. Ekim Ryelli was then beheaded at the very moment Itincoovar tried to contact him via comlink to announce that the Clone Wars had been won by the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
