However, the concept of droid soldiers had fallen out of favor among Imperial decision-makers due to the Separatists' defeat in the Clone Wars, and the program was scrapped.

But while Kligson, who had committed to an anti-war philosophy after his maiming and rebuilding, had wanted to keep his station out of the Galactic Civil War, Zee-Exthree still maintained a secret allegiance to the Empire. Over time, Zee-Exthree built a clandestine faction of like-minded droids that aimed to overthrow Kligson and claim the Droid World for the Empire.

However, Kligson had outsmarted them, having suspected Zee-Exthree's treachery for some time.

Specifically created to thrive in environments difficult for organic soldiers, Zee-Exthree had plating inspired by Imperial stormtroopers but colored a distinct shade of crimson. 1.9 meters tall, it fought with an AAP-II blaster box in its chest, while boasting enhanced strength and intelligence that wasn't dependent on a central computer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zee-Exthree first appeared in Star Wars 47, written by Archie Goodwin and released in 1981.
