A bowcaster contained a positive-default and negative-default alternating polarizer, along with a conductive bowstring, balanced on each end of the weapon. The polarizing orbs would charge a quarrel and envelope it in plasma energy before firing a destructive blaster bolt from the barrel of the bowcaster, boosting its power with its magnetic field."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
