However the Yuuzhan Vong issued an ultimatum and ordered to surrender a member of the Jedi Order and destroy all droids on the planet in return for the cessation of the attack. The native Aqualish began to destroy droids to appease the invaders. In Imthitill, droids were exterminated all over the city using a massive fire but Jedi Knight Dorsk 82 intended to leave the planet with thirty-eight droids. He was then killed when his starship was shot down upon takeoff by security officers. Nevertheless this was ignored by Warmaster Tsavong Lah and an invasion and occupation of their planet ensued."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
