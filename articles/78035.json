Blista-Vanee was an important figure alongside the likes of Bregius Golthan and Alec Pradeux.

Blista-Vanee was one of six advisors who accompanied the Emperor to the second Death Star in 4 ABY, while Palpatine oversaw the superweapon's construction.

Blista-Vanee himself was loyal and subservient to the Emperor, willing to backstab those who questioned his master's authority. The advisor's roles were myriad, from simple administrative duties, to conferring with the Emperor, to officiating at ceremonies. Palpatine ensured that his advisors constantly fought amongst each other to keep them in check, as well as to prevent them from forming alliances. To this end, he tried to keep them separated, sending each on various non-essential missions throughout the galaxy. He also maintained a select group of a dozen or so in-favor advisors, who frequently met with him and accompanied him off Coruscant; Blista-Vanee was among this group during the Galactic Civil War. With hordes of lesser advisors hoping to take their places, however, those in the circle of favored advisors were insecure of their positions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Blista-Vanee was also a prominent socialite, as well as an avid art collector. He owned a lavish mansion on Coruscant, which had giant transparisteel windows for walls and possessed a much-praised view of the planet's skyline. From here, Blista-Vanee threw elaborate galas and parties."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Emperor Palpatine was unable to attend the festivities for the New Year Fete Week of 3 ABY, as he was attending to business in the Deep Core. A number of advisors were chosen to officiate most of the ceremonies in his absence, one of the most prominent among them Blista-Vanee, alongside the likes of Alec Pradeux, Bregius Golthan, and Sate Pestage. It was the second year running that Palpatine failed to attend the festivities, and other notables, such as Supreme Commander Darth Vader, Grand Admiral Rufaan Tigellinus, and Admiral Thrawn, were also conspicuously absent. Palpatine's advisors were quick to play this fact down, claiming that the upkeep of the Empire required round-the-year work."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The second Death Star"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several months later, the famous Brentaalan opera The Kallea Cycle made its debut on Coruscant; to commemorate, Blista-Vanee held a gala at his Coruscant residence. The Imperial advisor invited the upper echelons of Coruscant's elite society, including Lady Amber Comark; Imperial Grand Admiral Miltin Takel; and Mayli Weng, representative of the Exotic Entertainers' Union. Other, seedier elements of Coruscanti society were also invited, such as spice-dealer Wendell Wright-Sims, who had many upper-class clients, including Takel and Weng."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this time, Advisors Blista-Vanee, Pradeux and Golthan were in a waiting hall of the Imperial Palace when Tiaan Jerjerrod, the moff of the Quanta sector, arrived for a meeting with Palpatine that neither of the advisors knew of. The three advisors disliked being left out of the loop, and waited for Jerjerrod to emerge, mocking him. Blista-Vanee brusquely stated that while Jerjerrod was competent, the moff couldn't be relied upon to carry out an important job. Jerjerrod simply informed them that he had been appointed the director of the newly formed Imperial Energy Systems. In actual fact, Jerjerrod had been appointed as the overseer of the construction of the second Death Star in the Endor system. Palpatine wanted to keep the operation secret, and chose Jerjerrod because he was unlikely to become overly ambitious like the men in charge of the first Death Star had been."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, Palpatine traveled to the Endor system to personally inspect Jerjerrod's progress, taking with him a number of close advisors, including Blista-Vanee, Janus Greejatus, and Sim Aloo. Darth Vader, had already visited Jerjerrod, voicing Palpatine's displeasure at the lack of progress. Palpatine, Blista-Vanee and the other dignitaries arrived aboard the Death Star on a Lambda-class shuttle, and were greeted by a procession of Imperials, including Vader and Jerjerrod. Palpatine decided to stay aboard the station for a time, ostensibly to oversee progress. Aloo and Greejatus later left the other advisors to consult with Palpatine in his throne room. While Blista-Vanee and the others were stationed aboard the Death Star, it was attacked by the Alliance to Restore the Republic. During the engagement, the battlestation was destroyed, and Blista-Vanee was killed along with the other dignitaries aboard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kren Blista-Vanee was a Human male, tall, thin, and exceedingly pale. He stood at a height of 1.6 meters, weighed 76 kilograms, and styled himself as \"His Eminence, Kren Blista-Vanee, Imperial Advisor To Our Most August Emperor.\" Like his fellow advisors, he generally wore lavish, dark costumes derived from the history of his homeworld, and he carried with him a hold-out blaster. A skilled linguist, he was extremely loyal to the Emperor, merciless in dispatching his master's enemies and more than content to backstab any of his fellow advisors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Blista-Vanee was also sneering and contemptuous toward those he considered lower to himself, such as Moff Jerjerrod. Not one to mince words, he spoke his mind to his subordinates without restraint. Like most of the other Imperial advisors, Blista-Vanee prided himself on being informed about all happenings within the Imperial Palace, and he was annoyed at the fact that Jerjerrod met with Palpatine without Blista-Vanee's knowledge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Blista-Vanee's position in the Empire afforded him considerable wealth, and he owned a vast residence on Coruscant, with a large entrance hall whose walls were made of transparisteel, providing a much-lauded view of the planet's skyline, and an honor guard. He was considered a cultured man, an aficionado of the arts and the opera.
