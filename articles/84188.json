He was a member of COMPOR and was unpopular with his comrades. He objected when Kal Skirata and the Null-class Advanced Recon Commandos went into a wardroom on the Redeemer, because the Nulls were clones, Kal was a mercenary, and because Kal and A'den were both sergeants. Captain Ordo cited a regulation stating that officers could invite guests into the wardroom, then head-butted Luszgoti and forced him to apologize. After apologizing Luszgoti scurried off knowing he should have never insulted any of the Null ARCs and to properly understand regulations and properly address both enlisted and officers of the Grand Army of the Republic. Luszgoti was disliked by his fellow soldiers and even the serving droid of Redeemer's wardroom, as shown by the free ale provided to the clones by it after he left the room."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
