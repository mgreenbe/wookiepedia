In time, Tching became a legendary ruler, with the following Tching Dynasty being named after him, and later Atrisians remembered with pride both him and the Kitel Phard Dynasty as a whole.

Around that same year, Xendor, the leader of the Legions of Lettow, discovered a number of secret hyperlanes leading beyond Atrisia. When the First Great Schism concluded with the Jedi Order attacking the Legions at Lettow, several of the Legionnaires fled and left the borders of the Galactic Republic.

The commander of the Eternal Alliance subsequently dispatched a companion to recruit skilled warriors who were up to the task posed by the Atrisian weaponsmiths.

By 17 BBY, Atrisia lay within space controlled by the Empire, and certain elements of the Imperial Military were named after aspects of the ancient Atrisian civilization, such as the atrisian corps of the Imperial Army and the military title Warlord of the Empire. The planet was mentioned in a holobrochure for the Tagge Holographic Museum of Chandrila, and, shortly after the Battle of Yavin, the Rebel Alliance historian Major Arhul Hextrophon noted the history of Atrisia in a compilation of Imperial documents for Alliance Supreme Commander Mon Mothma and other Rebel officers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the death of Palpatine at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Atrisia declared its independence from the Empire, and the Atrisian Commonwealth eventually joined the Empire's successor government, the New Republic, as an Allied Region.

In 38 ABY, the world was also featured in the xenolinguist Doctor Milanda Vorgan's publication \"The Written Word: A Brief Introduction to the Writing Systems of Galactic Basic.\" In her work, Vorgan noted that most people had since come to associate the ancient Atrisian Empire with exotic danger, especially when compared with the state of the modern Commonwealth.

Although the book mentioned \"Uueg Tching of Kitel Phard, 54th Emperor of Atrisia,\" it also introduced the Kitel Phard Dynasty and thus did not definitively establish the nature of the aforementioned \"Kitel Phard.\" In August 1997, the article \"From the Files of Corellia Antilles,\" which was authored by Timothy O'Brien and published in Star Wars Adventure Journal 14, established that Kitel Phard was an astronomical object. When writing The Essential Atlas, a reference book by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry released in 2009, co-author Fry felt that it was \"logical\" to conclude that Atrisia and Kitel Phard referred to the same planet, and thus the two were established by the book to be synonyms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition, due to previously published sources noting Atrisia's antiquity and its cultural importance to the wider galaxy, the authors of The Essential Atlas decided to place the planet in the Core Worlds region of the galaxy, albeit on the very frontier of that region as part of grid square J-12\u2014near the border of the explored galactic territories. This was done intentionally to make Atrisia seem a more exotic location and to provide the authors of future Star Wars media with interesting storytelling possibilities. \"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star, How I Wonder Where We Are,\" a 1990 roleplaying game source article published in Voyages SF 13, had previously placed the Atrisi system in the Harron sector. Since the article was released outside of the Lucas Licensing process, its canonicity within the Star Wars Legends continuity was never confirmed, and The Essential Atlas overrode the Voyages SF 13 placement by establishing that the Atrisi system, and therefore Atrisia, was situated outside of the Expansion Region in which the Harron sector was later placed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to an outline for Fry and Paul R.
