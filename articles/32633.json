Although designed to navigate on water rather than space, it shared many similarities with the N-1 starfighter, which was also build by the Engineering Corps. Such speeders were built specially for the monarch of Naboo and their entourage, and were kept in a section of the royal boathouse of Theed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
