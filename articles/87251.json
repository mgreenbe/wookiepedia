The man was tracked down by the Black Sun because he was transporting a new kind of spice. The gambler accepted to give him shelter but the Black Sun soon discovered the presence of Cal Handro at the estate and besieged the building. In order to get rid of the Black Sun, Martano contacted both the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance to negotiate information about the pilot's location. However, before he could get an answer, a fight erupted between the Black Sun henchmen and a group of spacer who were also searching for the missing pilot. Martano was rescued by the spacers who eliminated all Black Sun forces. As the gambler wished to get rid of Handro as soon as possible, he eagerly accepted to give the location of Handro to the spacers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Martano estate was a location in the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011.
