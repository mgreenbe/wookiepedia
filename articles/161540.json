Around 1 ABY, Louis Bender planned to attack a delivery depot on the outskirts of the city of Kor Vella. However, before the attack could happen, Louis Bender was captured by the Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk. Louis ordered Voba Duey to \"wait\" while he was taken by the Trandoshan. A spacer affiliated with the Meatlumps later arrived in Kor Vella to assist Louis and Voba in the attack of the depot but only found the woman, still waiting. Duey reported the situation to the spacer who decided to rescue the Meatlump leader. The spacer eventually negotiated with Bossk the liberation of Louis Bender in exchange for the elimination of the Bofa Treat Gang."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Voba Duey was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
