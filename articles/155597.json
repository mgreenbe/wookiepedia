During Gwarm's search for the supposed lost treasure of the pirate queen Rane Mahal, the Zygerrian accompanied Gwarm and his gang to Kelada, where they pretended to chase fellow pirate Makkeer into The Labyrinth. Inside the cantina, the smuggler Han Solo believed Makkeer's act, and assisted him in finding the treasure before Gwarm could, searching for Mahal's three NP-unit servo-droids, one of which held the coordinates. When Solo attempted to locate the second droid in the droid museum on Nubia, the Zygerrian stole it with the help of R5-P8 and escaped on a speeder bike. The Zygerrian and R5-P8 decided to steal the treasure for themselves, but the droid was one of the two false droids, instead releasing knockout gas. The gas caused the Zygerrian to fall unconscious, crashing her speeder into a wall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Zygerrian pirate first appeared in the comic story \"Droid Hunters,\" written by Cavan Scott, illustrated by Derek Charm, and published by IDW Publishing in Star Wars Adventures Free Comic Book Day 2019 on May 4, 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
