Strong animals with thick, shaggy pelts, slarga were capable of traversing through the harsh elements of the freezing world and were used as beasts of burden. The Talortai Udi Dis considered the slarga to be ugly creatures, imagining them to be the hideous result of a bio-splicer's experiments in cross-breeding a bantha and a blurrg. He encountered the creatures when traveling to Rystan with Marchion Ro, the leader of the group known as the Nihil. They were met by Ro's cousin, Kufa, who gave the pirates slarga mounts in order to travel to a place referred to as the Shrine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
