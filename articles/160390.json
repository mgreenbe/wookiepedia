The company was founded by businessman Corlin Quarle Deld, who used indentured servants to make the company a success. Eventually, the Empire came to Verkuyl and nationalized the successful business. All of the contracts that bound the workers to the company were erased along with other records by Deld, to make running it more difficult for the Imperials, so they didn't know about them. However, the Empire forced the freed workers to continue to work, but under the banner of the Empire. The bacta workers were given better pay, but they were forced to work more hours with less time off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the formation of the New Republic, Imperial forces were defeated and driven off Verkuyl.
