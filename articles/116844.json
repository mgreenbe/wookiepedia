During the battle, Skywalker and Antilles impromptuly formed Rogue Squadron. In naming the squadron, Skywalker drew inspiration from Jyn Erso and her Rogue One team, who sacrificed themselves to steal the Death Star plans during the Battle of Scarif shortly before the Battle of Yavin. It was the sacrifice of Rogue One that allowed Skywalker and Antilles to fight in and ultimately survive the attack on the Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To honor the actions of Erso and her squad, Skywalker decided the specific phrase \"Rogue One\" should be forever retired.

In 3 ABY, a month after Echo Base was established, Skywalker and Captain Han Solo went missing in the planet's vast snowbanks, however the T-47s weren't ready for Hoth's freezing conditions and temperature was dropping fast as light faded into night. It wasn't until first light that Rebel technicians had finally a figured out the coolant problem and gotten the speeders running. Within an hour, a dozen speeders were in the air, with Rogue Squadron splitting into groups of four to cover the search grid with maximum efficiency. Zev Senesca (Rogue Two) found them both alive. Echo Base was soon after discovered by an Imperial probe droid, and the Rogues were tasked with delaying an Imperial ground assault while Alliance transport ships fled the system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker flew as Rogue Leader in the Battle of Hoth against Imperial AT-AT walkers, with Dak Ralter serving as his rear gunner and Klivian flying as their wingman. Other Rogues in the battle included Senesca, as well as Antilles and Wes Janson as a pilot-gunner pair. When the AT-ATs' armor proved too strong for blasters, Skywalker suggested tripping the walkers' legs using harpoons and tow cables. A direct hit on his speeder killed Ralter, however, leaving the task of tripping the first AT-AT to Antilles and Janson. They succeeded, but Skywalker's vehicle was shot down and crushed by a walker's massive foot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having escaped the wreckage, Skywalker continued the fight by using a grappling hook to ascend to one of the walkers' underbellies. Cutting it open with his lightsaber, he tossed a grenade inside, which exploded and took the AT-AT down. Klivian, meanwhile, rammed his craft into the lead walker, but only after that walker fulfilled its objective of destroying the base's shield generator. Imperial snowtroopers were thus able to enter the base. The delaying tactic proved a success, as a number of Alliance transports were able to escape the system."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Post-Hoth"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the evacuation of Hoth, with Skywalker absent, as he had not reached the predetermined rendezvous point, Antilles was promoted to the rank of commander by The Contessa and given command of what was left of the squadron.
