Stationed on Almas in the Cularin system, Master Dow worked out of the experimental academy located in the city of Forard. Taking the Human Alkin Saad as his Padawan, Dow taught him everything he knew of the Force during their time together. The Master-Padawan pair were stationed at the Academy when the Academy's battlemaster Kirlocca and a group of his charges went missing in the Almas Wasteland."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Master Dow and Padawan Saad were approached by Academy Headmaster Lanius Qel-Bertuk who asked them to investigate the disappearances. As they raced across the wastes in a speeder, they were shot down by a laser cannon operated by the Believers cult. Emerging from the wreckage, Dow found his Padawan dead and was so overcome by grief that he succumbed to the dark side of the Force. Feeding off the strong dark side energies in the wastes, Dow remained at the crash site where he was discovered by the Heroes of Cularin. Believing that the Heroes had killed Saad, Dow attacked the men and women in a fit of rage. Without injuring the Duros, the Heroes were able to bring Master Dow back to his senses, and the Master let go of his anger and apologized, turning away from the dark side. After directing the Heroes to the campsite of Master Kirlocca, Master Dow arranged for the Squib Squeerie to transport him to Forard where he could receive treatment and take counsel at the academy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
