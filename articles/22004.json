The Republic group was to deliver a ransom in the form of spice to Weequay pirate leader Hondo Ohnaka, who was holding captive the Separatist leader Count Dooku.

Like all clone troopers, Stone was a clone of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett and trained on the planet Kamino. During the war, he served in the Galactic Republic's Diplomatic Escort Group, a branch of the Coruscant Guard. Stone was often tasked with guarding senior Republic officials on dangerous missions to worlds near the front lines. He spent long stretches of the Clone Wars far from the front while on Coruscant, and his primary responsibility was protecting the planet and its institutions, leaders and people. In 22 BBY, the Weequay pirate leader Hondo Ohnaka captured Count Dooku, the leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and demanded a ransom of one million credits in the form of spice from the Republic in exchange for the Count. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine subsequently dispatched Senator Kharrus and Gungan Representative Jar Jar Binks, under escort by Stone and some of his troopers, to deliver the ransom to Ohnaka's headquarters on Florrum."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving in a Nu-class attack shuttle in the atmosphere of Florrum, Kharrus contacted the Chancellor and informed him of the progress of the mission before buckling up for the landing. However, Turk Falso, a member of Ohnaka's gang, betrayed Ohnaka and ordered fellow pirate Barb Mentir to shoot down the Republic ship so that they could take the spice for themselves. Mentir, in a Flarestar-class vessel, managed to shoot down the Republic shuttle. The shuttle crashed into the Doshar fields, and the impact killed both of the shuttle's clone pilots and Kharrus, leaving Binks as the highest ranking officer and therefore commander of the group. While Binks buried the dead Senator, two of Stone's troopers tried to repair the shuttle's homing beacon in order to contact the galactic capital Coruscant but were unable to make it work. Shortly thereafter, Binks spotted Falso and several fellow pirates approaching on swoop bikes, and while Stone believed that the pirates would try to negotiate the ransom, the pirates attacked the clone troopers. Stone ordered his troops into a defensive circle, and the pirates cut the clones off from their crashed ship. Outnumbered, Stone, Binks, and their troops retreated into one of the surrounding acid geysers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Serving under a Gungan"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During their stay in the geyser, Binks discovered that the planet's native skalders were able to detect the geysers' bursts of acid. After the pirates left, Stone and the group returned to the shuttle, only to find that the spice had been stolen by Falso. While Stone proposed that they wait for a rescue party to arrive before doing anything else, Binks insisted on pursuing the pirates using the skalders as mounts, which the group did. The clones soon caught up to the pirates ahead and managed to kill most of them in the ensuing firefight. After recovering the spice, one of Stone's troopers scanned the landscape with macrobinoculars for the pirate base. When the group sighted some energy lines, Stone decided to follow them in order to find the base. Along the way, Binks spotted several pirate tanks, and the group quickly halted and took cover. Stone then sent Binks to \"negotiate\" with the pirates who were piloting the tanks. While speaking with the pirates, Binks climbed up onto one of the tanks and accidentally drove the vehicle into an energy line, collapsing it. In the ensuing chaos, Stone saved Binks by stopping a pirate from shooting him, before congratulating Binks on his \"success.\" The clones managed to capture all of the tanks and proceeded to the enemy base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stone, Binks, and the troopers arrived at the pirate base just in time to find Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2014who had been sent earlier to Florrum and had just escaped captivity from Ohnaka, who had attempted to ransom them to the Republic\u2014holding Ohnaka at lightsaber point. Kenobi ordered Stone to power up the engines of the Twilight, the Jedi's ship, while Kenobi released Ohnaka and told him that he held no grudge against him in spite of his crimes against them.

Stone's training never prepared him for having a Gungan politician as his superior, and though he found the idea of taking orders from Jar Jar Binks to be ridiculous, he nevertheless followed the chain of command.
