It was named after the Teyr Rift, a massive canyon around which the Skyrail is built. The train connects a number of stops around the canyon, including Pyre Folas and Turos Noth, but does not travel into the more rural areas farther away. Tourists would often ride simply for the spectacular views as the Skyrail hugged and sometimes crossed portions of the Rift."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
