It contained mementos of Luskin Exovar's adventures, and was protected by defensive shields and a hypersonic alarm system. Among the mementos on display were a full Imperial Royal Guard uniform, artwork from Master Furva Keill of Alderaan, several Jedi lightsabers, and two battle-worn Thyrsus Sun Guard helmets. Visitors to the Emporium were allowed to leave their own mementos, serving as chance at immortality of their adventures."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
