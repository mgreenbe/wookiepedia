In the wake of the Battle of Yavin\u2014with the tide having decisively turned in the war with the Rebel Alliance\u2014the Sith Lord Darth Vader directly tasked Bzorn with hunting down and laying waste to Rebel-held planets. To this end, he tracked down professor and inventor Renn Volz, a native of Little Kessel who had built a device known as the Ionic Ring Ship that could control a planet's weather from above. Bzorn and a crew of stormtroopers forcibly boarded the Ionic Ring above the planet Zerm, and took Volz's daugher Mira captive to ensure his compliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mira Volz wasn't in Bzorn's hands long, as she managed to slip out of Imperial custody during a transfer to a prison ship at a remote spaceport, coincidentally ending up with a crew of Rebels when she stowed away on Han Solo's Millennium Falcon during her escape. Although his leverage was gone, Bzorn continued to bluff and forced her father to use the Ionic Ring to devastate the Rebel base of Rion.
