When translated from the Mandalorian language of Mando'a to Galactic Basic Standard, the expression meant \"name and soul.\" Comprised of a simple statement of intent, a prospective Mandalorian parent needed only to recite the phrase ni kyr'tayl gai sa'ad\u2014\"I know your name as my child\"\u2014followed by the name of the individual to be adopted. The tradition could be conducted on a singular basis, or toward a group of several individuals, and even in some cases, posthumously. Adoption via the gai bal manda and a dedication to the Resol'nare, the six basic tenets of Mandalorian culture, was often considered all it took to make one a Mandalorian."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The custom of gai bal manda was first mentioned and described in the 2006 Star Wars Insider article, The Mandalorians: People and Culture, written by Karen Traviss.
