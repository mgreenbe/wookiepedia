From 130 to 138 ABY, Medon repeatedly provided the Galactic Alliance Remnant's Core Fleet safe haven from the forces of the Sith Lord Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire. Medon welcomed Alliance Admiral Gar Stazi to Pau City in 138 ABY after a battle between the Alliance fleet and Krayt's Empire, but their conversation was secretly recorded by a mouse droid.

The war pitted Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire\u2014a Sith-led organization that ruled much of the galaxy\u2014against several rebel factions, among them the Galactic Alliance Remnant. Medon was sympathetic to the Remnant and constantly provided its fleet safe haven from Krayt's Empire throughout an eight-year period beginning in 130 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 138 ABY, after the Sith scientist Vul Isen poisoned the oceans of the planet Dac, the Remnant fleet led a massive evacuation of the water world and suffered many casualties during a consequent battle with Krayt's forces. Medon welcomed the fleet to Pau City in the skirmish's aftermath and personally greeted its leader, Admiral Gar Stazi, upon his arrival onworld. As the wounded were unloaded from the ships of the fleet, Stazi promised Medon that he would leave as soon as possible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unbeknownst to either of them, their conversation was recorded by a mouse droid that belonged to Muerdo, an Utai spy employed by the Hutt crime lord Vedo Anjiliac Atirue; Vedo in turn passed the information to the Sith in the hopes of luring Isen into a trap. The scientist had also poisoned the Hutt moon of Da Soocha, and, seeking revenge, Vedo hired Cade Skywalker\u2014a former Jedi who was actively hunting Sith\u2014to go to Utapau and kill Isen, whom Vedo suspected would seek to punish the Pau'ans for harboring Krayt's enemies. Vedo's gamble paid off, and Skywalker slew Isen on Utapau in time to save the planet from a poisonous fate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Telan Medon was sympathetic to the Galactic Alliance Remnant during their struggle against Darth Krayt's Empire and repeatedly gave their fleet safe haven from Krayt's forces over a period of eight years. As Pau'ans had previously been supportive of the Galactic Republic, a government from years past, Medon felt that aiding the Alliance was keeping with tradition. The Port Administrator additionally believed that Krayt's Sith were evil and was dedicated to countering their wickedness; Medon saw the genocide on Dac as particularly evil and, as Port Administrator of Pau City, refused to condone it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Medon was friendly with Alliance Admiral Gar Stazi, who was casual enough with Medon to use the Port Administrator's first name in conversation.
