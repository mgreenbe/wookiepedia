The Republic wasn't able to organize any considerable fleet in time to save the patrol so they sent the renowned Coruscant Aegis squadron to delay the Imperial attack, providing enough time for Republic reinforcements to arrive. Coruscant Aegis, although outmatched, was able to destroy most of the Empire's starfighters and even damage slightly the Imperial capital ships. Eventually the Republic reinforcements arrived and the Imperial fleet retreated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
