Specializing in Jizz music, Figrin played a reed instrument known as a Kloo horn, as well as a percussion instrument called a Gasan string drum. Like his band mates, Figrin was registered with the Intergalactic Federation of Musicians (IFM). Regions of Figrin's highly evolved brain allowed him a special acuity when it came to analyzing and relating to music. In fact, the Devaronian music fan Labria called him possibly the greatest klooist in the galaxy. As such, his talents helped to greatly enhance the quality and popularity of the Modal Nodes' music."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes had entered into an exclusive contract with the Tatooine crime lord, Jabba Desilijic Tiure. They would routinely perform in the courts at Jabba's Palace and his Mos Eisley townhouse, but it didn't take long before they all regretted entering into a contract with the Hutt. Recognizing Jabba's penchant for executing underlings that displeased him at a moment's notice, the Modal Nodes began to fear for their lives. It would only be a matter of time before Jabba decided to make a snack of the musicians, by tossing one down into the dungeon abode of his pet rancor. Fortunately for them, a golden opportunity was fresh at hand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of Jabba's rivals, a Whiphid named Lady Valarian, offered the band 3,000 credits to perform at her wedding to the Whiphid hunter, D'Wopp. Figrin decided that the fast money would enable them to get off Tatooine and out from under the thumb of Jabba the Hutt. They arrived at the Star Chamber Caf\u00e9 reception hall inside of the Lucky Despot Hotel & Casino in Mos Eisley. During one of their set breaks, Figrin took the band's retainer and spent the bulk of it at the casino's sabacc tables. The other musicians grew gravely concerned. Thanks to Figrin's gambling, their chances of getting off Tatooine alive were quickly dwindling."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jabba learned of the Modal Nodes breach of contract and sent several of his bounty hunters down to the casino to disrupt the festivities. As luck would have it, Imperial stormtroopers likewise raided the party and a massive fire-fight broke out. During the confusion, the Modal Nodes met a party guest named Wuher who showed them a quick way out. Wuher put in a good word for them with Chalmun\u2014a Wookiee who owned a nearby cantina where Wuher tended bar. Chalmun hired the Modal Nodes to play a couple of gigs at his bar, the following evening. They were performing the night when Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi entered the cantina seeking a pilot willing to ferry them to the Alderaan system. They continued to perform at Chalmun's on a regular basis. Occasionally, Chalmun's nightshift manager, Ackmena, would liven the bar's atmosphere by singing along with the Modal Nodes' rhythms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after this event, Figrin D'an wagered the band's instruments and equipment on a hand of Sabacc. He lost the bet to Labria, but the Modal Nodes soon convinced him to win their equipment back. He eventually succeeded and the Modal Nodes went on to play the intergalactic circuit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like many Bith, Figrin D'an had no allegiance when it came to those in positions of power and he considered himself politically neutral. This aided him in protecting the group from any hazardous Imperial influences."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a band-leader, \"Fiery\" Figrin D'an was extremely demanding. He was highly critical of every performance and criticized the band heavily if they were to miss even a single note. With the exception of Fizzz-player Doikk Na'ts, Figrin owned all of the band-members instruments and equipment. Figrin was never shy when it came to doling out orders to the others."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aside from being a perfectionist, Figrin was also a glitterstim addict, and a compulsive gambler. He was always open towards accepting contracts if he knew that a Sabacc table and some spice would be close at hand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His name is also spelled as Figrin Da'n in Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Special effects/makeup artist Rick Baker played the part of Figrin D'an in A New Hope.
