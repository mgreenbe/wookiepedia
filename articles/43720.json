Costing 4,500,000, the model was the smallest terraforming device the company sold and was roughly equal in size to a Star Cruiser. The device's layout was similar to a large ziggurat, with stepped sides and a flat top concealing the many internal systems which the machine needed to produce a breathable atmosphere, clean water, and weather patterns. The systems were powered by the subsurface heat and energy of a planet, and used the raw materials available to manipulate the environment around them. Elysiums needed a crew of at least one hundred technicians and engineers as well as droids to work areas of the processor unsuitable for organics. During the colonisation of a world, a Model 2 was often the first thing deployed, with the colony built around the machine. As such, many cities in the Outer Rim Territories included a repurposed or decommissioned Elysium somewhere within their borders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Elysium Model 2 atmospheric processor was created for Far Horizons, a supplement book released by Fantasy Flight Games for their Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying system in 2014."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
