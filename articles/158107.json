She did this to represent the groups of Korunnai raiding the Balawai on Haruun Kal during the Summertime War. It was not really a group, just a name meant to intimidate the Balawai; it had no formal organization, command structure, or even a rank system. The Akk Guards were one of the ULF's few organized units."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
