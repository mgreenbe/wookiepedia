Instead, the rounded plate that served as their rolling surface was able to fold down over their face with a small slot that they could aim and fire through. The plate was armored and was resistant to blaster fire, however, the plate only protected their front and left their sides vulnerable. Their rate of fire was also slower, but provided much more penetrating power. They were designed with a highly advanced targeting computer and were extremely accurate. They were capable of speaking in both binary and Basic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A pair of such droids were used during the Battle of Kiros. They were used to defend a bomb from enemies, these being Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano. Initially, the two Jedi attempted to deflect their weapon fire back at the droids but their front sections were armored to protect them from such an attack. However, Jedi General Skywalker determined that the droids lack such protection on their sides which saw him and his Padawan deflect the sniper droid fire at their sides thus destroying them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sniper droidekas appear in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars series."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They appear in the LEGO Star Wars Movie Short series."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sniper Droids also were used during the Battle of Umbara and were equipped with a bubble shield."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
