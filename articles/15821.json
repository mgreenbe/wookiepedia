She flew a T-65B X-wing starfighter as flight leader in an attack on a nearby pirate base, that threatened the safety of the Alliance's rendezvous point. Her wingmen during the attack were Grizz Frix and Penn Zowlie, and her flight's job was to run interference, covering Janson's flight, who would hit targets on the landing field.
