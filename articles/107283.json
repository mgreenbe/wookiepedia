The scanner used an invisible beam to detect variations; the beam reflected back into the scanner where a microprocessor interpreted the information. The scanner could not penetrate shielded circuitry. Power scanners costed 150 credits to buy, and were readily available for purchase throughout the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
