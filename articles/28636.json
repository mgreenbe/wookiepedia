They possessed twelve legs, were covered in spikes and thorns, and were very fierce. They had a mouth full of razor sharp teeth, roughly fifteen eyes, and vocalizations in the ultrasonic range. They were native to the world of Carida prior to its destruction, however a small population of these creatures lived in the ruins of Kuar. Their carapaces had a gem-like quality, and the arachnids were sometimes raised purely for that purpose, though even the damage incurred during a battle left plenty for trophies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Combat arachnids were renowned for their prowess and fighting capability; Jabba Desilijic Tiure ordered a trio of them to fight his pet rancor; the rancor ultimately prevailed, however it was badly wounded in the fight.
