Following this attack, after they had secured the banner of Clan Cadera, Brokenblade met with Heta Kol, Bask Sunn, and Durn Wynnward. An argument broke out between Brokenblade and Wynnward but was quickly stopped by Kol when she pulled out a thermal detonator and threw it at Brokenblade. Brokenblade managed to catch and keep it from exploding, and was then stabbed twice by Kol as a demonstration of how they all relied on each other. Kol deactivated the thermal detonator, and Brokenblade was assisted by members of Clan Varad before being dismissed to fulfill the orders given to them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
