Barocci was able to calm the daughter's crisis, but later fell to his death off of the tower farm out of exhaustion while participating in a combined Jedi effort, led by Jedi Master Avar Kriss, to prevent a liquid Tibanna tank from colliding with the largest of the Hetzal system's three suns."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tower farm first appeared in the 2021 novel The High Republic: Light of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
