When the Aleena Jedi built his mechanical legs to move around in haste, his lightsaber pike was the requirement for his mechanical arms to use with deadly precision."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Clone Wars started in 22 BBY with the battle of Geonosis, Paratus rarely participated, using his aggressive pike swings to slice battle droids, which he would study in his quarters at the Jedi Temple. When Darth Vader came to initiate Operation: Knightfall in 19 BBY, Paratus fled in cowardice, taking some of his belongings, including his lightsaber pike."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In isolation in a junk Jedi Temple he built on Raxus Prime, Paratus rarely needed to use his weapon, until 3 BBY when secret Sith apprentice Galen Marek came to kill him. Paratus fought with his lightsaber pike, relying heavily on the Force, but in the end, Paratus was killed, and his lightsaber focusing crystal lens were damaged, so they could not be realigned. After this, it was discarded by Starkiller after he attempted to fix it in meditation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
