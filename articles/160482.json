The rifle used magnetic fields to fire small slugs at high speeds unattainable by typical slugthrowers, and produced a distinctive, audible crack as their metal-alloy projectiles broke the speed of sound. And while their rounds were relatively small, the speed with which they impacted a target inflicted great kinetic damage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Available in a number of different configurations, such as pistols, rifles, and sniper rifles, shatter guns were the dream weapons of mercenaries, assassins, and special forces soldiers. However, in addition to being prohibitively expensive and rare outside the Roche Asteroid Field at 30,000 credits, shatter guns were also fragile to the point where dropping the weapon, or even jostling it too hard, could cause it stop firing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
