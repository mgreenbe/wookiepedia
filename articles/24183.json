It was added to the game in the 2005 expansion pack Trials of Obi-Wan. It could be used in the player's home as decoration. It was made from a schematic which comes from inserting three Force-infused items\u2014a chemical antidote, an ammo box, and a shisha\u2014into the Chu-Gon Dar cube, a Jedi relic capable of transmogrification through the Force. These items were looted from the corpses of the various enemies found on Mustafar. Once combined, it produces a schematic of the painting which could be used up to ten times by a Structures Trader to make copies of the painting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
