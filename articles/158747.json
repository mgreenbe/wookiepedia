They were considered classics by mechanics (such as Anakin Skywalker) and nostalgics (such as Yoda) alike, although by those uninterested in speeders, they were considered \"pieces of junk\", an opinion favored by Obi-Wan Kenobi. Regardless of personal views, they were able to be fixed up nicely and could still reach high speeds many years after their original production."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Anakin Skywalker was able to salvage an old VXL speeder to use as a getaway vehicle to aid Obi-Wan Kenobi and himself in escaping from bounty hunters in Death Canyon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
