The program was considered a failure and contributed to the Joint Chiefs becoming disinterested in the use of combat droids, with the notable exception of the KX-series security droid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite this, the experimental Phase II Dark Trooper was evaluated by the Imperial Military during the Galactic Civil War, though these units required a human pilot to operate. By the third generation of the dark trooper, it was decided that the pilot was the final weakness in the design. Thus, it was decided to once again make the dark trooper a type of battle droid. A platoon of third generation dark troopers was used by Moff Gideon's Imperial remnant around the year 9 ABY. IDMR scientists were stationed aboard Gideon's light cruiser to maintain these dark troopers, which were held in cold storage due to their excessive power requirements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The dark trooper program was first mentioned in the Star Wars canon in Dawn of Rebellion, a 2018 sourcebook for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game by Fantasy Flight Games.
