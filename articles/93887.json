They were renowned for their thick hides, extraordinary backbone and possession of two hearts. Kaleesh would slay them with Shoni spears. This pastime eventually evolved into Mumuu-fighting and became a popular spectator sport among the Kaleesh. The Mumuu also were prized for their meat, and they had very high immune systems due to their second heart, not unlike Cereans. They were able to be domesticated by the Kaleesh, but often not for long.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mask protecting the face of Grievous was built on the model of a mumuu skull.
