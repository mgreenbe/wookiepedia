The Damarind station served as a fishing port for the company fleet. Its role was to collect corusca stones that the gas giant produced naturally. However, the station failed to harvest enough gems to keep Damarind Corporation solvent, and the conglomerate went bankrupt eventually."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
