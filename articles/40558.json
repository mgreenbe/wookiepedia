Following the defeat of the Galactic Empire at the Battle of Endor, the locals on Drogheda began pushing for self-rule, hoping to depose the current monarch, Queen Sarna. Sarna, angered by the attempt, began to crack down on the rebels with the use of her Royal Guard, led by Harlech. The oppressed people joined together into a concentrated rebellion, helped by the queen's sister, Danu, who stayed within the Drogheda Citadel, intercepting information from the government, to aid her allies. The revolutionaries eventually were able to capture the Mount Meru Mine, a major source of income for Queen Sarna, threatening her ability to fund the attack on the rebels. Looking for outside help, Sarna recruited her former flame, Lando Calrissian, claiming that the rebellion had been funded by the Empire. Calrissian came to the world, but he was not fooled by the ruse, and he ended up joining Danu and the revolutionaries. The rebels were able to storm Sarna's citadel, defeating her royal guard, and capturing the Queen. Upon Sarna's surrender, the revolutionaries paid Calrissian to take their former leader into exile from Drogheda. Calrissian agreed, and the two left the world. Upon their departure, Danu stated that the locals would now try to set up a new government, a democracy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
