That gang was formed by the young Human, Falk, the Rodian musician Doda Bodonawieedo, and several other like-minded youths. Initially content with minor crimes and fighting with other gangs, the Shawpees eventually moved into protection rackets, running numbers and spice, and fencing stolen goods. Falk and Bodonawieedo eventually left the gang to seek their fortunes as part of Jabba the Hutt's criminal gang."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
