They had been passed down through generations, and by the time of the Galactic Civil War, the Dark Rituals were seen as barbaric and silly to many members of the Ewok tribe ruled by Chief Chirpa, especially the young members of the tribe including Wicket Wystri Warrick. The tribe's shaman, Logray, with Chirpa's backing, performed the Dark Rituals despite protestation of the tribe's youth. Wicket's refusal to take part in the Dark Rituals earned him a banishment from participating in any ritual, including the festivals of the rain and the sun. Following the Battle of Endor, Logray was removed as shaman and replaced by Paploo; Logray cursed the village, predicting doom for \"those who dare mock the Dark Rituals.\" Paploo convinced the Alliance to Restore the Republic droid, C-3PO, who the Ewoks believed to be a golden deity, to perform a cleansing ritual to lift the curse."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
