The \"Screamer\" disguised the starfighter's ion drive emissions, in turn disrupting the sensor systems of enemy fighters, such as TIE/LN starfighters. It was also capable of interfering with the homing computers aboard concussion missiles and proton torpedoes, but was not powerful enough to jam military-grade sensors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
