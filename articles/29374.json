The dish's quirky name was inspired by the Kyuzo Outpost Militia of Niima Outpost on the planet Jakku, who were led by a constable and wore Kyuzo war shield helmets that bore a striking resemblance to the fungus caps used in the dish. At some point following the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY, the Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs included a recipe for the dish in his cookbook, The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the book, Tuggs suggested that  the best place to find large fungus to use in the recipe was the fungal forests of the planet Skako Minor, and stated that a wide range of fillings could be used to stuff the fungus including diced meat, mixed vegetables or even imitation killcrab. Tuggs provided a recipe using his favorite filling, which included bread crumbs and cheese."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Constable's Caps was created as one of the recipes in the 2019 cookbook Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, which was written by Marc Sumerak and Chelsea Monroe-Cassel.
