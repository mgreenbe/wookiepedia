Its flavor imitated juice from a citrom, a fruit that did not stay fresh for long, but was both sweet and sour with a burst of heat. Blurrgfire was suitable for consumption by Artiodacs, humans, and Chadra-Fans, but it was not compatible with pit droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to chef Strono Tuggs, Blurrgfire was invented by a bartender at Oga's Cantina, an establishment that was owned by Oga Garra and located in Black Spire Outpost on the Outer Rim planet Batuu. In Tuggs' account, the bartender came up with a recipe that combined various juices and spices to mimic the flavor of citrom. Tuggs claimed that he could not tell the difference between citrom and Blurrgfire because the imitation was so perfect, and he included the anecdote and a recipe for the drink in his cookbook, The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook. Although Tuggs did not specify the bartender's name, author and explorer Eloc Throno wrote in his Traveler's Guide to Batuu that Garra put \"her own twist\" on the drink."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Near the end of the Clone Wars, Blurrgfire was among the drink selections that the bartender Janott offered to Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala when she visited Oga's Cantina for a personal mission.
