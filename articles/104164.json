It was known for its forests filled with spine trees. Holshef, an elderly poet, wrote poetry about his recollections of these trees. His artistic expressions made him wanted by the Galactic Empire, but Old Jho read some of the poems and enjoyed reading about this Gorge. He recalled the sound of the wind through the cones of the trees, the taste of root tea, and the smell of the needles in the winter. He lamented that the Empire had cut down the forests in the Gorge, replaced with mines and machines."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
