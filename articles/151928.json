Bane ordered the Jedi to continue to be tortured after he refused to unlock a Holocron, but this killed Ropal. This B1-Series battle droid controlled the interrogation levels, and the droid viewed the Jedi's vital signs. This battle droid had a different sounding voice compared to other B1 battle droids.
