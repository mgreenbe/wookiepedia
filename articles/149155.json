Tri'byia led Drend Navett into the shield generator complex after Navett was hired to use cordioline trehansicol to exterminate metalmites in that area. However, Tri'byia did not know that Navett had a secret plan to sabotage the shield generator. Tri'byia didn't realize that Navett was spraying liquid nutrients around the shield generator in addition to cordioline trhansicol. Later, Navett released hungry mawkrens with explosives tied to their backs near the shield generator. The mawkrens ran towards the liquid nutrients, and then exploded, destroying the shield generator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
