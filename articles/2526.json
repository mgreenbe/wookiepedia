After failing to kill her by detonating her starship on Coruscant, Fett met up with Wesell at night to supply her a tube containing two venomous kouhuns as a more discreet manner of eliminating their target."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zam inserted the kouhun-containing tube into ASN-121's delivery apparatus, after which it immediately flew off to complete its task. Upon reaching the bedroom of the sleeping Amidala's apartment, the droid burned a small circular hole in the window through which to dispense the kouhuns. Avoiding detection by Amidala's astromech, R2-D2, the creatures nearly succeeded in killing the senator until they were sensed and quickly killed by Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker.
