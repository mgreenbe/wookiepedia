When combined with brass, it formed manganese brass, a metal alloy that was used in lightsaber construction. The hilt of Jedi Master Luminara Unduli's personal lightsaber was encased in manganese brass to prevent corrosion. The metal was also combined with plastoid to form a manganese-plastoid alloy which provided lightweight-durability. This material was used to construct the segmented track of the Pasaana Kitha-Garra-du DN-25 treadable."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Manganese was first mentioned in the 2018 reference book Star Wars Lightsabers: A Guide to Weapons of the Force, written by Pablo Hidalgo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
