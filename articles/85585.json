The deal was originally agreed upon by the remaining Hutt leaders to ensure their safe passage off the planet Makeb before its destruction, and under the directive of Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh it became an official alliance. Its terms included the building of a new colony world for Makeb's people by the Hutts, the Republic gaining control of the Hutts' warships, and the Republic's ability to claim sovereign territory on the moon Nar Shaddaa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
