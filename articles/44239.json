In 1 ABY, it was carrying 100 individuals to a new world. It was waylaid and captured by the Imperial Commander Rezi Soresh, who had fled the Empire and established an outpost in the Outer Rim of the galaxy. Soresh took the hostages to his outpost on a barren moon to use as bait in a trap for the Rebel Alliance pilot Luke Skywalker by threatening the hostages' lives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Skywalker arrived, Soresh used an impostor to greet him. The impostor was blasted by Han Solo, Skywalker's ally. Skywalker and his compatriots moved to the compound to free the hostages, but a series of mines went off, causing chaos. A colonist who appeared wounded grabbed Skywalker and used a Force pike to subdue Skywalker and revealed himself as Soresh. Soresh captured the other Rebels and held them in his outpost as he attempted to brainwash Skywalker. Soresh was also planning on luring the Rebel Fleet to his moon, along with Imperial leader Darth Vader, and destroy those obstacles to his power. Using his resources, Soresh acquired resonance torpedoes to destroy the system's star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the fleets arrived, Skywalker betrayed Soresh and his drugged bodyguards. Soresh escaped, but not before launching the resonance torpedoes. As the star began its death throes, the fleets withdrew, allowing Skywalker and his companions to rescue the surviving hostages. The hostages escaped on their ship before the supernova struck."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The vessel's name and origin were established in its appearance in Alex Wheeler's 2010 book Rebel Force: Uprising.
