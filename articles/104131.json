He and his group inhabited a base in an old Stenax temple filled with ancient carvings. Although the temple was located on one of the highest peaks and out of the range of the Imperials stationed in the city of Farruz, Kindar was afraid of being discovered by the stormtroopers under the command of Imperial Governor Quorl Matrin, and the group evacuated a short time following the Battle of Yavin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the group had been out of radio contact for five days, a Rebel scouting group made up of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2 were sent to check in with Kindar. When the arrived at Kindar's temple base they found no signs of a struggle or of a fast evacuation and concluded that Matrin's troops must have scared them away. However, before they could leave the world, they were confronted by Rik Duel and his gang who claimed to be under the command of Kindar and had been left behind to make contact with any Rebels that would show up. Using Kindar's name to secure their help, Duel and the rest of the Rebels took up the search for the statue of Vol, a sacred idol of the native Stenaxes. However, Duel's allegiance to Kindar was a complete fabrication, and he had actually been working for Governor Matrin all along. After discovering the idol and the deception, the Rebels were forced to fight their way off the planet. Whether they eventually made contact with Kindar is uncertain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
