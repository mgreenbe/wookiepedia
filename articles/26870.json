Members of the family outwardly claimed to be interested in earning profits, rather than aiding good causes, but they were all sympathetic to individuals fighting to attain liberty and justice. The family owned and operated the Barloz-class freighter Birthright; the ship was purchased by Thes Cilgris during the waning years of the Galactic Republic and by the time of the Galactic Civil War, it was being run by Thes' son, Yett Cilgris. Around the time of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Thes' nephew Naul Cilgris had became the pilot of the Birthright."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
