In that year, Darnada sent two of his men, Asa Naga and the Wookiee Gargachykk, to track down Fenoob on board the Deep Space Demolition and Removal space station, which the vigo used as a base of operations. Fenoob attempted to escape the pair, but only succeeded in wearing himself out before they confronted him in one of the station's hangars where the Sullustan tried to hide. Naga reminded him of the debt and claimed that he believed the Sullustan would pay up, although also mentioning the fact that Gargachykk doubted it. After Naga threatened to have the Wookiee pull Fenoob's arms out of their sockets, the Sullustan stunned the pair with several flash globes he was carrying and fled. His escape was cut short, though, as the Sith apprentice Darth Maul bisected the fleeing debtee with his lightsaber, hoping to use the Sullustan's death as a mean of earning Naga's trust so that he would be granted audience with Darnada."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fenoob gambled to a point where he owed a large debt to the dangerous criminal Darnada.
