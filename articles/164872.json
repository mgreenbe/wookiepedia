Clad in silver-white Mandalorian armor, the Wraiths were based out of the Death Watch's hidden bunker on the forest moon of Endor. The Death Watch Wraith Fenri Dalso was tasked with overseeing the entrance to the alum mines at the base, while Dalso's fellow Wraith Klin Nif was charged with regulating access to Section B of the Death Watch's bunker. Around the year 1 ABY, numerous Wraiths engaged several spacers who attempted to intrude into the base. Dalso and Nif were both killed during the incursion, and their individual pass keys taken by the spacers to gain access to the areas formerly under their oversight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wraiths first appeared in Star Wars canon in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies, beginning with it's updated release, An Empire Divided."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
