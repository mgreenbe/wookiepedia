The industrial planet Ank Ki'Shor was targeted by the Galactic Empire because it was a key supplier to the Alliance to Restore the Republic in its formative years. During the battle, the Rebel forces made a show of force with their Y-wing starfighters to defend the population against Imperial bombardment. The good use of these fighters saved countless thousands of lives by holding off Imperial TIE bombers. The Empire was eventually victorious."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
