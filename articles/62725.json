About two-thirds of them were big enough to destroy a starship as large as an YT-1300 light freighter on impact and some were even large enough to devastate capital ships.

Eventually the rebels picked the planet Hoth as their new base, largely due to the existence of the asteroid field, as the asteroids in the Hoth system formed an effective barrier to outsiders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the Battle of Hoth, being chased by the Imperial TIE/ln space superiority starfighters, the crew of the Millennium Falcon noticed that the hyperdrive was damaged, so they dashed into the asteroid belt to ditch the pursuit. Despite the near-impossibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field without getting pulverized, the Falcon evaded its pursuers and hid inside one of the largest astreoids. Death Squadron\u2014the Imperial fleet under the command of Darth Vader himself\u2014pursued them, but the field punished them with brutal impacts, resulting in the loss of at least one Star Destroyer when its bridge tower was obliterated by a particularly large asteroid and even causing damage to the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor before it withdrew."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
