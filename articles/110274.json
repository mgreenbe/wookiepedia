He flew with her on a mission to take out the Separatist blockade surrounding Ryloth, and was present when she disobeyed orders to retreat after Separatist reinforcements arrived, and lost most of her squadron. After the Resolute and Defender retreated, Anakin Skywalker came up with a plan to pilot the heavily damaged Defender into the Confederacy's flagship, while Ahsoka and her squad of Y-Wings take out the remaining enemy frigates. Ahsoka was still shaken from her earlier failure, but received support from Admiral Wullf Yularen and led the counterattack. Arseven would then fly with Ahsoka in her BTL-B Y-wing starfighter. The attack was successful, and the Republic forces prepared to invade Ryloth and liberate the captive Twi'lek inhabitants from Techno Union leader Wat Tambor. The droid also co-piloted Ahsoka's Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor during the Defense of Cato Neimoidia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R7-A7 was first revealed in the 2009 LEGO set \"Ahsoka's Starfighter and Droids.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars: The Clone Wars Character Encyclopedia says that R7-A7 is an R7-series droid with the body of an R2 unit.
