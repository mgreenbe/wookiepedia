Following the decimation on Magnus Horn, the Alliance attempted to reassign the surviving troops, but Micha Evon, the 61st's captain, fought to keep the company together and saved it from obliteration. After Evon and a number of his officers were lost in 3 ABY, the soldier Hazram Namir compared the loss to the decimation on Magnus Horn, which he saw as a blow to the company. Magnus Horn and Evon's actions after were also recounted by a trooper of the 61st named Pol Andrissus in a conversation during the captain's funeral."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Magnus Horn was mentioned in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
