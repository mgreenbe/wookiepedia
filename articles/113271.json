If all beings inside the chamber grabbed a handhold from the wall, the chamber would turn dark. Using a shadow-box mechanism, the chamber would then show a 3d picture of Brath Qella, its moons, and its star, N'oka Brath. The room updates to show Brath Qella, its moons, and its stars when it regenerates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
