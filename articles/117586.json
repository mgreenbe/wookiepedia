The queen sent multiple communications to the Galactic Republic, with whom the Felacat were allied, asking for reinforcements against the Separatists but was told no reinforcements were available to be sent. Six weeks, three days and seven hours after the siege began, Togruta Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano arrived on Felacat and landed on the palace's upper level alone with her astromech droid, R7-A7, to provide aid but was mistaken for a Separatist spy by the Felacatian Royal Palace Guard and brought before the queen. Miaria recognized the Jedi as Republic aid but argued with her over the lateness of her arrival before the pair was interrupted by super battle droids breaching the palace's main gate, causing the palace guard to panic and flee. Ahsoka and the queen worked together to fend off the droids with the queen assuming her beast form. This show of courage also motivated the guard, who themselves transformed and together with the Jedi fought off the droids, ending the siege on the palace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Felacatian Royal Palace was created by writer Robin Etherington and drawn by Andres Ponce for the short comic The Feral Queen, in which it was the main setting.
