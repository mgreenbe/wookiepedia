The former Jedi Padawan Ferren Barr, managed to survived and was found at a cantina sometime after. There, he recruited six individuals, whom loathed the new Empire. Each of them had their reasons for joining him against the Empire: Nipaltoo's sister, Palabee, was among the many Jedi they had murdered; the Empire had also bulldozed Orvek's home and force him to live elsewhere; Rebb and Stell had turned against the Empire following the occupation of their city; Daren's life had been saved by a Jedi once and was willing to help Barr in any way he could; and Verla had been promised by Barr to be trained in her special force abilities. However, not all of the disciples intentionally joined Barr. Nipaltoo and Orvek ended up falling for Barr's Jedi mind tricks which fueled their lust to fight against the Empire. As well as the six disciples, Barr also possessed an R1-series astromech droid named Endee in which he installed all of his knowledge about how the Jedi was so easily destroyed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Moving to Mon Cala"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the first year into the Empire's reign Barr took his disciples and Endee to Mon Cala, there he intended to have the Mon Cala monarchy turn against the Empire and openly fight them. He began by influencing King Lee-Char's trade negotiations with the Imperial ambassador Telvar, having him dismiss Telvar's every offer as an excuse for the Empire to bankrupt Mon Cala. This caught the attention of the Emperor, Sheev Palpatine, who recognized the negotiating tactics as that of a Jedi's format. Thus he sent his Sith apprentice Darth Vader to investigate this. Vader took with him: three Imperial Inquisitors, the Sixth Brother, Ninth Sister and Tenth Brother; and a death squad of fourteen Purge Troopers, elite clones whom finished their training after the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Vader arrived, the king's Chief of Security Gial Ackbar denied that any enemy of the Empire could be on Mon Cala. However, Barr had been planning the assassination of Telvar prior to this, fearing that the negotiations would benefit Mon Cala instead of causing conflict. The assassination subsequently took place as Vader was talking to Gial Ackbar. Vader immediately made haste for Lee-Char's palace in Dac City and Telvar's superiors came to invade Mon Cala. As the first wave of fighting commenced, Lee-Char notified Barr of this and when he mentioned Vader's arrival, Barr called Vader by his former name, Anakin Skywalker. Barr approached his disciples about the arrival of him and explained to them how Skywalker became Vader and helped destroy the Jedi order he once fought with."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ferren Barr's disciples first appeared in Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 13, a 2017 canon comic written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Giuseppe Camuncoli."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
