He had a minor role in Revenge of the Sith as Jedi Master Cin Drallig (his name spelled backwards, although he is uncredited with this in the Episode III credits) and was Mark Hamill's first choice as his stunt double for Return of the Jedi. Among his movie credits are various 007 James Bond films, the original Star Wars, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, 1991's Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, 1993's The Three Musketeers and 1999's Sleepy Hollow (with Ray Park). He has also peformed and coordinated for Lucas' The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles televison show."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Kit Fisto's lightsaber hilt was a personal favorite of Nick Gillard, Cin Drallig's lightsaber hilt bears a resemblance to Fisto's. Based on behind the scenes materials, his lightsaber blade was originally to be rotoscoped in yellow. However, George Lucas would only allow either blue or green as the color of any regular Jedi's lightsaber blade, with the exception of Samuel L. Jackson's violet lightsaber blade he used as Mace Windu. Lucas would go no further with other colors. With no choice, Nick Gillard chose green instead, however in a promotional image, see the image of Cin Drallig, he is shown with a blue lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He also claims to be able to speak (and understand) Droidspeak and is still offering Jedi Training lessons similar to the ones he used to train the Prequel cast as shown on his official site."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
