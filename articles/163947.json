After Dusat was kidnapped by the Fromm Gang, the White Witch made its debut as Joben and R2-D2 used it to rescue the young mechanic. The team eventually made their way to Boonta, where they planned to enter the White Witch in the Boonta Speeder Race in 15 BBY. However, the race was jeopardized when Tig Fromm, seeking revenge, planted a thermal detonator in the White Witch. Fortunately for Joben, the detonator was dislodged by Boba Fett's Silver Speeder, which was pursuing the White Witch throughout the race, and Joben and R2-D2 went on to win. The victory was enough to earn both racers jobs with the Zebulon Dak Speeder Corporation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mobquet C/L-82 landspeeder had been a popular model in the Core Worlds shortly before the Clone Wars. Although the popularity of the C/L-82 had declined by 18 BBY, it was still popular with Outer Rim teens due to its reliability and ease of maintenance. This made it an ideal choice for the young racing team of Thall Joben and Jord Dusat. The two overhauled most of the landspeeder's systems and installed several modifications to improve its performance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The finished White Witch, painted white to match its name, was 3.5 meters in length and capable of traveling at 380 kilometers per hour. As a result of the joyhopper system installed by Dusat, the speeder could, for a short period of time, ride noticeably higher than an average speeder and had a maximum altitude of four meters. The speeder could also bank to allow it to negotiate tight corners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The speeder's cockpit had space for two, allowing a single passenger to ride in the vehicle, behind the pilot. Both driver and passenger seats were equipped with seatbelts. A socket, situated by the engines to the rear of the cockpit, was designed for an astromech droid to assist with controlling the vehicle, while the pilot maintained control with a stick in the cockpit. A dashboard hosted a variety of other controls, mounted around a monitor that could be used to display data from the astromech droid. Another monitor and some controls were situated behind the pilot for use from the rear passenger seat. The speeder also had limited cargo space, allowing it to carry 15 kilograms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Construction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the early years of the Galactic Empire, the speeder racers Thall Joben and Jord Dusat came into possession of a C/L-82 landspeeder. Naming it the White Witch, the two began modifying the speeder in their speeder shop on Ingo, with a view to entering it into the Boonta Speeder Race, for what would be their first major competition. Over the course of three years Dusat worked as mechanic, implementing Joben's designs into the speeder as they sought to create a superior racing landspeeder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 15 BBY, the White Witch was nearing completion, but there was one major component missing\u2014an astromech droid to assist the driver.

R2-D2 was ideal for the role, so the two racers became the droids' new masters."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Fromm Gang"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Joben and Dusat attempted to return to the speeder shop, they accidentally entered the restricted zone around the secret base of Tig Fromm, son of Sise Fromm and prominent member of the Fromm Gang. Pursued by sentry droids, they were able to escape with the aid of Kea Moll, a member of the Annoo resistance who was investigating reports that Fromm was developing a powerful weapons satellite called the Trigon One. However, the racers had made enemies of the Fromms, who feared that they might leak details of the secret base to rival gangs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning to the speeder shop, the racers planned to test R2-D2 with the White Witch the following morning. However, shortly after Joben and the droids left for the night, muscle droids sent by Tig Fromm captured Dusat. Upon returning to the shop, Joben was told by Moll what had happened to Dusat. They soon came under attack from more muscle droids who had sabotaged Joben's speeder to prevent his escape. Acting quickly, Moll and R2-D2 activated the White Witch, allowing the group to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taking the White Witch, Joben, Moll and the droids were able to gain entry to Fromm's base. While Moll and C-3PO guided them, Joben and R2-D2 flew the White Witch through the base's network of service tubes and elevator shafts and rescued Dusat, picking up the others as they headed for the exit. Fromm tried to stop their escape, ordering his droid cruisers outside to await them after first disabling his sentry droids to prevent them attacking the cruisers. However, C-3PO was able to use the security system to reactivate the sentry droids. As the two groups of droids opened fire on each other, the White Witch evaded pursuing repulsor balls and escaped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The incident had an unexpected bonus\u2014Joben and Dusat had been looking for a way to transport the White Witch to Boonta for the race and now found a solution when Moll agreed to transport them on her ship, the Sand Sloth, with the White Witch secured to the hull."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The journey would not run smoothly, however, and a hyperdrive malfunction caused them to head to Annoo for repairs. The Fromm Gang's spies reported the group's presence on Annoo to Sise, who vowed to deal with them himself. An attempt to capture them at the spaceport failed when R2-D2 created a distraction, allowing them to once again escape in the White Witch.

As C-3PO and R2-D2 secured the White Witch for the jump to hyperspace, the Fromms attempted to get revenge by attacking Moll's ship with their one remaining vessel. They succeeded in damaging the engine on the Sand Sloth but a weapons malfunction on the Fromm's rundown shuttle, the Voor Viper, allowed the speeder racers to escape before the gangsters could destroy them. However, upon arrival at Boonta the damage the ship had taken caught up with them, forcing a crash landing. Though the White Witch broke free of its restraints during the crash, it survived with only minimal damage. However, Dusat, who was supposed to drive in the upcoming race, injured his arm, forcing Joben to take over."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The racers also required somewhere to repair the White Witch before the race. C-3PO found a solution when a droid called BL-17 offered the use of his master's garage. Unknown to the racers, BL-17 was the property of the bounty hunter Boba Fett, who had been hired by Sise Fromm to extract his revenge. While Moll worked on repairing the White Witch, BL-17 attempted to gas her, making it look like an accident. She escaped with the help of R2-D2."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "BL-17 suggested moving the White Witch to a processing plant where it would be safe until the race. However, this proved to be a trap, and Fett soon attacked Joben and Moll. During the ensuing confusion, Tig Fromm and his bodyguard, Vlix Oncard, planted a thermal detonator on the speeder, which was set to go off after the tenth and final lap of the race. Joben used the White Witch to lead Fett away from the others, heading straight to the race with Fett pursuing in his own Silver Speeder.

However, Fett had followed Joben into the race and attacked him throughout, unaware of the thermal detonator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fett fired cables to attach his speeder to the White Witch in an effort to slow it down, but R2-D2 was able to cut the cables and free the speeder. Fett then fired a blaster at the White Witch, inflicting damage and causing smoke to pour from the speeder, but R2-D2 was able to patch up the damage and keep it in the race. As Joben continued to pull ahead of the competition, Fett stayed with him attacking again with a magnetic beam. Fett's attack loosened the thermal detonator, which fell off and attached to Fett's pursuing speeder. Fett ejected in time, though his speeder was destroyed. Joben went on to win the race."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Joben celebrated with his friends after the race, they were approached by Zebulon Dak, owner of Zebulon Dak Speeder Corporation.
