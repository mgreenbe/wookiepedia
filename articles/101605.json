Additionally, he was the commander of the DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station up to the beginning of the Galactic Civil War. Born on Lexrul during the Republic Era, fifty-one years before the Battle of Yavin, Krennic began his career as a Lieutenant Commander in the Galactic Republic. Following the Clone Wars he was promoted to commander and later the fleet equivalent of admiral upon the formation of the Galactic Empire. Persistent and ambitious, Krennic was responsible for the development and construction of the Empire's enormous Death Star superweapon. An old friend of crystallographer Galen Erso, Krennic manipulated the brilliant scientist into researching synthetic kyber crystals under the pretext of researching sustainable energy. In reality, Krennic weaponized Erso's crystal research for the battle station's planet-killing superlaser, hoping this would place him above his long-time rival Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and win the favor of Emperor Palpatine. Krennic was also held accountable for security of the project, quelling rumors of the Empire's secret enterprise for the two decades of its assembly. For these many purposes he commanded a squad of death troopers, serving as both a sword and shield when the Director found himself in battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the final stages of the Death Star's construction, the project faced potential exposure in the form of a rather talkative cargo pilot. Krennic restlessly sought to silence these rumors, ordering the first successful discharge of the superlaser on the sacred moon of Jedha, where news of the technological terror had reached. However, Krennic was ultimately unable to contain the project's secrecy, and the Rebel Alliance soon launched an attack on the coastal planet Scarif where data tapes containing a complete technical readout of the station were being held. After Director Krennic failed to prevent the theft of these tapes, Tarkin deployed the Death Star in a continued effort to eliminate the compromised facility. Krennic met his end in this second blast of his own creation, an ironic culmination of his life's work. Soon afterward, the Rebellion successfully exploited a vulnerability in the Death Star discovered through the stolen plans, detonating the reactor module and leading to the downfall of Krennic's achievement."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orson Callan Krennic was a human male born in Sativran City on the planet Lexrul in the year 51 BBY. At the age of fifteen, he earned a place in the Galactic Republic's Future Program on Brentaal, wherein he met and befriended fellow student Galen Erso. The two friends had very different personalities, as Erso needed to be pushed into going to social events, while Krennic's nocturnal carousing became legendary among the Futures Program. Nonetheless, Krennic graduated with high honors to the astonishment of his classmates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two worked well together, but the older Erso shrank in the shadow of Krennic's personality and charisma. Although Krennic's listed area of excellence was architecture, his counselors noted that Krennic's ability to manipulate and read others was just as effective. After a time in the program, he was offered a position in the Republic Corps of Engineers and joined it, which led to him supervising large onworld and deep space construction projects. This increased influence allowed Krennic to land Erso a visiting professorship at the Institute of Applied Science at the time when Erso had focused on kyber crystal research."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Constructing the Death Star"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Krennic grew to become a member of the Republic's Strategic Advisory Cell, and, despite publicly still being represented as a member of the Corps of Engineers, only those within the cell were aware of Krennic's involvement as a member of the top-secret Republic Special Weapons Group. As part of this group, Krennic returned to studying, particularly in regards to the weapons Rothana, Kuat and others had built for the Grand Army, and Baktoid, Hoersch-Kessel Drive and others were engineering for the Separatists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At a meeting discussing the schematics for the Death Star obtained by the Republic sometime following the Second Battle of Geonosis, it was debated whether the Republic could create such a weapon before the Separatists were able to\u2014a basic ring structure had already been completed, but problems arose with the labor force responsible for its construction, as well as the superweapon that would give the station its devastating power. Krennic met with Vice Chancellor Mas Amedda to discuss the weapon, within which Krennic suggested using the work of his former colleague Galen Erso. Erso had been focusing his research on how crystals could be used to supply power, and had most recently focused on kyber crystals. Erso was currently imprisoned by the Separatists on Vallt, but Krennic believed that the research could be weaponized. Amedda agreed to let Krennic arrange for his rescue, yet Krennic had to do so without making the Republic's involvement clear."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Rescue on Vallt"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Krennic enlisted the help of smuggler Has Obitt to travel to the planet of Merj, where they and a team of other smugglers captured two Separatist Morseerian scientists. Going to Vallt disguised as employees of Zerpen Industries, the company that Galen Erso belonged to, Krennic arranged for the two scientists to be received by the Separatists in exchange for Galen, Lyra and their daughter, Jyn Erso. Upon making their way off the planet, they were intercepted by a Separatist warship. Krennic called for assistance from Commander Prakas, who arrived in a Republic cruiser and opened fire on Vallt, destroying the Keep where the Ersos had been kept, much to their distaste. In an attempt to persuade Galen to leave his strictly pacifist ways, Krennic took them to Galen's home planet of Grange, which had come under siege. Galen, however, maintained his resolve to stay neutral in the Clone Wars: Despite his fierce desire for the engineer's knowledge and talents, Krennic knew that Galen would have to mostly come to his own decision based on knowledge as opposed to being quickly and simply persuaded."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Rebirth of the Geonosian hive"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon return from Vallt, Krennic arranged for a meeting with Geonosian archduke Poggle the Lesser, who was prisoner to the Republic. Using his knowledge of the Geonosians from his studies as part of the Strategic Advisory Cell, Krennic appealed to Poggle and the work of his hive in the construction of the Droid Army and the Death Star plans. Knowing that the hives on Geonosis would turn back to their native barbaric infighting at the lack of their archduke and any construction projects, Poggle agreed to assist in the construction of the battle station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long later, Galen Erso came to Krennic with plans for an energy facility project the two could embark on together, which Krennic promptly declined. Mas Amedda arranged for a meeting with Krennic to discuss his unauthorized attack on Vallt and his interrogation of Poggle, yet Krennic's overall progress towards the creation of the Death Star won him Amedda's favor.

In an attempt to bring more favor from Galen Erso, Krennic arranged for espionage charges against him to be dropped - Krennic reasoned that gaining more favor from Erso would make him more likely to join the Death Star project when Krennic revealed it to him, and that in turn would give Krennic more influence in the Republic and lead to Krennic not having to report to Wilhuff Tarkin, whom he despised. Krennic contacted Galen and informed him of a job at Helical HyperCom at a large production facility on Lokori, in an attempt to have the mundane nature of the facility, as well as the continuous Separatist attacks on the planet, lead Galen to become more desperate for a fulfilling job."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Awakened one night by his comlink, Krennic was informed that the Death Star's infancy was in jeopardy, with the Geonosian drones turning back and destroying their three months worth of work as well as the marines who occupied the facility.

Galen accepted this position and would work on Coruscant in a new facility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Galen Erso began intense research on the kyber crystals Krennic had provided him with, whilst Tarkin met with Krennic in a shipyard in Kartoosh. Here, Krennic explained the potential power of the Death Star, which Tarkin regarded with mild skepticism, as well as announcing his plans to select certain worlds for the exclusive mining of resources essential to the construction of the Death Star. Tarkin found favor in Krennic's promises and allowed Krennic to overreach his authority in order to gain the resources needed and put them tighter into Tarkin's own grasp. Krennic would use Has Obitt and other smugglers to perform smuggling operations which would require the Empire to take complete control over mining corporations\u2014this would give Krennic the resources he needed and turn the smugglers against the Empire, which Krennic could later use to his advantage to oppose anyone who tried to circumvent his advancement of power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lyra Erso grew wary of the Empire's true intentions for Project Celestial Power and the Empire and informed Galen of this.

Following this, Krennic again met with Mas Amedda\u2014in the face of disapproval, Krennic suggested having his rank be raised in order to give the impression that the project was going more smoothly than it truly was.

Krennic suggested to Lyra that she take a break from parenting and go back to exploring as she used to do. With Lyra out of the equation, Krennic called Galen to meet with him in private. Here, Galen mentioned doubts Lyra had, as well as his own. Galen was shown the world of Malpaz, and Krennic claimed that it was an attack by those who wished to bring instability through sowing chaos into the Empire. Galen was upset to see his work being attacked by those who solely wanted to ruin the lives of others. Krennic had maneuvered Galen to his side, and Galen agreed to work more intensely but under complete secrecy from anyone, including Lyra."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this time,[source?] Krennic attended the annual Imperial Ball on Empire Day. His considerable status, as well as his choice to wear his distinctive white cape, drew the attention of those present at the fashionable gathering. In fact, inspired by his arrival, Krennic's subordinate Tifino drunkenly revealed confidential information about the project to inquisitive HoloNet reporter Calliope Drouth. Within meters of Krennic, a drunk Tifino divulged the Imperial commander's interest in the sacred moon Jedha. Tifino's friend, shuttle pilot Ianna Wick, added that Krennic's interest in Jedha arose from its kyber crystal deposits. Later during the party, Drouth's malfunctioning reporting droid fell to Krennic's feet, prompting him to retrieve the unit and offer to repair it. Aware of the sensitive conversations the droid had recorded, Drouth intended to decline the offer, but the droid eventually reactivated. Drouth was later able to broadcast the information she learned in her news story using hand signals."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Creation of the superweapon"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Galen in his grasp, Krennic then sprang a trap on Tarkin. Has Obitt had been angered by the destruction he had indirectly caused by following Krennic, and staged a rebellion alongside Saw Gerrera against the Imperial occupation of the Salient system and Zerpen Industries headquarters. Knowing Tarkin would not back down through fear of making the Empire look weak, he was preoccupied while Krennic was able to advance his plan without Tarkin claiming any involvement. During this battle, Galen's research advanced, and Krennic was able to get a prototype weapon created. From aboard a Star Destroyer, Krennic had the superweapon tested. The weapon was aimed at two black holes known as The Hero Twins so as to prevent any incident similar to what happened on Malpaz. At Krennic's command, the weapon was fired, and its collimating beams raced into the two black holes. It was a successful weaponizing of Galen's research, ensuring their place in history. At some point during these tests, however, Krennic admitted to the Emperor that the station's primary weapon was not yet fully operational."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Darth Vader arrived on Geonosis to discover who was sabotaging Project Stardust Krennic greeted him. He and Lord Vader then came under attack when an explosion went off and almost buried him and Vader alive. Vader used the Force to lift the rubble away from them. At his office, Krennic told Vader that he believed that Tarkin was behind the attack, but had no proof. He informed Lord Vader that there were several accidents that were sabotaged by someone. Lord Vader assured Krennic that the perpetrator would be found. Krennic was visited by Lord Vader after his investigation on Coruscant and showed him a Ootheca egg that was found in Galen Erso's Office. He told Vader that Erso received blueprints from the Geonosians and that a rogue infestation of Geonosians must have sent him the egg in order to get Erso's help. Krennic supplied Lord Vader with a squad of death troopers in order to deal with these Geonosians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Lyra returned to Galen from her expedition on Alpinn, she found him difficult to communicate with, as if he were under immense pressure. Krennic had given the task of taking her to Alpinn to Has Obitt, who Krennic had learned had showed her the destruction of the worlds he was involved in smuggling for on behalf of Krennic. Krennic informed Lyra that her disruption of Galen's research would set back the project massively and that there could be trouble for her and her family if she was to prove fatal to his research. Elated with the successful test, Krennic went to meet with Project Celestial Power workers on Hypori. Here, a former colleague of Galen and friend of Lyra Erso named Reeva Demesne inquired about what exactly they were working on, as the scale of their project was unlike anything seen before. Krennic came under scrutiny, as he was accused of using their research for the creation of a superweapon and their destruction was ordered."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Racked with concern over not being given specific updates from Krennic and being obsessed with his advancement of kyber crystal research, Galen realized he had been neglecting his child Jyn. Lyra then met with Galen, realizing they were under surveillance following Krennic's prior threat to their family - she had tried to contact Reeva Demesne, but she was no longer listed as an employee, nor were various other workers and friends. Lyra had a friend from her journey to Alpinn known as Nari Sable relay data to them from Malpaz and Hypori, and found evidence of destruction at Imperial hands as opposed to anarchists, despite Galen being told by Krennic that anarchists were to blame for the destruction he saw. They arranged a meeting with Krennic, wherein they raised questions over the devastated planets and Reeva. Krennic interpreted the meeting as a trap\u2014he left and made plans for the possible removal of Lyra and Jyn from Galen's life. On his journey back, Krennic received a transmission from Tarkin, regarding the arrival of Has Obitt on Coruscant. Krennic assumed that Obitt had planned on revenge, and perhaps the retrieval of the Ersos off of Coruscant. Krennic raced back, only to find that Obitt had arrived with none of the Erso family in sight\u2014they had vanished from under his nose in another location with the assistance of Saw Gerrera, and slipped from Krennic's grasp.

In 13 BBY, Krennic discovered the Ersos on the remote planet Lah'mu, where they lived a simple farming life. Landing near their homestead in his personal Delta-class T-3c shuttle, Krennic approached from afar with his death troopers on either side. Alerted to the sudden Imperial presence, Galen sent his daughter into hiding, guided by his wife, while he confronted his old friend outside the homestead. When Krennic expressed surprise at Erso's choice of a lonely, agrarian lifestyle, the scientist agreed, claiming Lyra had passed away. Krennic, skeptical, ordered the house searched and turned to Erso to explain his visit. The Death Star, he revealed, was still unfinished, and the only hope for its completion lay in Erso's advanced research into crystallography. Erso protested on moral grounds, but they were interrupted by Lyra, who held the cloaked Imperial officer at gunpoint in an effort to prevent her husband's abduction.

When Tarkin theorized that the Senate would sympathize with the rebellion should they discover the project, Krennic protested that a completed Death Star would render secrecy unnecessary. Tarkin, still skeptical, admonished the Director and suggested that the weapon be tested on the moon of Jedha, where news of the weapon had been leaked, warning him of those he would have to confront if the test were a failure. Confident in the weapon he had spent nineteen years building, Krennic defiantly told Tarkin that he would not fail. Krennic considered the possibility that Tarkin was setting him up for sabotage to the point that should the Death Star fail in its objective at Jedha, Tarkin would use his alliance with Vader to shield himself from the punishment that would theoretically befall him and Krennic.

After Leia's rescue by a group of Rebels that were tracked to the Alliance's headquarters on the jungle moon of Yavin, Tarkin moved the Death Star near the planet in an effort to crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke. However, in the subsequent battle, Luke Skywalker, the unknown son of Vader himself, fired a pair of proton torpedoes into Erso's deliberate design flaw, which the Rebels had discovered through analysis of the stolen plans. Skywalker's torpedoes ruptured the main reactor, as Krennic had envisioned in his dying thoughts, causing a cataclysmic explosion that tore apart his creation. However, his rival Tarkin perished in the blast, as did over a million other personnel, resulting in a brutal blow from which the Empire never truly recovered.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite Krennic's mixed legacy as a director, the Advanced Weapons Research agency remained in existence, and was tasked with building a second, more advanced Death Star, which underwent construction in orbit of Endor's Forest Moon, supervised by Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod, who helped build the first Death Star. However, Rebel pilots Lando Calrissian and Nien Nunb managed to destroy it with the Millennium Falcon during the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the battle of Scarif, Grand Moff Tarkin thought about what Krennic's legacy would be. While Tarkin noted that the weapon demonstration on Jedha City had proved spectacular in his eyes, he ultimately believed the director would only be a footnote in Imperial history, and Krennic would always be tied to the \"mining disaster\" on Jedha. Tarkin also considered discipline aboard the Death Star \"less than perfect\" under Krennic's direction, stating as much to Chief Gunner Endo Frant following a failed test firing of the battle station's superlaser at Rango Tan. When The Rebel Files were recovered by the Resistance in 34 ABY, Organa noted that Krennic received little credit in historical records despite his significant role in the development of Imperial weapons, something that certainly would have irritated him, and for which Organa was glad. Despite not getting credit in the history of this time period, Orson Krennic was remembered by the Whills. Krennic was mentioned by name, along with Jyn Erso and K-2SO, by a member of the Whills as someone to be remembered in galactic history sometime after the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orson Krennic was a human male with short gray hair, blue eyes, and light skin. He wore a white Imperial military uniform, similar to those used by members of the ISB, like Colonel Wullf Yularen, with an unusual addition of a white cape not commonly seen on other Imperial officers. Krennic sought to earn the favor of Emperor Palpatine, using his knowledge of the Empire's system to manipulate it and ascend in the Imperial hierarchy. He was known to be unpredictable and volatile. During his time as part of the Futures Program, Krennic was renowned for his \"nocturnal carousing\" and partying, as well as frequently coming to Galen's rescue to ward off his tormentors. He had lofty aspirations and a high opinion of himself and his capabilities, feeling that he deserved respect within the Empire's ranks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He was not afraid to go toe-to-toe with other highly placed officials of the Galactic Empire, including Mas Amedda. He had a rivalry with Grand Moff Tarkin, who did share his optimism regarding Project Stardust. When Tarkin used the event of Galen Erso's defection to position himself at the helm of the newly minted battle station, Krennic was infuriated. Krennic would travel to Mustafar with the audacity to make a direct request of Darth Vader, asking if he could be put in charge of the Death Star, which led the irritated Sith Lord to Force-choke him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Krennic was devoid of many human qualities such as compassion, mercy, and regard for innocent lives. Additionally, he remarked on the subsequent cloud of flame and smoke as something of beauty, unremorseful of having just murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent people. He was also dismissive of the Force and its importance in the galaxy, speaking of having just destroyed the last remnants of the Jedi with undisguised pride. Krennic was willing to kill people who served him, such as when he ordered the execution of the scientists on Eadu despite Galen having just admitted to being the traitor among the development staff. He also showed at least some sadism, as after knocking Galen to the ground, Krennic gloated about his use of the Death Star in the destruction of Jedha City, specifically noting every element of Jedha City, including Saw's Partisans, being gone as a result."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Krennic was not afraid to take get into combat if necessary. Flanked by two death troopers, he rushed to the data vault of Scarif Base and fought to prevent, although unsuccessfully, the theft of the Death Star plans by Cassian Andor and Jyn Erso. He was also somewhat sarcastic, especially when irritated with his underlings' incompetence, as upon witnessing the explosions triggered by the Rebel forces alongside everyone else in Citadel Tower, Krennic bluntly yelled to the present personnel (who were still staring out towards the explosions) \"Are we blind?!\" before ordering the deployment of the base's garrison to drive off the attackers. In battle, Krennic had a DT-29 heavy blaster pistol which he owned personally."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Krennic was a skilled manipulator, although he was more of an architect than a politician.

The character in Knoll's original story draft was a double agent in Jyn Erso's Rogue One team reporting to the Imperial Security Bureau, specifically to his boss Willix Cree. In addition, one of the earlier planned endings for the story had Krennic somehow surviving the Death Star's blast on Scarif unlike Erso and Cassian only to be executed aboard a Star Destroyer by Darth Vader for failing to stop the Death Star plans theft.

Despite Filoni's decision, an earlier draft of the episode \"A Fool's Hope\" included a scene featuring the show's antagonists plotting about the Empire's future, which would have called for the inclusion of Krennic.
