Han Solo's Wookiee co-pilot, Chewbacca was manning the cannons. The Mist Hunter managed to damage the Falcon's hyperdrive, forcing Han to fly to a planet. The Millennium Falcon flew into the thick clouds and the two bounty hunters followed. All of the sudden, everything on the ship stopped working and the ship began to plummet. The Falcon crashed in the ocean and Han activated the flotation pontoon to keep the ship afloat. Chewbacca and Han swam to a nearby island where Han pointed out that many ships were shipwrecked there."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Survivor island"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All of the sudden, a ship came barreling down and nearly crashed into Han and Chewbacca. Zuckuss called out for help and Han and Chewie reluctantly went to help him. Solo helped get his legs out from the wreckage but Zuckuss turned on Han and cuffed Solo's hands with stuncuffs. But the stuncuffs instantly deactivated and Han Solo and Chewbacca got away. Han and Chewbacca walked into the jungle to figure out what was going on. After walking for miles they found an energy projector. Han did not think that one of these was real. He explained that the energy projector can knock out all kinds of technology. Han and Chewbacca climbed up the energy projector in hopes of turning it off. As they neared the top Zuckuss appeared and threw a spear that just barely missed Han Solo's head. The bounty hunter threw more spears and started to climb the energy projector. Chewbacca grabbed one of the spears and used it to try to pry the top of the energy projector off. He got it off and they both celebrated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "But on the ground many small Scorpion-droids crawled out off the ground and announced that they were ready to fulfil their programming.
