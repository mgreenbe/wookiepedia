The system realized the strength of the gravity field around it, detonating whenever the level reached a preset threshold. Always very effective, the program could not be removed from the bomb without detonating. Adopted by the Imperial Navy when the M-12 failed to be effective, it proved to be advantageous in battles with the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
