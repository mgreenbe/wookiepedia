Powered by condensed K-grade conductor cells and cooled by a tankage of R717 refrigerant, the MWC-35c-a had a capacity of 35,000 rounds when fully charged and had two fire modes: a standard mode which fired at a rapid rate and a secondary mode which was a single-fire power shot. In the standard mode, the MWC-35c's electroscope's smart targeting array took into account the user's position and facing, grouping shots into bursts to maximize hits on specified targets. In the secondary mode, the blaster's lower barrel collected energy into single shots primed by a pump-action foreguard. Both modes drew from the same power source, but yielded different levels of destructive output."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
