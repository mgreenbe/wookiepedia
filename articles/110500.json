They were largely successful but for the fact that since the tank carried a stun cannon unlike their larger predecessors, the enemy fighters, drained of all their power, crashed into the Republic forces and disabled at least three AT-TEs. They were later used to disable the Zillo Beast, awakened in a sink hole created by the detonation of an electro-proton bomb during the battle, but most of the tanks were destroyed by the enraged monster. A number of the tanks were also used during the Zillo Beast incident on Coruscant, which occurred during the rampage of the escaped creature."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
