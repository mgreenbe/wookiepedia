The blast shielding was not always employed, being able to close over the gunship if ordered. During the Battle of Teth in 22 BBY, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker ordered a clone trooper pilot lieutenant flying his LAAT/i to close the blast shielding in response to heavy Separatist fire from the battle droids stationed at the Teth Monastery. The gunship was able to reach the ground intact, allowing Skywalker and the others on the LAAT/i to participate in the rest of the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
