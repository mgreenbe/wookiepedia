However, the Sith Lord Tulak Hord, his apprentice, Ortan Cela, and their Dashade Shadow Killers, Khem Val and Veshikk Urk, led an army of dark side warriors to break the Jedi siege, eliminating them and the rebels who opposed the expansion of the Sith Empire. During the fighting, Urk and Val feasted on the Force potential of their enemies, and Tulak Hord used a ritual to draw the strength of his enemies to himself in order to gain power and vitality.
