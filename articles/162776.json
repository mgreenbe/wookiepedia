After the Empire led by Eternal Emperor Arcann dominated both the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire in the Eternal Empire conquest of 3636 BBY, both sides were forced to pay heavy tribute to Zakuul, which remained the dominant power in the galaxy for the next five years. Rebels and dissidents who opposed Arcann's rule were left with no choice but to flee from his Eternal Fleet and scatter to avoid retaliation. Things changed when former Sith Intelligence Minister Lana Beniko released a figure known as the Commander from imprisonment in carbonite by Arcann and during escape from pursuing forces located the legendary starship Gravestone with the power to face the Eternal Fleet in open battle. During the battle of Asylum Beniko's group escaped with minimal casualties on the Gravestone, which destroyed several Eternal Fleet warships, showing the galaxy that Zakuul was not invincible. In response, Beniko's multiple contacts from the Core Worlds answered her call and gathered on a remote Wild Space planet Odessen, where they formed an Alliance dedicated to end Arcann's reign, of which the Outlander assumed command with Beniko as his right hand. Initially, the new Alliance was strained for funds, resources and personnel, equipped only for small surgical strikes against the might of Eternal Empire, while desperate to keep the location of the Alliance base a secret."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over time several bold strikes made against the Eternal Empire attracted to the Alliance multiple new contacts and recruits from the Republic, the Sith Empire and criminal underworld, who brought with them starships, weapons and ammunition, allowing the Alliance to grow into a power that could seriously threaten Arcann's rule. In a bid to remove Arcann's advantage of the Eternal Fleet, the Alliance allied with Mandalorian clans led by Shae Vizla for a raid on Darvannis and agreed to SCORPIO's plan to remotely take control of the GEMINI captains that controlled the Eternal Fleet. However SCORPIO followed her own agenda and used that opportunity to take over the Eternal Throne for herself. In the resulting battle of Odessen the Commander injured and defeated Arcann, who was taken by his mother Senya Tirall into hiding to recuperate. Arcann's sister Vaylin allied with SCORPIO and proclaimed herself the new Eternal Empress, and the cruelty of her reign quickly exceeded even that of her brother's. Meanwhile Alliance victories inspired the Sith Empire led by Empress Acina to join in the revolt, waging open war against the Eternal Empire while the Galactic Republic kept away from the conflict and continued to pay tribute to Zakuul."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An attempt by Vaylin and SCORPIO to take over of the Gravestone led to the discovery of Vaylin's mental conditioning placed upon her by her father, while a visit to the artificial world called Iokath uncovered the true origin of the Eternal Fleet and allowed the Alliance to upgrade the Gravestone to better withstand its firepower. Holding a key to Vaylin's mental conditioning, the Alliance Commander attempted to subdue the Empress during the Grand Festival in her name and ended up recruiting Arcann himself into the Alliance, after the former Emperor was healed and redeemed by his mother's sacrifice on Voss. During a visit to Nathema Vaylin broke her mental chains, while the Alliance obtained Dramath's holocron which held the power to destroy the spirit of Sith Emperor Vitiate once and for all. In the following assault on Odessen Vaylin was killed, leading to mass surrender of Zakuulan military forces. However, with the Eternal Throne empty, the GEMINI captains of the Eternal Fleet went rogue and began bombarding inhabited worlds, seeking to annihilate all complex life in the galaxy. The Alliance engaged the Eternal Fleet in the battle of Zakuul, where the Commander destroyed the spirit of Vitiate and claimed the Eternal Throne. The Alliance relocated the Throne to Odessen, established full control of the Eternal Fleet, absorbed the remaining Zakuulan military forces and re-organized itself into the Eternal Alliance, which then held enough territory and firepower to be considered one of the major galactic governments."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Origins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to the Sith Empire which he ruled for over thirteen centuries, Sith Emperor Vitiate also created a secret Eternal Empire in the Wild Space, ruling from the Eternal Throne on Zakuul as Immortal Emperor Valkorion. The Eternal Throne commanded a massive Eternal Fleet and a powerful group of Force-users known as Knights of Zakuul. Over centuries, Vitiate devoted more and more of his attention to Zakuul, eventually coming to see this new society as his greatest achievement, while deeming the Sith Empire a failure. However, in 3636 BBY Valkorion's biological son Arcann betrayed his father, resulting in the death of his physical body. Vitiate, who by that point had managed to live for over a millennia by using transfer essence to move his spirit between Voices, entered the body of the Commander present in his throne room in search of a new host, but Arcann sensed that his father was alive and immediately ordered the Outlander to be freezed in carbonite, trapping Valkorion within."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arcann assumed the Eternal Throne and proclaimed himself the new Emperor of Zakuul, blaming his father's death on the Outlander and promising revenge on the Core Worlds for what he claimed was an act of unprovoked aggression. Arcann launched a full-scale Eternal Empire conquest on the galaxy previously unaware of Zakuul's existence, attacking both the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, who by that point have been involved in a series of wars between each other for almost half a century. Arcann's war was swift and brutal, with the Eternal Fleet having the advantage over Republic and Imperial Navy in terms of both speed and sheer numbers. Eternal Empire forces destroyed shipyards, blockaded major trade routes and had achieved naval superiority over both sides within three months, blockading both Coruscant and Dromund Kaas by the end of 3636 BBY. Both sides suffered heavy losses from facing endless legions Knights of Zakuul and Skytroopers, but Republic Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh refused to submit the Republic to Zakuulan authority, and continued to wage the Galactic War against the Sith Empire as well, at the cost of millions of Republic lives. The Galactic Senate eventually managed to overrule Saresh and went to negotiate ceasefire terms. On the Sith side, the members of the Dark Council fought Arcann's invasion ruthlessly and lost, with all but one either killed or disappearing into hiding away from the public eye. The Minister of Logistics negotiated a Zakuul\u2013Imperial treaty, while a similar Zakuul\u2013Republic treaty was signed by the Republic Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Both the Republic and the Sith Empire were forced to pay heavy tribute of raw materials to Zakuul and were subjected to an arms limitation statute, preventing either of them from challenging Zakuul directly. Arcann had no interest in actually governing the conquered portion of the galaxy and thus allowed the Republic and Empire to continued their war against one another, as long as the tribute was paid and they continued to acknowledge Zakuul's superiority. Though there were no ongoing planetary occupations, to watch for possible uprisings massive battle stations known as Star Fortresses were deployed in orbits of dozens key worlds such as Alderaan, Balmorra, Bothawui and Voss. Arcann proved himself as a brutal dictator at home as well, cracking hard on any political dissidents who dared to openly speak out against his rule. Thousands of ordinary citizens were forced to either live in exile in the Endless Swamp, or flee their home world and blend into galactic underground in an attempt to evade Arcann's forces. After 3636 BBY the political situation on the galactic scale saw little change for the next four years. Chancellor Saresh had reached the end of her second term and failed to pass a notion to extend it indefinitely, though she still remained in power and controlled the Republic through a carefully chosen puppet Chancellor by the name of Jebevel Madon. The Sith Empire was ruled by Darth Acina, who proclaimed herself the new Empress of the Sith after remaining as the only Dark Council member alive and not in hiding. By 3631 BBY however former Sith Intelligence Minister Lana Beniko, who had spend years in Wild Space opposing the Eternal Empire and building a network of contacts, finally managed to to learn where the Outlander, her old ally from the Revanite crisis, was being kept and organized a mission to break them out of the carbonite prison, believing that person to be the galaxy's only hope in opposing the Eternal Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Sparking the rebellion"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Outlander is released"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beniko mounted a rescue mission on the carbonite prison in the Spire of Zakuul with her astromech droid T7-O1, bodyguard droid HK-55 and Koth Vortena, an exiled Zakuulan naval officer.

They were attacked by sky trooper guards and Beniko proceeded to escort the Outlander to the extraction point, while here pursued by High Justice Vaylin, Arcann's sister and extremely powerful Force user. Vaylin destabilized a Sun Generator, which threatened to overload and explode, while Vortena's shuttle was shot down and crashed on a shuttle pad, where Vortena and HK-55 were cornered by security forces. They eliminated their attackers and stole another shuttle, rushing to pick up Beniko and the Outlander, who were cornered by Vailyn. Vortena's shuttle arrived just in time and open fire on the High Justice, who shielded herself with a piece of debris, before throwing it at the shuttle, dealing it serious damage. Vortena managed to keep the shuttle in the air long enough for the Outlander and Beniko to get aboard, after which they fled the city. The damage forced Vortena to put the shuttle down, crashing in the Endless Swamp. While Beniko and Vortena hid the evidence of their landing, the Outlander and HK-55 discovered a large technological object, which Vortena quickly identified as the Gravestone, the legendary warship that single handedly stood up to the Eternal Fleet. The team got working on repairing the Gravestone, restoring major systems to working conditions, while Beniko sent a message to the former Knight of Zakuul Senya Tirall, asking her to join them and provide backup. Arcann's forces soon located and attacked the Gravestone, and Vortena and HK-55 got the ship ready to fly, while Senya Tirall arrived to assist the defense of the ship. The group prepared to leave Zakuul, but as the ship left the atmosphere, the Eternal Fleet appeared to intercept them. The Outlander fired the Gravestone's omnicannon, destroying more than two dozen Eternal Fleet warships in a single shot, and enabling the Gravestone to jump into safety of hyperspace, where the group decided to head towards Asylum, a shadowport and safe haven for those who fled Arcann's oppressive rule."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Battle of Asylum"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gravestone docked at Asylum, where the small team was joined by Koth Vortena's crewmembers, including his first mate Len Parvek, former Republic Sergeant Ralo and engineer Tora, who went to repair the Gravestone battle damage.

Senya joined the Outlander in the Scions' trials, in which the Outlander emerged victorious. As the group discussed the revelations made in the Scion enclave, they received a message from T7-O1 on Zakuul, informing them that the information broker known as \"Lady of Sorrows\" wished to have a dialogue with the Gravestone computers. Senya Tirall accompanied the Outlander back to the Old World of Zakuul, where they reunited with T7-O1 and located the Lady of Sorrows, an advanced artificial intelligence calling herself SCORPIO, who agreed to accompany them back to Asylum. Meanwhile, Heskal experienced a vision of Arcann's defeat at the hand of the Outlander and in accordance with his prophecy contacted the Emperor he detested, inviting him to Asylum. Arcann arrived to Asylum before his Eternal Fleet did and personally executed the Scions in their hideout, impaling Heskal on his lightsaber just as the Outlander arrived to meet with him, and a fight between the two ensued. The Eternal Fleet emerged from hyperspace and opened fire on the shadowport, and the Gravestone turbolaser cannons shot down several Zakuulan shuttles, one of which crashed into the Scions' hideout, interrupting Arcann's duel with the Outlander. Zakuulan forced took over the Control Spar, taking control of the docking clamps and keeping the Gravestone grounded. The ship was attacked by a group of Knights led by Vaylin herself, who was about to engage the Outlander when her mother Senya Tirall rushed to aid them, tossing the Outlander away and engaging her daughter, while the Outlander and Lana went to free the ship. Beniko volunteered to hold a choke point so that Vortena and the Outlander could reach the Control Spar, where reunited with HK-55, and Vortena and the droid stayed behind to hold off a battalion of Zakuul Knights. The Outlander proceeded to the Control Spar alone and released the docking clamps keeping the Gravestone in place, but was once again ambushed by Arcann. HK-55 arrived just in time to assist the Outlander, sacrificing himself to shield his master from Arcann's Force blast. During the fight Arcann was knocked off the Control Spar to the levels down below, and the injured Outlander returned to the Gravestone, where Senya disarmed Vaylin and had her daughter at her mercy, but could not bring herself to land a killing blow.

There she laid foundation of an Alliance against the Eternal Empire and the Outlander became the Alliance Commander, establishing the Alliance base on Odessen. Among those who joined the new Alliance was Beniko's old associate from Republic Strategic Information Service Theron Shan, who immediately started working on the big problems and assembled a team of specialists which included former Republic Admiral Bey'wan Aygo, famous smuggler captain Hylo Visz, Hutt scientist Juvard Illip Oggurobb and Sana-Rae of the Voss Mystics."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Alliance operations against Zakuul"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Early Strikes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reports of the new Alliance spurred others across the galaxy to take action, with resistance fighters taking arms on the planets under the threat of Star Fortresses. One such resistance cell on Bothawui was making significant progress, prompting the Eternal Empire to demonstrate their power by firing a powerful laser from the orbiting Star Fortress, wiping out the entire cell. In response, the Alliance Commander worked with Theron Shan and Miot Dengd to infiltrate one of these Star Fortresses to identify a method of destroying them. Learning valuable information about the inner-workings of the Star Fortress, the Alliance made contact with resistance fighters on Alderaan, Belsavis, Hoth, Nar Shaddaa, Tatooine and Voss to destroy shield bunkers that protected the battle stations.

Together, the Commander and Kaliyo rigged ion grenades into Power Junctions throughout the Old World and Breaktown to disable security measures of the Overwatch, from which the Commander could obtain the complete schematics of the Spire. Detonating three junctions at once, they knocked down the Overwatch security and stormed the facility, eventually reaching the control room where Kaliyo planted her explosives at the droid controls, while the Commander downloaded the Spire's schematics. Overwatch Administrator Tayvor Slen arrived with the skytroopers and attempted to stop them, but was defeated and mortally wounded during the fight. Kaliyo destroyed the droid controls, which shut down the droids throughout the Spire, after which she escaped the Spire with the Commander and traveled to Odessen, where she decided to stay with the Alliance. At the same time, the Eternal Empire continued their search for the Outlander and the Gravestone, which continuously came up empty.

Theron asked the Commander to assist Havoc in their operation, and the two approached Havoc at the meeting point in the Endless Swamp, where Major Aric Jorgan introduced his squad and explained that they were in the middle of an operation. Before they could discuss the details, their position was attacked by skytroopers, and Jorgan ordered everyone to split in pairs and regroup at their camp. Jorgan teamed up with the Commander and rescued a group of Zakuulan refugees led by Pashna Veyaad, inviting them to take shelter at their camp. The next morning, Jorgan explained to the Commander and Theron that their mission was to plant a wiretap on a listening post used by the Knights of Zakuul, allowing Havoc Squad to spy on their communications. The Commander brought Alliance personnel from Odessen to provide a distraction for the attack and proceeded with Havoc towards the main objective. With the rest of the squad providing their cover, Jorgan and the Commander disabled the outpost's security and planted the wiretap, but their presence was discovered and the rest of Havoc Squad fell back to their position, which came under heavy fire. Zakuulan exiles led by Pashna Veyaad came to their aid, taking care of reinforcements and everyone returned to their camp. Their mission successful, Jorgan traveled to the Alliance base on Odessen, where he got acquainted with the Alliance leadership.

To draw Arcann's attention from their objective, the Alliance required a diversion, and the Commander had to choose between Kaliyo and Havoc Squad to lead the main attack, while the other party would focus on the diversion. Before the Commander could depart to lead the mission, however, Beniko suggested contacting Valkorion on how to best infiltrate the facility he had built, but unfortunately the Commander decided to do so in a secluded spot in Odessen wilderness, where Valkorion tested them for a prolonged period of time before the Commander could return to the base. Unable to wait for their return, and with the intel turning stale every minute, the Alliance had no choice but to proceed with the mission without the Commander. Having successfully executed the diversion, the support team moved into position to assist the main team, which was only a few levels away from their objective. However, the infiltration team was cornered by a superior force, before contact with them was lost and the diversion team attempted a rescue. The Spire then went into full lockdown with no transmissions coming in or out, making any assistance from Odessen impossible. A tense firefight erupted, in which four of six Havoc Squad members were killed and the rest were forced to retreat.
