Within the western mountains, the Jedi Order established the city of Knossa c. 24,500 BBY; serving as the center of Jedi culture for over 20,000 years. Several of the mountains in this range were filled with Adegan crystal caves, which the Jedi mined for these precious lightsaber crystals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
