Ogem was located in a region of space that was primarily explored between 3000 BBY and 1000 BBY. Around 1000 BBY, wealthy Core Worlders led by Thull Vandron settled the nearby Senex-Juvex region and established a number of noble houses. A millennium later, Ogem was a bustling trade world, and Ogemite merchants were tentatively attempting to establish trade relations with several Juvex families that had a more progressive outlook than their neighbors. During the Clone Wars, Ogem was located in space held by the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ogemite focus on business meant that they avoided siding in political activity, and thus they at first were neutral in the Galactic Civil War. However, following the Battle of Yavin, the Galactic Empire overextended their line of credit with Ogemite traders. This lead many of them to side with the Rebel Alliance, as the Rebellion paid up front for the goods they bought."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Ogemites in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ogemites were widely known as apolitical traders in the galaxy. Their world was a bustling trade world on the D'Aelgoth Trade Route, which connected the Senex and Juvex worlds with the worlds of the D'Aelgoth sector and, ultimately, the Corellian Trade Spine. When the Empire overextended its credit with Ogemite merchants, many sided with the Rebel Alliance.
