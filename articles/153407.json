He served under the command of an unidentified commander on Kashyyyk in 1 ABY. When the Empire ordered a blockade of the planet, the commander, the technician, and two stormtroopers were charged with searching homes. They entered the home of the Wookiees Chewbacca, Mallatobuck, Attichitcuk, and Lumpawarrump, and the four Imperials remained in the home for some time while they searched for any signs of involvement with the Rebel Alliance. The trader Saun Dann, who was also in the home, showed the technician a performance by a musical group. They were later ordered back to base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character appeared in 1978's The Star Wars Holiday Special.
