Constructed with a metal frame, it generated an energy shield that was opaque to anyone who viewed it from the outside, thus inhibiting the opponent's view of the wielder. However, the inner side of the energy shield was transparent, allowing the wielder to have clear vision through the shield. Other versions were physical shields, such as the riot shields carried by the Coruscant Guard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The shield could also be used as a melee weapon, striking with the energy shield and dealing damage equivalent to a stun baton."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Riot shields were used by Alliance Commandos and Galactic Alliance Guard troopers during the Battle of Centerpoint Station in 40 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
