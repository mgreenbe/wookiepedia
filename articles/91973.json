It was developed during the early years of the New Republic, although they were never really mass-produced. These \"smart chips\" allowed weapons to be aimed and fired automatically, greatly reducing the need for gunners on a starship. Jorkatt the Render and Vohrkrewel Yahrkar tried to swindle Octavious Jupiter Scragg out of a huge pile of credits by selling him faked versions of these chips, but Yahrkar's personal droid discovered they were false and returned them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
