While the Techno Union, a commerce guild over which Skakoans had majority control, had officially declared itself neutral in the conflict, Foreman Wat Tambor, the organization's leader, directly supported the Separatists. Tambor's expansionist leanings turned the Republic against his homeworld of Skako, which their forces captured. When the Separatists fell at the end of the Clone Wars, Skako was quickly sanctioned by the Republic and placed under an emigration restriction by its succesor, the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
