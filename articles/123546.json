Death Watch would then swoop in an \"stop\" them, winning the support of the people. As the meeting adjourns, Bo-Katan Kryze converses with Pre Vizsla and remains hesitant on trusting the criminals. Vizsla tells her that they need Maul and the criminals to cause trouble in Sundari just to make Satine feel weak so that the citizens will accept them, afterward they would execute Maul and his thugs after taking over Mandalore. Meanwhile inside, Savage Opress expresses doubts on Vizsla betraying them to which Maul solemnly agrees as they can't rule openly without drawing the attention of the Jedi and that they need Vizsla as the face of Mandalore for now, until they find a new face."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Shadow Collective journeys to Mandalore and begins their attack.

He then returns to the throne room and challenges Vizsla to a duel for Death Watch's leadership, which Vizsla is honor-bound to accept. They engage in an intense duel with Vizsla gaining the upper hand before Maul destroys his jetpack. Vizsla then shoots Maul's lightsaber out of his hand and charges towards him for the kill. However, Maul overpowers Vizsla with his martial skills and claims his Darksaber after beating him into submission.
