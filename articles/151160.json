Compared to baseline Humans, their height would be considered short or dwarfed. Ugnaughts were industrious and loyal workers with a rich oral tradition. They were quite hardy, able to withstand long periods of discomfort, and lived around two hundred years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ugnaughts were ruled by elected terend councils, which were led by elected ufflor officers. They were also represented in the Cloud City's Parliament of Guilds. Ugnaughts lived in accordance with their \"blood profession,\" with Ugnaught parents teaching their children their trade. Infant Ugnaughts were known as Ugletts. If the number of new Ugnaughts in a given profession exceeded the number needed, a blood duel was called. When the Ugnaughts reached their twentieth year of age, these fights were held to the death, with the victor winning the right to inherit their blood profession. Despite this outdated and violent custom, the Ugnaughts were generally a peaceful people with a rich culture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When greeting an Ugnaught, it was advised to bow silently, then wait for a guttural purring as a positive response. Usage of the common galactic greeting \"yaa-yaah\" was considered a personal insult to Ugnaughts.

Once Cloud City was built, the noble Ecclessis Figg remembered his promise and gave them their freedom. To make themselves feel at home, the Ugnaughts constructed many labyrinthine and humid red-lit tunnels throughout the city, most of which could only be navigated by their kind."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 32 BBY, some Ugnaughts worked at the Oovo IV maximum-security prison.

His forces destroyed the Ugnaught Administration Hub and disabled the planet's defenses. He then took the entire Ugnaught population prisoner and put them to work in the Confederate droid foundries on Geonosis. Later he massacred the remaining Ugnaughts, except for some survivors who were later killed by General Grievous, when attempting to rescue a group of Padawans. A shipment of these Ugnaught slaves was rescued by the Jedi Treetower and the H.O.P.E. Squad on Yorn Skot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under the Human-centric Galactic Empire, the Ugnaught slavery continued, and they were used for many Imperial projects."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the Battle of Hoth, the Cloud City mining colony fell under the rule of Imperial Captain Hugo Treece, who enslaved the Ugnaughts. Many Ugnaughts fled the city, led by the wealthy King Ozz who sheltered the refugees on floating platforms terraformed to mimic the original Ugnaught home world. There, King Ozz's Ugnaughts formed a resistance movement on Bespin, which planted bombs throughout the colony. As a result, Cloud City was evacuated until the bombs could be defused. When the New Republic recaptured Bespin, the Ugnaughts returned. The fall of the Empire meant that things would return to normal for the Ugnaughts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars 56 indicates that Bespin was the home planet of the Ugnaughts.
