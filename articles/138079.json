Five of the non-gaseous worlds had atmospheres, with the air of the fourth planet being breathable.

In addition, Bshrah-Ky-Ushsj carried out a detailed analysis of the stellar components of the system's sun and determined that the star could at one point explode as a nova.

A skeleton was seated in the command chair of the bridge, with two chests\u2014one empty but adorned with a valuable seal of Kragg and the other filled with jewels and other valuables\u2014lying at its feet. An ancient gladiator droid was programmed to react to an attempt to take either one of the chests and plot a course for the starship to plunge into the system's sun. According to a later child's fable, a powerful Jedi Knight defeated Kragg aboard his ship but was forced to leave the vessel adrift due to being grievously wounded during the fight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the reign of the Galactic Empire, the fortune hunter and scout Sig Coven accidentally discovered the Kragg's Fury. Taking holographic images of the starship but unable to identify it at the time, Coven recorded the hyperspace coordinates of System VV-99-7JE-2N71 on a direct-read-only astrogation datacard and eventually contacted the scholar and university professor Jonas Durns. Durns, who had been trying to prove the historicity of Kragg for many years, believed that treasure looted during the pirate's raid on the Nijune Treasure Fleet was still aboard his starship. The researcher was then able to secure funding from his university for an expedition to determine whether the ship Coven had found was indeed the Kragg's Fury."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The expedition"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Durns subsequently hired a group of spacers to transport himself, his daughter Keya, and Coven to System VV-99-7JE-2N71.

Docking with the pirate starship, the expedition navigated the ship's interior, avoiding traps and ancient defense droids on its way to the bridge. After determining the password needed to enter the bridge, the spacers retrieved one of the chests located there, which led to the gladiator droid sending the ship into the system's sun. The expedition members managed to escape the Kragg's Fury aboard their starship and observed the disintegration of the pirate vessel in a series of explosions at the star.
