Following the boarding, Imperial forces did not discover the Ripoblus leaders but instead the children of the Ripoblus leaders aboard Phantele. After the ship was boarded the Phantele was destroyed. The Ripoblus intended to use the children as hostages to seal a treaty between Ripoblus and Dimok factions to join forces against the Imperial intervention."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
