They would step in whenever a crime was being committed and would record the events in an archive, which could later be accessed by information droids. Around the time of the destruction of Taris, the authorities had to prevent a fight between Calder Nettic and Rickard Lusoff inside a cantina attached to the Garang Spaceport. The archive of this event was later accessed during an investigation into Nettic's death carried out by Jedi Knight Bolook and Revan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
