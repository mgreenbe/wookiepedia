Most common dice were cubes giving only two results after being thrown; three of its sides were one color, while the other three were another color. Some dice were weighted by less sporting owners as it was more easily 'tempered' than a flipped coin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Watto used a chance cube he had with him to gamble with Qui-Gon Jinn on the outcome of the Boonta Eve Classic. After refusing to bet both Anakin Skywalker and his mother Shmi against Anakin Skywalker's Podracer, he offered to roll his chance cube to decide which slave would be wagered: blue for the boy, red for his mother. Qui-Gon Jinn used telekinesis to influence the fall of the chance cube to ensure that Anakin's freedom would be at stake. As Watto had weighted the die to land on red, and had five red spaces and one blue, to ensure winning such random tosses, Jinn's trick took him quite by surprise. (Note: in the film, Watto's cube appears to be the standard arrangement: 3 red sides and 2 blue sides are visible as it rolls; the sixth side is never seen. Based on Watto's shocked reaction at the result, it is likely that it was weighted for red)"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vilmarh Grahrk once played a game with chance cubes in a casino on Ord Mantell, although these had more than six sides."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Han Solo had a pair of dice-shaped ornaments decorating the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "King Katuunko also used a Chance Cube to choose Rugosa for a diplomatic meeting on whether he should join the Galactic Republic or the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a mission to the Unknown Regions in 28 ABY, Jedi Knights Saba Sebatyne and Tekli played a dice game while on board the Jade Shadow.
