In addition, COMPNOR was also an umbrella organization that consisted of multiple sub-divisions, such as the Coalition for Progress and the Sub-Adult Group (SAGroup). Following the Emperor's death at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, COMPNOR was reorganized into the Office of Imperial Promotion, Galactic Truth, and Fact Correction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Commission for the Preservation of the New Order (COMPNOR) started as the Commission for the Protection of the Republic (COMPOR), a populist movement composed of loyalists during the Clone Wars. When in 19 BBY, Sheev Palpatine, then Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, proclaimed himself Emperor of the First Galactic Empire, one of Palpatine's first acts was to reshuffle the political apparatus, reforming the Republic-era COMPOR into COMPNOR. This new division of government was wielded as a political tool for newly appointed Imperial advisors with a gift for shaping public sentiment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the first few years of the Galactic Empire, civic pride boomed. COMPNOR capitalized on the successful propaganda campaigns of the Galactic Republic to accelerate the vast military expansion decreed by the Emperor. A series of sub-commissions began blueprinting the image of the ideal Imperial citizen and what role he or she would play in the greater glory of the Empire. Various propaganda posters and patriotic ploys were designed to achieve these ends."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 14 BBY, COMPNOR was on the rise in the Imperial hegemony.

COMPNOR supported the state-sponsored political religion of the New Order, a set of ideals embodied within Imperial society dedicated to order, control, and the rule of law. COMPNOR supported civic pride, militarism, and unyielding patriotism to the Empire. It criticized the Galactic Republic as lachrymose, corrupt, and ignorant to the demands of its populace, flaws with which it purported the Empire had resolved. As such, the Empire represented the pinnacle of a thousand years of galactic culture and sophistication, refined and molded into a simpler, yet purer form."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "COMPNOR supported the state-sponsored xenophobia and humanocentric policies rampant within the Empire. This was justified by COMPNOR as a natural extension of the human right to rule, exemplified by COMPNOR's teachings of human accomplishments throughout galactic history while minimizing the influences of alien species. To the Empire, aliens were \"foreign\" and \"strange,\" and were portrayed as dangerous animals who were willing to lie, cheat, and manipulate others to get their way. Anti-alien xenophobia was so strong that even near-human species exhibited inherent distrust of their alien neighbors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Organization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "COMPNOR was led by a director and a deputy director.
