All known variants were 1,600 meters long (one mile). Compared to most common frigates and downscaled cruisers known from the days of the Old Republic, the Imperial-class was a huge warship, but in the Imperial Navy, it was one of the Empire's mid-sized mainline warships, like its predecessor had been for the Republic. The hulls of the Imperial-class were painted in Star Destroyer White, a purely economic choice as it was the only variety of paint that was produced in sufficient quantities to coat the Empire's immense number of warships."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Crew requirements"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to officially available statistics, Imperial-class Star Destroyers had at least 37,000 officers and crew. Counting the stormtrooper complement (one division or legion, 9,700 men) would total 46,700. This would include a stormtrooper detachment, starfighter pilots, and support craft pilots.

This could have been accomplished either by superelevating the aft turrets, or merely by spacing the turrets apart over a longer distance of the ship's length. In any case, this Star Destroyer class could bring all its heavy guns to bear by dipping its bow downward.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Numerous smaller and medium guns were mounted around the ship to ward off attacks against lesser ships not capable of being targeted by the main battery. They varied in size; some were designed as point-defense cannon to destroy incoming missiles and starfighters while others engaged lesser capital ships. Some ships, such as Emancipator, were refitted with proton torpedo launchers. Three triple-gun turrets were mounted on the ridge of the ship, just forward of the lowest, forwardmost terrace of the dorsal superstructure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mounted just beyond the forward tip of the attack hangar (see fighter complement), were two large ventral turbolasers, which sat near the corners of the massive hangar."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Complement"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial-class Star Destroyers typically carried a standard Imperial wing of 6 TIE squadrons, for a total of 72 starfighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The standard wing included four TIE Fighter squadrons (one squadron often referred to be a reconnaissance squadron of TIE/rc starfighters), one squadron of TIE Interceptors, one squadron of TIE Bombers (lower priority ships had to make do with TIE/gt starfighter-bombers).

By the Battle of Endor, one of these fighter squadrons had been phased out in favor of a second squadron of TIE Interceptors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack hangar was located on the underside on the ship and was guarded by a set of armored doors.

The receivers carried the TIE to a debarkation station where the pilot would exit. Once moved through the transfer tunnels to a launch hangar, the fighter could be serviced and refueled in a separate bay. In the hangar, the TIEs were cycled through a launch rack and ready for the next launch. The small forward hangar was for shuttle craft carrying high-ranking officials. The forward hangar was also used as a back-up to the main hangar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These ships carried 9,700 troops, as well as massive war vehicles such as AT-AT and AT-ST walkers.

I's tower had support beams running diagonally across it. These would later be substituted for vertical ones during a minor refit, which made the array look similar to the one on Mk. II vessels.\nThe two globes atop the bridge tower served two purposes: aiding both in hyperspace communication and deflector shield generation.

According to official records, over 25,000 were eventually produced. The Navy's immense demand for Star Destroyers led Kuat Drive Yards to subcontract the design out to various other shipwrights, which occasionally led to a number of design quirks: Star Destroyers built by the Corellian Engineering Corporation were considered the fastest ships in the Imperial Navy, both at sublight and hyperspace speeds. Many Star Destroyers were destroyed in the fratricidal warfare that consumed the Empire after the death of Emperor Palpatine at Endor in 4 ABY, while others defected or were captured over the years.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within sector-level fleets, the Imperial-class Star Destroyer served a central battleship role, being the flagship of the unit known as the \"Battle Squadron.\" A Sector Group was responsible for patrolling a given sector and comprised 24 Star Destroyers. It was also observed to operate more or less independently and often far from support ships and facilities. Through many operations, the Imperial-class functioned as a destroyer, a capital ship fast enough to chase down blockade runners and protect fleets. As an escort, it also supported Imperial Star Cruisers and Star Dreadnoughts in fleet combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When he assaulted Hoth, Darth Vader commanded the Star Dreadnought Executor and brought along a flotilla of Imperial-class vessels from Death Squadron to assault the planet.

The Super Star Destroyer Allegiance led a task force of Imperial-class ships and World Devastators during the First Battle of Mon Calamari. This was one of many fleets that struck out from the Core as part of the operation, which was aimed at taking back most of the Galactic Empire's former territories. Operation Shadow Hand saw a relatively heavy use of different types of Super Star Destroyers supported by Star Destroyers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, due to lack of logistics, not all Imperial splinter factions made use of Super Star Destroyers.

The warship was claimed by Booster in the wake of the decisive Battle of Thyferra that concluded the Bacta War, but was in poor condition for many years owing to the great cost of maintaining such a large vessel. In addition, she was stripped of the vast majority of her armament: only ten turbolasers were permitted, and even those were not always functional."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, the vessel received a comprehensive refit in exchange for Booster permitting its use in a New Republic special-operations raid on an Imperial base. The most notable part of this refit was a deep red paint job instead of the classic Imperial white. While Captain Terrik was not permitted to keep all of his weapons after the operation, they were reinstated when the Yuuzhan Vong War occurred.

Early material by Geoffrey Mandel, now considered unofficial, showed the Star Destroyer model smaller than they later appeared.

Later, during the Roman Empire, it became a title worn by the emperors and signified \"the supreme power of the Roman emperor.\" It also acted as the direct namesake for the term Emperor, as the latter term was the Old French spelling for the aforementioned term. Some critics suggest that naming one of the Empire's class of ships Imperial is redundant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Based on an animatic of a Revenge of the Sith TV spot, an Imperator-class Star Destroyer was scheduled to appear during the final scenes of the film, but was apparently cut and replaced with a Venator-class in post-production."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial-class Star Destroyers have featured prominently in many Star Wars computer games.

The book Starships of the Galaxy (Saga Edition) referred to most common Star Destroyers as being classified as \"star cruisers,\" with lowercase letters.
