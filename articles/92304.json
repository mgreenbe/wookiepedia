It was circular in shape and made of stone with a rounded doorway. An abandoned Rebel base on the planet was within visual range of the hut. After the Battle of Yavin during the Galactic Civil War, a spacer and fellow armorsmith visited Ni'mai's mountaintop home, hoping to learn the secret to creating the Bothan's greatest invention, the Reinforced Insulated Sheath armor. Ni'mai was initially skeptical of the spacer's armor crafting abilities, but after a payment of 50,000 credits he instructed the spacer on how to construct the armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mol Ni'mai's hut appears as an explorable location in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies.
