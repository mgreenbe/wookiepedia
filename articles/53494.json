Stationed on Rebel outpost DS 5 in 3 ABY, the Geddawai was used as an escape vehicle by the rogue Imperial Admiral Harkov when Imperial authorities caught up with him. Despite the deployment of a decoy and the confusion of the surrounding scene as the Imperials closed in, the ship was disabled by an Alpha-class Xg-1 Star Wing piloted by Maarek Stele, and was captured by stormtroopers. The vessel was then flown into the hangar of Imperial-class Star Destroyer Garrett, and its occupants, Harkov among them removed for interrogation. It is unknown what the Imperials did with the ship after its capture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since many ships of the X-wing series of games are anagrams and puns of names and phrases, Geddawai could probably stand for get away.
