It was located in the planet's northern hemisphere, hidden in a mountainous area. After an agent of the Galactic Empire tracked members of the Spectres and the Lothal resistance back to the camp after they recovered a hyperdrive, the Imperials attacked and took over the camp, with the rebels escaping under the guidance of the mysterious loth-wolves. After the rebels retreated, Imperial forces bombed the surrounding area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
