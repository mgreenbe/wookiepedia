Consisting of a large metal plate form-molded to match the contours of a starship's control panel, the CS20 Board Plate was slid into place and sealed off access to the console. The mechanism locked off access to the ship's instruments, computers, and flight controls. The plate could be removed by keying in an electronic combination, or using a keycard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
