During the time of the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, the medal was made available to Imperials who attained the rank of at least sergeant major. The medal was in the form of a necklace with a stylized blue and black ribbon worn around the neck. The medallion was silver-colored in appearance, and imprinted with a black Imperial crest. The form was similar to those used for Imperial commendations, issued to soldiers who participated in the Battle of Restuss. The Crimson Phoenix Medal of the Rebel Alliance served as the Rebel-equivalent to the Nova Star Medal of the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nova Star Medal of the Empire appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. With the release of Chapter 3: Smugglers and Scoundrels on September 27, 2006, the Nova Star Medal of the Empire was included as a wearable medal sold by Imperial recruiters to players of the Imperial faction who attained the rank of at least sergeant major. The medal was available for the standard price of 160,000 credits, but the cost of Imperial faction items would fluctuate depending on the planetary control bonus, and whether or not the player was Human. Due to the Empire's xenophobic policies, alien players were forced to pay an increased racial penalty. The item, when worn as a necklace, provided the player with an increase to certain attributes. The graphical appearance of the Nova Star Medal of the Empire was identical to the one used for Imperial commendations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
