The craft was able to avoid detection by the orbiting Separatist fleet, but crash-landed on the planet, due to unforeseen weather conditions. The wrecked transport was then attacked by an escaped roggwart, although the clones were able to kill it. They then unloaded all their equipment from the transport and one of the commandos then blew it up, to prevent the Separatists from learning any classified information from it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
