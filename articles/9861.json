In 43.5 ABY, he commanded a Security squad in an attempt to arrest the psychotic Jedi Knights Bazel Warv and Yaqeel Saav'etu. The two Jedi, however, had just been captured by Imperial Head of State Jagged Fel, Jedi Knight Jaina Solo, and Solo's parents, Han and Leia Solo.

By 43.5 ABY, he commanded his own squad, having attained the rank of Captain. In that year, a mysterious illness began to befall several Jedi Knights, and the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances decided to deal with the matter by encasing the psychotic Jedi in carbonite. When Jedi Knights Yaqeel Saav'etu and Bazel Warv were stricken by the psychosis, they were quickly detained outside of the Jedi Temple's speeder entrance by Jedi Knight Jaina Solo, Imperial Remnant Head of State Jagged Fel, and Solo's parents, Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Atar and his squad were drawn to the area by the commotion, and as Fel, Han, and Jaina took Saav'etu and Warv inside the Jedi Temple, Atar's squad surrounded Fel's limousine, on top of which was hidden the incapacitated Warv. While his men held Fel's driver, Baxton, at blasterpoint, Atar confronted Organa Solo. When she denied knowledge of anything that had happened, Atar showed her that he had an image on his datapad of Warv lying atop Fel's limousine. Fel and the Solos returned, however, and the Head of State ordered Atar to have his men stand down. Atar revealed that he had been unaware that the limo was Fel's and advised the Head of State not to interfere. Fel, however, replied that he would leave him to his duties only once Atar ordered his men to release his driver and vehicle. The Captain complied and then revealed that he had a warrant, signed by Head Judge of the Court of Jedi Affairs Arabelle Lorteli, for the arrest of the psychotic Jedi. Han and Leia decided to buy some time by reentering the Temple and closing the gate behind them as Fel and Jaina quickly left in the Head of State's limousine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they departed, Jaina gave Atar a mocking wave. Angered, Atar ordered that they be prevented from leaving the area, and a Galactic Alliance Security assault speeder blocked their exit. The Security officer in charge of the speeder refused to move for them, but journalist Javis Tyrr soon arrived, and Solo discovered that Tyrr was using a Lovolol cleaning droid to infiltrate the Temple and gather information on the Jedi. Atar then arrived on the scene and reassured the Jedi that Tyrr wouldn't do anything illegal, and when Fel requested that he allow them to pass, Atar, although reluctant to let them leave with the droid, complied."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Horns"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, a group of Jedi tricked Lorteli into giving them a document granting them rights to visit Valin and Jysella Horn, two psychotic Jedi who had earlier been captured by the Galactic Alliance and encased in carbonite.

Sergeant Weeze then activated an alarm, alerting Atar and several other Security officers to the trouble."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Atar arrived on the scene, Solo showed him the document granting them visitation rights to the Horns. The Captain claimed that he didn't have the authority to allow them access to the Jedi, but Jedi Master Saba Sebatyne countered that he didn't have the authority to stop them and questioned his belief that Galactic Alliance Security was bound by Judicial Center writs. Atar replied that they were bound by the law, and, after Sebatyne announced that the Jedi would begin their search, he volunteered to escort the Jedi to the Horns. Forced to allow the Jedi to enter, he ordered a Bothan lieutenant, Rasher Ke'e, to allow only the Jedi access to the Horns, not the press. However, the order was in vain, as the Jedi ensured that the media accessed the Horns as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Atar was concerned for his Security career and highly prioritized capturing the psychotic Jedi, seeing them as a menace to the Galactic Alliance. He also showed Head of State Fel some courtesy, as he feared the repercussions of evoking a diplomatic incident. However, he was easily aggravated, and he threatened Jaina Solo\u2014allowing her to leave with the cleaning droid only because they were in an Imperial diplomat's vehicle, which was thus Imperial property. Despite his often aggressive manner, Atar was also cautious, attempting to stall the Jedi and the press from accessing the Horns, knowing it could spell trouble for the Galactic Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Atar was created by Star Wars author Troy Denning for Fate of the Jedi: Abyss, the third of nine novels in the Fate of the Jedi series, released on August 18, 2009."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
