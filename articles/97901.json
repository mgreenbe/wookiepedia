When Leia revealed the Empire's treachery, it turned the Noghri against their former masters. Instead of working to take Leia's life, they acted as her loyal body guards, and it was essentially impossible to have them leave their mistress's side. A number of them were slain defending the lives of her and her family throughout the years of the New Republic and into the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They used either E-11 blaster rifles, T-21 light repeating blaster, or slugthrowers during their work.
