Lorrd was close to Bimmiel and its capital city was Lorrd City."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Geography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Imperial era, Lorrd was known as a great repository of academic knowledge. Lorrd City had a great university which contained many different schools of learning. Other major centers on Lorrd included Frezen, New Shallos and Qatamer. Qatamer was the capital of the desert province of Kinyov which was considered the birthplace of modern Lorrdian culture. During the Kanz Disorders, it was used by the Argazdan Myrialites as a center for slaving operations on Lorrd."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three hundred years after the start of the Disorders, the Argazdans ordered the construction of mysterious cone-shaped depressions known as the Slave Pits of Lorrd which were built at the cost of the lives of many thousands of Lorrdians. These pits were used to hide bio-engieered monsters created by a female Yuuzhan Vong shaper working for the last Argazdan Regent Torphceris. Following the end of the Disorders, Jedi Master Mari-Elan Nora ordered them filled, aware of the unknown evils they concealed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Kanz Disorders, Lorrd was conquered by the Argazdan Myrialites from\nneighboring Argazda. The Lorrdians were enslaved under the orders of Myrial for supporting the Amaltannan resistance. The Myriates seized control of the rest of the Kanz sector and established the independent Argazdan Redoubt which lasted 300 years (3970 BBY\u20133670 BBY)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Any attempt made by the Galactic Republic and the Jedi to end the disorders was cut short by the Mandalorian Wars followed by the more devastating Jedi and Sith Civil Wars. The Republic was further preoccupied by a G0-T0 droid revolt in the Gordian Reach in 3946 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under Argazdan rule, they were forbidden by their masters from speaking with each other and were forced to develop a system of subtle gestures, facial expressions, and body postures to talk to each other known as kinetic communication. This secret language was used to coordinate guerilla activities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Towards the end of the Kanz Disorders, the last ruling Argazdan Regent Torphceris constructed the legendary Slave Pits of Lorrd near Qatamer at the cost of the lives of thousands of Lorrdian slaves. After three centuries and the loss of over 500 million Lorrdian lives, the Kanz Disorders finally ended when the Republic and Jedi finally intervened. A Republic and Jedi task force under the Lorrdian Jedi Master Mari-Elan Nora defeated the Myrialites and recaptured Lorrd after dogged fighting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even long after the Jedi freed Lorrd, the Lorrdians remained staunch opponents of slavery, and were more fluent in non-verbal communication than most Humans were in verbal communication. During the Clone Wars, Lorrd and the Kanz sector were represented by Nee Alavar in the Galactic Senate prior to her arrest and imprisonment. By the time of the Imperial era, most Argazdans regarded their ancestors' treatment of the Lorrdians as shameful. Most Lorrdians and Argazdans in the sector got on well despite the repercussions of the conflict."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 40 ABY Lorrd was a member of the Galactic Alliance and Nelani Dinn, a Jedi of the New Jedi Order, was stationed there. Dinn was soon contacted by Jacen Solo, who was investigating an artifact recently found on Toryaz Station. Dinn found a contact who would examine the artifact, Dr. Heilan Rotham, and meet Solo and his apprentice, Ben Skywalker, on Lorrd. The three traveled to Dr. Rotham's office in Lorrd City, and Dr. Rotham found that the artifact contained encoded messages that Dinn considered ominous. However, their meeting was cut short, as Dinn received a message\u2014a man in a Y-wing was threatening to fire missiles into a populous area of Lorrd City unless he was allowed to speak to a Jedi. Seeing that Dr. Rotham would need some time to decipher the artifact, Dinn was accompanied by Solo and Skywalker as she left to settle the matter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dinn, Solo, and Skywalker were greeted by lieutenant Neav Samran of the Lorrd Security Force, who explained the situation to them. The man in the Y-wing was Ordith Huarr, a former fighter pilot who had flown for the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. Huarr claimed that he had been seeing the ghost of his late wife, but before Dinn was able to garner any more information from Huarr, Jacen Solo used the Force to pull the airborne Y-wing to the ground. Huarr then detonated the missiles, killing himself. Following Huarr's death, Dinn was agitated with Solo, because she thought that Solo could have used more peaceful means to end the conflict and prevent any loss of life. Afterward, the group returned to Dr. Rotham, who had translated the remaining messages on the artifact, save one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mysterious occurrences similar to the plight of Ordith Huarr soon began to happen frequently on Lorrd. One man, Dr. Movac Arisster, a professor at the University of Pangalactic Cultural Studies, took hostages inside an aquarium and strapped himself to one of the hostages, with a bomb strapped to his back. Arisster claimed to have spoken to the late Jedi Master Aayla Secura, and said that Secura told him to bring the Jedi in to talk. Arisster wanted one thing\u2014to become famous. Arisster was dying of cancer and wanted to be able to defeat a Jedi, to give some trace of immortality to himself. Arisster decided to defeat the Jedi by denying them a happy ending, meaning that he would prevent the Jedi being able to do their duty and save the hostages. Solo, realizing that Arisster had won, allowed Arisster to detonate the bomb, killing himself and his captive, Serom Haxan. Dinn became furious that Solo had just left Arisster to kill himself and Haxan without exploring any other options."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several more Force ghost related incidents occurred, including a man named Borth Pazz, who threatened to jump off a building unless he was taken for Jedi training. Pazz stood atop the building in old Jedi robes holding a dated, non-functional lightsaber. Pazz demanded that the Jedi teach him a Jedi trick, despite his complete lack of Force-sensitivity. When his request was denied, Dinn watched as he jumped from the rooftop, his fall slowed by Solo's use of the Force. Pazz ended the day with a broken leg, and he was taken away, howling about Jedi trickery and deception. Soon after these events, a mysterious woman named Brisha Syo arrived on Lorrd. Syo was arrested immediately after she landed in the Lorrd City Spaceport, and Solo suspected her of causing the incidents involving Huarr, Arisster, and Pazz. Syo admitted that she had caused the events and revealed that she was Force-sensitive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yuuzhan Vong occupied the planet during their invasion of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
