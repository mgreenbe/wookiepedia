During the galaxy-wide Clone Wars, Jhordvar briefly worked for Jabba the Hutt, a crime lord who operated on the desert world Tatooine. However, in 19 BBY, the Noghri tried to betray Jabba, and the Hutt hired the young Mandalorian bounty hunter Boba Fett to capture or kill Jhordvar, who had gone into hiding in Tatooine's vast Dune Sea."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fett soon found Jhordvar in his hideout and offered him the chance to accompany him back to Jabba's Palace peacefully. However, the alien refused to surrender to a \"lackey\" and was killed after a short but fierce battle. A sandstorm left Fett stranded at the hideout for a few days, and Jhordvar's body was exposed to sand and heat, which mummified the remains of the assassin and snapped off his hands. Fett took only the hands as identification back to Jabba and left the rest of the body in the desert. Upon Fett's return, Jabba's majordomo, Bib Fortuna, identified Jhordvar by a ring the assassin had left on one of his hands, and Fett received his bounty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jhordvar was a formidable assassin, but he was nevertheless overpowered and killed by the young Boba Fett after a fierce fight.
