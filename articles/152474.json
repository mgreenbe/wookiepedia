The Dimok had lived with war her entire life, losing her children to the war. By the time a group of Coruscant News Network journalists found her in the then\u2013bombed-out village, she had become an old crone. The journalists interviewed her with a holocamera, and she expressed her desire to see her grandchildren live in a world free of war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the journalists left, a Tynnan diplomat and the Galactic Alliance Defense Force's Gar Stazi, who had accompanied the journalists, stayed behind, and the Tynnan began to question the crone on matters regarding her family. When asked by the diplomat whether she would give a small parcel of her family's land to settle a claim with the Ripoblus, the crone spat and answered that she would rather die. Stazi later reflected in a letter to Rogue Leader Jhoram Bey in 137 ABY that the day he met the crone was the last day he believed in peace, and that everyone, even the Dimok crone, was bred to compete."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to living with war her whole life and losing her children to it, the crone said she would do anything to let her grandchildren live in a world at peace.
