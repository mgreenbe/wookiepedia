Karrde shot its tail off in self-defense, which injured and stunned the beast, stopping its attack. Karrde nursed it back to health and named it, and the two took a liking to one another (especially since Karrde was feeding Sturm, and since tailless vornskrs lack the aggressive tendencies of those who have their tails, Sturm had no desire to hunt). Around 9 ABY Karrde brought them to Mount Tantiss in hoping that they could locate Mara Jade and Luke Skywalker using their Force-related hunting technique."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The name, along with Drang, was a reference to Sturm und Drang, an eighteenth-century German literary movement emphasizing struggles of the individual against society, something which author Timothy Zahn felt would appeal to Karrde as an educated, pun-loving sort."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
