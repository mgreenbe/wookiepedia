BLC-2 burst cannons were considered to be the starfighter equivalent of a scattergun, as it fired a cluster of high-damage bolts in a wide arc with a slow rate of fire. The BLC-2s were used primarily at close range, as they conserved large amounts of power and were ineffective at greater distances."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
