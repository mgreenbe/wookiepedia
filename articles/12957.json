After having finally earned enough credits to leave the swamps of his homeworld, Barquin traveled to Tatooine. When he arrived at Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, the Modal Nodes had already left the desert world, leaving him behind. He needed money to leave the planet, so Barquin had to look for a new job and found one\u2014in Jabba's Palace. The atmosphere wasn't his taste at all and instead of earning money for performing with the Max Rebo Band, he was enslaved by the Hutt crimelord. Without any possibility to escape, he tried to find a way to kill himself. His opportunity came, when Jabba left his palace with the Khetanna to feed Luke Skywalker and his companions to the Great Pit of Carkoon. Barquin waited for an opportunity to jump into the sarlacc's maw, but when the skirmish broke out, he escaped into the Dune Sea. He headed towards Mos Eisley and hid on a cargo barge to Stenos. There, he built up an import/export business and became quite successful with it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Barquin was added to the extended musical number in the Special Edition of Return of the Jedi.
