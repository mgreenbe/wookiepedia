They were designed during the Clone Wars to serve as second-line ships. After they Clone Wars most were sold to local defense forces or private interests, and several were eventually modified to serve as carriers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Neutron Star-class was 600 meters long. By the Galactic Civil War, the design had become outdated and easily challenged and outgunned by most up-to-date capital ships. It was slow in comparison with many of its counterparts, as well as prone to frequent damage. It required a crew of 2,050 and could carry up to 200 troops."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their slow speed, their engines consumed high amounts of fuel, which somewhat limited the range of these vessels. The Neutron Star also required frequent and expensive maintenance to operate, making it quickly replaced by most organizations that could afford it. However, the Alliance Fleet, in desperate need of more capital ships, chose to convert a number of them into starfighter carriers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When a number of Neutron Star-class bulk cruisers fell into the hands of the Alliance to Restore the Republic some saw them as a curse rather than a blessing due to the extensive and costly maintenance they required to remain battle ready. However a cheaper solution was discovered which involved converting the craft into a carrier for three squadrons of starfighters despite the original model carrying no fighters at all."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel Alliance Sourcebook made it clear that the specifications for the Neutron Star class represented vessels which had been modified to serve as cruiser-carriers rather than the stock model.
