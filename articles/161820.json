Decades before 4050 BBY, the Nelori Marauders established their main base on Voon.

A small group of Jedi pursued the Marauders to Voon, where the former crippled the Nelori fleet before being repulsed by a counter-attack by Marauder reinforcements. Another, larger group of Jedi soon arrived onto the planet in specially-modified stealth transports. However, when the Jedi infiltrated the fortress used by the Nelori as their base, they could find no trace of the bandits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Arkanian-Sephi Jedi Arca Jeth then used the Force to detect signs of life below the fortress, in the subterranean pockets littering the planet's crust.

To gain the element of surprise, the Jedi silently penetrated Voon's atmosphere in unarmed transports rigged with counter-sensor arrays and low-output power compensators. Shortly before the dawn of Voon's sun, the Jedi reinforcements dropped on the roof of the Nelori stronghold, swiftly infiltrating the fortress and searching its topmost levels for the Marauder forces. To the Jedi's surprise, however, the structure appeared to be completely abandoned, leading the Knights to wonder how the Nelori had slipped past the Jedi sensor sweep of the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Knight Jeth then unsuccessfully attempted to use the Force to detect any Nelori forces in the lower levels of the stronghold. Still suspecting that the Marauders had not abandoned the fortress, Jeth proceeded to search the depths of the planet below the fortress and perceived an unusual feeling of living beings there. Jeth then led his companions toward the source of the sensation. When the group of Jedi finally entered a large subterranean chamber without having encountered any sign of the Nelori so far, the Knights began to argue among themselves over the trustworthiness of Jeth's sensation. At that point, all of the Jedi sensed a dark presence passing through them, causing them to search their surroundings for the feeling's source."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A massive cave-in occurred in the chamber then, immediately injuring four of the Knights present, followed promptly by an all-out assault by a force of more than two hundred Nelori Marauders. In the ensuing fierce battle, although the Jedi put up an efficient fight against their enemy, the numbers of the former constantly diminished. Realizing the hopelessness of their situation, Jeth realized he had violated his own Jedi training by letting his emotions affect his judgment. Jeth then proceeded to apply the Jedi battle meditation technique, which allowed the Jedi warriors to strengthen their resolve and ultimately prevail over the Nelori. In the weeks following the Jedi's costly victory over the Marauders on Voon, Jeth led the Jedi in chasing down and defeating the remainder of the Nelori forces scattered throughout the Hyabb-Twith Corridor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Nelori Marauders' departure from their homeworld of Dachat, the group established their main base in a stronghold on Voon.
