The caves became a vergence in the Force, where the dark and light side energies in the caves were unbalanced. Jedi strong enough to resist the dark side studied the balance of the Force in the caves, and after the fall of the Jedi Order the dark side power increased. The caves were lit by crystals embedded in the walls. These crystals could also be used in the construction of a lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The dark side was strong enough in the caves to corrupt the local icewolves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
