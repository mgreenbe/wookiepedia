Under the direction of the Jedi Master, and while receiving advice and an oral history of the Jedi Order and The Force the children are then taught a simple combination of lightsaber attacks.

Jedi Master Yoda uses the force to contact everyone at the audience. Outnumbered, Vader and Maul retreat back to the stage. The stage lowers again and the villains disappear. After the stage lowers, the Jedi Master uses a Jedi mind trick to make the stormtroopers leave.
