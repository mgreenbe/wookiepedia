The Plawal Rift was the location of a small enclave of Jedi refugees, mainly children, looked after by the Ho'Din Jedi Master Plett in the wake of Order 66. After Emperor Palpatine learned of the enclave, he commissioned the battlemoon Eye of Palpatine to destroy it. However, the battlemoon was disabled in the Moonflower Nebula by Jedi Knights Callista Masana and Geith Eris. A wing of Imperial starfighters subsequently assaulted the enclave, but the refugees managed to escape as they were forewarned of the coming danger."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
