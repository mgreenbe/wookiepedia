Four Jedi Temple Guards, along with Tano's Master, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, later escorted the actual culprit, the Jedi Barriss Offee, to Coruscant's Republic military base, where Offee confessed to the crimes, leading to Tano's exoneration.

The Guards, also known as Temple Guardians, comprised various Jedi Knights and sentinels in the Order. The position of Temple Guard was considered one of the duties that a Knight could adopt, and Knights were chosen as part of their continuing commitment to the Jedi.

Millennia later, the Jedi Temple Guards continued in their role as guardians for the Temple during the Clone Wars, a galactic conflict fought between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems that began in 22 BBY. Around the war's second year, the Jedi Temple's hangar was bombed, killing six Jedi, several clone troopers, and a number of Temple employees. During the investigation, a group of citizens gathered at the Temple's steps to protest the Jedi's involvement in the war. Two Temple Guards stood watch at the steps, along with Jedi Master Cin Drallig, their security chief, as the citizens continued their protest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a memorial service was held for the Jedi victims of the Temple hangar bombing, the Togruta Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano was accused of orchestrating the sabotage and the murder of Republic citizen Letta Turmond, who was secretly involved in the bombing. Tano was eventually captured by her Master, Anakin Skywalker, and the Republic security forces. Members of the Jedi Temple Guards helped escort Tano to the Chamber of Judgment, where the Jedi High Council questioned Tano about the charges levied against her. When the Council expelled her from the Order so that she could be tried by the Galactic Senate, two of the Guards activated their double-bladed lightsaber pikes and blocked Skywalker following his objection to the ruling, while one of the Guards removed Tano's Padawan braid."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Chasing Barriss Offee"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker soon discovered that the actual perpetrator of the crimes was the Mirialan Jedi Barriss Offee, a friend of Tano's. Skywalker confronted Offee in the Temple's dormitories, but she attempted to flee from him, only to be blocked by the Temple Guards. As the ensuing duel between Skywalker and Offee progressed to the rooftop of the Temple's ziggurat, the Temple Guards activated their lightsabers and continued to surround Offee and Skywalker in order to protect Jedi Master Tera Sinube and a nearby class of Jedi Initiates from harm. After Skywalker finally defeated and apprehended Offee, four members of the Guard escorted her to the Republic military base, where Tano was being tried, and Offee confessed to the Temple bombing and Turmond's murder. The Guards later escorted Offee out of the court when Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who was officiating her subsequent trial, ordered her to be taken away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later during the war, Jedi Master Yoda underwent a deprivation ritual in an attempt to ascertain the source of the voice he had been hearing in his visions. After the procedure, Jedi Master Mace Windu tasked three Jedi Temple Guards with watching over Yoda as he recovered. However, Yoda convinced Anakin Skywalker to help him evade the Guards by pretending to accompany Yoda for a walk. The two Guards standing by the exit from the recovery room tried to halt Yoda's progress, but Skywalker assured them that he would watch over Yoda.
