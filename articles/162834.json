They were programmed to capture escaping prisoners and to put down riots through nonlethal means, so that punishment could meted out to the prisoners by flesh-and-blood guards. They were tall and angular, with a thin body and long, spindly arms that were fitted with stun claws. Some were used in an Imperial prison on Felucia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
