Watto told him to move a scrap pile away for melting but Anakin found a ultra power cell. He was going to use the power cell for his podracer but a large explosion went off in the distance. Thieves had attacked the medical center but instead of running away like the crowd, Anakin ran towards the medical center. A Twi'lek told him that the medical center's generator was destroyed but Anakin promised her he could fix it. He used the ultra power cell he was going to use for his podracer on the generator. The generator restarted and everyone cheered."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A week later, Anakin was in a podrace against Sebulba when Sebulba insulted Anakin and knocked his podracer into Anakin's.
