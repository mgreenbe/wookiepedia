The Sith also discovered that Keshtah Minor was separated from Alanciar by a large ocean to the east and smaller western sea known as the Sea of Flames.

Vaal was forced to flee for her life and she flew her uvak Nink to the site of the explosion. Shortly later, she encountered the Sith who took her captive. After a few days, Adari learned to communicate with the offworlders, who told her about their predicament. After learning about the Skyborn from Adari, the Sith leader Yaru Korsin devised a plan to win over the Keshiri by claiming to be their \"gods\" who had returned to them.

These tensions led the Red Sith leader Ravilan Wroth to contaminate the Keshiri city of Tetsubal's water supply with cyanogen silicate in an attempt to force the Sith to return to the stars. However, Yaru's wife Seelah Korsin discovered his plot and framed the entire Red Sith community for a spate of mass poisoning deaths throughout the Ragnos Lakes region, which lead to the deaths of a hundred thousand Keshiri.

Meanwhile, Seelah and Jariad raised a force of armed supporters known as the Sith Sabers, who purported to be a hobby club which specialized in lightsaber combat. The two anti-Korsin conspiracies eventually converged at the Kesh Sith Temple. However, the Grand Lord and his daughter Nida Korsin outmaneuvered and defeated both conspiracies.

Nida's legacy was commemorated in a holiday called the Festival of Nida's Rise which was held every seventy-nine years. Meanwhile, Donellan's legacy was commemorated in a holiday called Donellan's Day, which served to warn the Sith not to hesitate to make their move towards power. In response, Nida instituted a succession system based on meritocracy. By 3960 BBY, four main social classes had developed on Keshtah: the high-born Force-sensitive Sith, a yeoman class of non-Force sensitive Human Sith, enslaved Sith outcasts and dissidents who had been condemned to generational slavery, and the native Keshiri, who formed a large serf underclass. By this stage, the Sith Sabers had developed into the Tribe's equivalent of the Jedi Knights and were task with enforcing law and order on Keshtah. Two major political factions had also developed within the Tribe: the Red Faction, led by High Lord Dernas, and the Gold Faction, led by High Lord Pallima.

Thus, in 3960 BBY, she staged her own assassination attempt to discredit her political rivals. Her agents manipulated the uvak wrangler Campion Dey into staging an assassination attempt during the rake-riding games on Donellan's Day. Campion was sponsored by the High Lord Candra Kitai, who had recently ascended to the High Lordship the previous year to fill Lillia's former seat.

After \"confessing\" to her role in the conspiracy, Candra pledged her \"eternal loyalty\" to Lillia and was forced to shovel uvak manure at an uvak-exhibition facility in Tahv known as the zoo.

As a result of the Time of the Rot, Keshtah's cities and infrastructure crumbled into ruins and disrepair. Southern Keshtah was also devastated by a series of powerful explosion from the volcano Sessal Spire and its sister volcanoes, which caused extensive damage to cities and infrastructure including Tahv's Korsinata arena.

Several factions particularly the Korsinite League, which emulated Yaru and his daughter Nida, regarded Yaru Korsin's Testament as a \"sacred scripture\" and believed that the Tribe needed to adhere to the political structure and practices outlined by the first Grand Lord. The \"Pantheon's Peace\" was convened at the Kesh capitol building, which was regarded by the various Sith factions as a neutral meeting ground and a sacred place due to its association with the Grand Lordship. The capitol building also housed the Office of the Caretaker, who was responsible for safeguarding the Tribe's history and time-keeping.

The Sisters' presence attracted the attention of the other Sith factions, which had camped on the grounds of the Circle Eternal. Following a brief skirmish between the Sisters and two other factions, the Korsinite League and Force 57, Hilts was able to mediate a truce by offering to read the Testament of Yaru Korsin.

Meanwhile, the Golden Destiny contested the Korsinite League's literalist adherence to the Testament of Yaru Korsin and argued that the Tribe needed to stop fighting, unseal the Temple and return to the stars. While attempting to deactivate the holocron, Varner Hilts discovered that the testament had been recorded over an older recording; which turned out to be orders from the Sith Lord Naga Sadow to his slave Captain Yaru Korsin.

This map confirmed the existence of a second continent on the planet Kesh known as \"Keshtah Major\". This discovery confirmed that Keshtah was not the only known land on Kesh and that several other lands and seas lay unexplored.

As Grand Lord, Hilts would leave a lasting legacy on the Tribe's history. Firstly, he allowed Force-sensitive Keshiri individuals to join the Tribe, thus providing them with an avenue for social mobility. This policy was intended to commemorate the sacrifices of Jaye, who had helped find the map of \"Keshtah Major\", but did not live to see the day.

Many of these Human Sith were the descendants of Ermon Parrah, who had led an unsuccessful attempt to steal the crippled vessel Omen and return to the stars eons ago. Some Sith Lords like Lord Galathos were also not above terrorizing slaves that failed to meet their work quota.

Edell Vrai, a young forward-thinking member of the Golden Destiny, was designated as the \"chief engineer\". After a series of failed experiments with long-distance uvak flights and sailing ships, Edell settled for airships, which were held aloft by hydrogen gasbags and powered by uvak.

However, the Tribe ultimately succeeded in conquering Alanciar despite these challenges. Edell's expedition managed to capture two Alanciari, the soldier Jogan Halder and the Wardmaster Quarra Thayn, who were roped into serving the Tribe. Firstly, Hilts successfully convinced Jogan that the Tribe did not actually pose a threat to them but were in fact the benevolent Protectors. Secondly, Hilts took the opportunity to use the Alanciari invasion to eliminate his rival Bentado Korsin, who was also the leader of the Korsinite League, and had ambitions of becoming Grand Lord. Edell and Quarra thwarted an attempt by Bentado to create a \"Second Tribe\" on Alanciar and kill Grand Lord Hilts.

Abeloth then \"absorbed\" the populist Senator Rokari Kem, and assumed her identity. Led by the new Chief of State \"Kem\", the Lost Tribe then infiltrated the Galactic Alliance Senate and took over the galactic capital of Coruscant. However, the Lost Tribe and Abeloth were defeated by the New Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Geography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Keshtah was a small continent in the southern hemisphere of the planet Kesh. It was characterized by long ridged peninsulas forming from plateaus which created rocky coastlines and fjords. Keshtah was also known to have several mountain ranges including Takara Mountains\u2014formerly called the Cetajan Mountains. This mountain range was very steep and also covered a peninsula which bordered the Sea of Flames. At the tip of this peninsula lay a a Sith Temple, which had been built by the Lost Tribe of Sith over the crash site of the starship Omen, which had crashed on the mountains during the Great Hyperspace War. Due to its remote location, the Temple was accessible only by air or a hazardous climb up the slopes. By 41 ABY, it had become a historically-important site on Kesh and was used to train Sith apprentices."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition, Keshtah was also home to several settlements including its largest city and capital Tahv. Prior to 5000 BBY, Tahv was a small Keshiri village which had been built to keep the Keshiri safe from dangerous creatures. By 4975 BBY, it had become the capital of the Sith Tribe on Kesh and would remain so for several millennia. After the Lost Tribe of Sith helped the Keshiri either drive away or domesticate Kesh's native beasts, Tahv became Keshtah's main settlement and capital city. As the \"Jewel of Kesh\", Tahv was a decorative city, focusing mainly on workings of art, often created by Sith artists using the Force. Some buildings in Tahv included the capitol building, which was built on top of a large plaza known as the Circle Eternal, the Korsinata stadium, and the zoo. The city also had a large aqueduct system, which towered over the cities' streets and buildings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Other known settlements included Eorm, Berav, Sharv, Zandi, Glorim, Orreg, Rees, Ryav, Elvarnos, Roston, Cham, Kithar, and Telmath. Eorm was a port city in south-western which was home to enslaved Humans, who had been cast out of the Tribe for various crimes including rebellion. Following the \"Unification\" of Keshtah and Alanciar, Eorm became a production center for sails used to build wooden sailing ships. Orreg was a city in northern Keshtah that contained the Tribal Intelligence Depository. By 2974 BBY, a port had also been built near Berav, overlooking the Sea of Flames, to cater for ships coming from Alanciar. The north-eastern corner of Keshtah, overlooking the Western Sea, was covered in purple dunes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Other prominent natural features included the volcano Sessal Spire, the Marisota River and floodplain, and the Ragnos Lakes. Sessal Spire was located on a peninsula on the southwestern coast of Keshtah and overlooked the Sea of Flames. The Marisota River was a large river which flowed from the jungle highlands and mountains of the central interior into the Ragnos Lakes. The Marisota floodplain was a flat grassland which was home to farms and was also the site of several battles. The Ragnos Lakes was home to several Keshiri settlements including Tetsubal until 4985 BBY when thousands of Keshiri were killed during a mass poisoning outbreak of cyanogen silicate. As a result, the Ragnos Lakes region was abandoned and was only filled with ghost towns by 3960 BBY.

Some notable plant species that were found in Keshtah included dalsa flowers, hejarbo shoots, and vosso trees. The Marisota Floodplain was covered in grass and tussock. Keshtah did not have any native trees whose wood could be used as timber for long-distance oceanic travel. The hejarbo shoots were often used for building houses but proved vulnerable to rainstorms. Vosso trees were too dense to float. Keshtah also had several jungles in its central highland region. This jungle region was home to various types plants which were ideal for making fertilizer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Keshtah was also home to several species of animals including the uvak, a species of winged dragon-like reptiles which was capable of traveling for long distances. Uvak were the only domesticated animal of burden that was native to this continent. Uvaks were also known for their intelligence and many developed close relationships with their owners. While Keshtah was home to several predator species including an unidentified six-legged mammal, most of these had become extinct by 3960 BBY due to the Sith Tribe's enthusiasm for blood sports.

The Neshtovar used their uvak to develop an aerial circuit system which connected Keshtah's settlements. The Neshtovar regarded themselves as the \"Sons of the Skyborn\", a race of powerful gods who were believed to have created Kesh during a \"Great Battle\" with the malevolent Otherside. Until the Sith-takeover, the Neshtovar dominated every aspect of life in their settlements and persecuted dissenters like the geologist Adari Vaal who disagreed with their creation account.

By 3960 BBY, Sith society on Keshtah Minor was divided into four main social groups: the Tribe, non-Force-sensitive Humans, disenfranchised Human slaves, and a large Keshiri serf class. Human members of the Tribe who fell out with the authorities were often condemned to generational slavery. Many of these slaves resided in the port town of Eorm where they were forced to serve as unskilled tailors, weavers, and laborers. Slavery continued even after the Hilts Restoration and at least one slave uprising was known to have occurred in 2974 BBY. It was also possible for slaves to regain their place in the Tribe if they cooperated with the authorities or did heroic acts, as in the cases of Candra Kitai and Parlan Spinner."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The most important social and political institution on Keshtah was the Sith Tribe.
