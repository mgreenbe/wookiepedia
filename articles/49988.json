Kun Lago, Prime Counselor to the monarch, blamed Princess of Theed Padm\u00e9 Amidala for the eruption of the crisis, which had a greatly negative impact on the popularity of the king. Lago's son Ian, in turn, believed that his father was also involved in the scandal. Since corruption in Naboo elected leaders was virtually unheard of, the king's double agenda was successful and unknown by the populace at first. Veruna's disastrous foray into offworld politics was initially encouraged by Senator Palpatine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the wake of the disclosure of Ars Veruna's involvement in the scandal, a crisis erupted and the king soon abdicated the throne, ending his thirteen year rule. The popular Amidala, whose bid for the throne had initially been suggested to her parents, and subsequently discreetly backed by Palpatine, was quickly elected and crowned his successor as Monarch of Naboo."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Kun Lago was dismissed of his post and his son Ian left the planet, Veruna chose to flee Theed, the planetary seat of government.

The comic was written by Terry Moore and published on September 27, 2000 by Dark Horse Comics. In the story, the scandal is shown as an important reason why Kun Lago resents Padm\u00e9 Amidala so strongly, and tries to oppose his son's relationship with the princess. The story hints that Amidala was behind the publicizing of the scandal, that Kun Lago was involved in it, and that the king's abdication was significantly influenced by this event."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although stories from issues 1 to 20 of Star Wars Tales are usually considered to be ambiguously canon, the events described in A Summer's Dream were included in other canonical works, fitting the story into the overall Star Wars continuity. The foreign policy scandal was cited in the 2002 book The New Essential Guide to Characters and vaguely mentioned in a few other reference books such as the Star Wars: Episode I The Visual Dictionary, Secrets of Naboo, and The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
