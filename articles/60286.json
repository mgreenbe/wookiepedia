The Heart Tree was central to Cularin's interconnected network of ch'hala trees and it was considered by the Tarasin species to be sacred."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the latter stages of the Clone Wars, the Wyrd\u2014a group of Tarasin Force witches\u2014attacked the Heart Tree and attempted to turn in to the dark side of the Force. However, the Jedi Master Lanius Qel-Bertuk sacrificed himself to save the ch'hala and his Force essence became part of the Heart Tree. Shortly after the end of the Clone Wars, the Force-using criminal Len Markus traveled to the Heart Tree with the Darkstaff, hoping to find the Eye of the Sun. He was attacked near to the tree by the Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents, and he used the Darkstaff to summon a group of Kilassin to fight the agents. However, the Heart Tree summoned a larger Kilassin, which engaged the lesser Kilassin in combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Heroes of Cularin eventually defeated Len Markus and destroyed the Darkstaff. The Tarasin sensed through the Force that a threat to the Heart Tree had been averted, so they gathered around the Heart Tree and held a celebration to commemorate the agents' efforts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
