Circa 1 ABY, Ilyamo and Angela went to Doaba Guerfel because Ilyamo wanted to go hiking. Ilyamo joined a group who went hiking with the ranger Myron Beech in the Thaos Mountains. However, the group was captured by psychotic cave-dwellers, an anti-government and criminal group. Commander Talte of the Corellian Security Force therefore hired a spacer to investigate the disappearances of the hikers. The spacer finally managed to find the cave where the hostages were kept. During the assault of the cave, the spacer met Ilyamo who advised to be careful of the cave-dweller leader Raynod Menar. Ilyamo and the other hostages were eventually freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ilyamo was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
