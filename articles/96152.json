A member of Domain Shai, he was dispatched by Commander Shedao Shai to Bimmiel, along with Dranae Shai, his elder cousin (and possibly his teacher) to recover the body of Mongei Shai, their ancestor. Unfortunately, Bimmiel's magnetic field interfered with their search. When Corran Horn and Ganner Rhysode came looking for members of Anki Pace's research team, Corran Horn battled with the two in an attempt to allow Ganner to take the researchers out. Neira, hungry for battle, attacked Corran first, but Corran easily killed the young warrior by driving his lightsaber through Neira's left eye."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
