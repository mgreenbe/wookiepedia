The gift caused controversy when a transmitter was discovered mounted on the external gun turrets of the ship, designed to transmit data to an offworld location. Later, a empty container capable of carrying four such transmitters was found; the three other transmitters were never located. While Thurm Loogg tried to quell the rumors of nefarious plans with a speech pointing the blame at other parties, they persisted nonetheless."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During An Uneasy Peace, a Living Force interactive held at Winter Fantasy 2001, the Metatheran Cartel gave the XP-38 to the people of Cularin.
