In 3643 BBY, Vargai and his brother Serjil encountered a Sith apprentice in Imperial space and a dispute broke out. The Sith killed Serjil and crippled Vargai, who was transferred to the hospital ship Anodyne to recover. However, the incident disrupted an Imperial Intelligence operation involving Karrels Javis, and Karrels was killed shortly after learning what happened. As a loose end, Vargai was placed under surveillance, and Watcher Three reported that they could have an asset alter the chemical balance of Vargai's kolto tank to extend his recovery time indefinitely."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
