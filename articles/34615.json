In it Drear compiled all of his knowledge and teachings, including instructions for an arcane ritual intended to grant the user immortality. Drear was ultimately destroyed by his ritual, but his holocron survived for a millennium until rediscovered by Darth Scabrous on Odacer-Faustin. Scabrous unlocked the ritual of immortality, but was consumed by it in the same way as Drear had been. Drear's holocron was presumably destroyed when Scabrous' tower retreat was sabotaged by his droid and exploded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
