A Human female from Coruscant, Petothel served as an Imperial Intelligence agent for nearly 15 years, during which time she assumed several different names and identities. Upon the supposed death of Director of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard in 7.5 ABY, Petothel switched her allegiance to Zsinj, a warlord who went rogue in an attempt to gain control over fragments of the Galactic Empire. While undercover aboard a New Republic frigate, she provided Admiral Apwar Trigit with information that led to the destruction of Talon Squadron, a New Republic starfighter squadron. She then worked as an intelligence analyst for Trigit aboard Implacable, his Imperial-class Star Destroyer. During the Battle of Ession, Petothel secretly provided information to the New Republic that led to Trigit's death after the admiral decided to sacrifice his ship and over 35,000 crew members rather than surrender."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To avoid arrest following the battle, she posed as an innocent farmgirl from Aldivy named Lara Notsil. She intended to return to service under Warlord Zsinj, but was first approached by Wraith Squadron pilots Garik \"Face\" Loran and Ton Phanan, who promised her a spot in one of Commander Wedge Antilles' squadrons if she helped them expose the black market ring of New Republic Colonel Atton Repness. After exposing Repness, Notsil joined the ranks of Wraith Squadron, which she planned to betray to Zsinj. However, after flying with the squadron and bonding with the fellow pilots, Notsil realized much of her Imperial Intelligence teachings about the treachery of the New Republic were lies and propaganda. She found that she wanted to remain with the squadron and the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She attempted to feed false information to Zsinj and keep her true identity a secret from the Wraiths; she even developed a romantic relationship with Myn Donos, the sole survivor from Talon Squadron. However, attempts by Zsinj to reconnect with Petothel sparked a severe identity crisis stemming from her many years of adopting and discarding multiple names and personalities. Her past was eventually discovered and exposed by Loran, which forced her to flee from Wraith Squadron. Along with her R2 droid, Tonin, Petothel returned to service with Zsinj and was given a post on Iron Fist, his Executor-class flagship. She developed a plan to destroy Iron Fist and Zsinj by having Tonin capture and reprogram hundreds of MSE-6 mouse droids to sabotage the ship. The New Republic triumphed over the Iron Fist during the Battle of Selaggis thanks to her assistance, and the loss set into motion Zsinj's eventual defeat at the hands of General Han Solo. She faked her death during that battle and submitted a secret message to Myn Donos proposing to rekindle their relationship.

She was close with her mother and father, and with them shared a deep feeling of trust and belonging that would be lacking in her developing and adult years. As a youth, Petothel enjoyed some carefree moments, learning such dances as the Alderaanian waltz and watching many holovids starring child star Garik \"Face\" Loran, developing a childhood crush on the young actor. As a member of the higher Coruscanti social class, she learned Coruscant Charm Signing, a method of body language that conveyed signs and intent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Petothel dreamed of becoming a starfighter pilot since her early childhood, but her parents and their Imperial superiors recognized her talents for intelligence work even from an early age. Petothel possessed a trick memory that allowed her to permanently remember facts, trivia and statistical information, although her ability to recall faces was less efficient. She also demonstrated a powerful ability to read people and an unusual control over her own emotions; her ability to cry and stop crying on command particularly delighted Imperial officials. Almost immediately, she was being groomed to follow in her parents' career path as an officer in the Bureau of Imperial Intelligence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She was also raised learning long-standing Imperial doctrines and traditions, including Humanocentric speciesism; although she allowed affection for certain members of alien species, like household servants or lowly merchants, Petothel otherwise believed strongly in the basic superiority of humans.

She was also taught to believe Rebel ideologies of individual freedoms were little more than simplistic and unrealistic propaganda."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Petothel's early teen years around 8 BBY, Dalls Petothel and Edallia Monotheer were arrested for unspecified charges of treason and executed. Imperials records indicated the pair funneled Imperial Intelligence information to anti-Imperial factions on Chandrila; years later, however, New Republic Intelligence Service officials would conclude Petothel and Monotheer had nothing to do with the Rebel Alliance and the charges were likely fabricated to provide an excuse for persecuting Petothel and Monotheer for a less significant offense."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The now-orphaned Gara Petothel experienced mixed emotions at the sudden, disgraceful arrests and deaths of her parents, switching repeatedly between hating and missing them. The lack of information and explanation about their execution further denied her any sense of closure. It was during this time Petothel was officially indoctrinated into the Imperial Intelligence Agency, which also removed any official documentation of her connection to Dalls Petothel and Edallia Monotheer from their records.

She was taught only to retain practical information or information significant toward her missions and Imperial service, and to push from her mind anything with personal or sentimental attraction, such as memories or emotional attachments. As such, she failed to remember the names, personalities or physical appearances of her teachers; in later years, she would only recall them as shadows silhouetted by lights behind them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Petothel was taught how to create new identities for herself and pose in various roles in order to fulfill assignments as a spy. She was trained to plant triggers deep in her mind in order to activate a new identity, then to bury that same identity once her objections were accomplished. Once the identity was abandoned, she was also expected to shed any personal connections or memories she may have developed while living that life.

Petothel learned to abandon her scruples and personal honor in order to do whatever was necessary to complete her mission. She was also taught that Rebels would do the same in order to defeat the Empire, furthering the propagandistic lessons she had learned about the Rebel Alliance from an early age. These lessons, combined with the impersonal and overwhelming teaching style of her instructors, afforded Petothel no sense of personal attention or belonging to a group; with no basis for comparison, however, she felt no longing for these things, and would not realize the extent to which the training damaged her until years later."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She proved to become an Imperial Intelligence prodigy. Her trick memory, ability to control her own emotions and skills at manipulating others made her ideal for covert assignments. Petothel's youthful wish to become a starfighter pilot became reignited during basic pilot training, and she requested a permanent transfer to the Imperial Naval Academy. Although her instructors believed piloting was a valuable side skill, they rejected the transfer, believing her intelligence-related skills were greater and more valuable. Her primary training focused on infiltrating the enemy, getting their secrets back to her superiors and sabotaging data the enemy possessed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon completion of her training, Gara Petothel was assigned her first practice role under the identity of Kirney Slane, a Coruscanti student of economics and the daughter of a fictional hotelier. She was given no significant mission or task as Slane, but simply ordered to pose as a member of Coruscant's middle society in order to test and hone her skills as a spy under an assumed name and identity. Under the guise of her first new identity, Petothel flirted with Imperial officer candidates and chatted with the spouses of the married men. She attended dances, pretending her ultimate motive was to find and marry a promising officer. She mastered the small talk of the social class and lost herself in Slane's carefree personality. But once the usefulness of Kirney Slane as a training tool ended, Petothel was pulled from the assignment and, as her training mandated, was forbidden to assume the name, manner or mentality again.

Under her command, Petothel infiltrated the New Republic Fleet Command and posed as a New Republic Intelligence Service operative and code slicer under the name Chyan Mezzine. Mezzine was eventually assigned a post as a communications officer and mission coordinator aboard the New Republic Frigate Mother Sea. She was serving on that ship in 7 ABY when Isard was supposedly killed during the Battle of Thyferra, the final conflict of the Bacta War; her controller, the only contact between Petothel and the Empire, also died along with the rest of Isard's support staff during that battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Realizing Isard's death would lead to further fracturing among the Empire, Petothel decided to switch her allegiance to Warlord Zsinj, a former high-ranking Imperial officer who had gone rogue and was fighting for control of the remnants of the Empire.

He eagerly accepted, and Petothel transmitted a significant amount of New Republic data to Trigit, including information about Talon Squadron, one of several new New Republic X-wing starfighter squadrons.

She soon because one of Trigit's favorite officers based on her intelligence and performance, and the admiral even developed a physical attraction for Petothel and considered eventually proposing a sexual affair. Petothel took notice of his affections but made no attempt to return them. Nevertheless, she held a feeling of respect for Trigit, knowing that Isard, known for her impulsive ruthlessness, might have preferred to let Petothel die rather than risk bringing her back from Mother Sea as Trigit had."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Petothel decided to design a contingency plan in case her service under Trigit failed to work out. In researching the admiral, she discovered Aldivy, an agriworld in the Outer Rim Territories. Trigit bombarded New Oldtown, an Aldivy farming community, and killed nearly all of its residents after they failed to provide him with supplies. Among the dead were Lara Notsil, a farmgirl of whom very little official records existed. Petothel replaced pictures, fingerprints, cellular coding and other record data for Notsil with that of her own, essentially taking the identity for herself. She studied the planet on Imperial surveys and other publicly available data, as well as the Aldivian accent, teaching herself to speak only bare traces of it in order to keep up the guise of a farmgirl who always longed to leave her home planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After conducting her own secret research on Implacable, Petothel illegally gained access to Trigit's personal headquarters and discovered his secret personal escape pod. She devised a plan in which, in the event of Implacable's downfall, she would pose as Notsil and claim to have been kidnapped by the admiral after the New Oldtown bombardment and forced to serve as his unwilling mistress, kept in a state of submission by glitterstim and other drugs. She memorized HoloNet addresses that would allow her to reestablish communication with Zsinj, and stashed away a stolen pair of expensive lingerie, several datacards with other alternate identities and make-up in order to change her appearance if needed. Although she had no intention of using the Lara Notsil identity except in the case of an emergency, she resolved to make as little contact with Implacable crew as possible so they could not identify her in the event of New Republic capture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Petothel quickly proved herself a valuable asset to Trigit, who immediately tasked her with analyzing information gathered by Morrt-class parasite-droids, small, box-shaped droids that attached themselves to the hulls of New Republic starships and tracked their movements as part of Trigit's Project Morrt. The data led Trigit to attack a New Republic starfighter training base on Folor, but just as the battle began, it was Petothel who analyzed the planetary data and determined the location of mining facilities most suitable for New Republic occupation were on the exact opposite side of the moon from where the base reportedly stood. From this analysis, Trigit was able to determine that beacons and other electronics were activated remotely by Wraith Squadron, the New Republic's newest starfighter squadron, in a deliberate attempt to draw the Imperials away from the base. Although the successful tactic prevented Trigit from inflicting as much damage as possible, it was Petothel's intelligence work that allowed him to turn his attention and resources back to the actual base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few weeks later, Petothel made a similar discovery in her analysis that saved Implacable and its crew from capture or destruction at the Battle of Talasea. As Trigit's fleet was in hyperspace en route to Talasea, a planet in the Morobe system where Project Moort information indicated survivors from Folor Base had congregated, Petothel analyzed the data and discovered almost all of it was coming from the same Morrt droid units. This indicated Project Morrt had been compromised and their information deliberately falsified. Petothel notified Trigit that the fleet was heading for a trap, allowing the admiral to drop his flagship from hyperspace prematurely. The quick action furthered Petothel's standing with Trigit, even though the discovery came too late to save other ships in the fleet, including the escort frigate Provocateur and corvette Constrictor, from the ambush orchestrated by Wraith Squadron."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Betraying Admiral Trigit"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Petothel last served under Trigit at the Battle of Ession, an attempt to use the Pakkerd Light Transport on Ession as bait to destroy New Republic starfighter forces, including Rogue and Wraith Squadrons. Implacable was quickly placed on the defense, however, when the battle proved to be a trap designed by Wraith Squadron to eliminate the Star Destroyer. Petothel demonstrated her usual skill and usefulness during the initial stages of the battle, such as when she accurately determined and reported to Trigit that Red Feathers, an old container ship, was actually a disguised delivery mechanism for sending three starfighter squadrons and Katarn Commandos to the planet's surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Implacable's shield generator domes and bridge transparisteel viewport were destroyed during the battle due to fire from Atril Tabanne, a former Imperial TIE pilot leading Wraith Squadron's TIE contingent.

As the crew struggled to continue operating the ship, Petothel was forced to assume some of the duties of her fallen crew members, including coordinating the fleet's TIE squadrons for the battle. As she performed these tasks, Petothel discovered that something had infiltrated the Implacable's power cells and was methodically destroying them.

Inwardly, Petothel was furious that Trigit would allow thousands of loyal soldiers to die, and disgusted at the lack of personal honor in secretly acting to save himself while his crew sacrificed themselves.

During previous missions as an Imperial Intelligence spy, Petothel distanced herself from any Rebel staff members, but her days in the hospital was the first time she spent actually interacting with New Republic personnel. She found they were different from the undisciplined, unrestrained people she was taught they were during her training, but she believed this was due to recuperating from serious injuries and thought little of it.

Zsinj, vaguely familiar with Gara Petothel through her work with Trigit, expressed interest in her services, but did not discount the possibility that she had been captured and was being used by the New Republic to flush him out and capture him.

In 40 ABY, Jaina Solo, Zekk and Kolir Hu'lya rented a shuttle from them at the outbreak of the Second Galactic Civil War. By 44 ABY, Slane and Donos had at least two children, and that year Slane was recruited by the now-retired Antilles to extract the new Wraith Squadron from Vandor-3 after the pilot was contacted by his daughter Myri Antilles, a member of the Wraiths. While Antilles and Tycho Celchu dealt with the attacking Pop-Dogs, a group of soldiers under the command of the traitorous General Stavin Thaal, in a pair of StealthX fighters, Slane piloted the Donoslane shuttle down to the Wraiths so that they could escape.

Imperial Intelligence officials used Gara Petothel's grief and confusion over the executions of her parents to manipulate her and shape her into an Imperial prodigy during her childhood. Thanks in part to their training, Petothel herself developed the ability to read other people's emotions and manipulate them into doing what she wanted without their realization. By spending her life adopting and shedding multiple identities during her 15 years as an Imperial Intelligence agent, Gara Petothel failed to develop any sense of her own individual personality or sense of identity.

However, during her associations with Apwar Trigit Atton Repness, and Warlord Zsinj, men she deemed to be treacherous, she discovered a desire to stray from their examples and remain honorable.

She adopted the same color and style hair as Chyan Mezzine during her undercover operation about Mother Sea; she even used a false birthmark to replace the one she previously removed. As Lara Notsil, she gave herself short, downy blond hair and used makeup to further conceal her any features that might have carried over from her Mezzine identity.

Donos persisted, however, and said he wanted to help Notsil stop closing herself off so severely from others and herself. The two became lovers, despite Petothel never having any such romantic experience in the past due to her strict Imperial Intelligence training. However, when Donos learned of Notsil's past during the Battle of Kidriff 5, he suffered a psychological breakdown and tried to kill Notsil, who was only saved by the intervention of Garik \"Face\" Loran. Notsil was devastated by the turn of events and, during her covert mission aboard Iron Fist, took the time to record an apologetic and confessional message to Donos. After his breakdown, Donos tried to resign from Wraith Squadron, but eventually regained control of himself and realized he did not want to kill Notsil, although he still experienced mixed emotions regarding her past. He vouched for Notsil to Wedge Antilles and Han Solo, insisting that she was honest in her intentions to destroy Iron Fist and had not betrayed Wraith Squadron.
