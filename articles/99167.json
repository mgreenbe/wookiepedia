The suspicious discovery led Plo to order the area cleared and all of the wreckage be collected for transport to Coruscant. Subsequently, Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi were sent to Oba Diah to investigate, discovering the Pykes' involvement in Sifo-Dyas' murder and Silman in their dungeon, as well as the identity of Tyranus: Count Dooku, a Sith Lord, fallen Jedi Master, and the Head of State of the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Oba Diah moon first appeared in \"The Lost One,\" a 2014 episode of the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars' sixth season."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
