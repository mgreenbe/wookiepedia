Circa 1 ABY, Vryim Raeth was kidnapped by the criminal organization known as Chirq Council and taken to the First Elite Council Bunker, near the city of Doaba Guerfel. The criminals suspected him to know too much information about their organization, but they were completely wrong about him. They finally assassinated the man, for no reason. Cara Raeth followed the trail of her husband during weeks. When she arrived at the First Elite Council Bunker, she asked a spacer to enter the bunker and rescue her husband. Unfortunately for her, the spacer only found the body of the dead Vryim Raeth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vryim Raeth appeared as a corpse in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
