Circling the base of the tower were four smaller towers with green spheres atop each of them connected by a wall. Inside the tower, there was a large circular window that overlooked a large courtyard. Beneath the window was the Son's throne chamber. The inside had a high ceiling, more than twice as high as the total height of the Son in his gargoyle form. Inside, there was also a prison, in which the Son would hold Ahsoka Tano prisoner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 21 BBY, the Son had kidnapped Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano and locked her up there. He then poisoned her, causing her to become a Dark-sider and he watched as she attacked Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi when they had come to rescue her. At the same time, he was confronted by Daughter and later Father and the tower became a battleground for both the Jedi and the powerful Force-users. The result ended with Daughter dying after sacrificing herself to save Father, Son escaping and Ahsoka recovering back to normal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Son's cathedral first appeared in Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series episode \"Altar of Mortis\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tower was based on the tower of Orthanc from Lord of the Rings films and was made to resemble the staff of the evil wizard Saruman the White.The location's concept also drew inspiration from Ralph McQuarrie's sketches of Emperor Palpatine's Imperial Palace (before the location was changed to the second Death Star in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
