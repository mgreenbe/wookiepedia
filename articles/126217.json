The AT-TE opens up to reveal Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano. Obi-Wan has the walker lift up its leg to see Ventress, only to find a hole in the walkway. The comic then shows the AT-TE carrying the Jedi through a swamp when the clone trooper on top spots a STAP. However, Unit 2953, the battle droid on the STAP, doesn't notice the walker and gets stuck in the top cannon. A homing spider droid then jumps out and the clone gunner fires the cannon at it. This sends the battle droid flying into the spider droid, taking both out. Inside the AT-TE, the Jedi discuss why they were sent to the planet. The walker then comes across a group of IG-100 MagnaGuards, before a \"To be continued!\" message appears. One last scene shows clone troopers and battle droids still playing the card game started in \"Orders are orders\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
