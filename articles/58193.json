After being sold to Xizor for nine million credits, Guri served as his lieutenant and was one of the few individuals the necessarily paranoid crime lord believed he could trust. Xizor left Guri to attend to much of the day to day running of Black Sun and many incorrectly assumed that she was the leader of the syndicate.

Xizor sent Guri to rendezvous with Organa and bring her to him on Coruscant. Skywalker later attempted to rescue Organa, infiltrating Xizor's Palace and confronting the Dark Prince.

Despite Savan's efforts, Guri was able to track down Thrumble on Hurd's Moon and was successfully reprogrammed.

Both her bones and organs appeared entirely Human when scanned, as did her flawless, cloned skin. The skin was the only truly organic part of Guri's body, cloned from genuine Human skin specifically for her. Her muscles, however, would not fool scanners\u2014in order for them to provide her with greater strength, they were made of a material that scanned as an unknown tissue.

She was also capable of emulating all of the \"more intimate\" functions of a Human woman, and Xizor occasionally made use of her abilities in that regard.

Thrumble's position within the Empire guaranteed his safety, however the creator of her processor had no such protection. Therefore, Xizor ordered Guri to travel to Simonelle's workshop and kill the scientist. However, Simonelle had anticipated Xizor's actions and constructed a replica of himself. Arriving at Simonelle's base, Guri entered the workshop and approached what she believed to be her creator. Striking quickly, she knocked him back into a computer console.

She also performed roles in his legitimate businesses, including appointing Tavvar Va'ran to the position of Master Chef at the Manarai, an exclusive Coruscant restaurant which was part-owned by Xizor. Xizor came to value her advice and would frequently ask her opinion of his plans. However, her duties extended beyond these administrative duties and Xizor frequently made use of her abilities as an assassin to deal with his enemies and to enforce loyalty within Black Sun. Since she so frequently acted directly on Xizor's behalf, most of those outside Black Sun's upper levels assumed that Guri was in charge of the organization, an assumption which neither Xizor or Guri did anything to discourage as it provided him with a degree of freedom of movement and, from Guri's point of view, served as an added layer of protection for her master.

Later, as Savan was led away by the authorities, Thrumble explained to Skywalker about Guri's reprogramming. After speaking to her and realizing that she truly had no memory of her former life, Skywalker decided to let her go, giving her the chance of a normal life."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "A new life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterwards, Guri walked into a bar, where Dash Rendar, also believed dead around the time of the death of Xizor, offered to buy her a drink. The two eventually formed a mercenary team, and were recruited by Admiral Gial Ackbar of the New Republic to help place a spy on the Tof fortress world of Saijo, teaming up with New Republic agents Kyle Katarn and Bey for the mission. Around this time, Guri was one of several agents who conducted shadow operations for the New Republic under the command of General Airen Cracken. Knowing what Guri was, Rendar quickly conceived of a plan\u2014by copying Guri's technology, he could create more of the valuable Human replica droids. Guri agreed to serve as a template for the development of more HRDs and served as Rendar's partner during the research and development phase. Afterwards, the two went their separate ways, though the development of the technology continued through Onadax Droid Technologies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Guri physically resembled a Human female, there was a coolness about her which could be attributed to her true nature as a Human replica droid. This coolness was part of her ability to kill without any sign of conscience or emotion, and she often considered killing to be the easiest solution to problems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Programmed to protect Xizor at all costs, Guri was devoted to him in all matters of his life\u2014she was even known to hold his clothes while he spent time with a mistress. As Xizor's most trusted advisor Guri was in the unique position of being able to speak her mind, saying things that no other would dare say to the Dark Prince and he valued her counsel when it was offered. Even so, Guri was not one to speak unnecessarily and would generally not offer an opinion unless it was requested."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although often terse, Guri exhibited a sometimes playful sense of arrogance; for example, when she massacred the leaders of Ororo Transportation, she took the time to allow Tuyay, knocked out in the initial fray, to regain consciousness so that she could have the last word before killing him. This smug attitude and apparent enjoyment of power were further illustrated by her dry and self-assured responses when Leia Organa and the other Heroes of Yavin interrogated her. At the end of this interrogation, when her captors moved to remove the metal bonds they had trapped her with, she burst them herself in a dramatic show of superhuman strength."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Guri also wanted to be stretched to her limits, preferring to perform jobs which she saw as challenging. It was this desire to push herself to her limits that led her to seek out a duel with Luke Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the fall of Black Sun, Guri lost what had previously been her main purpose in life, to protect Xizor. It produced a dramatic change in her personality as she began to question her programming and to wonder if she could be something more. Her quest for a new beginning was pursued with the same determination which she had always applied to her work with Black Sun, though neither her decision, or the process was easy for her and she was troubled by the memories of everything she had done."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Guri's reprogramming caused her to change further. Although she still possessed the ability to fight, she no longer had any memory of her time as an assassin, nor would she ever be one again with her assassination programming removed. She was also free to act independently, with her enforced loyalty to Xizor's family purged during the procedure. She also showed signs of a sense of humor\u2014initially pretending to have lost her entire memory during the reprogramming and even smiling for the first time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Guri was created for Shadows of the Empire, a 1996 multimedia project set between Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, and appeared in its novel, comic and video game incarnations. After Lucasfilm began working on the project in, author Steve Perry was brought in to write the novel for Bantam Spectra. At an early creative meeting at Skywalker Ranch in November 1994, Perry proposed several characters who were incorporated into the final story, including Guri, who Perry envisioned as Xizor's most able lieutenant, bodyguard and assassin. Early designs of the character were produced by game designer Jon Knoles and comic artist Kilian Plunkett. The Topps Shadows of the Empire trading card series featured paintings by Greg and Tim Hildebrandt based on reference photographs; Olga Hildebrandt posed in costume as Guri for these images. Guri appears in both the Nintendo 64 and PC versions of the Shadows of the Empire video game and was voiced by Lisa Fuson in the PC version. At one point, Hasbro/Kenner had plans to create a Guri action figure in their Shadows of the Empire toy line, but it was never carried forward. Concept art exists that shows the Guri figure would have come with a large gun and depicted her with \"battle damage\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Guri was later depicted in the \"Reflections II: Expanding the Galaxy\" set of Decipher's Star Wars Customizable Card Game, in which she is portrayed by an unnamed model. She also appeared in Perry's 1998 comic series Shadows of the Empire: Evolution, illustrated by Ron Randall, the 2009 Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game expansion The Shadow Syndicate and the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies. Joe Corroney's illustration of Guri in the Star Wars Insider 89 article \"Underworld: A Galaxy of Scum and Villainy\" was based on the appearance of artist Leah Mangue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jon Knoles experimented with different colors for Guri's attire, before settling on the mix of red and gray which is seen in both the game and comic. Guri's costume is similar in overall design in the Topps trading card series, but is colored yellow and blue and leaves her legs exposed. The 1997 Topps Star Wars Vehicles trading cards, Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game and \"Underworld: A Galaxy of Scum and Villainy\" use the attire shows in the original trading cards, while the Customizable Card Game image used a costume design following the comic series."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There is some uncertainty regarding the date of Guri's creation. The Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook established that she was created by Simonelle based on the results of Project Decoy. Massad Thrumble's involvement, together with that of the Empire, was not mentioned until Shadows of the Empire: Evolution and was clarified in later sources. The novelization of Shadows of the Empire identified her skin as ten years old in 3 ABY, suggesting that her creation was circa 7 BBY, and this has been repeated in several other sources. Her inclusion in Rebel Dawn showed that she was indeed created prior to 2 BBY. Yet Project Decoy was supposedly conducted by the Rebel Alliance, which was still being established at this time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
