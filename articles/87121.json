During the meeting, Marlo remained silent as Jabba and the council discussed the potential danger Ziro presented as the Hutt possessed information that was dangerous to the council. He agreed with Jabba and the other council members to have bounty hunter Cad Bane break Ziro out of Galactic Republic custody and deliver him to the council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Marlo was also present when Ziro was brought before the Hutt Grand Council on the planet Nal Hutta after being freed by Bane. When Ziro thanked for the council's help in his escape, Marlo addressed him in Huttese about the reason the council had gone through all the trouble of breaking him out of Republic custody. After Ziro had been taken away to the detention block, Marlo and the rest of the council were entertained by a performance of Da Hutt Moda by Pa'lowick singer Sy Snootles. During the performance, Marlo tried to attract Snootles' attention as the singer made her way towards him. When Snootles kissed council member Gorga, Marlo smiled and laughed.\nAfter Snootle's performance, Marlo was enjoying the entertainment of the Twi'lek dancers when Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Quinlan Vos entered the council chamber. Marlo did not speak as Kenobi informed the council of Ziro's escape. As the Jedi left, Marlo went back to watching the dancing Twi'leks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Marlo later travled to the planet Zygerria to visit its slave market.

Marlo, who had by this time gone largely senile, fell asleep during the meeting and was woken up by his protocol droid. He was then asked by fellow Hutt Bokku if they should accept the invitation, to which Marlo said they should, mistaking the inviter for Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Marlo was voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson.
