It could fit at least one Human adult and was available for purchasing. The model was considered as an option by the Galactic Empire during the construction of the DS-1 Orbital Battle Station for replacing the Death Star's slower default lift tube. It was slower than the Insta-Lift 2000 SE, the Ultra-Lift 3000 Extreme and the Infini-lift Lightspeed models."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
