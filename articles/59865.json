Harvaps were originally carrion-eaters, though they later adapted by incorporating industrial waste and garbage into its diet as they became populous on heavily-industrialized worlds. They were especially numerous in Hutt Space, and the atmosphere of the planet Quesh led to the evolution of a group of harvaps that were able to survive the poisonous atmosphere."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
