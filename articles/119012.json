As he was not permitted to use a lightsaber by the Jedi Order, he built the sabercane to conceal his weapon, practicing in secret and wielding it only when necessary. Haazen's sabercane followed the aesthetic of his grisly prostheses and produced a red blade when active."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Cosian Jedi Master Tera Sinube's sabercane featured a hilt made of wood from his homeworld.
