Sergeant Ran Harkas steps in and saves the \"Noob\" from the Sith's wrath and takes him to Joker Squad, Company C, Battalion 9. There, Anson meets Jes Gistang, Hondo Karr and Vax Potorr. The troopers welcome him by inviting him to join the bet they have on how long he will live. Lieutenant Gil Cassel informs Joker Squad that Grand Admiral Veed and the Moff Council have ordered the termination of the 908th division on Borosk for defecting from the New Empire and joining the former Emperor Roan Fel and that it is Joker Squad's job to see it done."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Borosk, Joker Squad is assigned to capture and secure the gun and shield placements along the perimeter wall of the 908th's Headquarters. After they secure the gun platform the troop is allowed to rest for the night. Anson and Jes talk about their reasons for signing up with The Empire and Jes goes on to tell the brief back stories of the other members in Joker Squad. Lieutenant Cassel is confronted by Darth Maleval who tells him that his idea of a truce with the 908th is out of the question and that an example will be made of the 908th. Hondo comes up behind Darth Maleval with a drawn blade and is subsequently Force thrown in a wall. As Maleval walks away, talk of joining the 908th or simply walking away from the fight arise but Sergeant Harkas reminds them that a soldiers duty is to complete the mission no matter the cost. One by one the members of Joker Squad agree."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next day the squad breaches the main fortress of the 908th Headquarters and press into the main mess hall, were Vex steps on a mine and is killed. Jes is killed when enemy fire hits one of the power packs on her waist and Sergeant Harkas is severely wounded by the ensuing explosion. When the battle is over, Darth Maleval brings forth a bound 908th prisoner, Captain Jared Cassel, Lieutenant Cassel's brother and orders Lieutenant Cassel to execute his own brother. The Lieutenant refuses and as Darth Maleval raises his lightsaber to kill both men, Hondo charges the Sith's back with his sword. Darth Maleval back hands Hondo with a clenched fist before lassoing Hondo's neck with a shock whip and electrocuting him. Anson shoots Darth Maleval in the back killing the Sith and saving Hondo. It is reported that Darth Maleval and Hondo Karr were killed in battle. Sergeant Harkas is taken away by a med-droid leaving Anson the only remaining member of Joker Squad.

Its initial story arc, Broken, was originally intended to span Legacy's first six issues, with series architects John Ostrander and Jan Duursema providing the script and the pencils, respectively. Noob, a standalone issue drawn by a new penciller, would follow Broken in order to give Duursema breathing room with Legacy's monthly schedule. When the design work involved with the series' launch and the demands of plotting out a new story with new characters proved more work than the creative team expected, Noob was moved up to become Legacy's fourth issue and an interlude to Broken."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ostrander and Duursema chose to make Noob the series' fourth issue because they felt that the end of Broken, Part 3 was the most natural break in Broken's story\u2014they believed that interrupting the arc after its fourth or fifth issue would have been more disruptive to its flow. Although Legacy's fourth issue was originally solicited as Broken, Part 4, with a projected release date of September 6, Dark Horse's official website later modified it into a solicitation for Noob, and Broken, Part 4 became Legacy's fifth issue. However, Noob's profile on DarkHorse.com has always mistakenly listed both the credits and publisher's summary of Broken, Part 4. Duursema has acknowledged the mistake."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Travel Foreman filled in as Noob's artist, providing both penciling and inking, Ostrander\u2014with input from Duursema\u2014wrote its script, as he wanted to maintain some control over Legacy so soon after its launch. He referred to Noob as a \"fill-in\" issue but assured fans that he was working hard to use its story to expand on the Legacy era. Brad Anderson colored the issue while Michael David Thomas provided lettering, and both Anderson and Duursema drew the issue's cover. Although Noob is not part of the Broken story arc, its cover follows the pattern used by artist Adam Hughes on the covers of the first five issues of Broken, showcasing three new characters against a bluish-gray background."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Noob's title refers to its protagonist, Anson Trask, who is fresh out of his stormtrooper training. Ostrander recalled the term from his days with the Boy Scouts of America, when it was shorthand for \"newbie\" or \"rookie.\" He was unaware of its use in online circles and later stated that if he had been, he likely would not have used it, as he felt that it had the potential to draw attention to itself and distract readers from the story. Randy Stradley, the issue's editor, joked on the Jedi Council Forums that \"noob\" had been a replacement after Lucas Licensing had forbidden them from using \"FNG.\" When designing Darth Maleval, Ostrander drew inspiration from the title of a novel by French writer Pierre Boulle, as he liked the sound of \"Maleval\" and thought that it would work well in a science fiction setting. In Noob's script, Ostrander described Lieutenant Gil Cassel as being his late twenties, but Foreman's art depicts him as an older man. Stradley claimed responsibility for the discrepancy, stating that he would have made adjustments after receiving the art if time had permitted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Noob scheduled for a September 6 release, a four-page preview was published on DarkHorse.com in late August. However, the issue was soon afterward pushed back to October 4 due to compounded delays from the previous issues of Broken. Duursema apologized for the delays, citing the unforeseen difficulties involved with exploring new territory. Noob was eventually released to comic shops on October 11. With advertisements, the issue is thirty-two pages long; the issue contains twenty-two pages of story."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Noob, along with issues eight through thirteen of Legacy, was later included in the trade paperback Star Wars: Legacy Volume 2: Shards, which was released on March 26, 2008.

Noob was additionally included in the Polish language omnibus Star Wars Komiks 2/2008, published on October 17, 2008; also included were the Star Wars comics \"Moment of Doubt\", \"The Way of the Warrior\", and sixteen pages of Star Wars: Legacy 0\u00bd.

The issue sees Roan Fel retake the fortress world of Bastion from Krayt's Imperials, thanks in part to Jaeger having slowly rotated Fel-loyal stormtroopers into service on the planet. When Fel asks Jaeger if all of the troops have arrived, the general responds \"The 908th has been delayed.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When designing Noob's cover, Duursema had two different pieces of reference art for Maleval's species, the Quarren\u2014one depicted them with three-fingered hands, and the other with five-fingered hands. Although she preferred the former look, she ultimately chose to go for consistency with the five-fingered look that Travel Foreman was using on the interior art. Maleval thus has five fingers both in and on the front of the issue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jes Gistang's appearance in Noob made her the first named female stormtrooper in Star Wars canon, although an image of an unnamed female trooper had earlier been included in the preview issue Star Wars: Legacy 0, and Star Wars creator George Lucas had established the existence of female stormtroopers while preparing background material for 1977's original Star Wars film. Gistang's weapon was first given a name in 2009's Legacy Era Campaign Guide: the BB-23 heavy blaster cannon. The guide asserts that the cannon's power pack must be replaced after ten shots, which contrasts with Noob's claim that a new power pack is needed after just four shots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Reception"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "34,346 copies of Noob were shipped to comic shops for the issue's release in October, making it Dark Horse' best-selling comic of the month and the fiftiest best-selling comic overall. It received fairly positive feedback on both the Jedi Council Forums and the DarkHorse.com message boards. A review written in 2007 for TheForce.net by writer JF Boivin graded the issue 8.5/10, deeming it \"Highly Recommended\" and \"Ostrander at his best.\" Boivin praised Noob's high drama about duty and loyalty, calling it a gripping tale of a soldier's hardships and a nice change of pace for Legacy. He also complimented Foreman's art, which he felt used minimal backgrounds as a way to focus on the characters and their drama, and which he believed portrayed Maleval as effectively sinister and dangerous. Boivin was, however, critical of the word \"noob\" existing in the Star Wars universe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Shards trade paperback was released in 2008, a staff writer for Things From Another World named Josh gave it five out of five stars, singling out Noob as a treat and a nice break from Legacy's primary storyline.
