During the operation, Yuuzhan Vong forces were lured to the surface of Borleias and systematically destroyed in a 4-minute long orbital bombardment from Executor-class Star Dreadnought Lusankya. It was the first time that a Star Destroyer under the banner of the New Republic performed an orbital bombardment, despite the fact that such missions were an integral part of the ships' design."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was an act of intentional irony that the operation was named after the New Republic's greatest enemy, Emperor Palpatine, and made use of one of his former command vessels, to engage in a tactic unused since his reign. It is named such in reference to Wedge Antilles' idea to fight the Yuuzhan Vong using the guerrilla warfare tactics and strategies of the Rebel Alliance when needed, and using the tactics of the New Republic at other times. Antilles realized that the usage of sheer, massive, overwhelming force\u2014i.e. the Galactic Empire\u2014would also be effective at times."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
