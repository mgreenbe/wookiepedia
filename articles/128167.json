He was stationed at Starkiller Base during the outbreak of the First Order/Resistance War in 34 ABY. During the Battle of Starkiller Base, he accessed defense shield files which implicated Captain Phasma for her role in lowering the superweapon's shield. Phasma had done so under duress from Finn, Han Solo, and Chewbacca in an attempt to save her own life. The Resistance operatives had then thrown her into a garbage compactor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After escaping the garbage chute, Phasma returned to the computer she used to lower Starkiller Base's shields and wiped the records clean of her actions. Realizing that Rivas had also accessed the computer and had proof of her betrayal, she attempted to detain Rivas and frame him for lowering the superweapon's shields and compromising its security. Spotting Rivas on Level Two, Phasma attempted to shoot Rivas, but ultimately failed due to the bombing runs of Resistance Forces. Rivas was able to escape to the surface with Phasma in hot pursuit. As the planet disintegrated around him, Rivas managed to reach an auxiliary hangar where he escaped aboard a TIE/fo space superiority fighter."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Escape and captivity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seeking to hunt down and kill Rivas in order to cover up her own malfeasance, Captain Phasma, the TIE fighter pilot TN-3465, and the BB unit BB-K8 gave chase in a TIE/sf space superiority fighter but were unable to shoot him down since their fighter's laser cannons were inoperable. Running shot on fuel, Rivas landed his fighter on the rocky, oceanic world of Luprora. Shortly after landing, he was captured by the native R'ora, a semi-sentient species of bipedal red skinned creatures with tentacles.

He was bound by ropes inside the R'ora's tower and sustained a bruised right eye and several scratches from his captors. Intent on tracking down and killing Rivas, Captain Phasma led an assault by the Lupr'or on the R'ora stronghold.

As a result of his captivity, Rivas sustained a bruised right eye and several facial scratches.
