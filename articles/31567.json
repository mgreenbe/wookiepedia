While he once used his nobleman status to enter politics in an attempt to bring about change, he eventually gave up in frustration after he realized how difficult it was to get the ball rolling in the inertia-heavy political arena of the Republic's heyday.

Highly opinionated and used to getting his way, his solid build and piercing eyes gave him an imposing demeanor, while his walking stick, expensive clothes, and the long, braided hair hanging down his back befitted his position as incumbent nobleman. However, Jam was in the habit of donning a cloak and wandering incognito through spaceport bars in search of deserving or downtrodden folk\u2014much to the chagrin of Jam's professional bodyguards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The phrase 'you are all gathered at the inn, and then a mysterious stranger\u2026' is a running joke among the players of certain fantasy RPGs, assuming all or most gamemasters have at some point started an adventure with the player characters already gathered at an inn, after which a hooded stranger suddenly walks in and offers them a quest out of the blue.
