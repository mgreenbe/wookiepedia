The first encounter was disastrous, as the scouts were stricken with fear. Acting in haste, they retreated to Coruscant. The \"Star Dragons\" misinterpreted the fear, and hundreds followed in pursuit. Reaching the Republic capital-world, the Duinuogwuin attacked the planet and devastated the cityscape.
