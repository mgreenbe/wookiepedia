In the year 3643 BBY, a team of criminals from the Migrant Merchants' Guild organization stole the design files for the Planet Prison superweapon, and Galen's unit was assigned to investigate with the help of the Coruscant Security Force. Upon identifying one of the thieves, a Rodian named Vistis Garn, Galen reported the unit's findings to General Var Suthra of the Republic Military. A young Jedi Knight was sent to retrieve the files from a Guild warehouse in the Old Galactic Market region, and Galen returned to Strategic Command with the Jedi Padawan Kira Carsen. When the two were alerted to the kidnapping of the Planet Prison's designer, Doctor Eli Tarnis, Carsen departed Strategic Command to pursue the kidnappers, and Galen ordered the Jedi Knight who had been sent after the files to bring the files back to him at Strategic Command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Galen handed off the files to Krand, one of his analysts, who used the room's computers to decrypt the files while the Knight helped Carsen defeat some of the kidnappers in the nearby Coruscant Spaceport.

Galen, Kiwiiks, and Din departed Coruscant to secure the Republic's three offworld superweapon development facilities, but Suthra and Carsen remained behind in Strategic Command to monitor the Knight as the young Jedi embarked on a mission to rescue Doctor Tarnis from his kidnappers in the Black Sun criminal syndicate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Suthra and Carsen were using the room's communications systems to monitor the Jedi when the Knight discovered that Tarnis was, in fact, a Sith Lord, and Carsen and the analysts were able to track Tarnis's transmissions to the Coruscant territory of the paramilitary Justicars' Brigade.
