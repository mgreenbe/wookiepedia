The two-hundred-meter cannon required support vehicles to maneuver it into position during sieges; the weapon was airlifted onto battlefields, and was towed on ultra-dense cables by All Terrain Heavy Haulers. When positioned, the cannon deployed retractable stabilizing outriggers to ground its bulk, and was armed with topside defense turrets for protection while charging."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A siege cannon was deployed by the First Order during the Battle of Crait, used to blow a hole in the blast door of the Crait outpost sheltering Resistance personnel. The Resistance sent \"Reb\" Squadron, piloting old V-4X-D ski speeders in an attempt to destroy the weapon. As they began to run out of time, Finn set out on a kamikaze run into the cannon's barrel, but was intercepted by Rose Tico at the last second. The cannon fired unopposed, breaching the Resistance's defenses and ultimately allowing Kylo Ren entry into the outpost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
