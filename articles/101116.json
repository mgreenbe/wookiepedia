The Xexto pilot Gasgano flew a green one during a Boonta Eve Classic race that took place during the Invasion of Naboo. Gasgano's cockpit had a camera built into the back of it, which connected to a holoscreen on the cockpits control panel, which allowed to the Xexto to keep an eye on any competitors who wished to pass him. During the Boonta, Gasgano used this feature to his advantage when dueling the human pilot Anakin Skywalker, blocking all of the Human's attempts to pass. Skywalker finally overcame Gasgano when he flew over the Ord Pedrovia following a cliff drop."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, an Ishi Tib flew an Ord Pedrovia of his own during a race that was broadcast in bar located on the planet Coruscant, called 79's."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ord Pedrovia first appeared in the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.
