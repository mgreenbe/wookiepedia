During the Separatist Crisis, which saw many planets seceding from the Galactic Republic, Rahn led a special joint task force of Judicial Department and Senate Bureau of Intelligence agents investigating suspected Separatist terrorist Gavrilonnis Tejere, who had tried to sabotage the repulsorlift assembly on the Yag'Dhul Ambassadorial Landing Platform.

For the next several years, Rahn searched obsessively for any information about the history or location of the valley. Time and time again, any leads Rahn found to the valley's hiding place left him empty-handed. In his mind, the valley seemed unreachable\u2014as mythic as the planet Millinar or the Lost City of the Jedi. To make matters worse, the relentless task of the Galactic Empire's Inquisitorius to find every last Jedi made travel perilous. Ultimately, Jerec caught wind of Rahn's search.

From Katarn, Rahn learned that the valley did in fact exist. Katarn also shared with Rahn a thousand-year-old prophecy that the native Bouncers had told him about the valley. Katarn wanted to tell Rahn the valley's exact coordinates, but the Jedi Master strongly forbade him to do so, having seen in the same vision that he might be captured before he could reach it. Still, Rahn told Katarn that he would try to assemble a team in order to study the valley. Rahn then entrusted his personal green-bladed lightsaber to Morgan and urged him to pass down the location of the valley and the lightsaber to Morgan's own son\u2014the stormtrooper-in-training Kyle Katarn.

Their mission was to find the linguistics expert Nij Por Ral, who was working at an excavation site there, and convince him to join Rahn's group.

Rahn and the Rebels decided to try to reach their corvette in order to escape from the Dark Jedi. Rahn told his group not to use the skimmer, fearing that the Imperials might spot its heat signature; instead, he ordered them to set out to the corvette on foot. However, Maw had the unique ability to sense others' fear. He spotted Rahn's group and soon the Imperials, riding skimmers themselves, started gaining on them. To buy the Rebels some time, Rahn formulated a plan that included Norley remaining behind with a rocket launcher. She managed to destroy one of the two skimmers, but was killed after doing so. However, her sacrifice bought some time for Rahn, Dree, Gron, and Por Ral to reach the starship.

Rahn and his companions were then escorted to the Vengeance's bridge, where they faced Jerec and all of his Dark Jedi. Jerec began questioning Rahn about the valley, but the Jedi Master refused to answer, so Jerec ordered his men to kill Rahn's comrades. One by one, Gron, Por Ral, and Dree were killed, but Qu Rahn still did not answer, even after being beaten to his knees by the Dark Jedi. Rahn attempted to will himself to die and asked Jerec to strike him down. Instead of killing Rahn, Jerec used the Force to rip the information he needed about the Valley of the Jedi from his mind.

Rahn put up a valiant fight, with Jerec's followers proving unable to land a single blow on him. Rahn managed to sever Maw in half at the waist, only to be brought to his knees by a blast of the Force from Jerec. As Jerec moved in for the kill, Yoda's voice echoed in Rahn's head the promise that one day he would understand. At that moment, Jerec struck the killing blow, decapitating the helpless Jedi Master.

Being unable to decipher it, the droid arranged a meeting with Kyle Katarn on Nar Shaddaa. Katarn refused to cooperate and was attacked by several bounty hunters hired by 8t88. Rahn contacted Katarn and taught him how to use the Force, in this manner helping Morgan's son evade death and obtain the disk from 8t88.

As soon as he reached the city, Katarn was attacked by a female bounty hunter with a remote. Rahn once again contacted Katarn, helping him to familiarize himself with the newly acquired lightsaber. With Rahn's guidance, Katarn was able to defeat both the woman and her remote. As a disembodied voice, Rahn contacted Katarn several more times, providing Morgan's son with information on Jerec's Dark Jedi.

Rahn appeared as a voice in the young darksider's head and advised Yun to try another tactic\u2014to sense the spirits' pain. Yun followed Rahn's advice and was able to make the spirits depart, and Rahn then explained that Yun would play an important part in the events that would follow. The Epicanthix asked what part, and Rahn answered that it was entirely up to him. The encounter with Rahn made such a deep impression on Yun that several days later, when a groundquake caused a rock to fall on an Imperial called Jaru, he used the light side of the Force to help him.

In response, Jerec pushed him into the Sulon Star and sent the ship crashing towards the surface. Rahn helped Katarn evade death by telling him that Kyle's ship, the Moldy Crow, had been kept in the hangar bay of the Sulon Star. Katarn managed to escape the doomed Sulon Star, but could not handle the controls of his own ship and crashed the Moldy Crow near the valley. He was found, unconscious, by Boc, Sariss, and Yun.

Not even knowing most of them, Rahn truly hated those who had betrayed the Jedi Order. Sometimes, Rahn almost hoped that Jerec would find him so that he could exact justice on the Inquisitor.
