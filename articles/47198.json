It had twin photoreceptors bracketing a single, central blaster cannon, and an antenna protruding from the upper dome. These droids were known to become more aggressive towards targets the nearer the enemy got to the source of their programming. Though self-activated, the droids could be programmed to avoid attacking beings who carried repellent signal emitters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A commercial-grade security droid developed by the Trade Federation, the Fastlatch-class defense droid was outlawed in most star systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 38 BBY, a group of pressure pirates smuggled Fastlatch-class droids aboard the Aurorient Express.
