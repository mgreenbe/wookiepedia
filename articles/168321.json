The Zhell organized themselves into the thirteen Battalions of Zhell, also known as the Nations of Zhell, and eventually came into conflict with their Taung neighbors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The war"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to the account of Dha Werda Verda, the two armies skirmished for centuries. Eventually, the Taungs led by a General nicknamed the Doom of Ulmarah successfully took Great Zhell, the Zhell capital, but with heavy losses, the Doom among them. The Zhell besieged the city and the Taungs, now led by Rexutu the Unconquerable, resolved to make their last stand there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Taung defeat apparently imminent, a volcanic eruption brought devastation upon the Battalions of Zhell, which it smothered their army with thick ash and nearly destroyed their race. The enormous plume of ash and smoke was so dense and widespread across the sky that it blocked out the light from the sun, leaving the land beneath in darkness for two years. The Taungs immediately took the advantage that nature had provided, and in the aftermath of the eruption, subjugated their age-old enemy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Taungs viewed the smoke and shadow as an emblem of their destiny, and it was then that they adopted the name Dha Werda Verda for themselves, a title that meant \"Warriors of the Shadow\" in the Taung language. However, the Taungs' victory over the Zhell was doomed to be a fleeting one. Over time, the Zhell eventually managed to win back control of Notron and drive the Taungs from their shared homeworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The defeated Taungs fled to Roon, where they left behind a number of artifacts that were found by future archaeologists, as well as the text of Dha Werda Verda written in Roonstones. The Taungs then began a nomadic existence, roaming through the Outer Rim until they settled Mandalore, becoming the Mandalorians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Disagreement raged among academics as to the historicity of Dha Werda Verda's account. Arhul Manaxa of the University of Rudrig noted in 2 ABY that no known species, not even the Columi, possessed hyperspace travel two hundred thousand years before the Battle of Yavin, and so questioned how the Taungs could have fled Coruscant to a planet on the other side of the galaxy. He speculated that the war may have taken place later than the traditional dates suggested while the galaxy's eldest species were exploring the Core Worlds. Additionally, Dha Werda Verda, and historical re-enactments, depicted the Taungs and Zhell as using swords, spears and axes, of the sorts found in Taung burial sites on Roon. However, military historian Hu Jibwe of Salmagodro Grand Academy noted that these finds from Roon were ceremonial weapons, and pointed out that no hyperdrive-capable society still used such melee weapons, even suggesting that the poem may have been the corruption of a battle fought by much more advanced parties equipped with aircraft and nuclear weapons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
