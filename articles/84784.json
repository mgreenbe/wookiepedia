Roughly the same size as a combat knife, the MMD-18 had a long and thin double-edged, crystalline matrix blade that was set into a polycarbonate hilt with a short, straight quillon. Its edges were honed to mono-molecular thickness, and while the dagger was sturdier than the MSW-9, the blade could have still been easily shattered as a result of an incorrect attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
