Five planets existed between Hoth and its sun, while an asteroid belt surrounded the planet with meteors occasionally striking the surface. Most of its surface was covered with glaciers and frozen ice plains. Another third of the planet was covered by oceans. The temperature, although always frigid, was known to drop to -60\u00b0C come nightfall. Although devoid of intelligent life, Hoth was home to fifteen species of large gray snow lizards called tauntauns, which was commonly used by Rebels as a means of transport, and which Han Solo cut open to use as shelter to keep Luke Skywalker and himself warm during a snowstorm. It was also home to a species of towering predators known as wampas. During his stay on Hoth, Skywalker was captured by a wampa and was hung upside down in the wampa's cave, waiting to be eaten. Using the power of the Force, Skywalker managed to get his hands on his lightsaber and cut himself down from the roof and sever the wampa's right arm. The planet also had a number of \"crystalline geysers.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Rebel Alliance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Hoth was undergoing an ice age."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime following the Battle of Yavin, Saponza's Gang established a base on Hoth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jan Dodonna, a general in the Alliance to Restore the Republic, listed Hoth among his preliminary scans for possible Alliance bases.

Han Solo expressed surprise at how obscure the locations were. However, Luke Skywalker responded to him by saying that one of the locations was the Rebellion's new home.
