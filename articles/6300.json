After subjugating a number of unaligned worlds, Mandalorian chief Mandalore the Ultimate set his true plan in motion, moving against the Galactic Republic by contesting resource worlds near the Outer Rim ecumenopolis of Taris. In an effort to defend Taris, the Republic Navy set up a defensive cordon in the region known as the Jebble-Vanquo-Tarnith line. One of the worlds along the line was the agriworld of Suurja, which, in the early days of what became known as the Mandalorian Wars, played host to four successive stalemated battles between the Republic and Mandalorians in 3964 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amidst the violence on the Outer Rim, the Jedi Order counseled caution and decided against jumping into the war. However, one group of Jedi, led by a charismatic young Jedi Knight known simply as Revan, refused to listen to the Jedi High Council's directive and vowed to fight the Mandalorians.

On the galactic capital of Coruscant, the Jedi Council castigated Revan after he returned from Onderon and Dxun\u2014the Masters were furious over his inclusion of other Knights and Padawans on his scouting missions, which the Council did not support.
