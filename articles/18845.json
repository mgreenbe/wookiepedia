Bokku used the barge to transport the Sith Lord Darth Vader to Zee-Nine City Seven, deep within Hutt Space, as part of Vader's search for the carbonite-frozen smuggler Han Solo. After Vader defeated the assassin droid IG-88 within the city, Bokku had Gak-Sixtoo aerially bombard the Sith Lord, but Vader survived, deflecting the fire with his lightsaber. Bokku, having realized that Vader could not be defeated, landed the barge on the ground despite the betrayal, allowing Vader to board."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
