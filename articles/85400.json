At some point between 2 BBY and 0 BBY, the Rebel Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry, more commonly referred to as Twilight Company, attacked Allst Prime's Imperial outpost. During the fighting, Micha Evon, Twilight Company's captain who was better known as Howl, entered Imperial headquarters accompanied by the soldier Brand.

Howl had Brand push Mag\u00e9 out of her chair before he looted the governor's desk of her Nabooian whiskey. At that point, Brand pointed her blaster at the captain, intending to reveal her true identity as a bounty hunter and kill Howl for the bounty on his head. The captain, however, was already aware of that fact and dissuaded Brand from bringing him in, making her join Twilight Company permanently.
