Ardon tasked the village's new Arena Champion, a spacer, with two tasks to further combat the Outcast threat. Ardon instructed the spacer to enter the Outcast's lair and defeat 5 of their assassins. When the spacer returned, they were rewarded with 5,000 credits. The final task that Ardon set upon the spacer was to take out one of the Outcast's top officials, a Sanyassan known as Exemplar Zheus. The spacer located Zheus, who was skulking around the Spirit of Nyenthi'Oris, and slew him. The spacer returned to Ardon, who rewarded them with 5,000 credits and named them the Blood Hunter of Kerritamba Village."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ardon is a non-playable character in Star Wars Galaxies.
