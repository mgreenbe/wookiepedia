While often residing in Doza Tower, she occasionally left to perform tasks for the station's captain. The First Order's interest in the station ultimately resulted in her destruction, when she was shot down by Commander Pyre while she attempted to defend Captain Doza from being placed under arrest. After the Colossus escaped from a First Order attack into hyperspace, 4D-M1N was repaired."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Assistant on the Colossus"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the assistant of Captain Imanuel Doza on the Colossus refueling platform, 4D-M1N acted as liaison, escorting guests into the captain's office in Doza Tower and relaying messages to the station's residents.

Some time later, 4D exited Torra's quarters to find the stormtroopers in pursuit of Kazuda Xiono, who was secretly a spy placed on the platform by the Resistance. As 4D opened the door to Torra's room and walked out, Xiono ran in behind her and escaped through a window. The stormtroopers followed Xiono into the room, and 4D protested, asking that they leave. The troopers ignored her, continuing to chase after Xiono."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After two children, Eila and Kel, escaped the massacre of their village on Tehar, the First Order put out a bounty on them. Captain Doza heard that Xiono had been seen in the marketplace with the children, sending 4D to summon him. She eventually located him and Neeku Vozo, taking them both to meet with Doza. Once Doza had finished speaking with Xiono, he requested that 4D escort him and Vozo out of his office, and she did so, accompanied by one of the Colossus security droids. Once 4D had gone, Doza contacted Captain Phasma, informing her that the children had been spotted, unaware of why the First Order were searching for them. The two children later faked their deaths to escape Commander Pyre and several stormtroopers, and 4D entered Captain Doza's office, informing him of the First Order's departure."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The First Order interferes"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Increased security"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, as Captain Doza was waiting to meet with the First Order, Torra entered his office, wishing to leave the tower. Doza, wanting to keep Torra safe, refused to let her leave while the First Order were on the station. When Torra walked out of Doza's office, the captain asked 4D to keep his daughter in her room until the First Order had left. 4D followed Torra back to her room, telling her that she had to remain inside for the next several hours. Torra attempted to leave for her patrol with the Ace Squadron, but 4D disregarded the need to, as her patrol had been covered by the other pilots.

Doza handed 4D a datapad containing the details of the First Order's proposed security deal, asking the droid to take it to his office. Once she had done so, she entered Torra's room, relieved to find that she had come back.

The pirates used an EMP grenade to disable several security droids, and 4D noticed the droids' deactivation.

He and Yeager were able to swim up to, and disable, the First Order's communications jammer, and alert the Resistance of their situation.

She threw the body at a second trooper that was attempting to fight Doza, knocking both of them down. She turned to shoot Pyre with the blasters hidden in her wrists, but the commander was faster, shooting 4D and knocking her backwards. With two more shots from Pyre's blaster, 4D deactivated, falling to the ground.
