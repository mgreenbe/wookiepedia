Built at an angle between thirty-five to forty-five degrees, swoopchasers had to accelerate into the Grand Moff Bank to crest the top of the Bank. Usually, Grand Moff Banks had a Repulsor-Out at the apex, increasing the difficulty of the climb as the fence attempted to repel the rider and their swoop. Repulsor-In fences were usually placed on the backside of the Grand Moff Bank to draw the rider in. At Outlaw level, the Repulsor-In fence was replaced with a Gravity Well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
