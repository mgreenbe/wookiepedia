Rebel Alliance Admiral Gial Ackbar's strategy for an Alliance victory was for the Star Cruisers to form a perimeter around the second Death Star while starfighters moved into the incomplete battle station's superstructure and destroy it from the inside. The battle was, in actuality, a trap by Emperor Palpatine to destroy the Rebel Alliance, whose naval forces managed to entrap the rebel ships as the second Death Star was revealed to be fully operational, destroying several Rebel Alliance capital ships including the Nautilian and the Liberty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "General Lando Calrissian, believing that the Rebel Alliance would not have another opportunity, convinced Admiral Ackbar to attack the Imperial warships directly, which would protect them longer against the second Death Star's superlaser and because rebel forces could inflict more Imperial casualties.
