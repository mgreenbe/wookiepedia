They saw use in the Federation's Lucrehulk-class Battleships during the Invasion of Naboo. After most of Naboo's blockade dispersed, the only battleship above Naboo was the Droid Control Ship Vuutun Palaa. However, all pilot droids and Neimoidians aboard were killed when Anakin Skywalker destroyed Droid Control Ship during the Battle of Naboo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Trade Federation gave its Droid Army to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, OOM pilot droids saw use by the Separatists. Two OOM pilot battle droids stood by Viceroy Nute Gunray and Rune Haako as they entered a Sheathipede-class transport shuttle to escape the First Battle of Geonosis, the first battle of the Clone Wars. Once the shuttle began to take off, the pilot droids and the organic Separatists around them moved away. During the mission to sweep outer corridor of space, an OOM pilot battle droid served aboard General Grievous's Munificent-class star frigate, and the droid notably disagreed with Grievous's decision to launch all starfighters to combat Anakin Skywalker. The fighters were launched to combat the Jedi Knight, however. During the infiltration of the Citadel, the Republic used three reprogrammed B1 battle droids, painted blue to serve as undercover pilot droids, to fly shuttle 81572 and deliver an extraction team to the Citadel prison. Ultimately, all three units sacrificed themselves to protect their Republic allies, including their commanding officer, R2-D2."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "OOM pilot battle droids were used by the Separatists for the entirely of the Clone Wars. They were used aboard the Invisible Hand during the Battle of Coruscant. When Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi were aboard the dreadnought, General Grievous ordered for the pilots to keep working on the ship instead of trying to fight the Jedi Generals. After Grievous fled his command ship and it began to crash onto Coruscant, the pilot battle droids and Neimoidian officers on the bridge tried to flee, but several of the pilot droids were cut down by Kenobi and Skywalker. Not long afterwards, at the end of the war, Skywalker, now known as the Sith Lord Darth Vader, executed the Separatist Council and shut down all Separatist droid units."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Age of the Resistance, a surviving B1 battle droid named R0-GR wrote the book \"droidography.\" Among the many droids he discussed in the book were the B1 pilot battle droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "OOM pilot droids could use E-5 blaster rifles if they were deployed for field combat.
