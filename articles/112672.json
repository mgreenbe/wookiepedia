He was trained to play the drums, a type of rhythmic musical instrument. At some point during the Republic Era, Reckly decided to join the Opposition, a political performance troupe of Pijali natives led by Halin Azucca. For some time, the group hosted theatrical performances on Pijal that showcased its opinions on local issues while also being informative to the public. By around 40 BBY, the Opposition began to protest the Governance Treaty, believing that the motion would cede irrevocable power to the Czerka Corporation, which had been exploiting the resources of Pijal and its moon for centuries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after initiating several pranks to express their dissent of the treaty, members of the Opposition, including Reckly, were framed by the Pijali monarchy for several violent attacks on Czerka facilities.

During their mission to Pijal to investigate the Opposition, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, were attacked by blackguards while on the planet's moon.
