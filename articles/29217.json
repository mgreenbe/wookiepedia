A C-9979 landing craft landed here and started deploying B1-Series battle droids, B2 super battle droids, BX-series droid commandos and at least one DSD1 dwarf spider droid, Armored Assault Tank and a IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tank. A Jedi Knight fought the droids it had deployed while Admiral Wullf Yularen got into position to fire at the landing craft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Confederacy of Independent Systems landing zone Aurek first appeared in Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures in the Umbara warzone. Once the player destroys the IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tank, the final boss for the landing zone, Admiral Wullf Yularen will fire at the landing craft. This damages the player significantly if they are within the blast radius. Just before the craft is destroyed, the landing ramp closes which can make players stuck inside the craft until the wreckage despawns. Players in the area of the craft when it is destroyed also temporarily get 2x credits and crafting materials, which also vanishes if the player logs off."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
