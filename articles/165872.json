It was made from fresh, laser-cut Sizhranian lettuce, tossed with Hocekureem Sea salt croutons and all sourced from VegSatellites orbiting Coruscant. The menu itself lauded the dish as being fit to serve to a Falleen prince, being amongst the tastiest dishes that the diner's Besalisk chef Dexter Jettster had ever tasted. The salad was also served at the Riverview Caf\u00e9 in the city Varlo on the Outer Rim world Roonadan, and in 44 ABY, the Jedi Knight Leia Organa Solo considered ordering a portion of the salad alongside Roba steak and a dessert of Vagnerian canap\u00e9s while dining in the caf\u00e9."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gregory Walker, the author of the 2009 StarWars.com Hyperspace article \"Dining at Dex's,\" created Xizor salad as a joke, naming it as both a pun on Caesar salad and a reference to Prince Xizor from Shadows of the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
