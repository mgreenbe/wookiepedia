The tournament started in 345 BBY and allowed Jedi Padawan learners to test their newly acquired lightsaber skills against each other in a fencing tournament. In 196 BBY, Pasha and Cyrus were the leaders and top two qualifiers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Origins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lightsaber Fencing Tournament originated in 345 BBY  from the challenges of skill made to students by the Jedi Master JanMinc\u00e9nte, an instructor at the school. JanMic\u00e9nte grew tired of always easily winning at fencing with lightsabers against students and decided it was more practical that they test their skills against each other. The tournament provided a ritualized way to do so. Throughout its history, several Jedi who went on to become important in the order distinguished themselves as winners in the tournament. The Jedi Master M'Ba-Tee was one such example, exhibiting the technique of Jar'Kai and becoming the champion the 12th Annual Tournament."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Tournament in 196 BBY"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of these tournaments was held in 196 BBY. The tournament was held at 1600 hours on a Hexaday. Students were divided into three squads - Squad A, overseen by Yoda, Squad B, overseen by Mr. Garfield, and Squad C, which was to cheer from the bleachers. The ten students that qualified for the tournament, in order of rank, were Pasha, Cyrus, Jo-Ahn, Egon, Tegan, Cronah, Gaiana, Shi-Fara, Greer, and Roan Novachez."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because they were the top two qualifiers, Pasha and Cyrus led the teams and presumably chose them as well. Prior to the tournament, Yoda and Mr. Garfield presented an exhibition duel. As one of the first two duelists to clash, Gaiana defeated Greer with a quick slash to his chest, and waved to the applauding audience. Roan Novachez was pitted against Jo-Ahn, and opened with a basic deployment of the Shii-Cho form. Jo-Ahn dodged and struck Novachez in the abdomen. Egon was pitted against Shi-Fara, and defeated her by speed-glitching behind her and landing a successful Zone 4 strike. Cronah and Tegan were next to clash, and Cronah defeated her by redirecting their weapons during a blade-lock. However, this feat earned him no applause. Pasha and Cyrus fought last, and their duel was relatively long. After leaping around Cyrus twice, Pasha was knocked over, leaving him at Cyrus' mercy. However, a worried Novachez deactivated Cyrus' lightsaber by accident. Pasha was disqualified afterwards."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Tournament in 195 BBY"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tournament was held again on schedule in 195 BBY, which also marked its 150th anniversary. As a result, Jedi Master M'Ba-Tee was present there, and did a special demonstration which impressed everyone but Ronald Rinzler. Gaiana was first again, and beat Jo-Ahn in combat. Once again, Cronah defeated Tegan as luck had pitted them together once again. Silva and Rinzler qualified this time, and were next to clash. Ronald let his guard down for one moment, and Silva provided the final blow. Cyrus was pitted against Egon, and used a Force-jump to triumph. This time, the final match was between Novachez and Pasha. Pasha attacked angrily, rapidly gaining ground on Novachez and driving him back. Eventually forced to drop his guard, Novachez was helpless against a blow from Pasha that was foiled by Cronah's flash camera. Although he had the chance to strike, Novachez waited for Pasha to take his time, as the circumstances would have rendered the blow cheating. Pasha resumed his attack, and after another bout of bladework, won the fight."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Tournament years later"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Victor Starspeeder participated in this competition, where he took down his own sister, Christina."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
