The Order of Revan and their Nova Blades pirate allies manipulated the two galactic powers into shifting their patrol routes and eventually forced a confrontation above Rishi, where Revan hoped to wipe out both fleets using a Revanite fleet and Revanite saboteurs aboard the opposing fleets. The Nova Blades set up a signal jammer on the planet, cutting off all unauthorized transmissions from the planet to the fleets once they entered orbit. However, a small team of Imperial and Republic agents disabled the Revanites' signal jammer on Rishi and managed to warn the two fleets, allowing both factions to capture the saboteurs in their ranks and bring the fighting to an end."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
