As a ship could not usually enter hyperspace when within a planet's gravitational pull, the gravity well projector mimicked the effect by creating a strong artificial gravity well known as an interdiction field. Five years after the birth of the Galactic Empire, an untested Immobilizer 418 cruiser was used to trap Wilhuff Tarkin's stolen corvette, the Carrion Spike. However, at the time the gravity well projectors were not perfected, and the Immobilizer was returned for reassessment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ten years later, the experimental Imperial Interdictor utilized four gravity wells to trap a rebel patrol.
