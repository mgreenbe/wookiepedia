Zhir-Khan was a member of the Task Force on Alliance Security, and wrote a report on the threat posed by Zayl Braith to the Rebel Alliance. Zhir-Khan found fugitive Zayl Braith during a routine stay on Ord Mantell. Braith should not have been on Ord Mantell, as she had recently made an attack there. Curious about her presence, Zhir-Khan assigned Agent Shofeld to keep an eye on her. The spy Derrida tried to frame Zhir-Khan, falsifying records to implicate the officer in treason against the Alliance. This scheme failed and Zhir-Khan's loyalty to the Alliance was not doubted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
