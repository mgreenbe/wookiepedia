The person filling it out, stormtrooper Sardis Ramsin, is writing about recent events involving his squad in Mos Eisley. He takes a decidedly insubordinate and sarcastic tone as he describes his patrol, Foot Patrol 7, being called in on a search for some droids. They encounter an old man who easily persuades the patrol's leader, TD-110, to let him and his companions, a teenager and some droids, go on their way. Ramsin then describes how he and one of his comrades, Tintop, have some drinks against regulations while searching a cantina after a report of their quarry being inside. A Talz patron, via the bartender, claims to Ramsin and Tintop that the droids were taken away by Tusken Raiders. After the cantina search, Foot Patrol 7 is called to assist in preventing a starship, apparently carrying the droids, from escaping. As the patrol sees the ship, an old freighter, take off, Ramsin, slightly drunk and hating his comrades and job, decides to leave, running back to the cantina and stealing a dewback waiting outside. He notes at the end of his report that this will be the last time his former superiors ever hear from him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
