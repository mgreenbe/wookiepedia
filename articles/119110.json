The spaceport contained a variety of hotels, bars and shops for use by off-worlders, and it also had a strong law enforcement presence. Due both its conveniences and the fact that the port was out of range of the Watchtower Base monitoring facility situated on Dorthus Tal Island, the spaceport was favored by visitors to Sacorria."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
