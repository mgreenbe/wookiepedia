It was responsible for securing the interests of the ruling Heaven-earth corporation of the Heaven system in the Lake asteroid field. The Lake branch battled the Vermilion Birds and Blue Dragon pirates towards the end of the High Republic Era. However, due to the corruption of high-ranking officials such as Zhang N\u00edngtao, many members of the security forces at Lake followed their lead in making business deals with the Blue Dragon, abducting civilians as slaves against both local and Galactic Republic anti-slavery laws and casually killing the slaves for their own pleasure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
