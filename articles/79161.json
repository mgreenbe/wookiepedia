The game was released concurrently with the highly-anticipated DVDs of the original, unaltered films of the original trilogy. The game is available on the Xbox, Xbox 360 and works via backwards compatibility on Xbox One and Xbox Series X, PlayStation 2, GameCube, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance, and PC. The Mac version, published by Feral Interactive, was released on 4th May 2007."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance versions are in portable style, as opposed to the original's presence on only the Game Boy Advance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the original films were fairly serious, besides a few puns in the later movies, LEGO Star Wars II is much more tongue-in-cheek, with large amounts of bizarre physical humor (there is no voice acting, so all jokes involve slapstick comedy). It covers the first three films (episodes IV, V, and VI), unlike LEGO Star Wars, which covers episodes I, II, and III."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The game was developed by Traveller's Tales, which was also responsible for the original. Publishing duties were taken up by LucasArts (replacing the original's Eidos Interactive). It features a total of 114 playable characters, 46 of them unlockable by having a saved game from LEGO Star Wars on the memory card or hard drive (and the others must be bought in the Mos Eisley Cantina, or unlocked during gameplay). The game also includes several new features, including vehicles, character-specific abilities, and customizable characters. The game holds the Guinness record for most playable characters in an action-adventure video game.\nMuch of the game revolves around collecting \"studs,\" small LEGO pieces that are used as an in-game currency. Some of the characters have special actions such as slapping or punching enemies, or interacting with friendly characters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There are also levels where you must pilot a ship.

At the counter, the player may use their Lego studs to purchase characters, vehicles, gameplay hints and extras, or activate cheat codes. In a small area outside the cantina, players may view collected vehicles. The game is broken into levels, which are accessed from the cantina; each film is represented by six levels, representing key locations and scenes in that film. The locations include Hoth, Bespin, Dagobah, Tatooine, the Death Star, and Endor. The game also features bonus levels. During levels, the player defeats enemies, builds objects out of Lego bricks, and drives vehicles. Certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles, including a TIE fighter, a Snowspeeder, and the Millennium Falcon. Levels must first be played in Story Mode. This unlocks the next level as well as a Free Play mode for the recently completed level. Gameplay is identical in the two modes. However, Story Mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on, while Free Play-offers all those unlocked. Levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three types of secret items are available: gold bricks, minikits, and power bricks. Within each level is hidden one power brick. When a power brick is collected, its corresponding extra, such as invincibility or stud multipliers, becomes available for purchase. Each level also contains ten hidden minikits, that is, ten pieces of a Star Wars vehicle. When all ten have been collected, the player is awarded a gold brick. Collecting a certain number of gold bricks unlocks free rewards, such as a spigot that spews out studs. Gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed, and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level; ninety-nine gold bricks are available. The vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina. As each vehicle is completed (all ten minikits collected), it becomes available for play in a bonus level."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Episode IV: A New Hope"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 1: Secret Plans"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 2: Through the Jundland Wastes"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 3: Mos Eisley Spaceport"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 4: Rescue the Princess"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 5: Death Star Escape"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 6: Rebel Attack"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 1: Hoth Battle"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 2: Escape from Echo Base"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 3: Falcon Flight"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 4: Dagobah"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 5: Cloud City Trap"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 6: Betrayal Over Bespin"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Episode VI: Return of the Jedi"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 1: Jabba's Palace"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 2: The Great Pit of Carkoon"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 3: Speeder Showdown"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 4: The Battle of Endor"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 5: Jedi Destiny"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 6: Into the Death Star"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Bonus Level"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "LEGO City"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Changes from the films"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Episode IV"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Episode V"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Episode VI"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of these differences, the game is considered non-canon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Handheld versions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Game Boy Advance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the Game Boy Advance, the game is altered for portability reasons, such as lower quality graphics.

Many Internet sites accused it of being rushed to shelves with the other versions of the game and the reissued Star Wars DVD films. One website was supposedly contacted by anonymous employees of the developer which claimed that the US, European, and Japanese versions were different from each other regarding the bugs, and that a new fixed version would be shipped to shelves after the first print run was sold out. One of the most notable glitches is in Episode VI, where many have considered the first main boss entirely unbeatable. This has not been verified by either the publisher or developer. However some people have beat the boss (Jabba's Rancor) using Luke Skywalker to use the force, to bring down the gate, crushing the boss.
