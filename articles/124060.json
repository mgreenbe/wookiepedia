In 3 ABY, while both starships were receiving repairs on the planet Ankhural, Sharn attended a meeting held by First Sergeant Hazram Namir and rebel asset Everi Chalis, a former Imperial governor, where the latter pitched Operation Ringbreaker. The proposed campaign focused on soft Imperial targets along the Rimma Trade Route to divert forces from Kuat Drive Yards, which was the final target."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chalis then allowed Sharn and the other attendees of the meeting to discuss her new plan. While the other attendees debated or raised questions, Sharn sat in the corner of the room, silently shaking her head. The Besalisk Gadren requested that Chalis leave and asked if Namir agreed with her plan. The First Sergeant confirmed that he did, and Gadren backed him. Chief Medic Von Geiz questioned whether a formal vote was required for approving Operation Ringbreaker, inquiring on Sharn's thoughts on having a voice vote instead. Sharn left the decision-making to Geiz and Namir, pledging the support of the Apailana's Promise.
