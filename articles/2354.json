The model moved about as fast as a Human and was very silent, able to move in zig-zag patterns so rapidly that most species would not be able to see them. Within a range of 500 meters, the holotransmitter could continuously feed live images to a security officer's holo display, and within that range the security officer could remotely control the droid by joystick if needed. The droids were not very intelligent and lacked personality. They would record suspects and relay the visual recordings, along with locational information, to a central surveillance station, then hide until they received further instruction or were taken over by remote control. Some at Battle of Hoth were equipped with a light blaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were deployed by the Empire on the Death Star I and at the Battle of Hoth; they were also used as advance scouts by the Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa where being ambushed by a group of Catuman warriors on the planet Tirahnn, R2-D2 patched into one of the local security's \"spy-eyes\" to track them down in the gigantic city; which allowed Han Solo and Chewbacca to find their friends on time to rescue them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were also deployed by the Imperial agent known as Blackhole; he used a host of them to track Luke Skywalker in 1 ABY on Vorzyd V without Luke knowing it.
