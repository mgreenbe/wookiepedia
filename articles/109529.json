A terrestrial world, Quermia's surface featured green landmasses with gardens and expanses of ocean. It sat close to the end of the Perlemian Trade Route hyperlane, which connected it to the astronomical object Makem Te. A separate hyperspace route connected Quermia to the planet Toola.

Named for their homeworld, these beings were the ancestors of the Quermian species. While the origins of the Quermian species were unknown to the larger galactic community, Quermians and Xexto shared so many of the same genetic markers that xenobiologists believed them to share at least a common ancestor. How this came to be was one of the galaxy's greatest mysteries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A member of the Galactic Republic, Quermia was located in Separatist space during the Clone Wars, a conflict between the Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems that began in the year 22 BBY. Isolated, the planet suffered heavily under an extensive Separatist blockade. With the fall of the Confederacy at the end of the war in 19 BBY, the blockade over Quermia was lifted. However, the planet fell under the rule of the Galactic Empire, which the Quermians did not usually consider to be a substantial improvement over Separatist control. Around the same time, Quermia was advertised as a destination worth visiting along the Perlemian Trade Route. One poster found on the moon Pantora suggested travelers take flight to the planet aboard Luxury 3000 space yachts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By around 3 ABY, a holy relic of the Quermian people had been taken from Quermia and put on display in the Imperial Museum on the planet Coruscant, capital of the Galactic Empire.

After the Arkanians departed Quermia, the Quermians developed a society centered on a largely communal lifestyle, as well as the contemplation of philosophy. The ease at which members of the species were able to communicate and share their feelings and concerns was a contributing factor in how Quermians were able to maintain the long-lasting peace of their society. While Quermia's history was not entirely peaceful, strife usually came from outside influence instead of internal struggles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yarael Poof, a Quermian male Jedi Master who served on the Jedi High Council during the final years of the Galactic Republic, hailed from Quermia, as did the Quermian male Rebel Alliance Pathfinder Needle.
