After infiltrating a smuggler ring on Karazak, Kostana and her Padawan Sifo-Dyas were led to Asusto, taking Dooku, a fellow Padawan, with them. They encountered several Abyssin smuggling nerve disruptors, who Dooku killed in a fit of rage. However, before they could verify the rumors of Sith artifacts, they were captured by the last remaining coven of the Presagers of Hakotei, who planned to enact a ritual using them. While experiencing a painful vision, Dooku unintentionally used Force lightning to kill the Presagers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
