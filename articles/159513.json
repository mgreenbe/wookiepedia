He knew that the Dim-U would simply send another bounty hunter when they learned of Jinsari's demise. In order to calm down the Dim-U, Vardias had a talented artist sculpt a bantha statue out of a piece of kiliad marble. He tasked the spacer who had helped him earlier with deliving the bantha statue to Brother Chonar, with the hope that they would forgive and forget the killing of the bantha. The spacer agreed, and sought out to find Chonar who was just outside of Anchorhead. When Chonar received the statue, he told the spacer that the statue conveyed the respect for the majestic bathas. He informed the spacer that the Dim-U would no longer pursue Vardias Tyne. When the spacer informed Vardias of the news, he thanked the spacer and gave away his shellfish harvesting tool which he used to use in the rivers of Naboo. He admitted that it had little use on Tatooine, but that the spacer may have a use for it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vardias Tyne was a Non-Player Character (NPC) in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies.
