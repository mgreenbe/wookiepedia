Dressed in a long white robe, it was his job to read Mutdah's massive collection of books to him, as Mutdah himself was too fat to do it. He did not know that sometime in 3 BBY, Mutdah had been killed and was being impersonated by Rokur Gepta. Gepta (as Mutdah) dismissed him when Lando Calrissian arrived at Oseon 5792. It is unknown if Ekisp was still on the asteroid when a massive hyperdrive engine collided with it and destroyed it, or if he had left in time to survive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
