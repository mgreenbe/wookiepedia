They notably hijacked the freighter Dromedar to steal its cargo of tibanna gas and captured its crew. After being boarded by members of the Imperial Navy vessel Blood Crow led by Lieutenant Thrawn, they pretended to be part of the Dromedar's crew and captured the Imperial boarding party. Most of the members successfully stole the tibanna gas and evacuated the freighter, while three members were captured and interrogated by Thrawn at an Imperial base on Ansion. Using the information Thrawn gathered both directly and indirectly, Imperial forces were able to launch counter operations on Uba and Cartherston, and after receiving intelligence, Imperial forces planned to launch an operation on Kril'Dor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
