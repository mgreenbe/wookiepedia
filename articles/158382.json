However, the sandcrawler was damaged in the northern Jundland Wastes, stranding the tribe there. Tteek Tlek was one of the Jawas living at the camp. In 3643 BBY, it was visited by Jedi Master Eriz Vossan in his Dark Plague-induced madness. Vossan instructed the Jawas to dismantle their sandcrawler and use the parts to build war droids to fight the Sand People instead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
