A Human male, he was considered one of the great Jedi of his time. As a young man he had explored the stars, and had once been in love with a woman who died long before his own passing in the Seventh Battle of Ruusan. During the Ruusan campaign, he had urged Lord Hoth to call off the final, doomed attack, to no avail. After his death on Ruusan, Tal was buried in the Valley of the Jedi. A millennium later in 5 ABY, his spirit helped teach Kyle Katarn how to wield a lightsaber and defeat mental attacks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
