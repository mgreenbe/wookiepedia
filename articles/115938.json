According to legend, the ring provided its wearer with immortality, but eventually drove them to madness. Its negative effects could supposedly be removed if worn alongside its counterpart, the Ring of Fortune, granting its wearer immense power. Detta Yao, student at the Shadow University, wished to acquire the rings, recruiting the rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Aphra and Professor Eustacia Okka to do so. Upon arriving at the Ring of Immortality's supposed location, in the Workshop of the Architects of Vaale on the planet Dianth, Yao and Aphra found that the ring was not present."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
