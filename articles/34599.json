The son of Han and Leia Organa Solo, Caedus was once a leading Jedi Knight who proved crucial in defeating the Yuuzhan Vong and protecting the galaxy during the Yuuzhan Vong War.

When he was thirteen, he and his twin sister Jaina began attending the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4, where their uncle Luke Skywalker taught them the ways of the Force. There he made several friends, among them the Hapan princess Tenel Ka Djo, to whom he became strongly attracted.

He escaped Yuuzhan Vong custody with Vergere, a former Jedi of the Old Republic, and rejoined the war effort.

The son of former smuggler, retired general, and Rebel icon Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa Solo of Alderaan, the New Republic Minister of State, Jacen Solo and his twin sister Jaina were immediately matters of public interest, and news of the pregnancy was spread throughout the New Republic. Taking a different sort of interest in the developing twins, Grand Admiral Mitth'raw'nuruodo, the new leader of the Galactic Empire's military, promised Organa Solo's powerful Jedi children to Joruus C'baoth, the insane clone of Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth, as his to raise and make his apprentices in exchange for C'baoth's participation in the Grand Admiral's schemes. This resulted in several kidnapping attempts by Grand Admiral Thrawn's Noghri agents against Organa Solo during her pregnancy.

Winter cared for them, and a squad of Noghri warriors provided security. They only saw their parents twice in 10 ABY before Han and Leia Organa Solo arrived on the Millennium Falcon to stay in seclusion with the children for the birth of a third child, Anakin Solo. They were quickly followed by members of Palpatine's Dark Side Elite, who sought to kidnap the children for the Dark Lord of the Sith. Defended by the Jedi Kam Solusar, Empatojayos Brand, and Rayf Ysanna, the twins were still snatched by Kvag Gthull before Ysanna freed them and their mother killed Gthull, causing the rest of the Dark Jedi to flee. With the arrival of Imperial All Terrain Armored Transports, Organa Solo had to take the children and flee. Evacuated to Nespis VIII, the twins were present when their brother Anakin was born. They were once again forced to flee when Palpatine targeted Nespis VIII, the site of the New Republic's hidden headquarters, with the Galaxy Gun superweapon. Traveling to Onderon, they were followed by Palpatine, who managed to sneak into Organa Solo's room, seeking to transfer his spirit from his dying body to that of Anakin.

Yet another Solo family crisis intruded on their life when his mother was stranded on Mon Calamari during the renegade Imperial admiral Daala's attack on it and Han Solo rushed off to save her; Jacen and Jaina were left with C-3PO and Chewbacca. To occupy the twins, C-3PO and Chewbacca took them to the Holographic Zoo of Extinct Animals. There, the young Solos quickly became bored and evaded their guardians. Wishing to go home, they took a turbolift, thinking that, like the turbolifts in the Imperial Palace, it would take them home. Instead, after Solo hit the button for the first level, it took them to the long-abandoned surface of Coruscant. They wandered through the derelict and deadly undercity, attempting to use the lessons learned from their favorite bedtime story, \"The Little Lost Bantha Cub,\" to reach their home. Eventually, they were captured in a trap set by one of the underdwellers to catch food. Rather than be eaten, they cooperated in using the Force to pull out the pins holding their cage together. Pursued by the creature's ferocious pet, they were forced to take shelter in a small crack. Moving through a small tunnel, they came upon a camp of undercity residents. Onibald Daykim, the king of the refugees from the Empire who had created the settlement, took an immediate liking to the children. He gave them food and then, using ventilation shafts and other utility systems, carried the twins up the many stories of Coruscant's worldwide city and safely back to their home, where they found their parents had returned."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Skywalker was felled by his corrupted student, Kyp Durron, the Solos flew to his Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 within the week.

At dinner with Skywalker's Jedi trainees, Solo and the rest of the Force-sensitives were struck by a wave of death felt in the Force, the result of Durron's destruction of Carida with the Sun Crusher superweapon. Han Solo set off to track down and talk down Durron, leaving Organa Solo and the twins on Yavin 4. Solo and his sister, exploring the ruined Massassi temples, encountered a pack of woolamanders; through the Force, Solo was able to \"speak\" to them, a fact that greatly intrigued him. That night, both Solo twins felt through the Force that Skywalker was in danger.

Solo and his sister were left in the care of Skywalker's students. Visiting Skywalker's bier, Solo was able to see and hear his uncle's spirit, standing in the room, as was his sister. They informed their caretaker, Jedi trainee Cilghal, but she did not believe them. That night, Skywalker's spirit appeared to Solo, warning him that his body was in danger from another of Kun's efforts. Solo woke his sister, who began raising the others, while Solo rushed to the Grand Audience Chamber, where he immediately sensed the dark side aura of the three Sithspawn battle hydras Kun had sent to attack. Fearlessly, young Solo charged the creatures to drive them away. At Skywalker's urging, he took up the Jedi Master's lightsaber and, with Skywalker fighting through him, defeated all three creatures. In the aftermath, the rest of the students realized that the Solos could see Skywalker, and Solo relayed Skywalker's message that Kun was behind the attacks and needed to be stopped before Skywalker could return to his body."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The students arranged a trap for Kun, luring his spirit into the Grand Audience Chamber and surrounding him.

McKumb, insane, caused a commotion that sent the children to the nursery with Winter and Chewbacca for safety and sent Solo's parents off on a mission to Plett's Well. In the same year, the Darksaber crisis and the creation of the Imperial Remnant again sent the adult Solos and Chewbacca scrambling while Solo was left with Winter and C-3PO. Nevertheless, most time was spent with family. Skywalker began developing Solo's Force talents, training him in the use of basic powers.

Although the assassins were thwarted by Sinn and Nanna, a combat-modified TDL nanny droid, Luke Skywalker traveled to Coruscant. Master Skywalker brought with him the identity of the man who sent the assassins, as provided to him by the Jedi Vima-Da-Boda: Devian, leader of the \"Restored Empire.\" For some reason, Jacen Solo and all the other members of the Skywalker-Solo clan were afflicted by lazy eyes around this time."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Empire Reborn"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 ABY, the Solo children traveled with their mother and Chewbacca on a diplomatic tour which saw them visit Mon Calamari, Gbu, and then Munto Codru. There, Solo spent time with Doctor Hyos, learning about medicine. As Munto Codru had a long tradition of political abductions\u2014kidnappings played out along a set of traditional rules\u2014the children were kept very secure. Nevertheless, while playing outside with Chewbacca and the son of Chamberlain Iyon, they were kidnapped\u2014not by local Codru-Ji but by agents of former Imperial Procurator of Justice Hethrir's Empire Reborn faction.

He did not know the password which hold-parents were supposed to know, explaining that he had not yet met Organa Solo to learn it. However, he was now their guardian; Hethrir dismissed the fact that Winter was supposed to care for them if anything should happen to their family. Neither twin fully believed Hethrir's account, and so they mentioned that Jacen had been the firstborn of the twins. Hethrir, who had claimed to be present at the birth, agreed with the lie, exposing him as a charlatan. The twins went along, and young Anakin did not pick up on the subtext. When Hethrir attempted to separate the twins from Anakin, however, they resisted. Hethrir used his own command of the dark side to suppress their Force abilities and had his aide Tigris take the twins away and lock them into separate small bedrooms. Solo had been playing with a bat on Munto Codru, and it had been carried along with him when he was kidnapped. He covertly kept the animal in his tunic, caring for it throughout the coming days."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next morning, the Solo twins and several other captured children were roused and gathered in lines. Upset and disinclined to follow the orders of Tigris and Hethrir's Proctors, Solo refused to line up. He had to be forced into line, and even then he and his sister resisted, walking out of step and causing disturbances. Angered, Hethrir canceled breakfast for the children and sent them straight to study. They were provided with educational programming and expected to complete quizzes on it. Later in the day, the children were lined up and those who could not wield the Force, or who were not Human, were weeded out of the group to be sold as slaves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At breakfast the next morning, Jaina used the Force to put sand in the Proctors' food, causing a disturbance with the cook. Solo capitalized on the altercation and used his Force-driven affinity for animals to convince the myrmin-like insects in the dining hall to crawl inside the Proctors' clothing. When the Proctors began to stamp on the creatures, he felt intense guilt for causing their deaths, and immediately swept them out of the way with the Force. In doing so, he tapped into the Force strongly enough that Hethrir, constantly monitoring them through the Force, immediately suppressed Solo's abilities once again. The Proctors were sufficiently irritated by the insects' biting that they rushed from the room, leaving the children unattended after only minimal attempts to ensure order. The Solos, reunited for the first time since their capture, led the other students to the play yard in a canyon on the surface of the worldcraft. There, they distracted the fearsome-looking but mostly harmless sand dragon that guarded the end of the canyon while Solo approached the dragon and communicated with her through the Force. Before he could accomplish anything, however, the Head Proctor returned and sent all the children to their tiny rooms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That night, Jaina used her multitool to open her door and let Solo out of his cell. When the Proctor on watch awoke, the twins decoyed him into Solo's room and, pushing him inside, latched the door to keep him in before they freed the rest of the children in the dormitory. Going out the play yard, Solo used the Force to move air molecules fast enough for them to glow with heat, creating a light in the evening to distract the dragon as he again approached her. Communing with the creature through the Force, Solo befriended and convinced her to carry the escaping children on her back. As they rode away, he set his bat free. They eventually reached an artificial stream on the worldcraft's artificial surface, where they could drink and eat berries growing on nearby bushes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the five-year-old twins lacked any sort of plan for the escape group which they found themselves leading. They settled on crawling along a path through the bushes, where they hoped the Proctors could not follow them. They were only barely ahead of the Proctors, and the trail ended at a large and impassable field of mud. The Solos again manipulated molecules, this time freezing the water in the mud to create a solid pathway to a tree on the far side, which was hollow. They were able to ascend it, where they were quickly found by Organa Solo in her ship Alderaan. With the children aboard, Solo summoned his bat so that he could take it back to its home as well. Organa Solo and Chewbacca rescued the Proctors, who had been stranded in the middle of the muddy marsh, and obtained from them the knowledge that Hethrir had taken Anakin to Crseih Station. Organa Solo and Rillao, Hethrir's former lover and recently freed prisoner, took the worldcraft to Crseih after attending to the children and locking up the Proctors. Rillao was able to comfort the twins and ease their fear of Hethrir, convincing them that he could no longer smother their powers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At Crseih, they were able to track down Hethrir and his entourage. Solo and his sister were left with Chewbacca while Organa Solo and Rillao, along with Han Solo and Skywalker, who were on Crseih for another mission, rushed to save Anakin. However, the children and Chewbacca were unable to resist intervening when the sounds of a fight reached them. They arrived to see Anakin rescued, but Skywalker had been consumed by Hethrir's trans-dimensional ally Waru. Solo's parents leaped into Waru to recover him. The twins surrounded Waru, screaming for their parents and uncle. Their shouts reached the three and were able to cut through the haze of Waru's mental manipulations, allowing them to escape. Foiled in his attempt to acquire their power, Hethrir was consumed instead by Waru who then vanished to his home dimension."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Family life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next two years, Solo's life remained relatively stable. Han remained at home to parent, and when Organa Solo returned from the office, the family would gather to relax and play in their vortex pool. Skywalker spent more time at his Praxeum, allowing Organa Solo to handle the children's instruction in the Force, which consisted of simple exercises. The Solos moved to a larger estate outside the Palace that had a yard of its own. However, Solo spent little time there; as of 16 ABY, he was more interested in mastering the Force than in physical play. He believed that the Force would provide for all his needs, avoiding the need for strenuous activity. This caused him to become somewhat pudgy, and he, like the rest of the Solo children, lacked friends due to their strict security measures; they had few other children of their age with whom to socialize. Even more, Solo played less and less with his siblings, and Han became increasingly concerned with his son's lack of interest in sport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point in his childhood, Solo found a female rock lizard by a river and decided to keep her as a pet. She was happy in Solo's care and was kind to those who treated her well. However, she soon started trying to escape. After failing to calm the animal with the Force, he consulted his Uncle Skywalker about this problem and the Jedi was reminded of his friend Windy Starkiller's pet dewback, Huey, of whom he proceeded to tell Solo. Huey also had a kind disposition and was not very troublesome, but one night he started trying to escape. Starkiller and his father released Huey to the wild because it was the dewback mating season and Huey eventually returned, so Skywalker advised his nephew to try the same technique. Solo reluctantly agreed. His pet did later return, now carrying an egg sack. Skywalker later recounted this to Mammon Hoole, and the scientist included it in the dewback entry of his reference book, The Essential Guide to Alien Species"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 16 ABY, Chewbacca left to be present for his son Lumpawaroo's coming-of-age ceremony, and Han was forced to leave to supervise the New Republic Fifth Fleet temporarily, leading to Winter returning to take care of the children during the day. Skywalker, meanwhile, retreated from the family into a hermetic life for personal reasons. Han was back after two months, but the crisis in the Koornacht Cluster, where the Fifth had been dispatched, quickly escalated. Organa Solo, suffering from burnout in her position as Chief of State, took the family on vacation to Rathalay, where Solo happily played on the beach, eager to see one of the carnivorous narkaa. After they returned to Coruscant, Han was again sent to command the fleet at Koornacht, but he was captured in transit by the Yevetha of the Koornacht Cluster. Organa Solo kept the news quiet, but it eventually went public. Solo was terrified for his father, but eventually Han was freed by the intervention of Chewbacca. Han had to spend time in a bacta tank on returning to Coruscant, but the children visited him. Returning home after their visit, they were delighted to find Luke Skywalker present. Rejecting his self-imposed hermitage, Skywalker was ready to take a larger hand in guiding the children's development."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The family soon moved back to the Imperial Palace, where Solo and his sister enjoyed exploring the vast building. They frequently used Anakin in their explorations, employing his uncanny talent with machines to have him open locks, interfere with security equipment, repair equipment, and otherwise facilitate their adventures.

Joining with his similarly affected siblings, he pushed back the feeling through the Force, but it was quickly followed by an explosion nearby that made the children worry their actions had caused it.

Solo scavenged most of the parts from junk heaps while his mechanically-minded siblings assembled it. Around the same time, the Solos met Zekk on Coruscant. A street urchin and expert salvager slightly older than the twins, Zekk befriended the children, and the three of them often spent time exploring the less reputable lower levels of Coruscant and skirting trouble. When the droid was fully assembled, a bad actuator caused it to overload and shut down, ruining the droid and leaving burn marks in the room. As the twins attempted to figure out how to avoid blame, Skywalker entered the room, lectured them on responsibility, and made them clean up the mess.

The trip in the Millennium Falcon was long, but the time was filled with family activities and an explanation of the situation in the Corellian system from Solo's father. When they entered the system, however, the Millennium Falcon was the victim of an ambush beaten off by a squadron of the untrustworthy Corellian Defense Forces Space Service, which had clumsily staged the attack in an attempt to gain the dignitaries' trust.

Storms delayed the trip for a day, but the Solos, Chewbacca, and Ebrihim and his droid set out for the dig on the next day. Solo was bored by the tour, conducted by General Brimon Yarar of the Human League, the organization that was funding the dig. He was also suspicious, as he had read about archaeology and recognized that the Human League was not following proper procedures. Instead, they seemed to be looking for something. He and his siblings fell behind the group, and stopped when Anakin began to act strangely. Anakin had, with his Force-powered affinity for machinery, discovered a live power conduit beneath the floor. He ran off to follow it, and Solo and his sister went along. Anakin found and activated a hidden keypad, opening a likewise hidden door. Solo led the way into the revealed passage, onto a platform near the apex of a vast conical chamber. He was interrupted in his explorations by the arrival of Q9-X2, who had noticed their absence and tracked them down. Realizing they would be missed, Solo immediately took charge of the situation and insisted that they leave, knowing that they had found whatever Yarar was looking for\u2014and that Yarar should not be allowed to find it.

When the summit started, the children took advantage of their parents' absence to stay up late in their bedroom playing board games. While they were doing so, Mara Jade entered the apartment. Realizing that their parents would be meeting her and discussing exciting adult business, they returned to bed from the landing on which they had hidden, pretended to be asleep when their parents returned and checked on them, and once more sneaked onto the landing above the living room to spy on the discussion. Jade had been sent a message to deliver to the Solos and the Corellian governor-general, Micamberlecto. The message offered a list of stars and dates and was understood to threaten that, if the unspecified blackmailers' unspecified demands were not met, supernovas would be triggered in those stars, which harbored increasing populations as the list progressed.

With the shields no longer in play, Jaina insisted the warning to stay atmospheric had ceased to be valid, and led the others into the main orbital battle. There, their excellent teamwork attracted enemy attention. While the swarm of enemies led the rest of the defenders to call a retreat to the atmosphere, Anakin insisted the Solos run the belt. He called to the other two Jedi through the Force, suggesting they join minds. Giving themselves over to the Force and sharing perceptions, they were able to evade the asteroids and easily target the Yuuzhan Vong fighters. The strain of the intense bond slowly proved too much for Anakin to coordinate, ending the experiment and forcing the unshielded Jedi to abandon Lando's Folly.

Meanwhile, the Millennium Falcon recovered Anakin and returned to Dubrillion, where Calrissian's men had captured one of the enemy fighters, its pilot dead. Skywalker intended to use the ooglith cloaker environment suit and gnullith breather, combined with an iceborer ship, to infiltrate the Yuuzhan Vong base of operations on Helska IV; however, Solo was convinced that the Skywalkers should not undertake the mission; Jade Skywalker, who would be piloting the carry ship Merry Miner to deliver and recover the iceborer, was suffering from a severe and mysterious disease.

He altered his course toward the signal, alerting the Yuuzhan Vong to his presence, before bringing the iceborer through the thick crust of ice coating Helska IV's waters. He left the iceborer and, disguised in his ooglith cloaker, was assumed to be a Yuuzhan Vong by a procession of warriors who ordered him into line. This proved fortuitous, as the warriors traveled to a cell holding Durron's apprentice Miko Reglia, shot down in the earlier battle, and the woman Danni Quee, whom Solo was surprised to recognize as the source of the Force call. The warriors finally realized that something was amiss, forcing Solo to battle them. Quee handled one, and Reglia, broken by Yuuzhan Vong torture, gave his life to remove the ooglith cloakers of a pair and carry them into the freezing water. Solo killed the other three and pulled Quee to the iceborer. He broke back through the ice and launched to space, where a New Republic task force had engaged the Yuuzhan Vong and been defeated.

When Anakin and Quee came up with the idea of turning the yammosk's tremendous energy output back on Helska to freeze the planet by intense evaporation, Calrissian was able to provide the shieldships to reflect the energy. A quick stopover on Dubrillion allowed them to marshal their forces, and then the New Republic fighters returned to Helska, this time with Solo in the ventral turret of the Millennium Falcon. Many coralskippers had left to harry Dubrillion, and the attack took the Yuuzhan Vong by surprise. Solo provided cover for the shieldships as they sapped heat from Helska IV.

The New Republic's leadership did not see things the same way and did not wish to put itself on a crisis footing, panicking the populace, for what they believed to have been an isolated, defeated threat. To formulate a Jedi response to the threat, Skywalker called a convocation of the Jedi two months after the initial invasion, which Solo attended. Skywalker shared the confusing news that the Yuuzhan Vong could not be sensed in the Force; they seemed invisible to or outside it. When Durron confidently stated the Jedi's ability to handle the threat, Solo spoke up to criticize him for overconfidence. Skywalker cut short an argument, but supported Solo's point, stating that he would direct the Jedi to gather information and prepare for war rather than attempt to carry on a war themselves. Jedi Knight Corran Horn brought the Solo brothers to see Skywalker about their assignments afterward. Anakin was instructed to accompany their aunt to Dantooine, where she could work on recovering from her debilitating illness.

Solo felt that the Jedi Order had fallen away from its origins as a meditative order, and the current Jedi Order was not fulfilling his need for an internally-focused, contemplative relationship with the Force.

He cut his way through the Yuuzhan Vong troops opposing him and used a captured bandoleer of blast bugs to destroy the shreeyam'tiz that blocked the dhuryams' signals.

Their discussion, though, was interrupted by the arrival of Yuuzhan Vong shock troops, sent to eliminate Solo. He fled into the center of the crater, where he waited as Vergere attempted to find an exit.

Vergere expressed her grief at learning that Anakin Skywalker had become a Sith, and revealed that she had been a Jedi Knight of the Galactic Republic, and the crater in which they rested was the former site of the Jedi Temple, the well of Force energy beneath it now tainted. As Vergere pushed Solo to decide who he was, he considered the question and declared that he was a Jedi. Disappointed, Vergere revealed that their room was full of Yuuzhan Vong, led by Nom Anor.

The other inhabitants of the gullet were outraged, as they threw new arrivals to the beast when it became hungry, saving themselves. Solo was disgusted, but willing to help them. When the girl he had saved attempted to convince the others to throw Solo to the beast rather than herself, he was once more enraged.

He worked with his uncle to formulate Force techniques based on their experiences combating Gorog. One was a technique to detect individuals who were concealing themselves in the Force by detecting the sensations that spread around them in the Force rather than searching for the individual himself. Another was working on using the Force in overwhelming amounts, calling on more power than the body could safely channel. Together they managed to work out ways to endure the sensations of overload, but not to prevent the damage it caused to the user.

Solo was initially disappointed, believing that his love had taken a Hapan husband and given birth to a child without even telling him, but on seeing the newborn girl, Solo realized that he was seeing his daughter, though it had been over nine months since he had been with Djo. The Queen Mother explained that she had slowed their daughter's development through the Force in order to avoid suspicion that the child was Solo's, which would have made him a target for the murderous infighting of Hapan nobility.

Seeing promise in his estranged apprentice's anger, Caedus played his cousin a doctored recording of Cal Omas supposedly ordering Jade Skywalker's death from house arrest in order to distract Luke Skywalker and allow his allies on the Jedi Council to reinstate him as chief of state without Skywalker's interference.

When Ratobo was killed, command passed to Rear Admiral Gavin Darklighter. With a bold disposition of his starfighters, Darklighter forced the Commenorians to retreat, leaving the Hutts' landing force vulnerable. Even Caedus was surprised by the maneuver, which he had been unable to predict. At that time a StealthX wing of Jedi arrived. Initially fearing an ambush, Caedus quickly realized it was the Commenorian fleet they were targeting after joining their battle meld. While advising Darklighter of this, Caedus was surprised to find Luke Skywalker in his personal chamber. Suspecting that the Jedi planned to extort concessions in exchange for ensuring the success of the Fourth Fleet's attack, Caedus was surprised to find that they merely wanted to show that they could have extorted him but freely aided him instead. As the Hutt fleet withdrew, Caedus ordered Darklighter to redirect his fire to the Hutt capital ships, not their landers still invading Balmorra. He was willing to sacrifice the planet to the possibility of Hutt occupation so long as he could reduce their fleet for the crucial Kuat clash. Skywalker was angered by this decision, and withdrew his presence from the room, revealing that he had been projecting a convincing doppelganger while fighting in his StealthX.

That plan collapsed just as Confederation forces began to engage them, when Luke Skywalker heard that his son had been involved in Omas's death. Skywalker stormed to Caedus's observation chamber and confronted him, demanding answers. When Caedus insisted he did not know why his uncle was upset, Skywalker angrily pinned him to his chair with the Force, leading Caedus to admit that his apprentice had heard an incriminating recording of Omas, but deny that he had sent Ben Skywalker to kill the deposed chief of state. Skywalker stalked out unsatisfied after informing Caedus that he would be withdrawing Jedi support from the Galactic Alliance. The fighter wing abandoned the battle, leaving Caedus with much worse odds.

When Skywalker showed insufficient ruthlessness, Caedus declined to take him back into his trust. Only when Skywalker revealed that the Jedi had traveled to Kashyyyk to convince the Wookiees to join the Jedi in opposing Caedus's rule did Caedus believe his apprentice showed merit sufficient to recover his place at the Dark Lord's side. Caedus decided to make an example of the Wookiees while also breaking the grueling stalemate at Kuat, taking the Anakin Solo and the Fifth Fleet to Kashyyyk to crush the Wookiee rebels. Caedus was sure that the Confederation would be unwilling to let a potential ally fall and lose face at a time when it desperately needed new members. Phennir would have to break fleet elements away from the fight to rescue Kashyyyk. Meanwhile, Caedus ordered Serpa to retaliate against the Jedi at Ossus and had Galactic Alliance Guard forces storm the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.

The outrage would force the Confederation to respond while terrifying worlds thinking of resisting the Galactic Alliance, he thought. It was his hope that his actions would provoke his cousin into attacking him. He had given up on Skywalker ever doing so when the youth suddenly struck, missing Caedus as explosions rocked the ship.

The short story \"The Crystal\" by Elaine Cunningham, appearing in Star Wars Gamer 5, helped show Solo's maturation. In The New Jedi Order, Solo weathered the death of his brother Anakin and assumed a position as the preeminent hero of the next generation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That was not the initial plan, however; it had been the creative team's intent to kill Jacen Solo in Anakin's place and have Anakin become the major hero. This was abandoned when Star Wars creator George Lucas vetoed the idea of Anakin Solo becoming the dominant figure, and the brothers' dramatic roles were swapped. Jacen Solo became the central figure of the arc; according to editor Sue Rostoni, \"in many ways, the NJO is really his series.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to author Matthew Stover, the New Jedi Order novel Traitor was originally to feature Jacen Solo learning a new fighting style that would provide him the key to victory against the Yuuzhan Vong. Considering Solo's entire arc in The New Jedi Order, Stover decided that what the character really needed was to transcend his philosophical doubts, and accordingly wrote him as gaining not martial but philosophical knowledge from Vergere. Solo's transformation in Traitor gained some strong support for its revolutionary nature, placing on Star Wars Insider's list of the twenty most memorable moments within the Expanded Universe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When LucasBooks and Del Rey were looking for ideas for the post-New Jedi Order series, Troy Denning, writing the Dark Nest Trilogy, proposed having Jacen Solo fall to the dark side. The idea was incorporated into the 2006-2008 Star Wars: Legacy of the Force series, in which Solo became the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Caedus. In Legacy of the Force: Invincible, published in 2008 and written by Denning, Darth Caedus was killed by his sister Jaina."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo gained his first name from a boy named Jasen, a friend of Zahn's son Corwin. Zahn's editor, Betsy Mitchell, suggested that he exchange the S in Jasen's name for a C in order to keep the name from sounding excessively rooted in 1980s America. When Solo was falling to the dark side during the Legacy of the Force series, the publisher decided to open his Sith name to fan voting. Del Rey and StarWars.com announced the Darth Who Contest, in which fans were invited to submit possible titles for the new Dark Lord of the Sith. The editors and series authors would review the entries and choose their preferred five, which would become the subject of the next round of fan voting. The five selected names were Darth Acheron, Darth Caedus, Darth Judicar, Darth Paxis, and Darth Taral. They were each given definitions: Acheron as \"a river in Hell for those who deny justice,\" Caedus as \"a battle of darkness,\" Judicar as \"the final judge,\" Paxis as \"bringer of peace,\" and Taral as \"ancient Sith for 'he who protects.'\" Darth Caedus was ultimately chosen, and the name's submitter, Tawnia Poland, was acknowledged in Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice, the novel in which Solo was given his Sith name. The New Essential Guide to Characters offers the pronunciation of \"Jacen Solo\" as \"J\u0101'-s\u0115n S\u014d'-l\u014d,\" and Leland Chee has said that \"Caedus\" should be pronounced \"KIE-duss,\" rhyming with \"hide us.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Young Jedi Knights cover artist Dave Dorman used Calvin Engel, the son of cartoonist Jim Engel, as a model for Solo's appearance.

This would place the training in 33 ABY, in the middle of Solo's five-year journey, during which he has been established by other material to have been completely out of contact with his family and the Jedi. This unusual situation is explicable as the result of a failure to correct the reference from \"seven\" to \"ten\" when Betrayal was shifted from a 37 ABY setting to 40 ABY.
