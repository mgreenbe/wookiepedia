One operated the shields while the other piloted the fighter and operated the laser cannons and sensors. The life-forces in the battle droids received their commands from the Ssi-Ruuk command vessels via sensor arrays located on thrusters on each side of the vehicle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though they had fairly fragile hulls, the shield system had a unique ability to absorb and redirect incoming energy, similar to the Vangaard Pathfinder.

In large numbers against inferior numbers of foes, the fighters proved devastating.

By that time, the entechment process had been enhanced to even sustain the life forces and the basic technological systems had been improved with reverse-engineered technology from other galactic civilizations, but the droids were still operated by captured life-forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Swarms of P'w'eck-piloted battle droids were used during a second attempted invasion of Bakura in 28 ABY. During the battle, the fighters were equipped with tractor beam projectors which were used to capture Alliance and Bakuran pilots. However, the battle droids later revolted against their Ssi-ruuvi masters and joined forces with the Alliance and Bakurans following the death of the Keeramak at the hands of P'w'eck Emancipation Movement leader Lwothin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
