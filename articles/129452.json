It allowed a witch to understand animals. Because animals did not have proper languages, the understanding was primarily based on emotions. The spell was far easier to cast on domestic animals than wild ones, and wild predators were more difficult to communicated with than other species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
