Its surface consisted of barren, sandy desert, oceans of red, cracked mud, and escarpments of yellow-orange hills, with quicksand and caves also present. It had an arid climate and winds often blew at speeds of 400-kilometers-per-hour or more. Rainfall occurred once a decade, and when it came it lasted several days, forming lakes and filling dry riverbeds. Herds of migrating chooba grazed on sulfaro plants and were hunted by the Kitonaks, a primitive sentient species native to the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kirdo III was discovered by scouts a few decades before the rise of the Galactic Empire.
