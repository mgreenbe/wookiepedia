After the Empire conducted a crackdown on Pipada, protests turned to massacres, and Sa'Kalla was captured. During her captivity, a movement was organized in Sa'Kalla's name and spread throughout the entire planet. When Imperial forces were in danger of being overwhelmed, they brought out Sa'Kalla in the Pipada Auditorium in front of half a million Drabatans, and convinced that they had broken her through torture, ordered her to prompt the people to submit to Imperial rule. She defied those orders and instead called out to resist, before being immediately killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The stadium erupted, the Drabatans tore Imperial security forces to pieces, and briefly reclaimed their world.
