Winnis eventually defected to the Rebel Alliance and he attempted to deliver some weapons technology to the Alliance. However, before he could complete his assignment, he became injured and received treatment inside the University Faculty Medical Center near to Lake Grallia, on the planet Ralltiir. The Galactic Empire suspected Winnis of being a Rebel informant who had provided the Alliance with information that had allowed them to kidnap a team of Cygnus Spaceworks designers, and a number of Imperial stormtroopers were posted to stand guard outside Winnis' recovery room. The Alliance then hired a team of agents to retrieve Winnis from the medical center, before the Imperials could discover his true identity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
