Taking to the skies during the fighting, Koon provided leadership in Coruscant's orbit as Master Kenobi and Jedi Skywalker rescued the captured Supreme Chancellor and killed Count Dooku.

Unaware of the danger he was in, Koon's craft was struck by a volley of laser fire as his escorts opened fire on their newly assigned target. His starboard wing in flames, the craft's engines exploded, consuming Plo Koon's body and ending his life.

The device's readings showed Horn to be dead, while he was clearly still alive. Grand Master Luke Skywalker, on a forced exile under mounting pressure on the Jedi Order, and his son, Ben, embarked on a journey to discover the causes of Solo's fall. While searching for an initial lead in the Jedi Archives, Jedi Master Cilghal stumbled across an obscure interview from decades before, in which Plo Koon mentioned an ability of the Baran Do similar to the one Horn exhibited.

Despite this special bond, Ahsoka ended up being abandoned by Koon as well as the rest of the Jedi Council when she was accused of treason. He did apologize to her after she was proved to be innocent and called her by her nickname of \"Little Soka\". However, Ahsoka was deeply hurt and disappointed by the whole ordeal and chose to leave the Jedi Order, believing she could no longer trust any member of the Council, not even the Jedi who had brought her to the Temple in the first place.
