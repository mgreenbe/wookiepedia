This garnered the interest of Palpatine's chief enforcer, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, who sped the young woman's advancement in various Imperial-sponsored programs, including her enrollment into the Intelligence Academy of Carida. After she graduated with top honors and was promoted to the rank of major by Vader himself, Brie was given a highly classified mission to infiltrate the Rebel Alliance and either cause the death or ostracism of Rebel hero and Jedi Luke Skywalker amongst his peers. Brie achieved the latter, but the events that ended in Skywalker's disgrace also left her horribly disfigured and near death.

While on that sojourn, however, both Palpatine and Darth Vader perished in battle at Endor, and as the foremost of their pupils despite her incomplete training, she defaulted to Mistress of the Sith. Purpose-driven toward vengeance against Luke Skywalker and the Alliance for the deaths of her Sith Masters, she apprenticed an ex-stormtrooper named Flint and lent support to the extra-galactic Nagai species' war against their mortal Tof enemies. The Sith Lady suffered a critical defeat early in her campaign, the damage from which required replacement of her armor, and saw the debut of a triangular headdress that, along with her lightwhip, henceforth became her trademark. She continued to aid the Nagai, during which time she confronted and ultimately lost to her sworn enemy, Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. As the Nagai\u2013Tof War commenced, however, the Dark Lady escaped Skywalker's custody, with promises of mayhem for him when next they met. She subsequently ended her partnership with the Nagai in favor of the Tof opposition, but their swift defeat by the unified forces of the Alliance, Empire, and Nagai signified the end of the war.

Together Lumiya and Jax eliminated the last vestiges of the Prophets of the Dark Side cult. She then charged him with the infiltration of the Imperial Ruling Council in anticipation of a threat to her Sith Order, while she herself brokered for additional assets with Imperial Regent Ysanne Isard. However, Jax's own nascent ambitions led him into an ill-conceived attempt at betrayal against Lumiya, and another former Royal Guardsman, Kir Kanos, killed Jax, leaving the Dark Lady once again without an apprentice. She returned to the planet Korriban to plot strategy and, in possession of the ancient Sith oracle stone artifact, continued to monitor galactic events from afar.

Together they conspired to restore peace to the galaxy through the creation and ascension of the next Sith Lord. Lumiya ignored a second offer of alliance from those on Korriban, as Lumiya and Vergere contrived to bring the Skywalker family's Sith legacy full circle through Jacen Solo, the grandson of Darth Vader. She and Vergere facilitated Solo's capture by the Yuuzhan Vong, to whom Vergere had ingratiated herself, and the Fosh began the training that Lumiya would eventually finish.

Brie's impressive achievements were noticed by the Emperor's foremost servant, Darth Vader, who recommended Brie for training in the Empire's Imperial Intelligence division. The young woman soon excelled in all aspects of her training and became proficient in nearly all exotic martial arts, from Echani to Noghri Stava.

As the school's finest pilot, the role of flying the personnel shuttle from Coruscant to the academy fell to Brie. The cadet refused, however, and her superiors instead selected Davani. The class arrived safely at Carida, a high-gravity world, and settled in to prepare for boot camp. The training began with two days of arduous physical conditioning in the barracks, before the cadets were dispatched on a 200-kilometer hike across one of Carida's deserts on the third day. Brie and her classmates were told by the instructors that they could pack however many supplies they wished, but the young woman perceived the exercise's true purpose. She explained to Davani that the instructors were waiting to see if the cadets would foolishly weigh themselves down with extra water and other supplies; any cadet who did would perish on the hike due to the world's high gravity.

To that end, a plausible backstory was fabricated for Brie, which stated that she was from the city of Chinshassa on the planet Shalyvane. Although the world was home to the Em'liy species, Brie's cover story falsely identified Humans as the native race. The Em'liy were instead cast as oppressors to the Humans who warred with them and destroyed the society to which Brie supposedly belonged, killing her family in the process. According to the cover story, the supposed war between the Humans and the Em'liy lasted for years until the two species cast their differences aside to make peace with one another. All of Shalyvane's natives then gathered together at a shrine called the Circle of Kavaan to solidify their new conciliation under the guidance of alien ambassadors contracted by the Em'liy; they were instead attacked by the offworlders, who massacred all those present. Brie, purportedly a little girl at the time, was able to escape the slaughter and was left to survive into adulthood by her own faculties. Many years passed before she learned the \"truth\" of Shalyvane's sterilization from an intoxicated ex-fighter pilot; the Em'liy had allied with the Empire and also lied to them, claiming that Brie's people were members of the Rebel Alliance. Enraged by the revelation, as the fabrication went, Brie sought out the Alliance and decided to enlist. The verisimilitude of her cover story was bolstered when Darth Vader ordered the razing of Chinshassa, which had previously displayed resistance to Imperial rule.

Oblivious to Organa's scorn, Brie left with Skywalker for Bespin in an X-wing starfighter as his wingmate. Upon their arrival, Brie noted that Cloud City seemed deserted, and an investigation by Skywalker's astromech droid R2-D2 determined that the installation of a series of bombs within Cloud City's infrastructure had led to the populace's evacuation. However, the bombs had soon thereafter been neutralized by a cyborg and a Human, which Skywalker surmised had probably been Lando Calrissian. Before their investigation could take them any further they were attacked by Hugo Treece, an Imperial governor stationed on Bespin by Darth Vader. They remained pinned under fire from Treece and his squad of stormtroopers until Calrissian's arrival served to distract the Imperial's attention away from Brie and Skywalker.

Feigning a need to perform a private ritual, Brie approached the monument and discreetly activated the embedded communications transmitter. Her message to Vader was interrupted, however, when Shalyvane's Em'liy natives ambushed the Rebels and forced them into cover. During the ensuing combat, Brie revealed several elements of her false past; that it had been the acts committed against her family and childhood home of Chinshassa by the same natives in allegiance to the Empire that led to her membership with the Rebel Alliance, and that she returned annually to Chinshassa in remembrance of her people's massacre."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebels were forced to give ground until Skywalker's astromech, R2-D2, discovered a series of underground tunnels previously mentioned by Brie that could potentially serve as an adequate means of escape.

Believed to be extinct, the teezl was under escort of the Imperial armada to Coruscant where it was to be installed and made to serve the Empire as a limitless source of communications energy. The Rebel Alliance was aware of that fact and was determined to thwart the Imperials at all costs. An infiltration mission was developed wherein Brie, as a member of Flying Bantha Squadron alongside Skywalker and pilots Alph and Hanc Thorben, would disguise herself and sabotage the Imperial armada by means of the TIE fighters that had been previously obtained on Bazarre station.

The successful transmission of the recognition codes allowed for a seamless and unsuspected insertion of Brie's team into the ranks of the Imperial fleet, and once each of the Flying Banthas had assumed an adequate vantage point, the attacks commenced. The Imperials were confused by what seemed to be friendly fighters engaging in wanton destruction and quickly deduced that Rebel forces had penetrated their ranks with fraudulent fighters.

His assault also resulted in the death of the teezl and the effective end of the battle. Skywalker's return to Haven Base was met with somber greetings; he was immediately debriefed by Organa and a holocam recording from Thorben's TIE revealed that the fighter which Skywalker had shot down was not one of an enemy, but that of Captain Shira Brie.

Not to be deterred, Lumiya prepared to face him in combat yet again, but she failed to properly assess the significant change in circumstances; in addition to his usual weapon, Skywalker had armed himself with a lightsaber with a shorter blade, known as a shoto. Lumiya's weapon was no match for the conjunct assault of Skywalker's two sabers, which were able to counter the duality of her lightwhip's tendrils.

The door opened upon the slightest command of dark power by Solo, who followed behind Syo as she brought him before her estate.

When the seemingly unarmed Lumiya refused to acknowledge Dinn's authority, she was attacked. Lumiya evaded Dinn to draw her lightwhip, and landed a disorienting strike to the Jedi's face. Dinn advanced, but was painfully forced into retreat by Lumiya. The Jedi telekinetically hurled two marble busts, the first of which Lumiya destroyed with her whip, and the second she caught in the Force. She lost the struggle, and the bust struck the whip from her hand. She was saved by Solo, however, who had agreed to learn her dark side teachings, after he envisioned multiple possible futures that resulted in the galaxy's descent into chaos and the death of his uncle, Luke Skywalker; only in his visions of Nelani Dinn's fall did Skywalker survive. Dinn realized that she was outmatched and fled with Solo after her, a confrontation that ended in her death. Lumiya met him shortly afterward in an airlock adjacent to the hangar where his shuttle was docked, and promised to honor the deceased with a burial suitable of a noble warrior. She noticed Solo's distress at what he had done and assured him that he had already begun to strengthen himself through his actions. As he departed with the unconscious but uninjured Ben Skywalker, Lumiya promised that upon his return to her asteroid, she would help Solo reach the level of Sith status that his grandfather had been unable to achieve.

Awed by the grandeur of the edifice, she entered, hid her dark side aura, and was led to the Room of a Thousand Fountains, where Solo explained that he would arrange for a discreet apartment for her on Coruscant where he desired for her to remain. She agreed but stressed the importance of haste on his part, now that she was confident in his decision to become Sith.

Unknown to her apprentice or anyone else, however, Lumiya commandeered another dwelling on the 288th floor, which was to serve as the relay station for her observation of the comings and goings of Zorp House. She also infiltrated a set of unoccupied quarters in the building's third level, where she installed the modified and booby-trapped datapad with which she intended to splice into the building's communications system. Her datapad was also programmed to penetrate the most secure of Alliance Military databanks, and from it she obtained highly classified plans for the Alliance invasion of Commenor, a world that was slowly leaning toward Corellian allegiance.

With reports of his cousin Thrackan Sal-Solo's plans to have Centerpoint Station operable within the coming months broadcast all over the HoloNet, Jacen became increasingly determined to mitigate the repercussions of actions various members of his family visited upon the galaxy. Lumiya realized that Solo feared the similarities in his fall to the dark side and that of his grandfather, whose actions during the razing of the Jedi Temple he had witnessed during a recent flow-walking experience. Satisfied when he related his desire to still take Ben Skywalker as his eventual Sith apprentice, Lumiya was not completely in agreement with Solo's decision to remain with the Galactic Alliance Guard police force in lieu of a more influential military appointment, given his relationship with Niathal.

Lumiya sensed his unrest as she emerged from an adjacent room to find him in her apartment, and advised him to recognize the significance of such decisions as he prepared to make his final sacrifice; among other things, the alienation of his sister was a small part of the price to pay for his role in the institution of an ordered galaxy. His dreams were inconsequential to Lumiya, so long as he was able to differentiate between them and Force visions, the latter through which he might find answers she was unable to provide. Solo was also troubled with the diminished faith in him of Ben Skywalker, who had witnessed Jacen Solo's inadvertent murder of a prisoner during interrogation.

The Dark Lady urged her apprentice to exit as she activated her lightwhip and prepared to deal with the Twi'lek, who beckoned Lumiya to stop the fleeing Jedi Master, Tresina Lobi, from reporting to the High Council details of the conversation on which she had just eavesdropped. The Dark Jedi blasted Lobi with Force lightning but was incapacitated by an urn thrown telekinetically by the Chev. Lumiya began a duel with the Jedi, but was methodically driven back by the larger woman, and forced to deactivate her weapon when the Twi'lek interposed herself between the combatants and was burned across the body by the whip's still-hot energy filaments. Lobi severed Lumiya's weapon arm just then and took position for a killing strike, but she was again parried by the Dark Jedi, which gave the Sith time to recover her lightwhip and wield it with her remaining limb. Forced into retreat and momentarily distracted by the being behind her, Lobi faltered, and Lumiya sheared both of her legs off at the knee, just before her accomplice killed her with a decapitating strike.

The StarWars.com Databank for Darth Vader referred to Lumiya as a \"proxy villain,\" one of many through whom Vader plotted throughout the Marvel Star Wars series."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It would be nearly ten years before Lumiya appeared again in the Star Wars universe, in managing editor of Star Wars Gamer Michael Mikaelian's short story Lumiya: Dark Star of the Empire, written for Star Wars Galaxy #3. In 2001, veteran Star Wars writer Abel G. Pe\u00f1a wrote The Emperor's Pawns, an article included in Star Wars Gamer 5, one which expanded on many of the elements that were only touched on in previous appearances and sourcebook references. Pe\u00f1a confessed to an immediate interest in Lumiya as a teenager, which led to an extensive, expensive, and ultimately successful hunt for each of her comic appearances. When the opportunity presented itself for his own addition to Lumiya's history, his focus was on exploration of the depth of the bond between her and Darth Vader, foundations of which were first laid by Michelinie and Simonson, and expanded on later by Martin and McLeod. He also expressed concerns that identifying her as an Emperor's Hand would be a \"tough sell,\" but was able to nonetheless incorporate it based on the retcon given in The Essential Chronology, which first established her so. At the time he wrote The Emperor's Pawns, Pe\u00f1a was able to share his fondness for Lumiya with still-managing editor of Star Wars Gamer Michael Mikaelian, also a fan and one-time writer of the character."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beginning in May 2006, Lumiya was featured in a critical role for the nine-part Star Wars: Legacy of the Force novel series, wherein she served as the primary antagonist for the first five installments. When co-authors Aaron Allston, Troy Denning, and Karen Traviss, each of whom shared a third of the series, began their collaboration, the idea of a being known only at that point as \"the wizard\" was intended to portray Jacen Solo's Sith Master. Lumiya had not been considered; in fact, ideas for beings of other species were given, including Anzati. Executive director of Lucas Licensing Sue Rostoni, however, suggested that the trio use Lumiya as their wizard character, an idea they accepted. For the first of the nine novels, titled Legacy of the Force: Betrayal, Allston toyed around with how to feasibly associate a character of thirty or forty in-universe years prior to a character of the current era, specifically Jacen Solo. He credited the rich history of the Sith and the dark side in Star Wars with providing him enough material to create a character of utmost complexity in Lumiya for Betrayal. Traviss noted the pleasure she took in writing characters with whom she was not previously familiar, Lumiya included. She was especially fascinated with her depiction of Lumiya and Alema Rar's interaction in Sacrifice, giving special attention to their differed perspectives on their various mutilations, and their different approaches to their problems with the Solo/Skywalker family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When he was contracted to provide drawings for the upcoming reference book Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force, artist Tommy Lee Edwards initially sketched the duel between Lumiya and Luke Skywalker on Terephon, featured in Sacrifice, with the Dark Lady on the receiving end of a decapitating strike delivered by the Jedi Grand Master. However, Lucasfilm felt as though the image was too violent, and Edwards chose instead to use one that depicted both combatants alive. Abel G. Pe\u00f1a later expressed his satisfaction with Exile's mention of the confrontation on Caprioril between Lumiya and Jade Skywalker and hoped that Sacrifice, Lumiya's final appearance as a living character, would spark a renewed interest in that which he originally alluded to in The Emperor's Pawns. Since its release, he has attempted to obtain licensing for the story, but to no avail. In the article Who's Who in Soulcalibur IV on StarWars.com, a grudge match was suggested between Lumiya and the character Ivy of Soul Calibur. In addition to features in a wide variety of reference and source material, several focus closely on Lumiya, including the one hundred eleventh issue of The Official Star Wars Fact File, as well as exclusive entries in both the StarWars.com Databank and 2008's Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lumiya and her lightwhip were included in Hasbro's Legacy of the Force set of Star Wars Miniatures. In 2009, Hasbro released both a Lumiya action figure in a comic pack with Luke Skywalker and Marvel's Star Wars 96, and a Shira Brie figure as part of the Evolutions: Rebel Pilot Legacy III set."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Inconsistencies"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Lumiya became a more popular character, many discrepancies and contradictions arose within the variety of sources that expanded her history. The Official Star Wars Fact File 111 says that Lumiya was shot down by Luke Skywalker during their mission to Cloud City, when in fact she was shot down during the battle of the secret armada, which appeared in Star Wars 61: Screams in the Void. While Lumiya's Databank entry claims that she was recovered from her destroyed TIE fighter by Darth Vader's agents, The Emperor's Pawns states that Vader himself discovered Brie in the damaged starfighter. Despite the sources that identify her eyes as green, Mara Jade describes them as \"cold gray\" in Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force. Lumiya: Dark Star of the Empire lists her height as 6\u00a0ft., or 1.83 meters, as late as the battle of Endor, but The Official Star Wars Fact File 111 and The New Essential Chronology lists it as 5\u00a0ft. 2 in., or 1.6 meters. Furthermore, the novel Legacy of the Force: Tempest, written by Troy Denning, states that Alema Rar is considerably taller than Lumiya, but the New Essential Chronology has them both as the same height at 1.6 meters, and Lumiya is the taller of the two based on the 1.83 meters given for her in Lumiya: Dark Star of the Empire. Dark Star of the Empire also mistakenly identifies Lumiya as having been previously a Jedi Knight that fell to the dark side of the Force. The final duel between Luke Skywalker and Lumiya that occurs in Sacrifice describes her as having removed her cowl to fight bare-faced, while the depiction of the same confrontation in Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force has the Dark Lady still clad in her trademark headdress."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
