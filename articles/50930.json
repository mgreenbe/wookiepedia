After Minister Zeffren Ecka ordered a system-wide evacuation, the Jedi Order and Galactic Republic responded, leading a rescue effort to save the system.

With all weapons systems under Te'Ami's control, the Duros Jedi was about to fire when Burryaga interrupted, preventing the shot as he had sensed through the Force that the anomaly was part of a starship, with living people still onboard. Te'Ami subsequently relayed the information to Avar Kriss, the Jedi Master in charge of the effort, who identified every anomaly containing lifeforms and alerted the Republic Defense Coalition forces involved in the rescue mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Fruited Moon appeared in the novel The High Republic: Light of the Jedi, written by Charles Soule."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
