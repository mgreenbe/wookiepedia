He escaped with the help of a defecting stormtrooper, whom Dameron nicknamed Finn, and returned to the Resistance base on D'Qar on his own. He aided Finn, Rey, Han Solo, and Chewbacca with air support during the Battle of Takodana, and he later flew during the battle to destroy the superweapon known as Starkiller Base.

Even so, General Organa gave Dameron command after Holdo sacrificed herself, and he led a last-ditch counterattack against the First Order during the Battle of Crait.

With this newfound hope, Dameron promoted Finn to co-general and they planned their final assault on Exegol, using the course plotted by Rey in Luke Skywalker's T-65B X-wing starfighter. The co-generals launched their attack, sending Lando to the core worlds to gather support. The Resistance's initial attack was a bust, as the Final Order picked off their pilots one-by-one.

As they went to accompany Grist and the rest of the team, Poe promised Snap to tell him the story of what the Resistance did during their absence.

However, the Millennium Falcon was damaged in the process, and Poe had to make an emergency landing on returning to the base on Ajan Kloss. Upon seeing the Falcon on fire, Rey chastised Poe for lightspeed skipping and damaging the Falcon, whereupon Poe on noticing an injury BB-8 had recieved while Rey was training under Leia as a Jedi chastised her for not being responsible for the droid's safety.
