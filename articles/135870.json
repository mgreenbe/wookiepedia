Some stocks were retractable, which allowed the user to change the shape of a pistol-like weapon to a rifle-like weapon and vice-versa. When the stock was folded, it reduced the length and shape of the weapon, allowing the user to treat it as a one-handed pistol. When the stock was extended, the user could treat the weapon more like a rifle, which allowed the wielder to fire at a greater range. However, the extended stock required that the weapon be used with two hands to be used properly. Some blaster carbines, such as the E-5 carbine used by B1-Series battle droids, had a retractable stock. The most common weapon used by the stormtroopers of the Galactic Empire was a blaster rifle that had a collapsible stock which allowed for three different firing positions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
