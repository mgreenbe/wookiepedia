The attack occurred during the war for control of Alaris Prime between 39 BBY and 36 BBY, during which the Trade Federation established the listening array to spy on the Wookiees. The array's commander, LUH-989, had launched an unsuccessful attack on Chewbacca's camp, after which Shoran's scouts found the listening array. Chewbacca and Shoran combined their forces in the attack, destroying the listening array's transmitters and the defending battle droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Between the years 39 BBY and 36 BBY, the moon Alaris Prime was caught in a war between its rightful Wookiee colonists and the company known as the Trade Federation. The Trade Federation built a listening array consisting of six transmitters to monitor the Wookiees' progress, which was commanded by the droid LUH-989. A camp belonging to the Wookiee leader Chewbacca was unsuccesfully attacked by LUH-989's forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Wookiees defeated those droids, scouts from a camp run by another Wookiee colonist, Shoran, discovered the listening array. Chewbacca suggested that the Wookiees destroy the array, a plan that was agreed upon by Shoran and Qui-Gon Jinn, a Jedi Master of the Jedi Order and advisor to the Wookiees. Chewbacca gathered a group of between eight and thirty Wookiees and marched through Shoran's camp to reach the listening array."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The attack"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of Shoran's heavy bowcaster troopers attacked two of the sentry posts that lay on the other side of a river before moving into the listening array. The trooper was killed by the battle droids before Chewbacca's Wookiees and Shoran arrived at the array. They destroyed each of the transmitters there along with every battle droid, which included four B1-Series battle droids, two advanced beetle droids, and two droidekas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinn congratulated Chewbacca for his successful strategies.

The attack is the final conflict of the sixth level of the Wookiee tutorial campaign, \"Allies and Jedi.\" The player is blocked from discovering the outpost earlier than intended by the walls of Shoran's camp, in which a gate appears after other story events have been completed. The player can use any military units available in the game's second technology level for the attack, which includes bowcaster troopers, dragon troopers, grenade troopers, HummBike speeders, and Jedi Padawans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The strategy guide states that if the player has been consistently creating soldiers prior to the attack, they should have between twenty and thirty Wookiees, but that only eight are necessary. The guide also stated that a scripted event of Shoran's forces fighting the Trade Federation would take place when the players units reach the listening array, but this did not occur in the finished game. Instead, a single heavy bowcaster trooper from Shoran's camp attacks the sentry posts before moving into the base, followed by Shoran himself. If the player sends their Wookiees in too late, Shoran can be killed by the Trade Federation army, but unlike the deaths of other unique units in campaigns, including Chewbacca, this does not immediately end the level. Unused audio files from the level have Jinn inform the player that Shoran is assembling his forces to attack the array, and he suggests that the player send any newly created troops to join Shoran's forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
