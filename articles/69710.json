He had a ship called Leilana's Dagger, named after his long-lost love Leilana. Jayne ultimately met his fate on the moon of Iope, in the Rinn system, while his skills were tested by the Imperial assassin X-7. Soon realizing that no reward was worth attempting to prove himself against X-7's onslaught, Jayn attempted to flee the system. Nonetheless, his ship was disabled and destroyed in the upper atmosphere of the moon. Ironically, Jayn had planned to return to Phindar and settle-down after collecting his money, like he had always promised Leilana."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
