Its handcrafted outer shell was formed of layers of flattened ribbon-like structural beams, with no right-angles to be found. The elongated hemispheres on the hull took on an organic appearance from a distance. The Independence saw its share of combat and this took a toll on the vessel, leaving streaks of blackened scorch marks on the hull."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A series of airlocks and hangars were located around the ship, allowing it to serve as a starfighter carrier. The main hangars, located one on each side of the ship, could each support up to two starfighter squadrons.

The Independence was armed with 36 twin heavy turbolaser batteries and 36 twin battleship ion cannon batteries, each positioned six forward, twelve port, twelve starboard and six aft. In addition it was fitted with six heavy tractor beam projectors. The cruiser had capacity for up to 120 starfighters, along with numerous shuttles, landing craft and utility vehicles.

Alliance Chief of State Mon Mothma had an office on board and there were several lecture halls located on the ship. There was also a large awards auditorium that was at least two stories high that presented Rebel personnel with various medals for distinguished actions in the service of the Rebel Alliance. The ship contained an intelligence center, located near the communications center, for use by Alliance Intelligence. The intelligence center was home to numerous datacores and computers and was secured by two sets of heavy doors, which were guarded at all times. Entry required both a code cylinder and passcode. From here, intelligence reports were compiled and used to produce briefings for High Command or mission planning officers.

The simulator room contained four banks of twelve flight simulators which could each run separate missions or be linked to allow multiple squadrons to train together. Additional simulators were located in the starfighter repair bay. Each simulator could be configured to resemble the cockpit of standard starfighters and shuttlecraft.

The Independence was part of a Rebel fleet comprised of seven Mon Calamari Star Cruisers, two Nebulon-B frigates, two CR90 corvettes and four GR-75 medium transports which were undergoing refueling in orbit of the planet Turkana when they came under attack from an Imperial task force. The Imperial force, comprised of ten Star Destroyers led by Captain Xamuel Lennox aboard the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Tyrant, opened fire on the Rebel ships and dispatched their TIE squadrons, but Ackbar responded quickly by launching the new starfighters, catching the Imperial forces by surprise.

On one such trip to Agamar in the Lahara sector, while Mon Mothma delivered her \"A Call to Reason\" speech to members of the resistance on the planet, the Independence remained in orbit, deploying four X-wings and four Y-wings, and keeping watch for signs of Imperial activity.
