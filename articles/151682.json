Overdevelopment on Li-Toran left little room for new hives, which caused myrmitrices to compete for the same tunnels and caverns. Before a battle could end, new myrmitrices deployed fresh soldier-myrmites and prolonged the conflict."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The conflicts escalated until the degree of subterranean warfare resulted in the collapse of entire tunnel and cavern networks. To prevent further destruction and a devastating catastrophe, the largest hives formed a planetary council to end the existing battles and work to ensure such wars did not occur again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
