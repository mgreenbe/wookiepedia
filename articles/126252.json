Dating back as far as the days of the Old Republic, numerous Sith temples were erected, including at least two located on the Sith homeworld of Moraband, the one on the ravaged planet of Malachor, and the one on the volcanic world of Mustafar. At some point before 10 BBY, the crime lord Dryden Vos plundered a Sith temple and obtained a slab of obsidian stone carved with hieroglyphs representing warding spells."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
