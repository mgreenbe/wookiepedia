After the colonists crash-landed on Wayland, they interrupted a series of wars between the two species. The Humans lorded over the natives, using blasters against them, when they had never advanced beyond primitive weapons like bows. This continued for several generations before the Humans ran out of power packs and were forced to take up arms similar to their opponents. This equalized the conflict that had always favored the Humans. Eventually, the three groups reached an uneasy peace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
