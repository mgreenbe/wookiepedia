Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo were attempting to help move a group of psychotic Jedi Knights safely to avoid capture by Galactic Alliance Security forces. They were attacked by a group of Mandalorians hired by Galactic Federation of Free Alliances Chief of State Natasi Daala, but managed to defeat them with the help of Bazel Warv, one of the Jedi suffering from the psychosis. With help from Raynar Thul, the Jedi were then able to convince Warv to get into the FloatVan that would transport him and the other Jedi to safety."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
