It stood at over ten meters tall and resembled a mass of titanium. It was manufactured by the same company that manufactured the Galactic Empire's armored walkers and its cab interior was similar to those walkers. One such vehicle was owned by Moonglow Polychemical, which stationed it at its refinery in Gorse's Shaketown. It had a big metal staircase. During the Gorse conflict, the company's chief operations officer Lal Grallik took the Imperial Navy Captain Rae Sloane on a tour of the vehicle's cab."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
