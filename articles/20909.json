During that year, the Alliance discovered that the Empire was constructing a second Death Star battlestation in orbit over the Forest Moon of Endor. The Alliance decided to attack the Death Star while it was still in construction; however, in order to destroy the station, the Alliance first had to deactivate the SLD-26 planetary shield generator on Endor protecting the superweapon. A strike team was organized by General Han Solo to infiltrate the moon. Carlson, by then a veteran scout and pathfinder, joined the team."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Carlson and the rest of the strike team traveled to the Endor system aboard the stolen Imperial Lambda-class T-4a shuttle Tydirium, piloted by Solo. Queried by the Super Star Destroyer Executor in defensive orbit over Endor, Solo gave a stolen Imperial code, and the Executor provided the shuttle clearance to land on the Forest Moon. Shortly after landing on the moon's surface, the strike team waited while Solo and the team's command crew\u2014Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, and the Wookiee Chewbacca\u2014scouted the area ahead to make sure it was clear. In the process, Solo alerted a scout trooper patrol to the strike team's presence, resulting in a speeder bike chase between Skywalker, Organa, and several of the Imperial scouts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Carlson and the rest of the squad waited until only Skywalker returned. When it became evident that Organa was missing, Solo took the rest of the command crew to search for her, ordering the squad to continue on and to rendezvous at the deflector shield generator at 0300 hours. Major Bren Derlin, the strike team's commanding officer, led the squad toward the shield generator. Several times along the way, the squad encountered Imperial patrols and managed to hide. However, Corporal Delevar, the team's medic, almost compromised their position by preparing to take a potshot at a speeder bike; he was consequently stopped and reprimanded by Derlin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When night fell, Carlson and the squad made camp in a camouflaged shallow ravine, posting two sentries and setting up a blanket grid with their scanning equipment. Shortly after their first sleeping shift, the scanners detected an All Terrain Scout Transport walker moving toward their location. Corporal Beezer and another member of the squad, Lieutenant Greeve, jammed the walker's transmissions and destroyed its spotlights with a sniper rifle, respectively, and the squad circled the walker in order to keep it off balance. Delevar fired a smoke canister into the AT-ST's cockpit window when it began firing randomly into the trees and foliage. The resulting smoke explosion forced the walker's crew to abandon the vehicle and surrender to the strike team. The squad captured the Imperials and forced the walker pilot to make a comm check-in at blasterpoint. The squad continued on to the rendezvous point, forcing the walker pilot to make several more check-ins on the way to explain the scout walker's absence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo and the others then rejoined the rest of their group, having allied themselves with the Ewok tribe of Bright Tree Village, who showed the Rebel commandos a route to the shield generator bunker's backdoor. Carlson and the rest of the commandos proceeded into the bunker; however, they were soon ambushed by Tempest Force, the Imperial Military legion stationed on the moon, and the entire strike team was captured and led outside the bunker. Their capture proved to be brief, however, as the Ewoks attacked the Imperial troops, turning the tide of the battle in favor of the Rebel Alliance. The Rebel commandos successfully destroyed the shield generator with the use of 7-PrG proton grenades. With the Death Star's deflector shield destroyed, Alliance starfighters were able to destroy the Imperial superweapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brooks Carlson had fair skin.
