An enclosed Complex similar to The Channel, it was a spacious labyrinth with multiple paths. Riders used infrared tracking lights to maneuver through dips, turns, and straightaways. The swoopchasers required infrared goggles to see the tracking lights and move through the Complex. Otherspace could be augmented by ion flare pits and repulsor buoy traps."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
