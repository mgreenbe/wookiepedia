But when they arrive near the colony, the Jedi discover that the Separatists have used the Gungans as an test, with a lethal new gas produced by Jenna Zan Arbor on Queyta. The Separatists plan on crashing a ship filled with the gas onto the moon, to frame the miners for the atrocity. When the Jedi and clone arrive, they find a contingent of droids. They destroy all the droids, but when they assist the miners, two unknown characters arrive: the Gen'Dai bounty hunter Durge, who wants to kill all the clones because they are offsprings of a Mandalorian (and he just hates Mandalorians), and the Sith apprentice Asajj Ventress. Ventress kills Glaive while Anakin and Alpha are helping the miners, but in the end Obi-Wan and Zule defeat the two enemies, who flee from the moon, and Anakin and Alpha destroy the ship the Separatists want to crash on the planet. Anakin did not want to believe that the Confederation would do so, but Obi-Wan says: \"Believe it, Anakin, this is the new face of war ...\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Issues"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
