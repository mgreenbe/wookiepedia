This white stone tower had been built approximately five thousand years before the Battle of Yavin by the Massassi, the warrior caste of the Sith species. Skywalker had installed his bedroom at the top of the tower, just beneath the turret. In this room, a narrow window overlooked the canopy of Yavin 4's rain forest. In this very tower, the spirit of the late Obi-Wan Kenobi advised his former apprentice to seek out the Lost City of the Jedi. Six years later, Skywalker established a new Jedi Academy within the ruins of the Great Temple, and he subsequently relocated his quarters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
