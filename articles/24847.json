They were usually typified by a predominance of several traits, including a hairless or nearly hairless body, a flat, notched tail, anterior flipper-like limbs, and vestigial posterior limbs. Many cetaceans also filtered food through the sieve-plates in their baleen. Additionally, their nostrils could close, with their large lungs allowing them to stay underwater for several hours at a time. Both the Porporite and Herglic species were sentient cetaceans. Non-sentient cetacean species included the aiwha of Kamino and Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
