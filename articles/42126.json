When in protocol mode, their sensors were white. In attack mode, their sensors turned red and the droids were also capable of elevating their height. Infiltrator droids were capable of weathering extensive damage in combat, possessed considerable strength and could leap great heights. They were also capable of rapidly scanning various objects and lifeforms and identifying them, enabling at least one undercover unit to play the role of an inventory droid. Infiltrator droids could also cannibalize other droids and drain their power. These droids were also programmed to pilot tactical infiltration pods and to operate transmitters. Breaking Imperial protocol, the droids were fitted with a proton warhead that would self-destruct if the unit was compromised."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial Era, Grand Admiral Thrawn commissioned the creation of E-XD infiltrator droids to scour the Outer Rim Territories for rebel bases. In 2 BBY, the Empire dispatched many infiltrator droids in tactical infiltration pods to hunt for the Phoenix Cell's base. One of these units, EXD-9, under the guise of an RQ protocol droid, discovered Chopper Base on the planet Atollon. After being attacked by krykna spiders, he was adopted by Garazeb Orrelios and AP-5, who believed that he would make a good inventory droid thanks to his rapid scanning functionality. However, Alexsandr Kallus, an ISB agent who was serving as a rebel operative under the callsign Fulcrum, alerted Zeb to the presence of the droids. Following a struggle, Zeb, AP-5, and the astromech droid Chopper overpowered a transformed EXD-9 and reprogrammed him into a improvised bomb which destroyed an Imperial Star Destroyer and all the other infiltrator droids aboard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Mon Mothma's rebellious speech against Emperor Palpatine, E-XD units were spread across the system in tactical infiltration pods in an effort to locate her.
