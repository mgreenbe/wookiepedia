Dameron and Finn traveled to the moon with a team of Resistance operatives but were pursued by the mercenary crew known as the Kendoh Gang, whose leader, Kendoh Voss, sought to turn Finn over to the First Order and collect the bounty on him.

Although Finn led the mercenaries away from Dameron, who loaded the supplies aboard the Resistance team's starship, Voss soon located and approached Dameron, intent on obtaining the bounties on both Resistance operatives. However, Dameron's droid, BB-8, rolled an activated thermal detonator into the base. While the resulting explosion allowed Dameron to escape, it began to trigger the remaining weapons, causing the base to become unstable. Finn and Dameron then departed with the weapons they had gathered, evading the Kendoh Gang, which similarly evacuated the base before it was destroyed. Afterward, the stormtroopers of the First Order's 709th Legion on the planet Batuu held animosity toward the Kendoh Gang because of its failure on the moon of Avedot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Base 354-23X, an impound storage facility of the New Republic, was situated on a mountainside on the moon of Avedot.
