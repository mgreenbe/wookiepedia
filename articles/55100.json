During his training as a Consular, at the advice of Jedi Master Shol Bestros, the senior Padawan began to keep a journal as a means to record his thoughts and experiences which could later serve as a personal reference as well as material for the Temple Archives. As Gnost-Dural began exploring the early histories of the Jedi Order, he uncovered forgotten records of Tython, the Force Wars, and the Infinite Empire. These discoveries would prove vital to the Order in the following decades. Continuing down the path of a historian, Gnost-Dural constructed his own green-bladed lightsaber as part of his training."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Great Galactic War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Four years after beginning his journal, the Jedi High Council bestowed upon Gnost-Dural the title of Jedi Knight. During the ceremony, the Kel Dor swore to uphold the Jedi Code and defend the Galactic Republic as part of his duty to the Order and the Force. It was upon this day that news broke on Coruscant of a bloody assault on the Tingel Arm; history would later remember this attack as the first appearance of the resurgent Sith Empire, last seen during the Great Hyperspace War nearly two millennia prior."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dispatched along with hundreds of other able-bodied Knights to the Minos Cluster, Gnost-Dural and his compatriots hoped to end the Sith offensive there quickly and decisively. As the Sith met the Jedi in battle, the conflict continued to drag out. Digging in on the planet Eliad for several months, Gnost-Dural had fought many Sith troopers in the initial weeks, but only once had an encounter with an actual lightsaber-wielding Sith. Despite the Jedi's initial concern at confronting the dark sider, he quickly realized that overconfidence was the Sith warrior's downfall and defeated him. Collecting the slain Sith's weapon, Gnost-Dural hoped to one day be able to return to the Temple Archives on Coruscant to enter it into the collection and studying it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the following weeks Gnost-Dural was transferred to the Republic Fleet where he was placed under the command of Admiral Greik and confronted and defeated the Imperial Battle Group at Bothawui. Despite this victory, the planet was eventually attacked a second time, resulting in the loss of Master Belth Allusis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After years of fighting on the front lines of what was now known as the Great Galactic War, Gnost-Dural's petitions to the High Council were finally answered and he returned to Coruscant and the Temple Archives to conduct research on the origins of the Sith. During his research, Gnost-Dural compiled a report to the Council detailing an historical account of the Sith Empire and his belief that the long-thought dead Sith Lord Naga Sadow was indeed the Sith Emperor leading the war effort against the Republic and the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi Master"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Gnost-Dural became a Jedi Master and the keeper of the Jedi Archives. In the years following the Treaty of Coruscant, the Jedi High Council tasked him with creating a new timeline of the event. His research during this time unearthed several previously unknown factors about the war and served as the basis for a new Jedi Library."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3640 BBY, Gnost-Dural was assisted by intelligence agent Theron Shan to find and destroy the Ascendant Spear. The pair infiltrated the facility and Dural, giving time for Shan to sabotage the station, confronted his former apprentice turned dark Kana Terrid, now Darth Karrid. Dural dueled and killed her apprentices, but was captured in turn and interrogated by Karrid.

Alongside Tau Idair, they fought in a lengthy campaign against the Eternal Empire and the pair were the only survivors. Following the conflict, with Jedi numbers thinned and Grand Master Satele Shan in hiding, Dural\u2014as one of the remaining Jedi High Council members\u2014took many Jedi and civilian volunteers with him to establish a hidden colony on Ossus. He and Idair recruited others to their colony, including the doctor Archiban Frodrick Kimble and Jedi Knight Nadia Grell."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3628 BBY, the colony was discovered by Imperials and Master Gnost-Dural led the evacuation efforts with Doctor Kimble and Nadia Grell.

Jedi chosen by Master Gnost-Dural to attend the meeting included Sal-Deron, Tau Idair and Vinyor Tesh, as well as the Dantooine mission party. Though Tesh believed that it was inappropriate for Leneer to attend the meeting, given that she was no longer a member of the Order, Peralun backed Leneer's presence and Gnost-Dural concurred."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Master Gnost-Dural was a historian above all else and strived to record galactic history and the feats of important individuals.

He was originally set to appear in the early version of Star Wars: The Old Republic's first expansion, which would have included the planet Ziost and a storyline for the Sith Warrior class involving the Jedi Master. He eventually appeared in update 5.10 Jedi Under Siege and was voiced by Fred Tatasciore."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gnost-Dural was set to be mentioned in the short story Quite A Story To Tell, set after the events of the Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught, but his name was later removed and replaced by a mention of Sal-Deron.
