With the help of a translator collar, he was able to communicate with his patrons in Basic. When Jedi Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano visited the bar and questioned the Ithorian about the whereabouts of bounty hunters Cad Bane, Moralo Eval and Rako Hardeen, the bartender initially was hesitant in revealing that the trio had just passed through. Angered by the Ithorian's stalling tactics, Skywalker used the Force to make him tell the truth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ithorion bartender was voiced by Stephen Stanton, who also voiced Moralo Eval."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
