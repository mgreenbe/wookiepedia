The battle occurred shortly after the Republic Navy pulled its fleets away from the Sith homeworld of Korriban and instead stationed them in orbit of the ancient Imperial world of Ziost. The Imperial Armada, led by Sith Lords Darth Angral and Darth Malgus, struck against the intruders in an orbital attack. The battle lasted over thirty days, and was primarily waged in space and low atmospheric orbit. Although the Empire ultimately managed to chase the Republic away, the Jedi Order and Republic Military struck again immediately afterwards on the Sith world Ashas Ree."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
