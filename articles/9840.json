Among the refugees were the Scions of Zakuul and their leader, Heskal, who had fled the purges instituted by Emperor Arcann. Following the rescue of the Outlander from Zakuul in 3631 BBY, former Zakuulan officer Koth Vortena and his compatriots - Sith Lord Lana Beniko, renegade Knight of Zakuul Senya Tirall, and the bodyguard droid HK-55 - fled Zakuul onboard the Gravestone, an ancient combat frigate that had been able to fight against the Eternal Fleet, and docked at Asylum for repairs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Guided by visions in the Force and believing a confrontation was required, Heskal lured Arcann to Asylum by telling him that the Outlander who had escaped him was there, resulting in a battle between the Outlander's forces and the Eternal Fleet, and a duel between the Outlander and Arcann in the station's control tower. Though weakened by the battle, the Outlander escaped with the Gravestone and its crew and fled to Odessen, laying the foundation for an Alliance against Arcann."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
