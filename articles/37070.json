It was directly responsible for supplying scouts with equipment, such as droids, starships, weapon, and survival gear. Unfortunately for the scouts, the Department of Supply was under-financed and could only supply the scouts with standard equipment. Equipment requisitions submitted to the Department of Supply had to first be approved, then passed on to the New Republic's purchasing agents for prioritization and purchase. This made getting any equipment from the Department of Supply in a hurry nigh on impossible."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
