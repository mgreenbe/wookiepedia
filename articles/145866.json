Nonetheless, his score of ninety-five was well above the next highest score on the simulation, so Wevary assumed that he had cheated.

Instead of using the opportunity to escape, Thrawn instead moves his ship behind the disabled patrol ship, perfectly matching its speed and rotation.

After Ba'kif congratulates Thrawn on a job well done, the Irizi representative is confused, claiming that Thrawn failed to disappear the way he claimed.

Wutroow continues by saying that before their attack on the Paataatus, a Chiss emissary told the Paataatus delegation: \"The next time you see Chiss ships come toward you through those stars, they'll be bringing your utter destruction.\" The emissary then pointed out into space, indicating the precise location that Ar'alani's force would later arrive at. Wutroow continues by saying that had Ar'alani known about the diplomat's action, she would have chosen a different attack vector. Since Ar'alani did not know, Thrawn's actions were necessary.

While the three pink aliens do not match any Chiss records, Samakro identifies the fourth alien as a Void Guide (its tattoo scars giving it away), a member of a group who act as navigators for hire through the Chaos. Thalias is also familiar with Void Guides, as she once had been aboard a warship escorting a diplomatic mission (the ship had hired a navigator to continue the illusion that the Chiss don't have their own). Samakro cannot identify the species of the navigator, and Thrawn comments that because the Navigator's Guild goes to great lengths to keep its member's species and systems secret, he would have been surprised if Samakro had been able to identify it. Nevertheless, the presence of the navigator gives them a lucky break, as some of the bridge recordings were salvaged from the wreckage of the ship. Because the wrecked ship's crew needed to talk to their navigator, they would have used a trade language, and because the Void Guides operate in the regions near the Chiss, it is very likely that they know whatever trade language they used. Samakro asks if any navigational records survived, and Thrawn explains that they were erased. It appears that the navigator was the last to die, and that he erased as many records as he could before doing so. Thalias theorizes that the Void Guide was working with their enemies, and didn't want anyone to know where they'd come from.

Che'ri's nightmare is very similar to one that Thalias had when she was younger: she was lost, but everyone just kept looking at her instead of talking or listening to her.
