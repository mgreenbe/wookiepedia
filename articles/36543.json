However, while flying a G-59 Cannibalizer above the moon Tilnes as a part of a routine patrol, he encountered an atmospheric disturbance and crash landed. However, his ship punctuated the crust of Tilnes and plumeted down, landing in a mineshaft deep beneath the surface. Fotrin was unable to extracate himself and could not activate his homing beacon because doing so would go against Order 1138. He recorded a short hologram and then died soon afterwards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Roughly ten years later, in about 31 BBY, the ship and Fotrin's body were discovered by the Heroes of Cularin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
