A renowned expert on aging and rejuvenation, Thorp headed research at Obroa-skai's Aurora Medical Facility, following stints at facilities of her own creation on Hijado and Enferm, and having traveled to many other planets in the Tingel Arm on medical missions. Parlay Thorp was a one-time owner of the Corellian YT-1300 freighter Millennium Falcon, which she used for her missions, after the previous owner Quip Fargil donated the ship to the doctor.
