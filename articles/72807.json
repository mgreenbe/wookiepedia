When the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems K'kur refused to report to the Jedi High Council and remained at the Almas Academy where he would die at the hands of Phylus Mon's raiders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike most Jedi of the era, K'kur studied at the Almas Academy in the Cularin system after being discovered to be Force-sensitive by recruiters of the Jedi Order's Acquisition Division. Eventually passing his Trials of Knighthood, K'kur went onto become a well respected Jedi Knight, known for his prowess with a lightsaber and his courage in battle. It was surprising to many then, when K'kur refused the Jedi High Council's call to arms at the outbreak of the Clone Wars. Invoking his Right of Denial in joining the Grand Army of the Republic, K'kur remained on Almas instead, answering only to the Academy's Council of Masters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While other Jedi died across the galaxy during the first year of war, K'kur was assigned to protect the ancient fortress of the long dead Sith Lord Darth Rivan. The fortress, long abandoned, had been captured by the Almas Jedi but had not been completely explored, and was in need of protection from assault by the dark side sect known as the Believers. Joined by five other Knights, K'kur was stationed at the south entrance of the fortress while a group of fourteen Jedi Researchers explored the interior of the complex. While K'kur was stationed there, a sandstorm swept across the landscape, surrounding the structure. Under cover of the sandstorm, the Dark Side Adept Phylus Mon led a group of his followers and a Force-sensitive Wampa against the fortress. Overpowered, K'kur and the other guards were slain and the fortress was open to the dark siders. Entering the structure, the raiders preformed a Sith ritual over several hours before leaving the fortress once more."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ignorant of the ritual, the researchers reported back to the Almas Council on the mysterious deaths of the guards, resulting in Master Lanius Qel-Bertuk organizing three search teams to investigate the fortress and find those responsible."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
