The dome is made of hand-painted resin and styrene with some metal adornments and elements that can illuminate and flash. The prop was intentionally tarnished in order to be in keeping with director George Lucas's \"used future\" aesthetic and also suffered additional wear from use during filming, requiring repair to the exterior.
