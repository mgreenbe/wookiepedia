The Wookiee Rock Council met at Council Rock in that year to discuss whether they should lend their fleet to the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances in its war against the breakaway Confederation. The Galactic Alliance's Galactic Alliance Fifth Fleet arrived in orbit and its tyrannical Chief of State Jacen Solo accused the Wookiees of harboring Jedi fugitives. When they denied the accusation, the Fifth Fleet began to bombard the planet in order to let them know that Solo did not approve of them dragging their toes. The Wookiee fleet fought back in the ensuing battle and were joined by several other Confederate fleets. The Galactic Alliance fled, and the Wookiees joined an informal Jedi Coalition."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
