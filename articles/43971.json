The obstacle had between five to seven vertical walls made of plasteel concrete, with openings allowing swoopchasers to pass through them. None of the openings were aligned, forcing the rider to pass though one and then decelerate or risking crashing into the next wall. Using thrusters, the rider would have to maneuver their swoop to pass through the next opening."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
