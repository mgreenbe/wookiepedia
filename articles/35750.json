The smugglers Platt Okeefe and Tru'eb Cholakk hid out within the crevasse after their escape from the slave lord Quintik Kahr. At the bottom of the gulch lay a bantha skeleton, which inspired them to give the fissure its name. The canyon was large enough to fit several freighters within, preventing them from being detected from the air; it also contained a number of large caverns. The native Jawas and Tusken Raiders kept clear of the area."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Okeefe and Tru'eb arranged to meet there around four months after the Battle of Yavin in order to exchange cargoes. However, Major Birket of the Imperial Security Bureau captured Cholakk and set a trap for Okeefe in the ravine.
