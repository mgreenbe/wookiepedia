Made from sgauru bones and covered with yorik coral, the talons were inserted into the body of a warrior who had proved himself in battle. They could be extended or contracted by a muscle movement. The placing of the talons was very dangerous, and few warriors actually survived the escalation. Those who did received even greater honor. The talons were included as part of the arsenal of the elite Slayers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Steng's talons take their name from Steng, the first of the warmasters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
