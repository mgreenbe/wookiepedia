Those clones received special naval training and many of them eventually became officers in the Republic Navy, although most of them were lower-tier commanders and aides to superior non-clone officers. Some of those officers believed that despite their training the clones were not suited for a role of an officer, which sometimes led to rising tensions aboard Galactic Republic ships. Although Grand Army of the Republic soldiers such as Rom Mohc had a high opinion of clones and relished working with them, others decided to avoid following Mohc's kindness. As a result, these naval officers had tense relationships with their superiors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known clone naval officers"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
