In 0 ABY, one of Jabba's Lieutenant/Legends, the Nimbanel accountant Mosep Binneed\u2014who occasionally traveled and worked under Jabba's name\u2014 flew the Voidraker to the desolate Outer Rim world of Orleon, where he had tracked a smuggler named Han Solo who owed his master a sizable debt. Binneed and the ship's crew cornered Solo's Millennium Falcon in a cave system, only for Solo's ship to escape by blasting through the cavern's roof. While this was occurring, the Voidraker was set upon by a massive swarm of stone mites, which threatened to chew through the entire ship. The stone mite infestation rendered the Voidraker unusable and killed the entire crew except for Binneed, who made his way to safety thanks to a lift from Solo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Voidraker first appeared in Star Wars 28, written by Archie Goodwin and released in 1979.
