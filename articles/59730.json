A common type of military harness, called a halter, consisted of a strap around the neck that left the shoulders and back bare. Such halters were frequently equipped with pockets to hold power packs and ammunition. While the Wookiees of Kashyyyk wore that type of gear chiefly in times of war, the male Calians of Shiva IV wore little else than ornated harnesses in all circumstances."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
