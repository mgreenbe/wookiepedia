Though he was not at the actual briefing (he was in fact in orbit above the planet it was held on), his presence seemed to fill the hall, anyway, from his projection in the holotank. After the briefing, he led a second attack on the Enforcer while it was being repaired at Phaylenn. His attack was extremely successful, not only destroying the Enforcer but the shipyards it was being repaired in also."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
