Many species made up the organization, including Humans, Wookiees, Zabraks, and Near-Humans. During the galaxy-wide conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Trade Federation attacked the miners, quickly crushing the far less militaristic organization. After their defeat, General Grievous allowed his battle droids to use the miners as target practice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 20 BBY, the Jedi Master B'dard Tone and Padawans Flynn Kybo and Codi Ty began to hunt down Grievous, determined to end the threat he posed to the galaxy. The leader of the Combine, Stellskard, heard the rumors of their mission and found Kybo on the planet Bryndar. He then brought the three Jedi to Banvhar Station, where the Jedi and the miners combined their resources in order to kill Grievous. They were able to find him in the Anoat system, on the moon of Belsus. The assassination mission quickly went awry, however, with Tone and Kybo being killed by Grievous in a duel, and the miners being overwhelmed with battle droids. Ty was able to rescue a group of Padawans who were fleeing from Grievous, and the miners fled the moon with the Padawans aboard their ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
