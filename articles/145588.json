As a Jedi Knight, he joined the Army of Light and fought in the Ruusan campaign, the final campaign of the war. Before the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, however, Tho'natu was assigned to Jedi Master Valenthyne Farfalla's gunship, the Fairwind, and thus survived the catastrophic detonation of a thought bomb, a deadly Force power that the Brotherhood of Darkness used in a failed attempt to destroy the Army of Light."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 990 BBY, ten years after the war, Tho'natu had been granted the rank of Jedi Master. In that year, a message drone was sent to the Jedi, alerting them to the presence of a helpless, grievously injured Sith Lord under the care of the healer Caleb on the planet Ambria. Realizing that this must refer to the Sith Lord after whom Lord Farfalla and four other Jedi had recently hunted on Tython\u2014a mission from which they did not return\u2014the Jedi High Council assembled a team led by Tho'natu, consisting of five other Jedi Masters and eight Jedi Knights. Aboard the Jedi cruiser Light of Truth, Thon'atu led the team to Ambria to arrest the Sith Lord. Upon arriving, Tho'natu and his team of Jedi found the brutally mutilated remains of Caleb's corpse outside the healer's hut.

Observing that Darovit had a missing hand and that he was in possession of a golden lightsaber identical to Farfalla's, Tho'natu assumed incorrectly that Darovit was the Sith Lord whom Farfalla and the others had hunted. He surmised that Darovit had killed them, but had been grievously injured and had gone to Caleb for help after driving himself insane by attempting to heal himself with the dark side. Tho'natu then assumed that Caleb had sent the message to the Jedi, but that Darovit had found out and killed the healer in retaliation. Mistakenly believing the Sith to finally be obliterated from the galaxy, Tho'natu and the other Jedi returned to the galactic capital of Coruscant, taking with them the stolen lightsabers, so that they could be kept in the Jedi Temple, as well as Caleb's remains, so that he could be given a proper funeral.
