The droids' remains were taken back to Theed to be scanned and reactivated without its photoreceptors. C-3PO tried to fish out any information about the droid's assignment on Naboo, as instructed by Padm\u00e9 Amidala, by telling him he was onboard a Separatist ship. The droid uttered something about a virus, specifically about a leak of a small amount from a secret laboratory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Threepio asked the droid more, the tactical droid realized that it wasn't on a Separatist ship at all. Typho put the droid at blasterpoint and said it would have to reveal information on the lab if it wished to survive. Jar Jar Binks, who was trying to catch a slug-beetle, got his tongue stuck on an R2 unit dome and knocked over some shelves, which toppled over and crushed the droid. However, Padm\u00e9 noticed the mud on the droid, recognizing it as mud from the Naboo swamp, which eventually led to the discovery of Vindi's laboratory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This T-series tactical droid was voiced by Phil LaMarr, who also voiced Admiral Trench's tactical droid later in the series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
