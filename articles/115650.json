On the Outer Rim planet Jelucan, such vehicles were commonly used in the years that followed the rise of the Galactic Empire. They were introduced to the world by Empire-backed merchants and were soon absorbed into the way of life of the Jelucani. Some wondered how they had lived without them. They almost completely replaced muunyaks as the primary mode of transportation for the Jelucani valley dwellers, although many of the creatures were still kept by their owners."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
