After Corona Squadron was permanently assigned to the MC80 Liberty Type Heavy Star Cruiser Liberty, the squadron began to fly recon missions. After a mission to the planet D'Qar, Smikes worked on his T-65B X-wing starfighter in the hangar. Shortly before the Battle of Endor the squadron embarked on a scouting mission in the Hudalla system. Smikes and the others tethered themselves to asteroids to hide and observe the Imperial fleet amassing in the system. However, the squadron was discovered, and after battling a patrol of four TIE/ln space superiority starfighters, including Ciena Ree and Nash Windrider, Smikes was shot down and killed as the rest of his squadron escaped to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Smikes was known to his fellow squadron members as wary, pessimistic, and constantly grumpy.
