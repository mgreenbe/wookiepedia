The weapon could exterminate organic matter without harming mechanical objects. Little did he know that Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, Aayla Secura, and the clones Bly and Rex were stranded on the planet and were looking for a ship. They managed to steal a shuttle from the base and they returned to a small Lurmen village to warn them about the Separatist weapon. Lok Durd attempted to destroy the Lurmen village with this weapon, but it was destroyed in the subsequent battle by Anakin Skywalker. He was then arrested by the Jedi along with his companion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mobile command center was also used as a basis for T-series tactical droid TZ-33's outpost on Felucia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
