Part of the Imperial-class line, the class served as successor to the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer.

Like its predecessor, the Imperial II-class measured 1,600 meters in length, was painted a light shade of gray, was wedge-shaped and had a raised bridge tower. However, it featured a communications tower between its two deflector shield generator domes, whereas standard ships of the Imperial I-class had a tractor beam targeting array in the same location. Imperial II-class Star Destroyers were powered by a solar ionization reactor located on the ventral hull."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Internal defenses were installed within the ship, consisting of stormtrooper helmet-sized exhaust ports built into at least one spacious room that emmitted fire capable of incapacitating armored troops. Near the meridian trenches at the side of the Star Destroyer located at least one airlock, and the vessel also contained at least one trash compactor connected with passageways large enough to transport stormtroopers into the waste facility."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Propulsion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ships of the class were propelled by three KDY Destroyer-I ion engines, and they also had four backup Cygnus Spaceworks Gemon-4 ion engines.

The ships carried with them seventy-two TIE line starfighters, eight Lambda-class T-4a shuttles, twenty All Terrain Armored Transports and thirty All Terrain Scout Transports, the latter two of which were transported to planetary surfaces by at least two Gozanti-class cruisers. All these vessels were stored in the ships' two large hangar bays, which were located side by side in the anterior wall of an indentation in the ventral hull."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "9,700 stormtroopers crewed the Star Destroyer, along with various other Imperial Military personnel such as TIE fighter pilots and Imperial officers.

The droid delivered a posthumous message from the Emperor, ordering the ship's captain, Lerr Duvat, to scour the planet Naboo using weather-altering satellites, as part of the Contingency's Operation: Cinder, an Imperial plan to ensure both the Empire and its enemies would fall following the Emperor's death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Assisted by Lieutenant Gulin, Duvat immediately set course for Naboo. Upon the Torment's arrival at the planet, he deployed the satellites in order to create massive storms across Naboo. However, a group of N-1 starfighters from Naboo, piloted by the rebels Shara Bey, Leia Organa and Sosha Soruna, attacked the satellites. In retaliation, the Star Destroyer's complement of TIE fighters was deployed to engage the attackers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just as the three starfighters were about to be destroyed by the TIEs, the Rebel Alliance arrived with the MC80 Star Cruiser Restoration and many starfighters including Danger Squadron, a squadron of X-wing starfighters led by Rebel veteran Shriv Suurgav and Imperial defectors Iden Versio and Del Meeko of Inferno Squad. Together with the Naboo starfighters, they destroyed the remainder of the satellites and the Torment, despite an attempt by the Star Destroyer to withdraw. Before its destruction, however, the Torment managed to deploy part of its planetary assault force, which briefly attacked Naboo's capital of Theed before being neutralized by an ion pulse from the Theed Royal Palace, and then captured."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Eleodie Maracavanya's find"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 5 ABY, three Imperial II-class Star Destroyers were part of the Imperial Navy, which fought in the Battle of Jakku against the New Republic, the Rebel Alliance's successor state.

Maracavanya deduced that the ships had come from Jakku, and ordered the destruction of the vessels, much to the surprise of crew member Carklin Ryoon. Maracavanya then elaborated on the decision to the Liberty's Misrule's crew, citing that the New Republic could grant the group some legitimacy if they destroyed the vessels, as it was likely they would appreciate the cleanup following their battle.
