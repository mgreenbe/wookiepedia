Jedi Master Revan and Mandalorian mercenary Canderous Ordo journeyed to the planet Rekkiad and joined Clan Ordo in the search. Revan led the clan into Clan Jendri's territory in search of the mask, and narrowed the location down to the one of the Twin Spears, a pair of columns of ice several kilometers tall, with flat plateaus on top.

They set up camp and were attacked the next morning. Outnumbering Clan Ordo two to one, Jendri's forces attacked their campsite while their Basilisk war droid pilots razed the battlefield from above, pinning down the invaders. Veela Ordo, Canderous' wife, led her clan into battle, while Revan deduced Clan Jendri's strategy and created a diversion using his lightsaber to attack the Jendri's Basilisks. His diversion allowed six Clan Ordo pilots, including Canderous, to make their way safely to their own Basilisk mounts. Revan managed to damage one of Jendri's Basilisks and slew the pilot when he flew back around to get a bead on the Jedi Master. During the distraction Canderous and five other pilots of Clan Ordo got their Basilisks into the air and proceeded to attack the remaining Jendri pilots. Quickly realizing that they were outnumbered the remaining Jendri pilots abandoned the battlefield and the battle was quickly turned into a rout. Some of the remaining Jendri troops broke rank soon after and the rest that remained were slaughtered by Clan Ordo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clan Ordo celebrated their victory late into the night, built a funeral pyre for the fallen honoring their memories through songs and a feast and grieved for their fallen comrades.

Veela revealed that she knew Revan's identity and pleaded to Ordo that he break his loyalty to Revan and reclaim his place in Clan Ordo as their leader, and his rightful place at her side. Ordo stated that he couldn't break his loyalty to Revan and pleaded to Veela and the others to stand down. With neither side backing down, Veela and her Mandalorians opened fire on Revan and Ordo.

After telling Ordo the story Revan told them that he didn't know the identify of the Sith nor what he was after, but he did know that the Sith knew the Mandalorian invasion would fail and that the war would destroy the warriors. Ordo speculated that if the Sith were planing another invasion, they would be forced to come through Mandalorian space first and that the Sith were trying to get rid of the Mandalorians. Revan agreed that it was possible but also mentioned that the Sith could have been trying to twist the beliefs and culture of the Mandalorians in hopes that they would join them. Revan then asked him to stay behind, become the new leader of the Mandalorians and protect the remaining Mandalorians and the Republic from the threat of the Sith.
