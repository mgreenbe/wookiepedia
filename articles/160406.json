Considered poor imitators of the Blue Dragon pirates, the Vermilion Birds had a couple hundred members, and had a smuggling ship as well as several starfighters at their disposal. Around 82 BBY, the Vermilion Birds raided the Nan family villa in the Lake asteroid field, plundering its properties and capturing the servants hired by the Nan family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the attack, the pirates encountered Mostema and Sean, two Jedi who were detained at the villa by the Heaven system authorities. While Master Mostema fought against the pirates to save innocent guests at the Nan family villa, Sean disguised himself as a member of the Vermilion Birds and escaped to the nearby forest, seeking a ship to escape the pirates and the system's authorities. However, with a blaster and several incendiary grenades, Sean attacked the pirates when he saw that they were about to kill innocents at the villa. With a vengeful horde of Vermilion Birds in pursuit, Sean fled to a starship parked far away from the villa, and came into the graces of the Knights of Silver Dawn. The Knights, led by Li Yu, welcomed Sean to their organization, preventing the Vermilion Birds from capturing him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
