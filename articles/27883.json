This infantry unit would enter an enemy ship and would either capture or critically damage essential systems on that ship. On boarding parties, they would be more reliable, due to their quick sharpshooting and automatic DC-15A blaster rifles, than a clone pilot armed with a blaster pistol. On some occasions, the marines would land a space transport in an enemy hangar and deploy from there or use jetpacks to fly through space and land on the ship itself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
