They were mainly used by governments for transporting prisoners, although a number of Incarcerators were used by criminals for the transport of slaves. Although the Incarcerators were heavily armed, they were slow and often relied on starfighters or frigates for protection. The Incarcerator was also excellent at repelling boarding attacks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most of an Incarcerator was devoted to prison cells of varying size and security, including minimum-security holding pens and thick-walled, heavily shielded isolation rooms with redundant protective measures. The hallways and cells were also equipped with cameras and sensor to monitor the inmates and guard stations featured weaponry designed to quell riots and stun or kill potential escapees."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
