Although Baron Fel promised him that he would get his squadrons and more to command if the Chiss committed against the Yuuzhan Vong, this did not come to pass. In the event, a single |squadron was deployed a few months before the Battle of Ebaq, which would remain Fel's command until the end of the war. This may have been one of the three squadrons from force Spike, but combat losses meant that, by the time of the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, it had been amalgamated with the Galactic Alliance X-wing unit Twin Suns Squadron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Jag Fel is referred to several times as Spike Lead, the name \"force Spike\" (so capitalized) is only used once in canon, in a line of dialogue by Grand Admiral Pellaeon in The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide: Ruin.
