Trapezoidal in shape and green in color, the mindwarper module created a field that caused a target within a twenty-meter area to fall unconscious, or become disorientated and confused, depending on their strength of will. The effect was similar to stun gas. Moff Kentor Sarne used a mindwarper module to delay soldiers from Page's Commandos during his flight from Kal'Shebbol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
