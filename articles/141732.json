Its body is a shapeless blob from which emenated dozens of thin, ribbon-like tentacles. Each of these tentacles were specialised: Some of its limbs conjured a bioluminescent, blinking light to bewitch passing fish, others stinged and some tentacles grasped, constricted and rended. The Tenticulon was able to regrow its lost appendages. With five tentacles it was capable of swallowing a humanoid whole but typically just preyed on the fish."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tenticulon was able to breathe underwater and is immune to heat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
