Torra reminds Kaz that this isn't a race, as she's just helping him test the Fireball's engines. Kaz points out that the ship may not start, and if it does turn into a race, he intends to win. Torra retorts that if it turns into a race, she'll win. They launch, and Tam Ryvora, watching, complains to Neeku Vozo about him letting \"her\" ship be taken out and flown again. Kaz follows Torra as they fly a twisting course before turning back in the direction of the platform. Torra tells him to pull up, since they're heading that way, but when Kaz tries to do so, the throttle handle breaks off in his hand, to his horror. The Fireball hurtles towards the repair shop hangar uncontrollably. Tam, realizing something is wrong, has to pull Neeku out of the way as he fails to realize the danger. Kaz manages to jam the broken handle onto the socket and gain enough control to bring the ship to a sliding stop, knocking over a rolling staircase. He pops out of the cockpit as an unhappy Tam approaches and announces that the ship is still in one piece, only to be proven wrong as the landing gear collapses, causing the cockpit canopy to collapse and knock Kaz down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
