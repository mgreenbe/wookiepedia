Many species had a pair of ears placed symmetrically on opposite sides of the head. Thanks to their bigger ears, some species like the rupings, Lanniks, and the Lasats had better hearing than humans. The Pau'ans of Utapau had hypersensitive hearing, and were forced to protect their fragile ears with special coverings. The ears of the Yuzzum were shaped like antennae.
