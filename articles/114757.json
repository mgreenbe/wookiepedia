Around 17 BBY, a bounty was placed on Resk, making him a target for bounty hunters. The bounty hunter and former Jedi Master A'Sharad Hett eventually tracked Resk to the planet Korriban, where both men were forced to the world's surface due to a storm. Resk fled from Hett and attempted to defend himself with his blasters but was disarmed by the former Jedi's lightsabers. As Hett cornered Resk, the latter threatened to inform the authorities of the former's status as an ex-Jedi, which prompted Hett to behead Resk to ensure his silence, as the bounty on Resk's head did not depend on whether he was living or deceased. After Resk's death, Hett, who had fallen to the dark side, discovered the ancient Sith Lord XoXaan's holocron, which taught the former Jedi Master the ways of the Sith over the next few years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Resk was a light-skinned man who wore jewelry in his brown hair and had brown eyes.
