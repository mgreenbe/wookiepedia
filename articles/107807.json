Organa insists that Verlaine join her and the former Royalist reluctantly agrees. While eating the boiled ruica, Organa sniffs the food, causing Verlaine to wonder if Organa likes ruica. Organa thinks back to a memory of her as a young girl on Alderaan, and of her adoptive father, Bail Organa, who urges young Leia to finish her ruica so she can grow big and strong.

Leia protests, saying she wants to be a queen of action, not of talking. As Bail takes her back home aboard a shuttle, he tells her that while a princess is sometimes able to think of herself, she must always be thinking of others. He reminds her of the way they trade for Ruica seeds and how Alderaan must continue to share its beauty and culture with the galaxy. \u201cWhatever happens, Leia,\u201d he tells her, \u201cyou must keep Alderaan alive.\u201d Back in the T-1 shuttle, Leia Organa sits alone at the table and quietly apologizes for failing her father."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile at Club Deeja in the Naboo city of Keren, the club's manager asks Uwa Pareece, the leader of the Melodic Order, to play in person.
