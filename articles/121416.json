The Naboo Resistance had joined forces with Borvo the Hutt, a smuggler operating out of the mountains, and together they planned an offensive against the invading Trade Federation forces. One of their victories was an infiltration of a Trade Federation slave camp using a captured gunboat to free Naboo civilians. After the mission was over, Borvo supplied transports while Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes of the resistance escorted the remaining civilians. As Sykes reached the rendezvous, the rest of his squadron told him his flight lead, Captain Kael, had been shot down, and Sykes raced off to find him. During the search, Sykes fought against Federation Single Trooper Aerial Platforms and Armored Assault Tanks. He reached a plasma mining camp and saved it from attacking tanks, but the mine's operator betrayed him, forcing Sykes to destroy the camp. One of Sykes' wingman, Lutin Hollis, then contacted Sykes to tell him he had found the Captain. Sykes fought through more Federation forces before reaching Kael, who, with his dying breath, revealed that Borvo had betrayed him and asked Sykes to rescue the civilians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After joining with the smuggler Borvo the Hutt and his organization during the Trade Federation's Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, several pilots of the planet Naboo's Bravo Squadron launched an offensive against the Trade Federation Droid Army. Upon the squadron liberating captured civilians from the Trade Federation, Borvo supplied transports for the squadron to pick up the civilians, though Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes was forced to escort a separate group.

Sykes had then no choice but to disable the rest of the camp, knocking out the turrets and the camp's plasma miners.
