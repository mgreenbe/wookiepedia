A horrifying vehicle capable of traveling underground, it was used during the Battle of Umbara, a conflict that occurred during the Clone Wars when Republic forces attacked Umbarans on their home planet who had sided with the Separatist Alliance. The IAT had a laser cannon on the back of each segment. During the Battle of Umbara, the IATs emerged from the ground and inflicted heavy casualties to the members of the 501st. The clones destroyed one of the crawlers using the RPS-6 rocket launcher by striking the front view port."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
