The Cerean Amin Galingal arrived at the Centre in 48 BBY and was believed never to have left it since then. He eventually became the director of the Centre and his books and essays became popular among the Tarasin, Cularin's native sentient species. In about 31 BBY, members of the Intarsa League, a criminal organization led by Dersa Welles, entered the Centre and took everyone inside it hostage. However, the Heroes of Cularin were able to aide in defeating the League and the hostages were freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Structure"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Centre consisted of a series of buildings, each on it's own island, in the middle of a lake. All the islands were linked together by bridges and the largest island was located in the center of the lake and was the site of the Centre's main building, the library. Another island was the site of a rock garden."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Curriculum"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The director of the Center was given the title Lector.

Most students produced written work, but their were some artists and craftsmen who also chose to study in the Centre. Some philosophically-minded Jedi Masters would advise their Padawan learners to visit the Centre and listen to a lecture there, or even spend a few days there. It became said among the Jedi that those who undertook while in the Centre the meditative exercises that were required to attune lightsaber crystals, would have a better chance of success in construction a lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Blue Star Centre made it's first and only appearance in Operation Blue Star, an adventure in the Law and Order arc of the Living Force campaign. It the adventure, it's name is spelt using the UK English spelling \"Centre\", rather than the US English spelling \"Center\", probably because it was written in the United Kingdom.
