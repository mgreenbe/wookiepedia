It had been occupied by the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War, but the natives drove the Empire out following the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY. In 5 ABY, the Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing carried out a string of genocides against worlds which had defied the Imperial loyalist faction. Shortly after the devastation of the planet Fedovoi End, the engineer Agias Rikton heard from other personnel that the next target was possibly Fikzwaa. When he discussed the possibility to Lieutenant Yrica Quell, he speculated that a base might have been established on the astronomical object since the Empire was thrown out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fikzwaa was mentioned in the 2021 novel Victory's Price, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
