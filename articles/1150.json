That year marked the Tho Yor Arrival\u2014the eight Tho Yor pyramid ships became active and traversed the galaxy, picking up Force-sensitive passengers of over a dozen species from many different worlds. The Tho Yor then traveled to the Deep Core world of Tython, where they gathered around the ninth and largest Tho Yor. The Tho Yor Arrival sparked an immense Force Storm, the strength of which would go unrivaled for almost ten thousand years, as Tython reacted to the presence of so many Force-sensitives. The Tho Yor then scattered themselves across Tython, and the pilgrims soon formed the Je'daii Order, a Force-using organization that strove to maintain balance between the light and dark sides of the Force in both themselves and the world around them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The novel Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void, which first named the Tho Yor Arrival, erroneously placed the event in the year 36,463 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
