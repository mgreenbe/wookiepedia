She and her family moved to Milvayne to escape the Rebellion on their homeworld. At the processing center where they had to stay, the family in the tent beside them disliked the smell of their pet qaberworm, Gurtyl. Because of this, the family reported Klam's family for several issues, including a speeder incident in Klam's father's past and a misplaced stamp on Klam's mother's papers. The Milvayne Authority threw Klam and her parents into the undercity, and both her parents died in the fall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
