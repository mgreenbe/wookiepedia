A task force of fifty Jedi Masters and Knights was sent to Kalee, and was able to stymie Grievous' efforts to claim total victory. The Republic blamed the Kaleesh for the war, likely due to their history of oppression, and imposed an embargo and harsh sanctions on the Kaleesh, yet this still did not garner enough sympathy for the Separatists to convince Qymaen to join their cause. The CIS was forced to arrange for a bomb to be placed aboard Qymaen's shuttle, which maimed him horribly. Combined with planted evidence that pointed toward the Republic as the source of the attack, this event finally swayed Qymaen to the Confederacy's side, and he agreed to lead their army, following his recovery from his transformation into the cyborg General Grievous."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Huk withdrew from the galactic stage for decades following the end of the Huk War.
