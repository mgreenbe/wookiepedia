Together with his droid I-5, Jax has eluded Vader time and again, all the while wreaking havoc against the Empire through the underground resistance on Coruscant. But now the Rebel's leader on the city-planet has been captured, and it's up to the Last Jedi to ride again...possibly for one final adventure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Back cover"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "KNIGHT OF RECKONING"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Order 66 has all but exterminated the Jedi. The few remaining who still wield the Force for good have been driven into exile or hiding. But not Jax Pavan, who's been steadily striking blows against the Empire\u2014as a lone guerrilla fighter and a valued partner of Whiplash, a secret Coruscant-based resistance group. Now he's taking on his most critical mission: transporting a valued Whiplash leader, targeted for assassination, from Coruscant to safety on a distant world. It's a risky move under any circumstances, but Jax and his trusted crew aboard the Far Ranger, including the irrepressible droid I-Five, are prepared to pit their combat skills and their vessel's firepower against all Imperial threats\u2014except the one Jax fears most. Reports have raced across the galaxy that the dark lord of the Sith has fallen in a duel to the death with a Rebel freedom fighter. But Jax discovers the chilling truth when he reaches out with the Force . . . only to touch the dark, unmistakable, and malignantly alive presence that is Darth Vader.

They make a stop on Toprawa, where Jax and Laranth meet with Aren Folee of the Antarian Rangers. After continuing their journey, the ship is assaulted by Imperials at the Twins. Darth Vader and several stormtroopers board the dying ship during the battle. Laranth is killed, Yimmon is taken, and I-Five is nearly destroyed.
