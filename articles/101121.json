Initially successful, Malgus' forces laid siege to Livien Magnus, the capital of Ord Radama, and after a week the city fell to them. However, the Sith forces were not subsequently resupplied and a few weeks later, the Republic sent a fleet to Ord Radama, to drive the Sith from the planet. The Republic ships decimated Malgus' fleet and during the engagement, a stricken Sith Harrower-class dreadnought plummeted into the atmosphere of Ord Radama and crashed into Livien Magnus, destroying the city and killing one hundred thousand of the world's inhabitants. The Sith subsequently abandoned Ord Radama and the city New Raido became the planet's new capital. However, in the aftermath of the attack, the Ord Radama natives struggled to survive, while the Republic did little to fortify the world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several months later, the Sith Emperor, the ruler of the Sith Empire, ordered Malgus to retake Ord Radama, and Malgus launched a fresh attack on the world.

However, General Xantus actually took his orders from the Imperial Intelligence Service, the true power behind the military on the world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under the Empire, the native Devlikks were forced into servitude and, in many instances, outright slavery. Relocated in the poorest areas of the planet to make way for Imperial housing, they lived in makeshift homes and horrible conditions. Many worked in the industrial sector or as servants for the local nobles. The Devlikks came to harbor a deep hatred of the Empire and began to form a small resistance movement under the leadership of Narralla. These rebels started to quietly gather intel for the Alliance, using their positions as servants to their advantage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the planet had a strong military presence and was protected by infrequent patrols of Imperial-class Star Destroyers and the Interdictor-class Star Destroyer Eternal Wrath.
