Qui-Gon Jinn dropped his lightsaber when he was impaled by Darth Maul, which deactivated. Anakin Skywalker was disarmed when he was riding on top of Zam Wesell's air speeder on Coruscant. His lightsaber deactivated and then was caught by Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan Kenobi dropped his lightsaber when he was fighting General Grievous on Utapau, which deactivated and fell to the ground.
