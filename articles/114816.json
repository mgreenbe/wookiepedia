However, when Trana accused the droid of being a proxy for a cowardly contestant, thereby questioning the droid's honor, the droid immediately kicked Trana mid-sentence through a fifteenth-story window. After a moment of silence, the other Mandalorians unanimously declared the droid Grand Champion, and also christened it \"the Defenestrator.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
