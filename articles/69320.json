During the time of the Clone Wars, the slicer Tiny F posted on the Cularin holonet node a message that detailed the contents of a Thaereian military memo that Tiny F claimed to have discovered, in which Jir Tramsig ordered Cularin-based Thaereian commanders to crush all resistance to them on the world.
