During the Imperial Era, Tibanna gas was mined to extinction by the Empire before they abandoned the planet. After the empire left, the native inhabitants discovered tuusah, a residue from mine runoff. Tuusah had medical properties that led to the establishment of a new industry, turning the planet into one of the largest spas in the galaxy. The capital city, Wish, was once known as Outpost 665. Despite having no solid ground, Ephemera was home to a species of felines, which had been tamed by a Rothkahar philosopher who later discovered that their excrement had healing properties due to high concentrations of tibanna gas being naturally processed into tussah."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the First Order/Resistance War, Poe Dameron visited Ephemera seeking to recruit the aid of Maz Kanata, who was relaxing at one of the planet's spas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
