In 0 ABY, shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Naarg attempted to defect from the partisans after seeing the futility of their cause, claiming to have information on where the remaining partisans were getting information from. Inferno Squad was sent to recover and extract Naarg from Tellik Four Station, but failed to do so because three other partisans carried out a suicide bombing, which killed Naarg. Despite this, Del Meeko's ID10 seeker droid managed to recover Naarg's intel on a datachip."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
