There, she worked at the Leafy Green tapcafe until the Jedi Tekli overheard two patrons at the establishment express suspicions that she was not Human. Recalling the Yuuzhan Vong ability to disguise themselves as Human using ooglith masquers, Tekli reported her suspicions during a meeting of the Jedi Order. Two Jedi, Jedi Master Mara Jade Skywalker and her nephew Anakin Solo, went to investigate the lead. Determining through their inability to sense her through the Force that she was indeed a Yuuzhan Vong saboteur, they confronted the Yuuzhan Vong and apprehended her after a fight. During the fight, Jade Skywalker and Solo discovered a way to kill the amphistaff creatures that the Yuuzhan Vong employed as weapons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "New Republic medics examined the captive Yuuzhan Vong in the hopes of learning more about the biology of the species. However, rather than allow the New Republic to learn anything more from her about her people, the Yuuzhan Vong killed herself at the first opportunity. The untimely death frustrated Jade Skywalker, who felt that it wasn't enough and she should have done better."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yuuzhan Vong had pale skin with bluish sacs below each eye and patchy black hair that grew in tufts across her skull. Her face had little flesh on it and one upper cheek was burned all almost through, forming a scar that revealed a cheekbone covered in jagged, healed fractures. The Yuuzhan Vong had tattoos shaped like concentric energy bursts across her forehead, and half of her body was tattooed with similar concentric designs meeting at a focal point that vaguely resembled a living creature. She had extendable claws protruding from the knuckles of each hand, formed from a parasitic Yuuzhan Vong creature embedded deep into the bone. Because she had fewer bone breaks and scars than the Domain Shai warriors scanned at Bimmiel, Jade Skywalker surmised she was a younger, low-ranking Yuuzhan Vong who was given undercover work to prove herself. Though female, according to the examinations performed by New Republic medics, the Yuuzhan Vong's ooglith masquer disguise had the appearance of a pale, Human male. The unnatural way she carried herself while wearing the masquer led some members of other species, including Rodians and Humans, to doubt that she was truly Human."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Yuuzhan Vong operative, she could fight using an amphistaff and other biological weaponry of her species, including blorash jelly.

This included pants and a belt from which she carried a pouch of blorash jelly.
