He was both an expert practitioner of Jedi mind tricks and illusions and a skilled diplomat and teacher. Following the Great Hyperspace Disaster, Poof was enlisted by Chancellor Lina Soh to help determine the cause of the incident and prevent it from happening again. After the seeming destruction of the Nihil marauders that had been manipulated into causing the disaster by Marchion Ro, he accompanied Soh to the opening of Starlight Beacon. Two centuries later, Poof witnessed the reemergence of the Jedi's ancient enemy, the Sith, and the discovery of the Chosen One, Anakin Skywalker, who was prophesied to bring balance to the Force.

A celebrated diplomat and teacher, he was among those summoned by Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh to Monument Plaza, a green space located on the Galactic Republic's capital world of Coruscant, in the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace Disaster. There, Poof informed the Chancellor that the Council did not believe the event was the result of direct action by Force users. While he clarified that the Jedi were not all-knowing, Poof asserted that there was no evidence of that being the case, a claim supported by fellow Council member Jora Malli. Soh assigned everyone present at the meeting, including Poof, to determine the cause of the disaster and prevent it from happening again. The Council then assigned Master Avar Kriss to lead the Jedi response to the Emergences, a series of events that occurred in the aftermath of the Great Disaster throughout the Outer Rim."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Poof was later present at a Council meeting to discuss Soh's request for the Jedi to work with the Republic Defense Coalition to hunt down and imprison or destroy the Nihil, a group of Outer Rim-based marauders that had been unknowingly manipulated into causing the Great Disaster by the Eye of the Nihil, Marchion Ro. Poof refuted fellow Council member Rana Kant's claim that the galaxy was far from being at war and expressed his belief that the Jedi were the guardians of two ideals that sometimes came into conflict: justice and peace. Ultimately, the Council voted to grant the Chancellor's request for Jedi aid. After the Nihil were believed destroyed with their defeat at the Battle of Kur, Poof accompanied Soh to the dedication of Starlight Beacon, a space station located in the center of the Outer Rim's dark zones to assist with navigation through the dangerous and difficult to navigate area of space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nearly a year afterwards, Poof participated by hologram in a High Council meeting after a devastating Nihil attack on the Republic Fair on Valo. When Grand Master Pra-Tre Veter noted that Master Kriss was engaged in battle against the Drengir on Miluta, Master Teri Rosason criticized her for thinking she could do what she wanted. Poof countered that Kriss was operating within the parameters the Council had afforded her, and Adampo added that she was acting in direct response to the Chancellor's request. The Quermian further commented that no one, including Kriss, had known what was occurring on Valo until the journalist Rhil Dairo had managed to get a distress signal out."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ontonthon Temple"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Poof was present when the Council discussed the outcome of Padawan Cere Junda's and Jedi Master Eno Cordova's mission to Nameel. The Council realized that Junda had been provoked during the battle and erupted chaos. As a result, the Council briefed the duo on their assignment to help the Daa Corporation explore a recently uncovered temple on the planet Ontotho. When Cordova asked if it was a Jedi temple, the Quermian explained that, while the temple was not thought to be Jedi in origin but Ontothon, they were being sent in place of a division of Republic troops that had been redirected to help with evacuations in the Bunka system when its star began to collapse."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Chosen One"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the Battle of Naboo in 32 BBY, by which point he was the most senior of the four Quermians enrolled in the order, Poof was in attendance when Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn came before the Council with news that the Sith, the ancient enemies of the Jedi Order, had resurfaced. He later observed Jedi Master Mace Windu evaluate the Force abilities of Anakin Skywalker, a nine-year-old boy from the planet Tatooine whom Jinn had discovered to be Force-sensitive and believed to be the Chosen One, a being who was prophesied to bring balance to the Force. Although the child was strong in the Force, the Council denied Skywalker entrance into the Order as they found his deep emotional attachments troubling and believed that he was too old for training. The Council reversed their decision, however, after Jinn was slain by the Sith Lord Darth Maul on Naboo, allowing Skywalker to become the Padawan of Jinn's former apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi, per Jinn's dying wish."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Death and legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Poof sat on the council until he perished on a mission shortly before the beginning of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY.

Around 12 BBY, shortly after the Battle of Fortress Vader, Darth Vader, Skywalker's Sith identity, entered a portal constructed by Darth Momin to resurrect his wife, Padm\u00e9 Amidala. While walking through visions, he encountered Poof along with many Jedi with their lightsabers ready to battle him.

Although his name was never spoken in The Phantom Menace, it was given in the film's credits. Poof was originally slated to reappear in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, but George Lucas was concerned that viewers would confuse him with the Kaminoans, a new species introduced in the film. As no new footage of the Jedi Council chambers were shot for Episode II, archive footage from Episode I was reused. In order to remove him from the film, Poof was digitally painted out of the footage and replaced by Coleman Trebor, a new Jedi Master designed for the movie."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to multiple sources, Poof died prior to the outbreak of the Clone Wars. Despite this, he later appeared as part of the Jedi Council in Jedi of the Republic \u2013 Mace Windu 5, a story that takes place during the aforementioned conflict.
