After seeing it fit, she picked up the bow, later using it on a mission to retrieve a tactical droid's head on the planet Corellia. She lost it while dueling with Rafa Martez but found it and used it to fight against police droids. She later tried using it to fend off Cad Bane after he shot Hunter, but was disarmed by the droid Todo 360 and captured by Bane. The bow was retrieved by Wrecker and returned to Omega after she was rescued."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
