Tantajoc V orbited a binary star and was completely uninhabited by sentients as of 3 ABY, although its harsh and humid forests teemed with dangerous predators. After fleeing a coup on nearby Velmor in 17 BBY, Velmorian crown prince Denid and his retainer Jedidiah crash-landed on Tantajoc V, where they survived for the next 20 years in a hostile environment. Rebel leaders Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker tracked Denid's distress signal to Tantajoc V in 3 ABY, finally rescuing him from his exile and returning him to Velmor to assume his throne."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tantajoc V first appeared in Star Wars 49, written by Mike W.
