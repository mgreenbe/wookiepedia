Ordering Shan and Conro to stand by while he handled the thieves, the commodore had his Star Destroyer release a pair of gravity mines, which would latch onto the Imperialis and prevent it from jumping to hyperspace.

The captains realized their mistake too late, and their ships were pulled together into a collision while the Imperialis fled the system.
