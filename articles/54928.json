She ordered them to watch after the child while she carried out a scheme against the Ewoks of Bright Tree Village. Queen Urgah, with the help of Umwak and a Dulok with an X on his belly, prepared and served glock to the baby to stem his insatiable appetite. The baby Phlog enjoyed the food; in fact, he seemed unable to get enough of it. The Duloks later captured the Ewoks Latara, Teebo, and Wicket Wystri Warrick and forced them to prepare the glock for the Phlog."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
