Set at odd angles, the corners between each facet of the pyramid appeared lop-sided. With a combination of magenta, apricot, mustard, aquamarine, turquoise, and lavender stone, each side was constructed with a different color, including the flattened altar at the top. The main and only entrance to the interior of the pyramid was the Key of the Overpeople to \"enter without entering.\" The Bearer of the Key was allowed to pass through the pyramid's walls if he properly inserted the Key into the Great Lock. When the pyramid thought the Bearer was ready, it led them to a downward-spiralling tunnel upon which the history of the Rafa system was etched. The history passed through the early days of the Sharu until it opened into The Hall, the repository of the Mindharp. The remainder of the Sharu history was depicted on the walls in this room, and any individual who tried to acquire the Mindharp would have to view the remainder of the exhibits before reaching it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 BBY, when Lando Calrissian, Vuffi Raa, and Mohs entered the pyramid, Calrissian was reduced in size when he approached the Mindharp. Mohs the High Singer, was blinded by the pyramid's power, allowing him to \"see\" beyond mortal knowledge. When Lando and Vuffi Raa returned with the Mindharp, they were surprised to learn that they had spent nearly four months inside the Great Pyramid, a stretch of time that seemed to them to last just a few hours."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
