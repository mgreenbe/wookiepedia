Once written, the inscribing would never fade away, and could only be seen, read, altered, or erased by someone trained in the White Current. Conversely, the ability also allowed another to sense if scribing is present on an object, as well as where scribing would be on any given object."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
