The Federation had initially hired mercenaries to protect itself, but it moved to using battle droids for their cheap price, their lack of a need for food or living quarters, and the fact that droids would not rebel against them over working conditions. By 32 BBY, the Galactic Senate had passed legislation, Prop 31-814D, that forced the Trade Federation to pay taxes in the previously untaxed Free Trade Zones. As a result, the Trade Federation decided to retaliate by blockading the Mid Rim world of Naboo and force the people of Naboo to sign a treaty legitimizing the military operations."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Invasion of Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seeking to settle the trade dispute, Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, Finis Valorum, sent an envoy to the blockade.
