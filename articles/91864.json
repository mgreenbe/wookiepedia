Unbeknownst to Mitth'urf'ianico, the Aristocra tasked with recruiting Vurawn, Vurawn was to be rematched into the Mitth family at the personal request of Patriarch Mitth'oor'akiord himself. When Vurawn, now Thrawn, was a cadet, Patriarch Thooraki also insisted on recruiting former sky-walker Al'iastov into the Mitth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the waning days of the Clone Wars, the Mitth family was competing against the Ufsa family to establish a mining operation on Thearterra.  At this time, the Mitth family was led by Patriarch Mitth'oor'akiord, who took great interest in recruiting and adopting promising Chiss into the Mitth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Patriarch Thooraki was present at the Mitth family homestead when Mitth'ali'astov undertook her Trials, and personally congratulated the caregiver as a Trial-born of the Mitth. When she had nearly climbed the mountain marking the end of the Trials, Thalias encountered an old man whose skin was pale with age. Gathered about the mountain's summit were memorial staves memorializing deceased Syndics, Speakers, and Patriarchs of the Mitth; their accomplishments, and those they recruited and/or elevated within the family. The elderly man asked the caregiver her opinion on a particular memorial staff adorned with many smaller staves nearby, to which she responded that it was impressive. The elder laughed and responded that such displays were only impressive to those impressed by pure numbers, and that quality of recruits was more important than quantity. At that point, Thalias recognized the elder as Patriarch Thooraki. The Patriarch told the caregiver that Thrawn would someday be his crowning jewel, and Thrawn's staff would stand next to Thooraki's own adorned walking stick on that mountain one day. He told Thalias that he personally arranged for both Thrawn and her to be rematched into the Mitth family, and asked Thalias to look after Thrawn and protect the officer from enemies within the Ascendancy, and possibly the Mitth family itself. Thooraki worried that an enemy of Thrawn might try to succeed him as Patriarch once he died."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Indeed, Thrawn had enemies within the Mitth. Syndic Prime Mitth'urf'ianico, the very Aristocra who recruited Vurawn to the Mitth from Rentor, had a vendetta against Thrawn. Working with Irizi family Syndic Zistalmu, Syndic Thurfian plotted to sabotage Thrawn's career. During his official duties in the Syndicure, Thurfian sought to advance Mitth interests but also sabotage Thrawn. Thurfian was promoted to Syndic Prime by ingratiating himself to the political establishment of the Mitth family and the Syndicure, and had an eye on the Speakership, then held by Mitth'ykl'omi. During the Nikardun campaigns, Syndic Prime Thurfian arranged to send Mitth family spies to learn the secrets of the Great Stybla family, renowned as merchants and shippers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon the passing of Patriarch Thooraki, Syndic Prime Thurfian was chosen by the Patriels and Speaker as his successor. Thurfian had not even set his sights on the Office of the Patriarch, and believed that perhaps Speaker Thyklo may have succeeded Thooraki. Nevertheless, Patriarch Mitth'urf'ianico was highly pleased with his new role and powers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
