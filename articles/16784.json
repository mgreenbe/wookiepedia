At its center was Sanctum Sanctorum, a modified A4 Juggernaut used by Erethen as a research lab. To keep its precious cargo safe, Arakyd referred to the ship only by a variable codename and kept it mobile across the Mid Rim. While under the codename Bloodhawk, the Bhishana Bhaga's hyperdrive failed, dropping the ship into an asteroid field. The battered corvette crashed on nearby Krykas V, spreading its wreckage across 300 meters before resting in a valley."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
