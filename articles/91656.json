After a daring rescue operation to retrieve the Bothans on their return, the Alliance discovered enough information to begin their plans. Key to the strategy was obtaining the necessary codes to enter the Endor system, fortunately for them, the Alliance had learned of an Imperial shuttle that carried the codes they needed. They set in motion an audacious plan to steal the shuttle from a heavily guarded Imperial outpost"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The starship tasked with this dangerous operation was the Mon Calamari Cruiser Liberty, who had among her ranks a pilot whose talents were perfect for the operation.

Before he could enter the system itself, Ace had to pass through the Imperial Customs Golan III station at the edge of the system. After transmitting a false ship's manifest that the Alliance had provided, there followed an agonizing wait as the manifest was verified, all the while Ace had to use all of his piloting ability to avoid getting to close to the patrolling TIE/LN starfighters while \"remaining casual.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the Sabra was given clearance to proceed.

Again, Ace found himself having to avoid the Imperial fighters as he made his way to Outpost 327's hangar, where the Tydirium was docked. Ace succeeded, despite a near fatal mistake by the facility's commander, who failed to recognize the Sabra on his roster for several minutes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mission was further complicated by events after Sabra docked. The commando team was slow in getting the Tydirium ready for launch, causing Sabra to be docked far longer than Fiery Dawn, the next freighter of schedule was happy with, this caused Ace's co-pilot, Emkay, considerable consternation as he made excuses in an attempt to keep the command center sending a team down. Just as the commandos were finished, the outpost's commander sent out and order to seize and detain the Sabra. Their time up, Ace blasted his way out of the hangar and called in Rogue Squadron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE Fighters swarmed the Rebels, in an attempt to stop them.
