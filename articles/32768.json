Each dart was six centimeters long and two millimeters wide, and was loaded with a neurotoxin that affected most sentient species. A target hit by a dart first suffered the ill effects of the impact and then was affected by the poison, which commonly caused a non-lethal, ten-minute paralysis. Particularly massive or resilient beings were known to be more resistant to this. Specialized toxins for specific species were available to focus the intensity of the neurotoxin onto a particular species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In use during the Galactic Civil War, the Neural Inhibitor was sometimes mistaken for a common blaster. It found widespread use among bounty hunters, particularly after it was used by hunter Merrck Nall. Before 4 ABY, the Neural Inhibitor was used by many bounty hunters including Chenlambec the Wookiee, Yarr Gatonne, Saras Krenin of House Benelex, Sabran of House Paramexor, Merrck Nall's son Gradress Nall of House Salaktori, and Sirenas Firil."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A number of pirates including as Captain Rislar also used this technology as a means to knock down enemies without killing them.

The Inhibitor is listed in the gear of several notable hunters in chapter six of Galaxy Guide 10 and in the adventure Two for the Price of One, with abbreviated stats that consistently specify that it causes only five dice of stun damage. Chapter seven also specifies that shooting the Inhibitor used either the Dexterity attribute or a little-used specialized skill in firearms, one that none of the notable hunters owning the Inhibitor had."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
