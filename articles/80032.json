At the Praxeum, Le'Ung was one of the Jedi who oversaw the training of Jedi apprentices Jacen, Jaina, and Anakin Solo. Le'Ung was present when leading Jedi Master Luke Skywalker brought Prince Finn Galfridian to the Praxeum to be trained as a Jedi after Galfridian's homeworld of Artorias was subjugated by the Yuuzhan Vong."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Galfridian and some of his fellow apprentices encountered a Tuk'ata\u2014an ancient Sith creature\u2014in Yavin 4's jungle, Le'Ung, Skywalker, and Master Kyp Durron discussed Galfridian's future as a Jedi. Their discussion was interrupted, however, by news of a Yuuzhan Vong attack on the planet Rychel and a request for the Jedi to aid in the evacuation of the world. Leaving Durron behind to watch over the Praxeum, Skywalker and Le'Ung left to lead the mission, taking Galfridian with them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While en route to Rychel, Le'Ung briefed the Jedi team on their mission objectives and the current situation from onboard one of the New Republic fleet's Bulwark-class battle cruisers.

With Galfridian at his side, Le'Ung led the troops against the coufee-armed Chazrach slave warriors and siege creatures fighting for the Yuuzhan Vong, while air support in the form of T-65XJ X-wing starfighters assaulted the creatures from the sky.

The Pau'an raised his lightsaber in the air and called for his troops to hold, knowing the refugees needed more time. Just at that moment, however, he was stabbed from behind by a Yuuzhan Vong warrior wielding an amphistaff.

When the evacuation ships left, Galfridian wanted to return for Le'Ung, but Skywalker told the young man the Pau'an was gone.

During the discussion, the Pau'an revealed that he was uncomfortable with the Jedi being seen as weapons, unlike his contemporary Kyp Durron.
