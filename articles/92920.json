In the wake of the Great Galactic War and the resurgence of the Sith Empire, Moracen studied on the ancestral Jedi homeworld Tython with the rest of the Order during the Cold War, residing at the Temple there. During her training, Moracen fell in love with fellow apprentice, Spanios, as both were regularly assigned to work with each other. Developing a strong bond with each other, they discovered a rare lightsaber crystal amidst the ruins of the ancient fortress city of Kaleth.
