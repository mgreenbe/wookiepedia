Composed of approximately six squadrons, the 233rd was stationed on the Outer Rim planet Ord Biniir in 0 BBY. That same year, Ord Biniir was attacked by a large number of Rebel BTL Y-wing starfighters in the First Battle of Ord Biniir. The 233rd attempted to defend the planet, but the Rebel Y-wings easily defeated the fighter wing, securing Ord Biniir for the Rebel Alliance. Although many Rebel pilot veterans of the battle later bragged about their drubbing of the 233rd at Ord Biniir, the planet was soon retaken by the Empire in the Second Battle of Ord Biniir."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 233rd was first mentioned in the twenty-fifth issue of the Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron comic series, The Making of Baron Fel, released in 1997.
