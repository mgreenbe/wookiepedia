They were identified by big, black eyes, six legs that possessed claws, large ears, spines on its back, and antennae.

However, the droid manning the baggage check, G2-9T, quarantined the luggage containing the creature, as animals weren't allowed on Star Tours flights."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The creature appeared in earlier versions of Star Tours: The Adventures Continue. The creature was actually supposed to be Stitch from the Disney-created franchise Lilo and Stitch, an advanced extraterrestrial and advanced research project that accidentally crashed-landed on Earth (Hawaii, more specifically) and eventually befriended a human girl named Lilo. Coincidentally, it was initially mistaken for a dog and kept as a pet when Lilo first met it. In later versions, it was replaced by Figment, the draconian mascot for the Epcot ride Journey into Imagination."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
