The Corrupter's first target in this campaign was to destroy a colony on Halanit. The ship's TIE/sa bombers conducted an orbital bombardment using thermal detonators and proton bombs to melt the glacier and open a hole in the colony's roof. TIE interceptors and stormtroopers then attacked the colony in order to kill its people."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Corrupter would, however, meet her end at the Graveyard. With the aid of the Immobilizer 418 cruiser Aggregator, the Corrupter's captain thought that he had the Rogues in an inescapable trap\u2014until the sudden appearance of the Valiant, which attacked the unshielded portion of the destroyer. After suffering a considerable amount of damage from the squadron and the Alderaanian war cruiser, a pair of proton torpedoes fired by Wedge Antilles struck the bridge, killing Captain Convarion. The leaderless capital ship was soon abandoned. The Rogues and smugglers were unable to salvage the Corrupter, and it was destroyed by the Graveyard's asteroids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
