When detonated, the dazer unleashed a brilliant display of lights and other sensory disruptions that deadened a Killik's aura and cut off a Killik's ability to commune with the rest of its hive. Many Jedi observed that dazers gave off a smell like freshly-cut pallies when they exploded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
