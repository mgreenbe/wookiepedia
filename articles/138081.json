Millions of system cells were deployed by Imperial Intelligence, existing on virtually every habitable world in the galaxy, and even those uninhabited worlds with strategic or tactical value. System cells were generally staffed by between four and twenty personnel, although the number could range for one individual to a hundred. Personnel was often recruited from the planet on which it was based, with off-world training a rarity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Systems cells were isolated from one another, with all communications coming directly from the command structure above them.
