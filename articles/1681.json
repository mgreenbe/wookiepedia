Made by Merr-Sonn Munitions, the 57C recorded holographic images of its targets and had 360-degree coverage of the target area. While the scanners recorded excellent images, they were vulnerable to the blaster shots sent at them by Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Chewbacca as their screens exploded upon being hit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The components of the 57C included an audio pickup, motion sensor, signal transmitter, data relays, visual scanner, audio matrix, and screen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
