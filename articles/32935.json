They were used by regular Stormtroopers and Heavy Weapons Stormtrooper of the Galactic Empire, as well as by the bounty hunter Dengar, and some heavy troopers of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. It featured a high rate of fire and could deal heavy damage at long ranges, and was most commonly used for pinning down troops and eliminating large groups of enemies. There existed two variations of the DLT-19, the DLT-19x targeting blaster and the DLT-19D heavy blaster rifle. The DLT-19 wielded by the LOM-series bounty hunter 4-LOM was capable of firing electromagnetic pulses as well as standard blaster shots. Zuckuss, a Gand bounty hunter and partner to 4-LOM, occasionally used the DLT-19 as a sniper rifle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The DLT-19 heavy blaster rifle was based on the MG 34."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
