In the year 34 ABY, he was managing a Hazard Toss table in the casino where Count Sosear Latta scored a perfect cross-cap, which earned a cheer from a crowd of humans watching. Stee watched Latta closely as he played to ensure the count was not cheating, but believed he was playing cleanly. The croupier wore a green waistcoat with yellow patterning in casino livery over a white shirt with a red shimmersilk cumberbund, as well as black pants with red and yellow patterning and a black hat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Karlus Stee first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, which was released on December 15, 2017.
