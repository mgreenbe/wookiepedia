Before he took a criminal's path, Teska was a respected scientist in the Techno Union. However, an accident with his pressure suit left Teska disfigured and forced him to leave the Union. With the help of his knowledge in the field of cybernetics, Teska rebuilt his pressure suit, equipping it with a variety of weapons, and became a gun-for-hire. All the while, Teska continued his own experiments with gravity and began construction of the gravitic polarization beam, a superweapon with enough firepower to collapse a star. Teska's experiments soon attracted the attention of Count Dooku, the leader of the Confederacy. During the Clone Wars, Teska came into Dooku's service and was provided with a laboratory on the planet Behpour in the Naboo system, where the Skakoan continued the development of his weapon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 22 BBY, the gravitic beam was complete, and its integral part, the Gravitic Core, was to be delivered to Behpour on a Munificent-class star frigate.

When the Republic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala arrived on the planet, investigating rumors of a Separatist presence in the system, Teska captured the Senator and held her hostage. Soon, following a message delivered by Amidala, the Republic forces assaulted Behpour. Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano infiltrated the base, rescued Amidala and engaged Teska in battle in the gravitic polarization beam's core room, while the beam itself built up its power to collapse the Naboo star.

However, an accident occurred with his pressure suit, which left his body damaged beyond repair. Ashamed of his disfigurement, Teska left the Union to focus on his personal experiments with gravity and began developing the gravitic polarization beam, a powerful superweapon capable of collapsing a star. In addition to his research, Teska\u2014using his knowledge of cybernetics\u2014rebuilt his suit, equipping it with a vast array of weapons, and became a mercenary, in order to gain credits for funding his research.

In 22 BBY, the gravitic polarization beam was finished and ready for testing, and two duplicates of its crucial part, the Gravitic Core, were to be delivered to Behpour on a Munificent-class star frigate. However, Teska's rival Cad Bane infiltrated the frigate in orbit over the planet Alzoc III and stole one of the crates containing the Core. To cover his tracks, the bounty hunter made the other crate explode, destroying the starship that was carrying it; the frigate crashed on Alzoc III and created a gravitational anomaly. In order to recover the stolen part, Teska devised a plan to trace the Core by the unique energy signature it radiated. To that end, the Skakoan initiated an attack on the Republic space station Juma 9, which possessed a powerful radar suited for such a purpose. Separatist droid forces under Teska's command fought against clone troopers stationed at Juma 9, and the scientist also had the entire station, including escape pods, rigged with explosives. As the battle continued, he himself infiltrated the station's communications room and initiated a radar search for the Core. Teska soon discovered that the Core was located on the planet Ryloth, where the remnants of the local Separatist army were still fighting the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teska contacted Dooku, requesting the remaining droid forces on Ryloth to distract the Republic long enough for him to retrieve the weapon core. As the Skakoan scientist prepared to leave, however, he was confronted by Plo Koon and Obi-Wan Kenobi, two Jedi Masters who happened to be at the station at the time of the Separatist attack. Igniting their lightsabers, Kenobi and Koon told Teska that they were placing him under arrest, but he ordered them not to move and demonstrated his remote detonator that was linked to the explosives. The Jedi complied and lowered their weapons, but Teska\u2014stating that they were \"no fun\"\u2014triggered the explosives anyway and fled farther into the station with his rocket boosters, saluting his adversaries in mid-air. Eventually, Kenobi and Koon caught up with Teska, cornered him inside one of the station's chambers, and sealed the only door to prevent him from escaping. The Skakoan was unwilling to give up easily and once again brandished his detonator, threatening to destroy the escape pods, which the clone troopers were using to escape from the exploding station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that moment, however, Teska's attention was distracted by the sound of an explosion, which allowed Kenobi to Force-push the detonator out of the Skakoan's hands.

After a lengthy battle, Teska was defeated and thrown into a glass window; the glass shattered and broke, leaving Juma 9 open to the vacuum of space. He was almost sucked out of the station but was able to cling onto the edge with his hand. The vacuum also moved Teska's fallen remote detonator, and it flew toward him. The Skakoan tried to reach for it, but Kenobi threw his lightsaber at the detonator, slicing it in half. Koon then threw his own weapon at a nearby control panel, and an emergency blast door came down; Teska let go of his grasp and was sucked outside the station. His suit allowed him to survive the vacuum, and he veered off toward Ryloth, leaving Kenobi and Plo Koon stranded on the station without their weapons, which had also been sucked outside."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Reclaiming the Core"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Ryloth, Teska found the Gravitic Core still in the possession of Cad Bane, who had been taken into custody by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano.

Teska ambushed them, emerging from a pile of wreckage surrounding Bane's starship and, after exchanging insults with the Duros, ordered him to return the Core. Teska then gripped the crate containing the Core with his built-in grappling hook and pulled it over to him.

At that moment, two clone troopers, CS-2207 and CT-7567, arrived and engaged the Skakoan. After a shootout with the clones, Teska decided that it was time to retreat and activated the force field; the field began to shrink, threatening to crush the two Jedi inside. Teska then gave the clones a choice: they could either pursue him or rescue Skywalker and Tano. The clones chose the latter option, and the scientist boarded the Sleight of Hand, leaving Ryloth and making his way to Behpour, where he planned to use the gravitic beam to collapse the Naboo star.

Skywalker seemingly complied and went to Teska, who had tied Amidala in the gravitic beam's core room and was keeping her hanging from the roof there. When Skywalker arrived, the Skakoan ordered him to surrender his lightsaber\u2014which Teska wanted to study\u2014and told the Jedi not to use any \"tricks.\" After Skywalker gave him his weapon, Teska placed it on his belt and proceeded to tell Skywalker that he considered his surrender to be an act of cowardice. He told the Jedi that he would normally suspect a trick, but in Teska's opinion, Skywalker was out of options this time.

As a mercenary, Teska was known for his ruthlessness and excessive methods, which put him in direct competition with the likes of fellow bounty hunter Cad Bane. Teska was also often times arrogant and had a brash attitude with a short fuse. He was not intimidated by anyone and believed no foe, clone, or Jedi could match his strength. He often stated that he was unbeatable and considered Cad Bane's attempt to steal the Gravitic Core from him foolish. During battle, Teska often taunted his opponents, stating that their cause was hopeless and that they would soon be dead, as well as diminishing the Jedi's skills with the Force and their faith in the Republic Clone Army. He was self-confident, believing that Skywalker was out of options on Behpour. The Skakoan considered Skywalker's surrender to be a display of cowardice, only to find out that the Jedi had in fact tricked him.This traits caused him to be overconfident in his and the Confederacy's superiority and not on rare occassion to boast on his skills as both a gun-for-hire and a scientist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If an opponent gained the upper hand over Teska, he did admit to his enemy's prowess to a certain extent.

Teska's right arm was outfitted with a rotary quad blaster cannon and a grappling hook. Two rocket launchers were mounted on the suit's shoulders, along with concealed blasters, and a powerful laser beam weapon was located in its chest. Teska was also capable of creating a shockwave that threw all opponents off of him. The defensive systems of the suit included a shield generator, which created an energy shield, protecting Teska from enemy fire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Teska was capable of quickly fixing it even during battle, the suit was prone to malfunction. The boosters in particular were not very reliable, as they malfunctioned when Bane fired at them. In addition to those built into his suit, Teska also used other mechanisms. During the battle on Juma 9, he made use of explosives, which he had planted throughout the station.

According to the game's assistant producer, Chris Lee, the creation of Teska's character was a collaborative effort between Krome Studios, LucasArts, and Lucasfilm Animation and was aimed at creating a unique and intriguing new villain for The Clone Wars universe. The production team envisioned Teska as a classic villain, albeit the one with his own reasons. The developers hoped to create a character that players could love and hate at the same time, a character surrounded by mystery that would draw interest in finding out more about him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teska's fight against Skywalker, Tano, and the clones on Ryloth is omitted from the PlayStation Portable version of the game, as Teska retreats aboard the Sleight of Hand right after Skywalker throws the Gravitic Core there.
