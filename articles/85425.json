Her son was a Force-sensitive, and he was to become a member of the Jedi Order once he was old enough. After a Jedi holocron containing the names of Force-sensitive children was stolen from the Jedi Temple by the bounty hunter Cad Bane, her son became a target to the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Sidious sent Bane to Rodia to retrieve Dunn's son, intending to make him a member of an army of dark side warriors created to destroy the Jedi. Disguised as a Jedi, Bane traveled to Rodia and convinced Dunn to hand her son to him by hypnotizing her. Later, when the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi came to her home looking for Bane, she realized her mistake as Bane was seen escaping the planet. Eventually her son was rescued by the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his padawan Ahsoka Tano."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
