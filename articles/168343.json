When Surik and her companions arrived on Nar Shaddaa, G0-T0 instructed the bounty hunters not to touch her while she was on the moon. After the Exile was trapped and imprisoned by G0-T0's forces, the hunters considered the truce finished and began their hunt for her. Three of the Zhug brothers, including their leader Azanti Zhug, pursued Surik's companions on the landing pad of their freighter, the Ebon Hawk, and all three Zhugs were killed during an exchange of fire. Soon after, eight Zhug brothers attacked the Jedi in the Visionary, where G0-T0 had brought her, with a similar outcome.

In 3951 BBY, the former Jedi Knight Meetra Surik\u2014known as the Jedi Exile\u2014arrived on the \"Smuggler's Moon,\" and soon after met former bounty hunter and Bounty Hunters' Guild leader Vossk. He warned the Exile of the bounty hunters on the moon trying to collect the bounty on her head, with the Zhugs being among the most prominent. Meanwhile, G0-T0 had invited all bounty hunters on the moon to his yacht, the Visionary, where he clearly expressed that the Jedi Exile was not to be harmed while she was on Nar Shaddaa. When they heard of this restriction, the Zhug brothers' representatives loudly proclaimed G0-T0 as being mad for not allowing them to hunt her when she was so close."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually Surik went to meet with Visquis, a Quarren who acted as the head of G0-T0's operations on the moon, in order to discuss the bounty; however, she was taken prisoner instead. The bounty hunters considered this to be the end of the truce, and when G0-T0 brought the now imprisoned Surik to the Visionary, three of the Zhug brothers pursued the Jedi Exile's companions\u2014the Zabrak Bao-Dur; the former Jedi Master Kreia; the Ebon Hawk's pilot, Atton Rand; and the Echani handmaiden Brianna\u2014at the landing pad of their freighter, the Ebon Hawk. Instead of ambushing them, the Zhug brothers decided to issue ultimatums and threats, which Surik's companions considered unwise. The three hunters, including leader Azanti Zhug, were dispatched in the following short, decisive exchange of fire, but none of Surik's comrades were killed. After the fight, two of Jedi Exile's companions infiltrated the Visionary in an attempt to rescue her.

Arriving in the Japrael system, they encountered an Onderonian blockade above the planet, and as they tried to approach the spaceport of Iziz, the capital city of planet Onderon, they were stopped in space by the planet's fleet. Soon after the arrival of Surik and the Zhug brothers, the ships in the blockade opened fire, and both the Heraklon-class transport ship of the Zhug brothers and the Jedi Exile's Ebon Hawk were forced to land after taking damage from the separatist forces in the opening space battle of the Onderon Civil War. After crash-landing their ship, two surviving Zhug brothers led by Dezanti Zhug confronted Surik in the jungles of the moon. They attempted to claim the Exile's bounty, stating that they would not fail to fulfill their part of the deal like Azanti and the other \"brothers\" had before.
