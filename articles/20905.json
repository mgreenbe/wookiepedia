While speaking with Commandant Brendol Hux, Hux's son Armitage was ordered to serve them drinks, but dropped the tray. Both Admiral Brooks and Commandant Hux scolded Armitage for his failure. Brooks later served as an admiral in the First Order, ranking below Armitage Hux, who had risen to the rank of General. When a shuttle transporting General Hux and Kylo Ren was sabotaged, Hux traced the attack to a radar technician working under Brooks, confronting the admiral.
