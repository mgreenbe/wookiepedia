It was heavily armed, carrying a rocket launcher, blaster cannons, a grenade launcher and a flamethrower within its blocky chassis. They were primarily used for facility defense against intruders, and although it gave an impressive first impression, the droid was ineffective against Jedi because of its sluggish reaction time and slow movement. After it had reactivated, the Jedi Exile and her party defeated such a droid that had laired within the hangar bay of the abandoned Telosian Military Base that resided underneath Restoration Zone RZ-0031 on the surface of Telos IV."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is unknown whether these units ever saw action in any other context, or if this was a prototype or experimental model of droid tank."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
