Worried the powerful Hutt would mount another attack, the gang bought another construction droid and built an alloy refinery and an alloy depot. They were then asked to aid the Empire in attacking a Tusken Raider camp, and offered the opportunity to ally with the Imperials. The Alliance also contacted the mercenaries and asked for their aid in recovering medical supplies from a Hutt Cartel den on the planet Dandoran, also earning them an offer of allegiance from the Rebels. While the mercenaries were off-world aiding the Alliance, Jabba's men destroyed their homestead in vengeance for the outlaws deaths. Realizing they couldn't face Jabba alone the gang then chose to accept the Rebellions's offer.. The mercenary gang would later work with Jabba and Fortuna in order to obtain intel on the Empire; however, the arrangement eventually broke down and conflict between Saponza's men and the Hutt's errupted once more."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack first appeared in Star Wars: Commander, a mobile strategy game released in 2014 by Disney Interactive.
