To deal with this grave threat, Jedi Master Mace Windu dispatched his new Padawan, Echuu Shen-Jon, Naat Reath, and a battalion of clone troopers to recapture Mount Corvast, the prime energy collection facility on Sarapin.

There, he seized a Trade Federation facility on one of the moons of Krant, which was to be used as a staging ground for his invasion of the planet. However, Naat Reath was captured by Tann, and Shen-Jon began to descend further into the darkness that had been growing within him since the death of Reath's brother."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pursuing Tann to Krant itself, Shen-Jon fought his way through several large Separatist bases, taking the Decimator facilities and reaching the stronghold of Tann herself.
