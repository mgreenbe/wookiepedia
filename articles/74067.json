Traveling in spores, the virus relentlessly attacked the internal chemistry of its host. Blindness occurred in forty minutes, followed by brain death within an hour. Natives of Concord Dawn were vaccinated against the virus as children, so the aggressiveness of this virus was mostly experienced only by offworlders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jango Fett carried Karatos Plague spores in his armor that he could release when needed.
