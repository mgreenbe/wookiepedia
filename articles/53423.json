As a result, the military planned to kill Lermyn, but due to his publicity they could not do so overtly, so they planned to have him assassinated, and frame the Thaereian deserter Osten Dal'Nay for the crime. The military dispatched Lermyn to the Cularin system, supposedly to act as a negotiator to gain some trade concessions from Cularin, and they planned to have the assassination take place while he was on the planet. However, the Heroes of Cularin foiled the plot to kill him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
