This enormous canyon was wracked with volcanic and seismic activity, marked with jagged spires and dangerous quicksand pits. It was a wild place, far from the cities. Difficult to reach and challenging to navigate once there, the Rift was a place where many Je'daii went to hone their survival skills.
