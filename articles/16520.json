The staff was made of pure beskar, a metal alloy tied with Mandalorian culture. After Elsbeth was defeated by the Force-sensitive Ahsoka Tano, the staff was given to the Mandalorian Din Djarin. The staff was durable enough to be able to block and deflect lightsaber blows and survived the destruction of the Razor Crest intact. After the Razor Crest's destruction, Din Djarin wielded it during the second rescue of Grogu, where he used it to destroy one dark trooper and engage Moff Gideon in lightsaber combat, which led to Gideon's defeat and capture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
