They infiltrated the mansion disguised as utility workers, but discovered it was a trap, with dozens of guards, combat probots, and YVH 1 droids guarding the room where Sal-Solo was supposed to be. Veila ordered a withdrawal, but Doran came up with the idea that they could disguise a Protocol droid as a dead Jedi, allowing one of them to remain behind and gather information. Zax pointed out he was too large for the task, and volunteered to do so instead. After preparing the droid, Doran and Veila carried it out of Sal-Solo's mansion and hijacked a groundspeeder, heading to the Behareh Spaceport to meet up with Team Purella."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving, Doran reassured Jaina Solo that the body in the back was not what it looked like, and explained the situation to her, guessing that they had been ambushed as well judging by the injuries several of the other Jedi had.

She ordered Doran to get Bacta patches for Zekk's burns and something to help Kolir Hu'lya's injured mouth, while Thann Mithric secured a vehicle for them to escape in.
