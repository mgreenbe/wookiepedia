They were considered the primary predators of the sentient t'landa Til species who also dwelt on their homeworld. The predators were capable of producing a relatively high pitch, shrill wail, the sound of which caused t'landa Till to panic and flee mindlessly. The thota's homeworld had its atmosphere destroyed in a cataclysmic event which left the planet barren and poisoned, killing most of the creatures on it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 1 BBY the Rodian Sniquux used a recording of a thota's wail to panic a group of six t'landa Til priests in Colony Nine, a colony city on the planet Ylesia. The priests attempted to locate the source of the sound then fled from the noise, causing them to run into a number of monofilament wires that the Rodian had set up, which killed them. By this year the thota were considered ancient."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The thota were first mentioned in the novel Rebel Dawn released in 1998 which was the second book in The Han Solo Trilogy written by A.
