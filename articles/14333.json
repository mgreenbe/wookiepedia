A corporate fleet, led by the Harch Admiral Trench, had blockaded the planet Malastare. A Galactic Republic force, with which Wullf Yularen was serving as an officer, attacked Trench's fleet at Malastare Narrows, but was defeated, losing most of its strength. Eventually, the matter was resolved when a task force led by the Jedi Master Kep-She moved in, defeating Trench and destroying his flagship. Trench was presumed dead after the battle, but he was discovered to have survived during the Clone Wars, reappearing to command Separatist forces at the Battle of Christophsis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Malastare Narrows was first mentioned in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode \"Cat and Mouse\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
