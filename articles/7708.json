The star system lay on the Veragi Trade Route hyperlane, which linked it to the Sinsang system and the Relgim sector's Ord Trasi system. Anx Minor was also connected via another hyperspace route to the planet Gravlex Med, which was home to the Anx species that had at one point settled adjacent systems in the region known as Anx Space.
