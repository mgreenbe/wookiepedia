It was a sister organization of the Imperial Exploration Corps, also a branch of the Imperial Navy. To fulfill its mission, the ISC was often staffed with scientists and scouts; however, it never achieved much importance during the height of the New Order and thus experienced perennial manpower shortages. The Empire planned to gradually pare back the size of the ISC and eventually disband it altogether due to Emperor Palpatine's inability to control the corps\u2014many ISC members had spirits too independent for the Empire, and some even ran information and supplies for the Rebel Alliance. Regardless of the ISC's increasingly reduced status, it was claimed that the corps was responsible for discovering a new planetary system every 207 minutes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ISC's preferred scout vessel was the MRX-BR Pacifier, which embodied the Imperial scout's mindset with its powerful weapon systems.
