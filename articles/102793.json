Amidala, accompanied by R2-D2, in her custom N-1, and Tano, piloting a standard N-1 starfighter, flew past an asteroid activating a dormant modified droid starfighter. The droid proceeded to attack the pair during which Tano's fighter was disabled. This forced Amidala to face the droid fighter alone. Knowing that droids could not improvise, the senator flew her fighter into the tail of the comet, hiding her from her pursuer. Once the droid fighter passed over her, she emerged from hiding behind her quarry and damaged it with her ship's blaster cannons, causing it to crash into the asteroid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
