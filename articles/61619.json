The droid unit included several regiments, and was led by the droid mercenary AD-W4, who had been hired by the Supreme Commander of the Droid Army General Grievous, to oversee the operation. The main purpose of the unit was for the unit's harvesters to harvest Hissrich's plant life, so that the energy from it could be used.
