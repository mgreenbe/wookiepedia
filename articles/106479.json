During a Galactic Republic infiltration of the Citadel prison on Lola Sayu during the Clone Wars, a group led by Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and including reprogrammed battle droids attempted to reach their shuttle on the prison's landing pad, after the astromech droid R2-D2 and the battle droids had freed them from being captured. OOM-10, the reprogrammed droid in the lead, claimed to the droids guarding the shuttle that they were transferring their \"prisoners\" to a supposed Separatist outpost at Point Tarron. The ruse nearly worked, but the guard droids were alerted to the escape attempt by tactical droid K2-B4, leading to a firefight at the landing platform and the eventual destruction of the shuttle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The episode trivia guide for \"Counterattack\" words it that Point Tarron does not exist at all, saying that the fake outpost was Point Tarron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
