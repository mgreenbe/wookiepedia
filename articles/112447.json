Along with the Fleet, the High Command Base was one of the Rebellion's two cornerstones. It was just as critical as the fleet, and it's loss would have been just as catastrophic. With the help of hundreds of civilian and military assistants at the base, Mon Mothma ran the war effort. Every day, dozens of starships and messenger droids entered and left the base, delivering information to the government and carrying it's orders throughout the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel Alliance had a number of bases which housed the High Command, including Massassi Base on the moon Yavin 4 and Echo Base on the planet Hoth. At any one time there was only one High Command base, as the Alliance High Command moved from one base to another. At Echo Base there were over a 1,000 government officials, and nearly as many high-level military and intelligence officers. All of whom were served by hundreds of support personnel, and when both the starfighter pilots and infantry men were added, the base contained over 4,000 beings. Within the base were vast amounts of equipment, including starfighter repair equipment, infantry weapons, and communications equipment. There were medical facilities, and machine shops, the latter which could create nearly anything, from long-range communicators to microsurgery droids to airspeeders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Echo Base was one of the most heavily defended Rebel bases. The outer edges of the system were patrolled by three starfighter squadrons, and the base itself was defended by an anti-space ion cannon and a defense shield capable of deflecting the most powerful orbital bombardment. In addition, the base contained 1,000 Special Forces troopers providing ground defense. Whom were equipped with several dozen artillery pieces, both anti-vehicle and anti-personnel. Protecting the base from all avenues of attack were a system of trenches, that were connected by underground tunnels. Which were complemented by flights of snowspeeders, modified to operate in Hoth's frigid temperatures. In the case that they needed to evacuate their personnel, six Kleeque-class transports and a small fleet of Gallofree Yards medium transports were on standby, ready to leave on an hour's notice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
