Since the primary focus of the CSA was to maintain profitability, Class A infractions of the Legal Codes included piracy, smuggling, industrial espionage, and data-slicing. In contrast, murder and assault were only Class D infractions, covered under the \"Unapproved work behaviour\" and \"Disrespectful behavior to personnel\" sections. The wording of the Legal Codes technically allow for piracy against non-Authority targets, but Security Police enforcing the law care little for this loophole."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
