With numerous eyes and electrified tentacles that they used to ensnare prey, summa-verminoth were often misunderstood creatures. In 10 BBY, after the Raid on Kessel, Beckett's gang accidentally awakened a summa-verminoth in the Maelstrom, whilst aboard the Millennium Falcon. Han Solo, the ship's pilot at the time, endured a chase with the creature until he lured it into the Maw Cluster gravity well using the Falcon's escape pod.

In 10 BBY, Han Solo and the rest of Beckett's gang unintentionally awakened a summa-verminoth near the Maw Cluster, while escaping Kessel in the Millennium Falcon. The individual had come to the Maw untold eons ago, drawn to it. The Maw entranced the creature and it eventually fell into a dream-like state out of longing.  After awakening in hunger, the massive creature pursued the ship and its crew, until Solo flew the Falcon near the vicinity of the gravity well. He then ejected the Falcon's escape pod, which the creature chased instead, right into the gravity well. The summa-verminoth was caught by the well's pull and its skin was torn from its skeleton, before the rest of its body was consumed in turn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The summa-verminoth first appeared in the 2018 Star Wars Anthology film Solo: A Star Wars Story.
