They immediately go on the defensive until they realize that the image of Vader is merely a holographic recording. Vader tells Luke that his late friend, the Rebel pilot known as Shira Brie was actually an Imperial spy. Luke can't believe his ears. The holographic emitter explodes after delivering Vader's haunting message. Unsatisfied with the revelation, Luke and Chewbacca decide to go to the databank vault located on Krake's Planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, on board the Executor, Vader meets with Admiral Mils Giel. Giel has recently failed to secure a rare creature known as a Teezl \u2013 a non-sentient alien that could have provided the Empire a tremendous advantage over the Rebels.

Shira Brie was born on Coruscant and genetically raised to be a perfect spy. By the time she was an adult, Vader personally selected her to act in the role of an Emperor's Hand. Although he is crushed, Luke can take some small satisfaction from the fact that the Force didn't betray him when it indicated that Shira was an enemy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A squad of stormtroopers burst into the kitchen and begin firing at Skywalker.
