The alien was vaguely humanoid, with two legs, six arms, and a head. In 21 BBY, the alien was on ship's bridge when it was intercepted near Shipwrights' Trace by a pirate ship. The pirates attacked and disabled the ship. The pirate captain, Dool Pundar, then ordered the freighter to surrender, and sent B1-Series battle droids to secure it. The alien then joined the crew in an escape pod as Pundar absconded with the freighter and its cargo of droid brains. At the time, the alien was wearing a green uniform and a helmet on its head, along with gloves and boots. The crew was later safely recovered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The alien appears in 2011's The Clone Wars: Strange Allies, a comic tie-in to the Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Secret Missions series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
