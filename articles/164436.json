As an operative of Alliance Intelligence, she served the Rebel Alliance and later the New Republic. Her holographic and audiographic memory gave her a special advantage in piecing together confusing situations or even simply computing data. She was often attached to Rogue Squadron as an intelligence officer, though sometimes under false identities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Winter also served a vital role as Leia Organa's best friend, aide and confidante. She had special relationships with Leia's children Jaina, Jacen, and Anakin Solo, whom she raised during their first years of life.

The two grew up together on the peaceful planet of Alderaan and attended the best schools, learning about art and history, as well as ladylike graces. Possessed of a natural grace and poise, she was often mistaken for Princess Leia by visitors to Alderaan's court. This impression was increased by the fact that Leia's youthful tomboy nature did not seem as regal as Winter's stately bearing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite these differences in personality, however, Winter would remain a comfort to Leia, who had problems relating to the snobbish, cruel young girls at court. Though the pair's physical resemblance was tempered by Winter's stunning white hair, the two friends would soon learn to employ similar looks for tactical advantage, a practice they would continue throughout their lives. Winter would sometimes disguise herself as Leia so that Leia could escape the palace to create mischief and visit with inappropriate boys.

Following Bria's initial speech to the attendees, Winter joined her for a cup of vine-coffeine. The two young women discussed their backgrounds, Corellian and Alderaanian culture, and the cruelty of slavery on Ylesia, forming a quick connection. Winter confided in Bria that she supported military action, despite Alderaan's traditional pacifism, and that she would try to convince Leia and Bail Organa of this truth. She also mentioned that she and Leia could accomplish much for the Rebellion, since both were trained with blaster and the prevailing galactic presumption that women were weak would make them appear harmless. Ultimately, the meeting on Cloud City would lead to the formation of the Corellian Treaty that officially formed the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "True to her promise to Bria, when the Rebellion began Winter was heavily involved with many of the operations, partly because she was unassuming and non-threatening, but mainly because of her holographic and audiographic memory.

She participated in several Rebel undercover missions with various code names such as \"Targeter.\" Her time under the alias \"Targeter\" may have been cut short, however, when Imperial spies discovered and eliminated the Rebel cell on Averam she was working with.

Her first encounter with the squadron was on Cilpar, where she worked in defense of the planet's native resistance forces. During this mission, she was disguised as her childhood friend Leia Organa. She discovered Rogue Squadron pilots Tycho Celchu and a very injured Wes Janson in a Cilpari cave infested with ronks. After an initial misunderstanding, Winter convinced Tycho to pose as an Imperial captain to infiltrate the planet's Imperial leadership. Unfortunately, after Tycho had joined Cilpar's Imperial forces, Winter accidentally and unknowingly shot his TIE Fighter down while piloting his X-wing. Soon thereafter, Winter and Janson were captured in their hidden cave by Vance Rego, an Imperial spy posing as a Cilpari resistance member. Convinced that Winter was Leia, Rego took Winter into Imperial custody. Once transported to the Cilpari capital of Kiidan, Winter was treated as a princess and the personal guest of Governor Norquest and even given a seductive gown to wear and treated to a formal banquet. Fortunately, when Kiidan was attacked by Rogue Squadron and ground forces led by Elscol Loro, Moff Boren Tascl requisitioned Winter to pilot his shuttle. As Winter and Tascl entered the ship, Rogue Squadron arrived to save the day. Winter and Tycho then flew the Moff's shuttle back to her base. It was on this mission that sparks first flew between Winter and Tycho. Not only was Tycho personally compatible with Winter, like her he shared many tragic memories of Alderaan.

This time, the Rogues were summoned to Tatooine. There they attended a reception thrown by Huff Darklighter to commemorate the anniversary of his son Biggs's death. Together, Winter and the Rogues were investigating the continued Imperial presence on the planet in an attempt to prevent anarchy. Winter's mission was to stage a diversion so that she could steal a data disk containing Imperial intelligence from Darklighter's safe. Winter, in disguise as Windmere Wellen, was escorted by a smitten Tycho Celchu to the party. However, Winter's planned diversion was sabotaged by a group of Rodians. She and Tycho chased the Rodians, eventually meeting up with the other Rogues\u2014but failed to obtain the data disk. Winter intimidated Huff Darklighter into handing over his copy of the disk, which she analyzed to discover the location of an important cache of Imperial ships, including the Eidolon. Unfortunately, the stolen copy of the disk was now in the possession of Firith Olan, a crazed Twi'lek who hoped to take over Jabba Desilijic Tiure's role as the primary crimelord on Tatooine. Using Huff Darklighter's weather satellite, Winter tracked Olan's forces to their hideout. Unfortunately, while the Rogues were in pursuit of Olan, they encountered an Imperial squadron commanded by Marl Semtin and were forced to retreat, leaving Olan free to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon thereafter, Winter, along with Wedge, Tycho, and Elscol Loro followed Olan to his homeworld of Ryloth. There they met with Cazne'olan, the head of Olan's clan hoping to purchase his capture with valuable transparisteel. However, the Imperials had beaten the Rogues to Kala'uun and were also negotiating for Olan's release. Cazne'olan and his associate Koh'shak had devised a competition between two Rebels and two Imperials to determine who would obtain Firith. After a brief debate, it was decided that Wedge and Winter would represent the Rogues. The two participated in a race for a gold \"Globe of Victory,\" encountering strange beasts and a deadly heat storm along the way. Because Wedge protected Winter during the race (despite the fact that she ordered him to abandon her), the Imperial naval commando Sixtus Quin reached the Globe first. When the dust cleared, however, the race participants realized that their experiences had been an illusion created by headband monitors which created a sort of virtual reality. Koh'shak congratulated Winter and Wedge for their courage and teamwork during the race, but refused to grant them victory. Meanwhile, Marl Semtin had bribed his way through the Twi'lek compound and fled with Firith Olan.

Thanks in part to Elscol's heroic attack on an Imperial Star Destroyer, the Rogues successfully captured the Eidolon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the end of the Tatooine affair, Winter's relationship with Tycho had reached a new level. Throughout the mission, Tycho had flirted with Winter, but she had continually spurned him. At one point, it seemed that Tycho might even give up on Winter, stating that she seemed to have \"ice water in her veins\" when she informed him that she would have abandoned Wedge in order to obtain the Globe of Victory. During the final battle for the Eidolon, Winter was convinced that Tycho was killed when his X-wing crashed into several TIE Fighters. Previously hesitant about giving into her feelings for Celchu, Winter broke into tears, only to be informed by Wedge Antilles that Tycho had used a code phrase, \"going out with a bang,\" to indicate that he was about to eject from his craft.

Winter's role involved standing in as a double for Princess Leia. Successfully testing her disguise, Winter discussed the relationship between Tycho and herself, without him catching on to the deception. After arriving on Eiattu 6, Han Solo sent Tycho up to Leia's room, where he finally met the disguised Winter and shared several kisses. However, the two were interrupted when Rayt and his thugs, agents of Leonia Tavira, knocked out and captured the couple, bringing \"Leia\" and her \"aide\" to their boss on Axxila. Under the cover of their capture, the real Princess Leia met with Sate Pestage. In exchange for his life, along with ten worlds for himself and fifteen worlds for four friends, Pestage offered to leave Coruscant virtually undefended from attack. He also arranged for his agent Kavil to arrange the release of Winter and Tycho from Tavira. Yet Tycho and Winter managed to escape on their own, breaking out of their separate cells, fighting past the guards, stealing a Y-wing, and out-flying the pursuit offered up by Kavil's corsairs. Fortunately, they managed to send out a distress call, and Rogue Squadron and the Millennium Falcon cleared the way back to base for Tycho and Winter. However, an Imperial Star Destroyer, the Reckoning, arrived in the system at the same time. The ship under command of Admiral Delak Krennel was sent by Ysanne Isard to capture Leia. After have recovered Pestage, the Admiral launched his TIE fighters on the planet and began orbital bombardment. The New Republic agents situation was critical when Krennel was stopped by an AT3 Directive issued by Soontir Fel. Delak Krennel was forced to obey at the behest of Sate Pestage and left the system. Winter and Tycho then shipped back home aboard the Falcon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back on base, Winter enjoyed walking among the gardens, as well as dining and dancing with Tycho, Wedge, and Reina Faleur at the officer's club. One of their nights at the club was cut short, though, when Rogue Squadron was called back to headquarters. There, Winter participated in the rushed planning of Pestage's extraction from Ciutric IV, accompanying the ground intrusion team to rescue Pestage. Along with Kapp Dendo's commandos, they broke Pestage out of prison, but were trapped on the surface of Ciutric IV by Delak Krennel and his Reckoning, reinforced by the Interdictor Binder. The intrusion team and Rogue Squadron fled to the night side of the planet, and Wedge ordered an attack on an Imperial outpost. Once it was seized, Winter helped rig a HoloNet communication for Wedge so he could send a message out, though he did not tell her who he was calling. As it turned out, Wedge had called Mirax Terrik, who arrived in the Pulsar Skate and helped sneak the commandos, Winter, and Pestage out of Ciutric, escorted by the Rogues and aided by Aggressor Wing, who had arrived with Terrik. However, Pestage turned his back on the Rebels during the mission and deserted them, leading to his death at the hands of Krennel.

She served as a contact for Corran Horn and Erisi Dlarit while Iella worked with Wedge Antilles and Pash Cracken. While leading Corran and Erisi on reconnaissance missions (disguised as tourists), Winter inquired about Tycho. Horn was wary of Tycho after his capture by Ysanne Isard, who was known for brainwashing her prisoners and sending them out as covert agents. Suspicious of his fellow Rogue, Horn picked a fight with Winter about Tycho's tragic losses on Alderaan.

Winter was then part of the raid on a subsidiary computer center and a EVS Construction Droid that allowed the planetary shields to be deactivated. Working with Wedge Antilles, her quick-thinking and speed on a datapad helped to coordinate the Rogue Squadron pilots in their fight to take the planet.

Winter assembled intelligence on Thyferra and presented this information to the squadron in a special meeting immediately before their departure for their new base at the Yag'Dhul space station, where she was to join them and serve as part intelligence officer, part quartermaster. Her findings, including several Imperial supply dumps, proved crucial to the Rogues' success. At this time, Winter also alerted Wedge Antilles to a store of X-wings and parts on Rishi. Also around this time, Tycho Celchu left a memorial for his fianc\u00e9e Nyiestra (who perished during the destruction of Alderaan) at the Graveyard. His memorial gift, suggested by Winter, was a symbolic acknowledgment of both his own personal transformation and his new love for Winter. Soon thereafter, when Rogue Squadron was ambushed by the Imperial Interdictor cruiser Aggregator and Victory I-class Star Destroyer Corrupter, Winter's holographic memory helped the Rogues to discover more information on the mysterious ship which came to their rescue. It was the Valiant, an Alderaanian ship that was the escort of the famed Another Chance.

(Interestingly, over time, Mara and Leia became closer, while Winter and Leia grew apart, to the point where Leia eventually acknowledged that Winter's best friend was Iella.) Winter was the one who informed Mara of the current state of the Thrawn crisis; Mara had been unconscious for a month as she healed. During the course of their conversation, Mara expressed her wish that Winter could help her obtain a ship on which to depart Coruscant.

Suspicious of Mara Jade's recognition of her as Targeter (thought to be known only to a few Imperial agents on Averam), Winter informed Leia that Mara might have Imperial connections. This information led Leia to confront Mara about her past. Soon thereafter, Winter was present for the attempted kidnapping of Leia and her children. Mara Jade's timely rescue helped to ease Leia and Winter's minds about Mara's allegiances. As a result of this event and concerned for the safety of the infant Solo twins in the face of continued danger, Leia invited ten Noghri bodyguards to Coruscant to protect her, the twins, and Winter. This proved to be a fortuitous decision\u2014when Coruscant came under attack a few days later, Leia's political duties called, and it fell to Winter and the Noghri to defend the twins.

Though she was stumped as to who Delta Source could be, Winter was soon able to discover that the Grand Corridor of the Imperial Palace was likely the site where Delta Source was obtaining its information.

Therefore, the decision was made to sequester the children for several years, at the same time freeing their parents, Leia and Han Solo, for important New Republic duties. Initially, Winter kept Jacen and Jaina on New Alderaan with the protection of the Noghri. However, the depredations of the resurrected Palpatine and the birth of the twins' younger brother Anakin necessitated a change in both locations and strategies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thereafter, Winter and the children moved to the planetoid Anoth, where a special base had been constructed for them. Besides having cutting-edge security, this base was designed to be stimulating and educational for small children.

The two then contacted Moruth Doole, whose evasiveness raised the suspicion of both women. (Indeed, Doole had kidnapped Han and Chewbacca and set them to work in his spice mines.) A few days later, Winter left to return to Anoth and baby Anakin, much to the Solo twins' dismay. Indeed, even the typically stoic Winter seemed sad to leave the children behind on Coruscant.

After deploying her station's FIDO against an attack by Furgan's fearsome Mountain Terrain Armored Transports, Winter fought bravely, hoping to lead the stormtroopers away from Anakin. Through her ruse, she was able to draw some troops into a trap, leaving them vulnerable to assassin droids. Then, in the nick of time, Leia and Ackbar arrived on-planet to provide assistance and rescue Anakin aboard the Galactic Voyager. However, in years to come, Winter's role in the Battle of Anoth would be remembered as decisive.

However, Winter's emotional control was both a coping mechanism for dealing with the destruction of Alderaan and a useful technique she employed in her career as a spy. It also may partly have been a result of her royal upbringing and was in stark contrast to Leia Organa's more emotive style. In her personal life, her stoic nature was also helpful, as it allowed her to spend long periods away from her partner Tycho Celchu while both were involved on missions across the galaxy. It also made her a very reasonable and composed nanny for the often-mischievous Solo twins."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In terms of her personal style, Winter could best be described as elegant and stately. Growing up, Winter had better fit the role of \"princess\" than her friend Leia did, and though Leia eventually grew out of her tomboy phase, Winter retained her regal bearing. Though Winter's line of work often required her to wear practical clothing such as jumpsuits, her tastes were never as functional as Leia's. Indeed, at different times in their adulthood, Leia would remark that Winter seemed fashionable and distinguished even in an old robe and that she favored expensive, impractical clothing made out of materials such as vine-silk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Her most unique trait was her memory, which was both holographic and audiographic. She had perfect recollection of everything that had ever happened to her, and all information that came to her. Across the galaxy, this trait was highly uncommon. Ironically, one other individual who possessed this trait, Imperial officer Kirtan Loor, was a contemporary and an enemy of Winter's. Winter's memory proved useful time and time again in her service to the Rebel Alliance and later the New Republic. Eventually, however, this ability would cause her some emotional difficulty, as she remembered every experience, even the most painful, in complete detail."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Winter also was a very skilled slicer and a master of disguise, often impersonating her adoptive sister Leia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Winter was created by author Timothy Zahn for the early 1990s Thrawn Trilogy. There, and in many subsequent Expanded Universe novels, Winter's purpose is to serve in capacities normally filled by Leia when Leia is otherwise occupied due to plot or continuity concerns. She also functions as a foil for the more excitable Leia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There is a slight discrepancy in the sources regarding Winter's alias \"Targeter.\" In The Last Command, Winter tells Leia that she only used this alias for \"a few weeks\" and only on Averam. However, in numerous other sources such as Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Rebel Opposition and X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble, Winter uses this alias in other locations and on other missions. Even Timothy Zahn, Winter's creator, appears to contradict his earlier work when, in Allegiance, \"Targeter\" is mentioned as active on Drunost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
