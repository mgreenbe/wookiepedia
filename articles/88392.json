When Roan Novachez and several of his classmates from the Jedi academy at the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant visited the Senate on a class field trip, Shi-Fara expressed to Roan that she hoped that the Senate would work on this medical aid bill. She explained that it would help Gaiana's Gaiana's father, who had been sick. Roan was shocked, as he been so absorbed by his own problems that he didn't know anything about Gaiana's dad being sick. He was also disgusted by the actions of the Senate, who, during the field trip, did not work on the medical aid bill at all, but instead debated bills he considered frivolous, such as one to customize repulsorlift seats and another that would change how bills were introduced."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
