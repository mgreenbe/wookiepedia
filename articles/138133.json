Between two jobs, however, they would sometimes take her to Black Spire Outpost on Batuu for a vacation. There, Ricair's father used to hang out at Oga Garra's Cantina, while her mother told her stories about the planet, many of which revolved around the extinct Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Ricair grew up to become a smuggler. Around the time of the Hosnian Cataclysm in 34 ABY, she had been with a smuggling crew for several months. Upon hearing the news of the Cataclysm on the HoloNet, Ricair decided to part ways with the crew and find a place to lay low while the situation between the New Republic and the First Order settled down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having fond recollections of her childhood vacations, Ricair decided to make a stopover at Blackspire Outpost. There, she visited her mother's favorite petrified tree, which she said housed a cave where Jedi Padawans of old went to discover their greatest fears through the Force. She then visited Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities, where she indulged in the purchase of a Jedi holocron and a purple kyber crystal. As she passed Docking Bay 7, Ricair saw a YT-1300 light freighter, which she thought might have been the famous Millennium Falcon\u2014or, more probably, one of a great many knock-offs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the recommendation of a sympathetic local, she then headed to the Milk Stand. However, she was halted in her tracks by a group of First Order stormtroopers on the lookout for members of the Resistance. When they finally let her go, Ricair had a blue milk at the stand, and learned from the merchant that the YT-1300 was indeed the Millennium Falcon, and that its famous co-pilot, the Wookiee Chewbacca, had been seen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As she wandered through the shopping district, Ricair noticed a woman in orange flight jacket trying to hide in the shadows. Suspecting that she was a member of the Resistance, Ricair decided to help her rather than report her to the First Order. Ricair stepped between the woman and a stormtrooper that walked by, blocking the soldier's line of sight. Before heading off towards the forest at the edge of the outpost, the mysterious woman gave her a mysterious look, an invitation to follow her. Hesitating, the smuggler held back."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later on, Ricair learned of the atrocities Supreme Leader Kylo Ren of the First Order committed when he visited Batuu, which prompted her to join the Resistance after all."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "T'Bar Ricair first appeared in \"Life on the Edge,\" a short story written by Tricia Barr that appeared in Star Wars Insider 192 in 2019.
