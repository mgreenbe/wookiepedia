Named after the nearby Brejik's Run swoop track, which lay in ruins, the outpost was established as a forward outpost for the Taris Resettlement Initiative during the Cold War. During the Sith Empire's invasion of Taris, the Republic was in the process of excavating a buried swoop track known as Gadon's Superhighway, which was accessible via a tunnel in the outpost, but Imperial forces overran the outpost and collapsed the tunnel and excavations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
