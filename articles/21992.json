They utilized a Nu-class attack shuttle for transportation, and sported rusty red color markings on their Phase I clone trooper armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before mission to Vassek 3, Fil's squad made several missions alongside Nahdar Vebb. They were specialized in making 'entrances' by detonators. During the missions Fil had become a close friend to his Jedi General Nahdar Vebb."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a skirmish on the Republic Venator-class Star Destroyer Tranquility with Separatist forces that managed to rescue Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, Fisto and his former Padawan, Nahdar Vebb, were dispatched to track down Gunray. Meeting on Vassek 3, Fisto and Vebb, along with Clone Commander Fil and his squad moved into a fortress where they believed a homing beacon was. Niner and Bel remained by the Nu-class transport and Fisto's Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor. The Jedi and Clone squad found a room where they believed Gunray was being kept, guarded by B1-Series battle droids, but realized it was only a hologram of the Viceroy. After Count Dooku offered an \"alternative prize\" to the Jedi, the troopers went deeper into the fortress. There, they discovered that the fortress belonged to General Grievous."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later Grievous went back to his base and discovered Fil's squad inside. He killed two of the clone troopers, the Jedi and Fil with only one other trooper. The cyborg activated his IG-100 MagnaGuards again to hunt the Jedi. The floor beneath them disappeared and Fisto and Vebb were able to easily jump back onto the floor still remaining, however the clone trooper fell to his death. Commander Fil dispersed his cable, and was pulled back up by the Jedi. Fisto made contact with Niner and Bel in order to bring in reinforcements. While the troopers were trying to make contact with the Republic, the MagnaGuard killed them. Droids were also attempting to destroy Fisto's starfighter, but R6-H5 escaped. A short while after recovering from what had just happened, Grievous deployed his pet roggwart Gor, in an attempt to finally finish them off. After Fil began firing his blaster at the beast, Gor grabbed him, then repeatedly smacking him against the ground using its tail, ultimately leading to the clone commander's death. Fisto was then able to chop Gor's front limbs off, as Vebb stabbed it in the back. The beast then fell to the ground, as the Nautolan Jedi stabbed it in the neck, finishing it off. Jedi survivors eventually witnessed Grievous leaving his control room and watched him as he entered a sequence to lock the security door. After Grievous had gone, Fisto went to re-enter the sequence, but as he did, they heard his medical droid alert him that they were trying to enter. The door then opened, and Fisto walked in, but Nahdar did not and protested that they should make an attempt to finish off the cyborg warrior instead. The Padawan destroyed Grievous' bodyguards, but he was killed by General himself. Fisto faced Grievous once again and later escaped from Vassek 3 in his Jedi starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
