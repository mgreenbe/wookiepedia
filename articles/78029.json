During the Galactic Civil War, after the destruction of the first Death Star, Krelman visited Chalmun's Cantina and became infatuated with Ackmena, a bartender who worked the nighttime hours. After much consideration, Krelman\u2014who had practically given up on life\u2014returned to the cantina days later and confronted the woman, professing his love for her and giving her flowers.

He was quite taken with Ackmena, the silver-haired nightshift bartender. Her parting words\u2014\"Come back soon, I'll be waiting\"\u2014had a profound impact on Krelman. He left the cantina with a renewed sense of purpose and felt more alive than he had in years. He went home and contemplated the meaning of Ackmena's words, and he decided that the message was particularly relevant to his life.

The broadcast began just before Krelman approached the Mos Eisley Cantina. He entered, dodging the bouncer Tork, who was escorting out an unruly Abyssin patron named Cyceyed. Flowers in hand, Krelman scoped the cantina and found Ackmena standing at the bar. Reassuring that his flowers were properly potent, Krelman approached her and prompted her for a conversation. He was indifferent and unconcerned with his choice of beverage; rather, he was focused on the woman to whom he spoke. Krelman regretted not returning to visit her until that point, having contemplated doing so previously a number of times. While Ackmena tended to other customers, Krelman downed his drink through his upper-cranial orifice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a gesture of his desire for Ackmena, he placed the flowers on top of his empty glass; Ackmena was flattered with the gift. Krelman reminded her of his name, grabbed her hand, and began to share his feelings: how he had lost all hope until he met Ackmena and thought she cared for him. He then spoke of love and, in a flicker of pseudoemotion, grabbed Ackmena in a fierce embrace. Taken aback, Ackmena had to explain to him that her words were not any sort of romantic proposition and that she had no time for such things. Unconvinced, Krelman took a seat next to Cebann Veekan at the bar and accepted another drink from Ackmena, complimentary this time. Krelman's hopes were dashed, however, when he heard Ackmena repeat, as Krelman called them, those \"six simple little words\" to another customer. He quickly became depressed as the realization of Ackmena's non-interest set in."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Curfew and a second chance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At this point, the Empire announced an immediate curfew for the entire Tatoo system. Ackmena tried to make the patrons leave and comply with the order, but none would. So Ackmena gave everyone one last round of drinks on the house and used her charm, through the song \"Goodnight, But Not Goodbye,\" to convince the customers to leave, which they did\u2014all except for Krelman, whom Ackmena let stay inside after she locked up.
