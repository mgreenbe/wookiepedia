He found a reference to Rajivari's great knowledge, and went on a quest to find the source. Through his obsession in protecting the village and his love ones that he cared for, he was pulled towards the dark side under Rajivari's influence. As Nalen leaned toward the dark side, he became increasingly aggressive and obsessed on become more powerful. Eventually, Nalen found his prize in the form of the Fount of Rajivari; the secret laboratory of the fallen master. He was also confronted by a young Padawan of Jedi master Yuon Par, who noted the Twi'lek's disturbing condition. With the Jedi hot on his trails, Nalen implores his more sinister abilities to outwit them. In one of such occasions, Nalen disguised himself as Master Yuon to gain the exact location from Qyzen Fess."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his head start against the Jedi, Nalen prove to be a less-than-desirable student to Rajivari's teachings. The Fount is defended by trials that demand understanding to Rajivari's principles. Instead of overcoming puzzles and illusions, Nalen forced his way into the inner sanctuary. In the main chamber, he was introduced to Rajivari's spirit and his invention: a device which can transfer decades of experience and knowledge into oneself. Demanding wisdom, Nalen used the device on himself. Unfortunately, Raloch's mind broke and to Rajivari's horror, Raloch decided to destroy the Jedi on Tython in revenge for leaving the Pilgrims to die at the hands of the Flesh Raiders. His first goal was the Forge, where the Order's lightsabers produced."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after, Raloch reaches the Forge with his fellow Twi'leks, only to find his rival waiting with a green Lightsaber. Pleaded by Master Rajivari to stop Raloch from destroying the Jedi Order and himself, the young Jedi reached the forge ahead and crafted his own lightsaber. As Raloch and the apprentice face each other, he accused the Jedi for keeping Rajivari's knowledge for themselves while neglecting his people's suffering. The Consular respond with gentle rebuke that his cause was lost to these people he claimed to protect. Angered by his peers' disapproval, Raloch dueled the Jedi with his vibrosword. Raloch had the upper hand at beginning, but the Padawan disarmed the Dark Pilgrim, and defeated him. Kneeling down in agony, Nalen taunted the Padawan to kill him in front of the people who held honor for their hero. The Padawan spared him, and took the wounded Twi'lek to the temple where he could be healed. The Jedi Council had a discussion of what to do with him, but the Padawan decided that Nalen should become a Jedi and follow the ways of the light side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nevertheless, Nalen recovered from his injury and was visited by Bashenn and Matriarch Kolovish.

Deducting from Nelan's disturbed speech and action, he realizes Nelan is more confused than corrupted and resolved the situation with might and mercy.

However, these capabilities were not good enough to resist Rajivari's trap at the Fount of Rajivari and though he ultimately survived them, his mind was severely injured."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
