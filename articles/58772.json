Circa nine hundred and thirty eight days after the First Battle of Geonosis, Hadde's Forward Operating Base was damaged in an artillery shelling by Separatist rebels. Among the losses were a communications relay, rendering the base unable to receive nor respond to a distress call from the nearby clone commandos of Omega Squad, pinned down by pro-Separatist Maujasi soldiers. Only the timely arrival of a LAAT/i gunship manned by clone troopers from the 14th Infantry Brigade out of the nearby town of Neska\u2014dispatched by Advanced Recon Commando Captain Maze, who picked up the distress call when Omega commed Special Operations Brigade on Coruscant\u2014allowed Omega Squad to escape the fight unharmed and return to Hadde Base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thirty-two days later, the base came under attack by a group of pro-Separatist rebels that launched a missile from a house within the Republic-friendly city of Hadde.

The clone commandos of both Delta and Omega Squads\u2014all of whom had been inside the mess at the time of the attack, but were spared the worst injuries due to their hardy Katarn-class commando armor\u2014would lead the counterattack on the Hadde rebels with Jedi General Etain Tur-Mukan and elements of both the 14th and 85th Infantry Brigades."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Structure"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic's forward operating base was located on the outskirts of Hadde, and by nine hundred and seventy days into the Clone Wars, had expanded to a size Delta Squad member Scorch regarded as approaching a small city in and of itself.

The sprawling base included a mess hall for dining, barracks for housing clone troops, and the office of the base's commanding officer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
