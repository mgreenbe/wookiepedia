Death Star City was spread over hundreds of square kilometers, housing the Death Star's enlisted members as well as civilian contractors finishing the final construction of the Death Star. Residents of Death Star City were housed in small, strict apartments. The berths of Star Destroyers were considered luxurious compared to the apartments."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Death Star City had multiple sectors, with each sector containing a commercial district with various markets, repair shops, cantinas, theaters, arcades, and more establishments that served the needs and wants of residents. A black market had also taken root in Death Star City, with many types of contraband and illegal entertainment being purchased, despite the attempts by agents of the Imperial Security Bureau and Death Star internal security personnel to regularly end the underground market. Death Star City was destroyed, along with the rest of the Death Star, during the Battle of Yavin when Luke Skywalker of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, managed to launch his T-65B X-wing starfighter's proton torpedoes into a 2 meter shaft that led to the main reactor, destroying the battle station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
