This practice was so ancient that no one truly knew where borheks originated from."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were large insectine creatures covered with a color-changing carapace possessed of six limbs. Borheks were known to be remarkably strong because of their exoskeleton could deflect blaster bolts. This armor was studded with spikes that would wound the borhek's attackers. The creature's head featured a prominent horn which allowed it to gore its target,making them equally dangerous, charging or evading a target. While the armor and spikes were strong they were also flexible and allowed the beast to curl into a ball and roll on the ground. This was usually done when the beast felt threatened by an attacker. The borhek's mandibles allowed it to clamp onto its victim after biting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Borheks were known to be temperamental creatures that would easily be goaded into a rampage, this tendency was exploited by those who used them in pit fights. Borheks were often fitted with illegal pain stimulators that induced the beast's rage, provoking them to attack their opponent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Outland Transit Station notably hosted borhek pit fights in an arena, with a yellow champion borhek which remained undefeated until the cheating ways of Meeko Ghintee resulted in its death. Jango Fett, hunting Meeko due to the bounty on his head, was forced to contend with Meeko's rigged borhek which he killed after a brief fight. However, the deaths of the champion borhek and the one Meeko stole and rigged resulted in a 10,000 credit bounty being issued for his death, ironically enough being claimed by Fett."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
