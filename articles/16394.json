In 28 ABY, during the Yuuzhan Vong War, in which the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong invaded the galaxy, Berrida was stationed at Yaga Minor. Following the devastation of the Imperial capital world, Bastion, retreating Imperial forces regrouped at Yaga Minor along with a small Jedi expedition searching for the living planet Zonama Sekot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Imperial forces regrouped, Berrida was contacted by Jacen Solo, a Jedi Knight, who offered to assist the Remnant in various ways, including showing their pilots new tactics and helping them find Yuuzhan Vong spies. When Solo inquired as to why Berrida believed the Remnant was attacked, the general stated that although the Yuuzhan Vong had issued no explanation, he believed it was in retaliation for assisting the Galactic Alliance, the New Republic's successor government, most recently by sharing information on hyperspace routes into the Deep Core worlds. The information the Remnant had shared allowed the Alliance to ambush a large Yuuzhan Vong fleet in the Treskov system and kill Warmaster Tsavong Lah, the leader of the Yuuzhan Vong's military."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo agreed with Berrida's theory and also believed that the only way for the Yuuzhan Vong to have known about the assistance was if they had spies hidden within the Remnant's ranks. Berrida initially believed this to be impossible, stating that they could conduct random security sweeps and checks, though Solo explained that sweeps and checks were useless unless they knew what to look for, and that the Galactic Alliance, along with the New Republic before it, had difficulties with both Yuuzhan Vong infiltrators and sympathizers. In addition, Solo also cordially invited the Imperial Remnant to join the Galactic Alliance. Berrida reluctantly decided to bring the information and the offer of an alliance to Moff Flennic for consideration. Ultimately, although Flennic opposed such an alliance, Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, the man in charge of the Imperial Navy, accepted the offer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Berrida was a portly and stubborn man. It was not in Berrida's nature to negotiate, and he was quick to argue with those he perceived as a potential threat. When Jacen Solo attempted to reason with Berrida, the general was quick to claim that the Empire did not need help from anyone. Nevertheless, when provided with evidence that the Yuuzhan Vong had infiltrated the Empire, Berrida was willing to appraise his superior about the situation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Berrida appeared in the 2003 novel The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic I: Remnant, written by Sean Williams and Shane Dix.
