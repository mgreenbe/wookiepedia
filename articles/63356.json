However, Ziro has an ally in the singer Sy Snootles, with whom he had entertained a romantic relationship. After learning that Ziro is being held captive in the Hutt stronghold, she secretly visits him.

Nevertheless, Vos is well-informed about the possible reason why Ziro has been freed, so they travel to Nal Hutta. The Hutt Council denies any knowledge of Ziro's and Bane's whereabouts, and Obi-Wan is reluctant to confront them openly since the Republic owes the Hutts for their contributions to the war effort, but Vos states that they could have freed him, to Gardulla's resentment. He then detects Ziro's presence by psychometrically scanning a cup Ziro has drunk from. As the two arrive at Ziro's detention cell, they find him already missing and promptly attempt to track him down.

The Jedi and Bane meet beside the corpse and immediately begin to slug it out between themselves: While Obi-Wan intends to bring Bane to justice for the Senate hostage incident, Bane is tempted by the reward for each dead Jedi delivered to the Separatists.

The episode marks the first appearance of Sy Snootles in The Clone Wars; Snootles originally appeared on the screen in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.

Vos was a fan-favorite Expanded Universe character who had appeared in numerous issues of Dark Horse Comics' Star Wars: Republic series, though his original character design came from a background extra in the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. Gilroy contacted John Ostrander, who had penned most of Republic's Vos-centric issues, to ask if he would be interested in writing the episode which featured the character's first appearance. However, the producers of The Clone Wars ultimately decided to employ experienced television animation writers early in the show's production, and Ostrander's involvement was nixed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vos was written into an early draft of the show's season one episode \"Bombad Jedi,\" but was cut due to limitations involving how many new character models a single episode could introduce. His first appearance thus did not come until the season three episode \"Hunt for Ziro,\" which drew on his character traits from the Republic comics, including his powers of psychometry and his tendency to bend the rules of the Jedi Order. Various pieces of concept art were created for the episode, including art of Vos, Vos's gunship, the swamp speeder, Mama the Hutt's home, the musical number performed by Sy Snootles, and various locations on both Teth and Nal Hutta. A maquette of Mama was also built."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Production"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Hunt for Ziro\" drew inspiration from various sources. Mama was partially inspired by the obese vampire Pearl from the 1998 film Blade; the Ran-D housekeeper droids in Mama's hut were an homage to the 1987 film Batteries Not Included; and when Ziro dies, he says \"What a world, what a world!\" in reference to a line spoken by the Wicked Witch of the West in 1939's The Wizard of Oz. Additionally, the musical number in Gardulla's palace was a tribute to the opening scene of 1984's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The number was inserted into the episode as a throwback to the Chicago nightclub scenes often seen in gangster films. Designer Darren Marshall and Supervising Director Dave Filoni designed the headdresses worn by Snootles's backup dancers; the headdresses have been compared to those found in Director Julie Taymor's staging of The Lion King musical. Originally, Jabba the Hutt was intended to be present in the palace along with his protocol droid, TC-70. He was replaced by Gardulla late in the episode's production, and TC-70 was swapped for Gardulla's droid MF-80. TC-70 has not gone on to appear in Star Wars canon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In May 2010, Dan Curto of Rebelscum.com reported a rumor that Quinlan Vos would be included in The Clone Wars' season three action figure line.

An official preview of \"Hunt for Ziro\" was included in the 121st issue of Star Wars Insider magazine (October 2010), consisting of several still images and a brief plot summary.

Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a score of 8/10; although he found the horrifically obese Mama the Hutt to be awkward and the episode to be odd overall, he praised Snootles's surprise betrayal and a well-sustained action sequence between Bane and the two Jedi. Another \"Eric,\" writing for TheForce.net, also named the climactic fight as his favorite part of the episode, asserting that it felt like a scene from one of the main Star Wars films. To Eric, the episode redeemed a thus-far disappointing third season."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Filmmaker Bryan Young, writing for Examiner.com, rated \"Hunt for Ziro\" five stars out of five, stating that it had \"just about anything I could want in an episode of Clone Wars.\" Young singled out the dance number's impressive animation, fun factor, and nod to Indiana Jones as making up for overall slow pacing and for the disappointment of Kenobi being fought to a standstill by a non\u2013Force sensitive bounty hunter. He also favorably compared Vos to The Big Lebowski's \"The Dude,\" including his use of the line \"That's just your opinion, man.\" A review posted by \"Cameron\" at Denofgeek.com likened Vos to Han Solo, but found Snootles to be the episode's main star.

Responding to jawajames's review, Star Wars author Pablo Hidalgo revealed that he loved both the episode and Star Wars dark comedies in general. On dauntlessmedia.net, reviewer Samuel Walters assigned \"Hunt for Ziro\" a grade of B due to its mob-movie homage, dark romance, and appearance of Quinlan Vos.
