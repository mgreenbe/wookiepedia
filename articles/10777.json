It was a predecessor to the 3PO-series protocol droid, though it lacked the diplomacy modules of the later models. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, the talker droid had become obsolete, though one such droid was kept as an artifact in the Imperial Museum on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When attempting to devise an encryption code that the Empire would be unable to crack, the Rebel Alliance intended to steal the talker droid and utilize its knowledge of the extinct Trawak language. A team of rebels entered the museum and broke into the curator's private collection, stealing the droid. Upon the team's return to the rebel forces, the protocol droid C-3PO reactivated the ancient droid, discovering that it had become corrupted. The cyborg Lobot was able to connect with the talker droid and organize its circuits, allowing it to function coherently. Fearing that it would be deactivated once the rebels had no use for it, the droid refused to provide them with its Trawak module, but eventually agreed to translate their codes in exchange for Lobot keeping it active. The effort of doing so took a toll on Lobot, who began to die as a result."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A model of protocol droid and linguistics droid, the Autonomous Translator Module, Mark II\u2014known in its time as a talker droid or talky\u2014had memory banks that contained a repository of languages, including Trawak. However, the droid lacked the diplomacy modules that were included in later models, such as the 3PO-series protocol droid, of which the talker droid was a predecessor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon being reawakened during the Galactic Civil War, the talker droid wished to preserve its existence and remain active\u2014despite not being alive in an organic sense\u2014refusing to give up its Trawak module out of fear that it would be deactivated once it was no longer useful. The droid stated that it was always on its own side; it was apathetic to the cause of the Rebel Alliance, serving the rebels only out of the interest of remaining online. When the hybroid Lobot began to die as a result of keeping the talker droid active, the droid was unconcerned with his survival, merely requesting that another hybroid be prepared to assist it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid had gray plating and red sensors that were fitted into indentations on its face. Standing above a height of 1.75 meters, the droid had a bipedal humanoid form and five-fingered hands, with a raised layer of plating on its shoulders, lower arms, chest, and legs. Red lights were situated on the droid's chest, shoulders, and the joints on its elbows and upper legs. Its circuits could be accessed through a hatch on the top of its head. Prior to being reactivated, the droid's sensors had a pale red color and the light on its chest was yellow. The 3PO unit C-3PO considered its design to be blocky and inelegant compared to the streamlined designs of later models."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "An ancient relic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Autonomous Translator Module, Mark II was utilized long before the time of the Galactic Empire. One of the languages that it possessed, the Trawak language of the Trawaki species, became extinct over a thousand years prior to the Galactic Civil War between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. By the time of the Imperial Era, the talker droid was no longer in use. One such droid, which the protocol droid C-3PO believed was only remaining droid of its type left in the galaxy, fell into the hands of the curator of the Imperial Museum, who kept the droid stored in his private collection within the museum on the galactic capital of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, the Rebel Alliance split its fleet into divisions, intending for the divisions to communicate with one another in order to reform. However, the Empire was able to crack the rebel encryption codes, and the Rebellion wished to devise a new method of secure communication. Aware of the Autonomous Translator Module, Mark II's existence, C-3PO suggested that the rebels use its knowledge of Trawak as the basis for a new code. In order to do so, the Rebellion planned a mission to steal the droid from the Imperial Museum, dispatching a team of Pathfinders, accompanied by the cyborg Lobot and former Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After learning of the droid's location within the private collection, the rebels drew the curator out and kept him distracted so that Lobot could slice the door and allow them to break in. The rebels located the talker droid, returning it to the combined fleet of the Fourth and Seventh Divisions. Once it was aboard the rebel flagship, C-3PO reactivated the droid. However, the talker droid's speech was garbled, and C-3PO determined that its memory banks and primary cognitive functions had been corrupted, leaving the rebels without a solution to their situation."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Activation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Supervised by C-3PO and watched by several rebels, the astromech droid R2-D2 repaired the talker droid's circuits. The droid was successfully reactivated; however, it was still malfunctioning, speaking incoherently and rising up from the table it had been lying on. The talker droid threw C-3PO across the room and confronted R2-D2, who attempted to shock it. Overpowering the astromech droid's charge, the talker droid redirected it back at R2-D2 and continued to rampage through the room. Lobot, entering the room to face the talker droid, managed to connect with the droid and reorganize its circuits, removing the corruption from within it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon awakening, the talker droid asked who the rebels were. C-3PO spoke with the ancient droid, informing it that it had awoken in the future and requesting that the linguistics droid prepared its Trawak language module for download. The droid refused, to C-3PO's surprise, not wishing to surrender the one reason that it had been brought back online. Interrupting C-3PO's outrage, Calrissian reminded the talker droid that it was functioning solely because of Lobot, who could undo what he had done to fix the droid. Calrissian offered to have Lobot keep the droid online in return for the droid translating for the rebels. Princess Leia Organa informed the droid of the ongoing war, asking that the talker droid encode the Rebellion's communications into Trawak."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The talker droid accepted the rebels' terms, agreeing to work for them as long as Lobot helped it work around the corruption in its processing unit. After making sure that Lobot was willing to do so, Calrissian told the talker droid that it would have to answer to him if anything went wrong. The rebels provided the talker droid with the code that they needed translated, which was given to the pilots of Starlight Squadron to be passed on to any rebel divisons they encountered. Able to see through its connection to Lobot, the talker droid determined that the hybroid had a stutter in the interface between his organic and calcutronic elements, a common problem in the droid's own time. Reaching out, the droid was able to briefly make Lobot\u2014whose mind had previously been taken over by his implants\u2014think and speak clearly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the effort of maintaining the talker droid began to take a toll on Lobot. The talker droid estimated that Lobot had only hours left before system collapse, suggesting that the rebels prepare another hybroid for it to use. Despite the potential for Lobot's death, the rebels required further translations immediately, having lost contact with Starlight Squadron and wishing to transmit emergency protocols. Calrissian objected, insisting that they save Lobot, but Kes Dameron, one of the Pathfinders who had retrieved the droid, prevented him from intervening."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Autonomous Translator Module, Mark II first appeared in the comic Star Wars 9, written by Charles Soule, illustrated by Jan Bazaldua, and published by Marvel Comics on December 9, 2020."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
