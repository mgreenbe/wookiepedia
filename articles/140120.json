In or around 3 ABY the Empire split off the Freeworlds into a new sector called the Shapani sector. Tapani was then converted into an oversector composed of the Tapani and Shapani sectors; although by 40 ABY at the latest, this action was reversed and the sector reunited.

The houses gained power and influence by forming coalitions within the Great Council in order to obtain enough votes to carry their policies. For approximately twenty years prior to the Battle of Yavin, the House Mecetti-controlled coalition (Mecetti-Reena-Calipsa coalition) held the power within the council. The proportion of votes each house had within the Great Council was based on the total population within each province and not the number of worlds or systems.

With the establishment of the Giju Passage, around 4,003 BBY (8,717 Tapani calendar), the worlds of Tallaan and Neona were opened up to Galactic trade although the other colonies were held in the backwaters for another 18 centeries until Sullustan scouts opened up the Shapani Bypass. The bypass cut days off the heavily traveled Rimma Trade Route that ran from the Core to the Outer Rim Terrirories and it soon became a favored route for traders keen to shorten the trips along the Rimma hyperlanes, especially the transporters of Bacta from Thyferra to the Core.

This, however, was not a very direct route for any companies not based in neighboring Calipsa province and therefore was equivalently expensive.
