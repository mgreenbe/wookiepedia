However, the access tube leading to the junction terminal being too narrow, the Wookiee had to brutally remove the panel covering it. Running out of time to properly reprogram the command relay, Chewbacca manually overrode it by rewiring two cables of the junction terminal. Gaining full control of the freighter, the Rebels captured drone vessel 171 and made their jump to lightspeed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
