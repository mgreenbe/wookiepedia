After hiding for many months, Shemza was able to make contact with the Rebel Alliance and through a contact, he was able to arrange a rendezvous with the Rebel fleet. However, while he waited on Cloud City, he was attacked by a group of thugs who had been hired by Jabba Desilijic Tiure the Hutt to capture him and take him back to Tatooine.
