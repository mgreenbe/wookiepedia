Following the Battle of Hoth, all Alliance personnel were forced to evacuate the planet in the face of Imperial assault. Per standard operating procedures, as devised by General Carlist Rieekan, survivors regrouped at the secret rendezvous point, a predetermined location outside the galaxy where the Empire could not track them. However, their rendezvous point was nearly exposed when an Imperial Strike Cruiser found them, so the Alliance Fleet decided to detour in case the destroyed Strike Cruiser did indeed transmit the coordinates of the fleet to the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That point, code-named \"Haven\" by the Rebels, was located beyond the Galactic Rim, far above the galactic equatorial plane and far away from any stars. It was beyond the galaxy's gravity well, making it a perilous journey to reach, one that many of the Rebel ships escaping from Hoth may not have been able to make. It is likely that the Rebellion suffered additional losses in the attempt to reach that point."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During their hunt for the crew of the Millennium Falcon, the bounty hunters Zuckuss and 4-LOM believed Han Solo would attempt to reach the rendezvous point considering he carried vital Rebel personnel with him. Through intuitive meditation, Zuckuss determined that the rendezvous point was at the coordinates 2.427 by 3.886 by 673.52 above the galactic plane, a journey of approximately two standard days from the Hoth system. In actuality, the rendezvous point was two degrees off of these coordinates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There, High Command and a portion of the Rebel fleet, as well as many surviving personnel from Hoth, regrouped to continue their fight against the Empire. The bulk of the fleet, however, was ordered away from Hoth during the Rebels' time there, in accordance with a tactical doctrine devised by Gial Ackbar, Supreme Commander of the Alliance Fleet. High Command and the Rebel fleet were to be kept separate from each other in order to avoid being found and wiped out by the Imperial Navy in one fell swoop. It was determined that the Rebellion could withstand the loss of either High Command or its fleet, but not both."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
