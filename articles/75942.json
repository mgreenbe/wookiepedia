He was known to use a one-handed style during combat which was possibly Makashi. During his duel with General Grievous he used the Ataru opening stance. Notably, Mundi was the last Jedi standing during the grueling duel with Grievous on Hypori despite being exhausted from the battle that preceded it and while facing a style of lightsaber combat never before encountered by the Order. Later, the Cerean proved his skills in a duel with the Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress, whom he forced into retreat. Mundi would continue to wield his blue-bladed lightsaber for the rest of the war until he was killed during the execution of Order 66 on Mygeeto."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
