Around 9 ABY, he received a tracking fob to hunt down a child. The Kubaz tracked the child to the planet Sorgan where he had been taken by another bounty hunter named Din Djarin, known as \"the Mandalorian.\" Following the fob's trail through a forest, he found the Mandalorian and the child at a village. The Kubaz aimed at the Mandalorian while he talked to a resident before switching his aim to the child. However, the former rebel Carasynthia Dune sneaked behind him and shot the bounty hunter in the back before he could kill the child. The Mandalorian arrived at the scene, after hearing the shot, and rolled the Kubaz's body over, finding and destroying the tracking fob. Knowing that the Guild was after the child, the Mandalorian departed Sorgan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kubaz bounty hunter wore a black fur coat with a round metal hood.
