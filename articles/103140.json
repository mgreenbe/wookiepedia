This caused mega-corporations, such as TaggeCo, begin to exploit the planet so that they could harvest the trees. The PFL was formed to oppose their actions and began attacking corporation assets on Pamorjal. Taj Vellion, the governor of Pammorjal, was unwilling to do anything about them, but soon came under increasing pressure to act."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Dark Jedi Thaum Rystra traveled to Pamorjal in 3 ABY and was being pursued by a group of Rebel Alliance agents. To get them off his tail, he contacted the PFL and tricked them into believing that the alliance agents posed a threat to them. The PFL attacked the agents outside the Temples of Vormijj, but eventually realized that Rystra had tricked them. As they had destroyed the ship that the alliance agents had been using, the PFL gave the YT-2000 light freighter Celestial Dancer as a replacement."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
