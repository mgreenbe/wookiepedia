In 140 ABY, the Mon Calamari engineer Sauk purchased a retrofitted stabilizing coil from Jariah Syn, a companion of the Jedi Knight Cade Skywalker and Deliah Blue. While Sauk was reluctant to pay a high amount to Syn, he paid in the end since it was very hard to obtain spare parts in this star system. Sauk's purchase came at an opportune moment because he and his companions were then attacked."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
