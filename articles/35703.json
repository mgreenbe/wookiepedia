From the very beginning, she disliked answering to the Jedi Council. The Chiss had a critical view of the Council's actions, considering them stubborn and too traditional.

Dazh Ranos believed she would be better off on her own and set off for the far reaches of the known galaxy, away from the Core Worlds. She traveled the frontier and helped ordinary, everyday people with the intention of avoiding all the politics and bureaucracy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During and after the conflict with the Eternal Empire, Ranos had little contact with the Jedi Council, for they considered her to be a rogue agent and an embarrassment. By the time the news of the war reached her at the edges of space, the Council had already gone into hiding. She openly revealed her indifference regarding the fate of the Council, uncaring whether they kept holding secret meetings or were all dead already. By now, she considered the Eternal Alliance a lot more important than the Jedi Order ever was. She believed that the Alliance Commander's actions affected trillions of lives in the galaxy for better or for worse and that joining the Alliance would let her accomplish more than she ever could have done on her own."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Ranos was accepted into the Alliance but wondered still what her former Master would have had to say about it.

She disliked meditating in the Jedi Temple on Tython all day, and had no interest in the grand scheme of politics and bureaucracy, considering it more important to help the people who lived outside the Core Worlds. The Chiss considered herself quite independent and struggled with taking orders from anybody but herself. Master Ranos also believed that the dark side came from putting oneself before others and that true servants of the Force were automatically servants of the light. Dazh Ranos was also very proud of her skill with the lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ranos wielded two metallic vented Crossguard lightsabers powered by blue lightsaber crystals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Master Ranos debuted in the 2016 expansion Knights of the Eternal Throne for the Star Wars: The Old Republic massively multiplayer online roleplaying video game.

Ranos also revealed information regarding Scourge but deemed the entire story about him more a myth-enshrouded tale to teach morality.\nIf the player is playing as Sith Warrior, Ranos reveals information regarding Jaesa Willsaam, depending whether Jaesa is affiliated with the light or dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
