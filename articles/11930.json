Several generations before the Great Galactic War, the family's eldest daughter Jhaka became a Republic fighter pilot and took on the surname Bakarn when her father disowned her. After Jhaka died leading her squadron to victory against a warlord in the Outer Rim Territories, her father changed the family name to Bakarn to honor her.
