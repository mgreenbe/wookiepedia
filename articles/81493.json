A week after the Battle of Endor of 4 ABY, the Galactic Empire's General Weir attacked the Core Worlds planet of Corellia and abducted Rebel pilot Ten Numb, bringing him to a base near the city in which Leyli resided for interrogation. The Rebel Alliance's Rogue Squadron traveled to the nearby planet of Tralus in hot pursuit of Weir; upon landing on Tralus and encountering the Selonian community there, the pilots of Rogue Squadron met with Leyli. She expressed her fear of the Sith Lord Darth Vader and Galactic Emperor Palpatine; initially doubting Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker's reports of Vader's death and the Empire's defeat at Endor, she was convinced by his assurances."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leyli decided to keep her queen uninformed of the situation until the Rebels had defeated Weir. Leyli enlisted several Selonian scouts to lead Skywalker and Rogue Squadron leader Wedge Antilles to Weir's base, where the general was holding Numb.

Numb would later be found dead by Rogue Wes Janson."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leyli was a cautious and pragmatic individual; concerned with the protection of her community and queen on Tralus, those tendencies were motivated by fear of Darth Vader and Palpatine.
