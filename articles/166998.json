Upon arriving at the station Yorr and his copilot Jendon made final readings, monitored descent functions. It was a sequence they'd each performed a thousand times. Yorr requested clearance to land and transmitted the transmission code. The port controller, Endicott, said that the shield would be deactivated when the code was confirmed.

Yorr appeared in Richard Marquand's 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, where he was portrayed by actor Jasper Jacob. Jasper spent two days filming his work during March 1982. Jasper had a hard time memorizing his dialog. This lead to them having to do many takes, but director Richard Marquand was very understanding.
