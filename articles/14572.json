The battle was also led by the colonists destroying the Gurlanins food supply and refusing to leave when asked. The Galactic Republic provided training and low-grade weapons to the colonists in an effort to receive aid in removing the Separatists that remained after Etain and Jedi Master Arligan Zey rooted out the Separatist network. Due to the request to try and remove the colonists alive, the clone troopers were limited in their abilities. After Etain took leave, Levet took charge of the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
