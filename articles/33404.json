Two years into the war, Teep served in the Republic's elite X-wing starfighter squadron, Rogue Squadron, flying as Rogue Seven. High attrition levels during the war forced Rogue Squadron to accept members who lacked experience, allowing Teep and others to gain a place in the renowned squadron, where in better times, they may not have qualified."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the New Republic retook the planet Borleias from a Yuuzhan Vong occupation force in the aftermath of the fall of Coruscant to the invaders, Teep and Rogue Squadron were stationed in the Republic garrison on the planet, under the overall command of General Wedge Antilles. The Yuuzhan Vong had launched a campaign to wrest control of Borleias back from the Republic, and after many skirmishes, Antilles was forced to withdraw his forces until they were concentrated in a tight perimeter around the old Alderaanian Biotics facility on the planet, which was slowly being surrounded by Yuuzhan Vong ground troops."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Yuuzhan Vong launched an aerial raid on the biotics facility, Teep and Rogue Squadron were called into action. The Rogues, now reduced to just nine members, were organized into three shield trios\u2014groups of three starfighters that, while flying in close formation, would extend the radius of their deflector shields and inertial compensators to provide overlapping coverage of the three-ship formation\u2014with Teep assigned to Jedi Master Corran Horn's trio along with the Sullustan Leth Liav.

Horn, aware of the danger, ordered Teep to evade, and the main ball of plasma passed Teep harmlessly. However, when the plasma ball hit the facility's shields, the resulting concussion hammered Teep, Horn, and Liav, sending their fighters into spins. Horn regained control of his fighter first, and watched as Teep and Liav rolled as they fell, out of control, toward the jungle below. Liav managed to come out of her roll not far above the treetops; however, Teep could not regain control of his fighter in time, and the teenager's fighter punched through the treetops, exploding in a fireball.
