It had a thin atmosphere and was home to the Ordo Moon Dragon, a creature that fed on raw energy. After defecting from the newly-formed Galactic Empire, the former clone troopers of Clone Force 99 crashed their shuttle, the Havoc Marauder, onto the moon when damage to the starship sustained from a previous skirmish on Saleucami threw them out of hyperspace. While Tech and Echo donned breath masks and attempted to repair their shuttle, an Ordo Moon Dragon stole their replacement capacitor and ran off. Hunter and Omega went out to retrieve the device, and although Hunter temporarily lost his breath mask and fell unconscious in a skirmish with the creature, Omega infiltrated its den and grabbed the device, allowing them to repair the Havoc Marauder and escape the moon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ordo Moon had rocky terrain and an atmosphere which humans could not breathe unassisted, necessitating the use of breath masks. The moon also had weather patterns which could interfere with long-range communications. Its landscape contained holes which led to underground tunnels and warrens. It was inhabited by Ordo Moon Dragons, a species which fed on energy and dwelt in the moon's warrens. The moon orbited a blue gas giant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 19 BBY, the fugitive Clone Force 99, who had recently defected from the newly-formed Galactic Empire, fought a skirmish at a spaceport town on Saleucami against Imperial clone troopers. During their escape, their shuttle, the Havoc Marauder, was struck by enemy blaster fire. The damage the starship sustained included problems with one of its capacitors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Marauder travelled through hyperspace, the damage it had taken, which Echo was attempting to fix by himself while Tech instead worked on building an inhibitor chip scanner, finally forced it back into realspace and onto a collision course with the Ordo Moon. As everyone strapped themselves in, Echo and Tech managed to bring the Marauder to a rough landing inside of a crater. Subsequently, the blown capacitor was identified as the problem, and Tech checked the ship's inventory to confirm that they only had one spare onboard. After locating the space, Echo and Tech donned breath masks and went outside to replace it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the repair was going on, the ship's energy drew the attention of one of the moon's native dragons, which left scratches on the Marauder's hull with its claws. As Tech worked to secure the capacitor, Echo thought he heard something, looking around with a flashlight to discover the additional damage. He called Tech over to look, and as Tech noted that the scratches were new, the dragon stole the capacitor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back onboard, Echo told Hunter about the situation, and mentioned that the moon's storms were interfering with communications. While the adults were discussing it in the main hold, the child clone Omega, sitting in the cockpit by herself, was frightened upon seeing the dragon through the ship's windscreen, before it ran off into the dark, which prompted the others to join her. It was quickly realized that the creature had stolen the capacitor, and Hunter decided to go after it, ordering Wrecker to stay on the ship because he had been complaining of a headache. Omega persuaded Hunter to allow her to come along, and the two donned breath masks and headed out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hunter tracked the dragon to the entrance of its underground den on the moon's surface, where he and Omega saw the capacitor lying on the surface. Telling Omega to stay back, he drew his blaster pistol and approached the device, only for the dragon to emerge from behind the den entrance and leap at him, knocking him down and his mask off. The dragon subsequently took back the capacitor and retreated underground. Unable to breathe, Hunter fell unconscious quickly as Omega panicked. She retrieved his mask and put it on him, asking him to wake up, but he did not immediately come to although he was breathing again. Unable to reach the Marauder on her comlink, Omega took Hunter's pistol and flashlight and resolved to retrieve the capacitor herself, entering the dragon's den."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Crawling through the passages, Omega shortly found the dragon's primary den and the capacitor. However, she was then frightened by the creature itself. Panicking, Omega aimed the blaster at the creature before realizing that the light from her flashlight was somehow bothering it, and it retreated after she switched the light off. Noting the creature's interest in the device, Omega distracted the dragon by throwing it into a corner, leading the dragon to gnaw on the flashlight and devour its energy. Hearing a revived Hunter shouting for her outside, Omega retrieved the capacitor and exited the den. The two subsequently returned to the Marauder, and the ship was able to depart after the capacitor was installed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
