The Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure ate chuba stew and had it prepared by a chef loyal to him. However, by the year 32 BBY, the chef had been killed during an assassination attempt on Jabba by the Twi'lek Romi Moola. Moola poisoned a chuba stew being prepared by the chef in the hope that Jabba would consume it. The chef instead tried some first and died in Jabba's place, which led to Jabba placing a bounty on Moola's head. Chuba was the Huttese name for the gorg, a species of non-sentient animal that the Hutts ate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chuba stew was first mentioned in Romi Moola's bounty posting in the video game strategy guide Star Wars: Bounty Hunter: Prima's Official Strategy Guide, which was written by David Hodgson and released by Prima Games in November 2002. Shortly afterwards in December, the posting appeared in the video game Star Wars: Bounty Hunter itself, which was released by LucasArts. Neither the guide nor game make an explicit connection between the stew and the chuba species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
