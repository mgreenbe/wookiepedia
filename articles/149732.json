The Knights were able to swiftly overwhelm Solo in his unarmed state, forcing him to the ground and beating him. However, through the use of their Force-bond, Rey was able to give Solo his grandfather's lightsaber. With Anakin's lightsaber, Ben swiftly cut down Kuruk and Cardo before force pushing Ap'lek into a pit, and then cutting Vicrul down. Afterwards Trudgen attempted to attack his former leader, but was effortlessly stabbed in the chest before he could swing his vibrocleaver."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trudgen was Force-sensitive and an adept of the dark side of the Force but he was untrained which made his powers stunted. As his fellow Knights, Trudgen's fighting skills and martial prowess were without equal. A remarkable achievement performed by Trudgen in the past was defeating a death trooper, given the death troopers' strength and rarity. Although he was a very powerful individual, he was quickly killed with a stab through his chest by his redeemed former leader, Ben Solo, during the Battle of Exegol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A collector of trophies from fallen conquests, Trudgen used to add the weapons and armors from previous victories. His patchwork helmet, for example, once belonged to a death trooper he defeated in the past."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trudgen's signature weapon was an enormous vibrocleaver. The vibrocleaver was made of crucible steel with phrik or beskar filaments. Although his weapon could be cut through by a lightsaber, it would require great pressure to do so. The primitive weapon was modified with ultrasonic technology that vibrates the blade to give it extra cutting power. When not in use Trudgen would put the blunt end over his shoulder on weight-reducing holes along the weapon's spine or he would put it on a bandolier over his back. Trudgen also carried a large secondary blade sheathed on his torso."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trudgen wore all black like the rest of the Knights of Ren. He wore a heavy tabard and hood with scavenged armor plates all along his torso.
