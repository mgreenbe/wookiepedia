The only remnant of their civilization was ceramic statues containing crystals that gave them the energy to move when sentient brain activity on the planet suddenly stopped, such as when a sentient being died. When that happened, a number of statues corresponding to the amount of organisms that just died would begin moving towards the corpse or corpses before carrying them away, presumably to the chamber the statues came from."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
