As the company headed to the medical frigate TB-73 going to the Ord Cestus medical station, the infected clone brought more eggs in his backpack and eventually infected the entire clone crew. The clones took control of the ship, attacking its other members, and proceeded to infect Barriss Offee. Ahsoka Tano ruptured the ship's coolant system, weakening the worms. Subsequently, Ahsoka and the infected Barriss dueled, but the cold finally got to the worm in Barriss, and Ahsoka killed it as it was crawling out. Barriss and all clone troopers aboard the ship besides Trap, the pilots, and two other clones were saved. Trap and the other two clones were killed by Barriss and Ahsoka in self-defense, and the pilots were killed by infected clone troopers Ox and Edge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin Skywalker later speculated that use of the parasite might explain how the Geonosians were able to recapture their planet prior to the Second Battle of Geonosis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
