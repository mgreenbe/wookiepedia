It was built some twelve years after the Battle of Endor, and was named for the illicit refining of Rokna that took place during the early years of the New Republic. However, due to the New Republic's swift crackdown on the production of Rokna blue, the station was abandoned just ten months after its completion. The drug kingpin known as \"Blue\" Imcrix tried to re-establish the production facilities on the station, but the New Republic quickly shut him down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
