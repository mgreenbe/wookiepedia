It was scheduled to rendezvous with the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Warrior bearing a cargo of Mon Calamari slaves. As this class of freighter had never been designed to carry life forms, conditions on board were brutal and overcrowded. On the way to its rendezvous, the ship was disabled by Rebel Alliance Y-wings so that Citadel 2, another BFF-1 bulk freighter, could dock with it and liberate the slaves. While this action was being executed, Rebel pilot Halley Kadorto held off wave after wave of TIE/sa bombers and TIE/LN starfighter. The freighter was presumably destroyed shortly afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
