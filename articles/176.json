It held enough power to disable an AT-ST, and its rugged dependability meant it could function even in the harshest environments."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tower functioned by having its single laser cannon fire from the center of the energy dish, which had 16 micropower routers evenly spaced along the edge of eight power conversion cells along the interior. Despite its ability to offer soldiers a 360\u00b0 field of fire due to a rotating base, along with operational capability in temperatures ranging from -73\u00b0C to 49\u00b0C, it was inexpensive, quick and easy to produce."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The P-Tower was used throughout the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War on worlds such as Hoth, Tatooine, and Endor. They were notably used by the Rebel Alliance during the Battle of Hoth, though they proved ineffective at penetrating the armor of the All Terrain Armored Transports of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
