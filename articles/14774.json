K'Kruhk's battalion made it to the lip of the canyon, and made a final assault. K'Kruhk led his troops from the front, but knew the Separatists had the advantage in numbers. He ordered his clones to fall back, but they assured him they could achieve victory. K'Kruhk was unprepared to send so many men to their deaths, though the clones knew this is what they had been bred for; to fight and die in battle. With a weary heart, K'Kruhk pressed the attack, and though the battleship was destroyed, only the Jedi General, CRC-09/571, and several clone troopers appeared to have survived the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "K'Kruhk was shell-shocked by his ordeal, and fled Teyr without informing the Jedi Council of his survival.
