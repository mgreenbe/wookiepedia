During the Clone Wars, the clone trooper Cutup was devoured by a rishi eel. Later during the same incident, Clone Captain Rex killed a Rishi eel in self-defence by shooting it in the eye after he and Clone Commander Cody had escaped an ambush by BX-series droid commandos. After encountering the three surviving rookie clone troopers \u2014 Fives, Echo, and Hevy \u2014 Rex left a handprint in blue eel blood on Echo's breastplate while explaining what the term \"shiny\" meant. After being inducted into the 501st Legion after the battle, Fives painted an eel onto his helmet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The eels were extremely dangerous, and thus regulations for Rishi Station personnel mandated that they not go outside under normal circumstances, as the eels were capable of killing and eating adult humans.
