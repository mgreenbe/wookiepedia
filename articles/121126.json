Clone scout troopers of the 41st Elite Corps and Clone shadow troopers were also known to carry these weapons during the latter stages of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This compact, one-handed blaster was fitted with a side-mounted targeting scope and phase amplifier, and featured a miniature gas cell on the rear. The weapon had a short-range barrel. Scout troopers commonly carried these weapons in a boot holster of their armor. Because scout troopers wore padded gloves, the pistol had a pressure-sensitive grip rather than a trigger. The trooper was able to hold the grip with two gloved fingers through the enlarged finger guard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
