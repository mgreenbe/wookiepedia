In the aftermath of the Battle of Balmorra, Fiskin ran an election campaign for the new Balmorran government, in which his major opponent was a former Balmorran resistance member, Zenith. Fiskin arranged an arrest of Zenith's followers on Balmorra over an operation, which supposedly killed civilians in addition to Imperial soldiers. Zenith hit back by revealing that Fiskin once took a bribe from an Imperial official, after which hundreds of Fiskin's supporters switched over to Zenith.
