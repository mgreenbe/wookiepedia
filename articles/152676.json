In transit, rumors that Darth Vader was on his way spread among the crews. The transport landed on Geddes and discharged a squad of Heavy troopers, three T1-B hovertanks, and three Pummels, along with the army's leaders, Princess Leia Organa and the exiled Jedi Echuu Shen-Jon. The protocol droid C-3PO was also a passenger. The army, along with a force of Wookiees, raided the Galactic Empire research facility on Geddes and stole the ancient Jedi artifact Vor'Na'Tu. On their way back to the transport, they were ambushed by Darth Vader. Shen-Jon sacrificed himself to allow Organa to escape on the transport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The transport appears in the second Princess Leia campaign in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds as the \"Landed Rebel Transport\" model.
