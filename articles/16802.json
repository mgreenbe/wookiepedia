It was tied into a vehicle's main control computer and then cross-connected to the main drive control package. The device was controlled by a hand-held voice recognition link, and the user could program a series of syllables into the module. If a thief attempted to steal the vehicle, the BiVVoL would prevent the vehicle's ignition and flight control systems from being activated unless the proper sequence was inputted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Forging the code required the use of a top grade voice replicator. A failed attempt to bypass the system would lock-out the vehicle's control mechanisms. The owner of the vehicle could activate a secondary activation system that used datakeys, datachips, the activation of a certain sub-routine, switches being activated in a certain order, or a variety of scans including retinal, fingerprint, and genetic code."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Blizz Pinnix used a vehicle voice lock to secure his prized, one-of-a-kind speeder bike, the Black Raptor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
