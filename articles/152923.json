He had a scar running across his face. In 21 BBY, he was at the controls along with a Rodian when the ship was carrying droid brains to the Fondor Shipyards. When it was near Shipwrights' Trace, the freighter was intercepted by a pirate ship. The ship lost two of the thrusters and the deflector shield generator during the attack. The pirate captain, Dool Pundar, got the freighter to surrender and sent B1-Series battle droids to secure it. The Human then joined the rest of the crew in an escape pod as Pundar took the freighter. At the time, the man was wearing a blue uniform with brown epaulets and a breastplate, along with a bandolier and gloves. The crew was later safely recovered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Human appears in 2011's The Clone Wars: Strange Allies, a comic tie-in to the Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Secret Missions series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
