SIS agents Carteri and Izak began hunting Coral down with the help of two other Project 32 subjects. At some point Coral was contacted by another one of Project 32 subjects Mako, who had no memory of the Project and believed Coral was her sister. Coral used this opportunity to set her up into meeting with Izak on Dromund Kaas instead of her, to throw him off her tail. Coral was eventually tracked down by Izak to the Gudnem's Gadget Emporium on Nar Shaddaa, though Mako got there first and confronted Coral. Coral claimed that Mako was not a real person and called her a \"cheap copy\". Izak and his men arrived shortly after and took Coral into custody."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Coral appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during Mako companion storyline."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
