After killing Faye Patrick, one of the slavers, the spacer managed to find the camp and the escaped slaves. The spacer agreed to help the former slaves and moved to the Corellian Slaver Bunker. The spacer fought several guards but successfully infiltrated the bunker. With the help of several slaves, the spacer managed to access the depth of the bunker, and even killed the slavemaster. The spacer finally sliced the bunker's main computer. Using the bunker's own communications array, the spacer broadcasted the slavers' records on the CorSec emergency request channels. Dozens of CorSec agents quickly moved to the slaver bunker and freed all the slaves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Corellian Slaver Bunker was a location in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
