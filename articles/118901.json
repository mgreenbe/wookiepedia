Part of a line of reliable and uncomplicated riot control equipment, the SWE/2 was one of the more unique weapons available from its maker, firing sound waves from a powerful acoustic generator in concentrated beams similar to the output of a blaster. Designed to be capable of taking down even the toughest of trouble-maker, the rifle's beam could not be parried by a lightsaber, a feature of limited use in the SWE/2 but more of a selling point for its predecessor the SWE/1 sonic suppressor which was available during the Clone Wars when the Jedi Order fought for the Galactic Republic against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Any being struck by the beam would find their fine motor centers shorted out, staggering them and impacting on their balance and hearing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The SWE/2 sonic rifle was first mentioned in Far Horizons, a reference book for Star Wars: Edge of the Empire released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2014 and written by Sam Stewart."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
