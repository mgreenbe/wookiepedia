Nevertheless, around 1 ABY, the Meatlumps discovered her activities and decided to stop her. The Meatlump sublieutenant Merkie Howzat and a group of Meatlump stooges attacked her speeder in Coronet, overturned it while she was driving. Korr was thrown clear and knocked unconscious. The woman was rescued by CorSec troopers and she was hospitalized in the Coronet Hospital. This attack almost put her research to a complete halt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short time later, a spacer witnessed a group of Meatlumps vandalizing some power generators in Coronet and intervened. The result was some fierce combat, in which the Meatlumps were defeated. Just after the initial fighting had ceased, Merkie Howzat arrived at the scene only to be defeated by the traveler, too. The traveler found a viewscreen with the Corellia Times logo on it and decided to find its owner. The spacer met with a Corellia Times employee, Finn Shallo, outside the newspaper building, who told the traveler that the viewscreen belonged to Vani Korr and suggested that the traveler meet her in the hospital. When the traveler arrived, Vani saw an opportunity to finish her work on the Meatlumps and asked for the traveler's help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The traveler agreed to help her retrieve a number of Meatlump datapads with vital information on them. The traveler stalked the Meatlump hangout spots around Coronet and managed to acquire nine datapads, which were delivered to Vani. Unfortunately for Vani, the datapads were encrypted, and a passcode was needed to access their contents. Vani, however, devised a shrewd plan. She reckoned that the members of the higher echelons of the Meatlump hierarchy might have the passcode. The traveler was to go to one of the many Meatlump camps scattered around Coronet and send an emergency signal from their communication device to the Meatlump headquarters, which was most likely to prompt them to send a lieutenant to investigate the call. When the lieutenant arrived, the traveler was to persuade him to tell the code to the traveler. The plan was executed, and after some aggressive negotiations, the traveler acquired the code\u2014which was actually just \"meatlumps\"\u2014and passed it on to Vani, who was now able to finish her investigation and write the first part of a revealing article on the Meatlumps entitled Who are the Meatlumps?. As a token of gratitude, Vani Korr gave the traveler an advance print of her article as well as a small amount of credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Examination of the datapads revealed that one communication contained a mention to a \"King of the Meatlumps.\" Vani Korr thought it was exactly the kind of scoop she was hoping for and decided to investigate further. To prove the existence of the Meatlump King, she needed to find him first. She thus tasked the spacer to find the Meatlump Hideout. With this aim in view, she started tracking recent crimes of vandalism against machinery and technology in order to find a link to the Meatlumps. The first she found was an attack against Talan Joben's crate-manufacturing company in which machinery and crates were destroyed. However, the spacer discovered that the retired explorer turned terrorist Riyan Kiner was responsible. Vani later found a droid engineer, Zorajas Garamin, who claimed his droids had been sabotaged. Again, it was a dead end since Garamin was in fact a delusional farmer who tried to culture droids by planting them in the soil. The spacer then traveled to Talus to meet a speeder bike racer by the name Sul Prine. While the presence of Meatlumps on another world was unlikely, Prine pretended that a band of Meatlumps destroyed the speeder bikes parked at his place. The spacer hence discovered that a group of Meatlumps led by the lieutenant Strilath Farles was actually based on Talus. The adventurer encountered Strilath Farles in Doaba Guerfel and tried to negotiate the location of the Meatlump Hideout in exchange for some help against Gramo Murah's Ragtags. However, the spacer was deceived since Farles ignored the location of the hideout."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next lead was finally the right one. Vani Korr received word that a Meatlump was smashing generators in Coronet. This old Meatlump, Alliin Mepou, was quite disillusioned but he could not retire from the Meatlumps unless a new person take his place. The spacer, who realized he could use this situation to infiltrate the Meatlumps, indeed accepted to replace the old man. The spacer therefore went to work for Alliin Mepou's lieutenant: Kaiya Merel. The woman considered positively the admission of the adventurer among the Meatlumps but not without testing this new recruit. As a first mission, the spacer was tasked to help two Rogue CorSec officers, Erinn Bonette and Echdo Bervekk, to hijack a shuttle. Then, Kaiya Merel ordered her new recruit to disrupt the plans of one of her rivals, another Meatlump lieutenant by the name Stephax Dain. The spacer traveled to Naboo's moon of Rori and killed Dain to not let him get any credit for his successful attack of a Weapons Research Facility. Kaiya Merel was extremely satisfied of the death of her rival and definitively accepted the spacer among the Meatlumps. Finally, she also gave the spacer the location of the Meatlump Hideout, located in some abandoned maintenance tunnels below Coronet, and free access to it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Vani Korr's work was giving positive results, another Corellia Times reporter, Halden Wes, joined the investigation to assist the young woman. While she focused on the Meatlump Hideout on Corellia, Wes was more interested in the Meatlump activities and violent actions committed on other worlds. In the meantime, the spacer entered the Meatlump Hideout and finally encountered the legendary Meatlump King. The information gathered in the hideout allowed Vani Korr to finalize her article."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vani Korr was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
