It was generally built upon the same principles as squadrons serving with the Combined Defense Forces of the New Republic and the Imperial Navy, however the tactics of the flightknife varied greatly as the object, according to Adumari tradition, was to kill the most prestigious pilots of the enemy flightknife first. The Adumari of Cartann had a long tradition of aerial \"duels\" that involved challenges issued to other flightknives; who could challenge and who could accept challanges varied and was the subject of a complicated series of rules and protocols."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Further, during peacetime a flightknife seldom operated at full capacity; units based in Cartann, for example, often quartered as half-flightknives of six pilots apiece."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
