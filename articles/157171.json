It was an old droid, with outdated programming that rendered it barely sentient at all. After it informed Netal of the existence of her next mission, it began counting down from ten. Alerted to the fact that the droid was a bomb, Netal accepted the unknown mission. The droid projected a hologram of the cloaked being, telling Netal to find a steel case owned by TK-1472, a dead stormtrooper captain. Thirty seconds after the message ended, the droid exploded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
