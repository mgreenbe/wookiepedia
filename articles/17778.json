The blaster emitter was tiny, with almost no Galven circuitry implemented, giving it a maximum range of mere centimeters. However, while effective, the Blast Knuckles were also dangerous for the wielder, who was prone to suffering the effects of overheating or even splash damage should the glove bunch awkwardly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
