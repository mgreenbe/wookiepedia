Farrelly was assigned to the Rebel hospital as protection for the Rebels who were wounded during the evacuation of Hoth. However, while Tomaas Azzameen, piloting the Vasudra, was delivering bacta to the Rebels, The Star Destroyer Corrupter and a pair of Lancer-class frigates, the Cascade and the Blue Hawk, dropped out of hyperspace and began a bombardment of the hospital, executed by TIE/sa bombers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Farrelly's fate is unclear, as it is possible for the vessel to escape, or be destroyed, depending on a number of situations made possible by random AI events in X-Wing Alliance, as well as the actions of the player. Adding further ambiguity to the situation is the fact that not only does Farrelly only appear in XWA, it also does not appear at any point during the rest of the campaign."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
