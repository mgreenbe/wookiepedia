In circa 31 BBY, the ship was traveling through the Cularin system en route to the planet Genarius when it became caught in the Cularin system asteroid belt due to the actions of a shadow creature, which was draining passing starships of power. However, a Force Adept aboard the ship was driven mad by telepathic contact with the creature. In an attempt to escape the creature's telepathic attacks, the crew of the End Run used the ship's remaining power to fire a security cannon at the ship's landing door. The crew died instantly and their bodies drifted out into the vacuum of space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
