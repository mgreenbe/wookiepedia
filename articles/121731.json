Inside the Ghost's cockpit, Ezra Bridger, Garazeb Orrelios and Hera Syndulla are listening to a propaganda HoloNet broadcast played by the astromech droid Chopper. The Imperial newscaster, Alton Kastle, says that in 010, he'll bring exciting news happening in their galactic sector. Zeb switches off the HoloNet broadcast, stating he's not sure how much more of it he can take. Ezra remarks that he'd say whoever they're supposed to meet is late, but they don't know when they're supposed to arrive, or even who they are. Chopper beeps, and Hera says she knows as much as Ezra does, but that Senator Bail Organa trusts them, and that he trusts the Spectres to get them fuel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ezra grumbles about secrecy, and remarks that's why Kanan Jarrus volunteered for a supply run elsewhere. Chopper then plays a broadcast from Kastle announcing that Senator Mon Mothma has shocked the Imperial Senate with her \"treasonous\" remarks against Emperor Palpatine. The rebels watch Senator Mothma give a speech condemning the Emperor for ordering the brutal attacks on the people of Ghorman. She denounces the Ghorman Massacre as proof that the self-appointed Emperor is nothing more than a lying executioner who has imposed tyranny on the galaxy under the pretense of security. Ezra and Zeb marvel at what Mothma said, with the latter adding that she has guts and that he's surprised she's still alive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Suddenly, there is a proximity alert and the Spectres see a tactical infiltration pod approaching them. The pod has an E-XD-series infiltrator droid, a model which Zeb and Chopper had encountered earlier on Chopper Base. Chopper displays a hologram of the outside object to his fellow rebels. Hera is alarmed to see an Imperial probe droid out there, while Ezra remarks that the droid speaks an Imperial code. Zeb adds that this is bad, and tells them to blast it. Hera disagrees because she doesn't want to attract attention, and powers down the Ghost. She orders Ezra into the ship's nose gun. Chopper is also switched off, despite his protests."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hera tells her crew to stay silent as the infiltration pod passes over them. Zeb doesn't think the droid saw them, but Hera is not convinced. Inside the pod, the droid mumbles in an Imperial code and flies its craft towards the Ghost. Hera realizes the pod is scanning for lifeforms, and Zeb sarcastically states that that's \"great\", noting that they can't fire with the power off. Ezra waits for the pod to approach their ship. At Hera's signal, Ezra fires the Ghost's frontal turbolasers at the pod but misses. The Ghost pursues the pod, but Ezra is unable to get a clean shot in the debris field. As the chase continues, a large freighter with a Y-wing escort emerges from hyperspace.

Hera introduces Ezra, Zeb and Chopper."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Ezra asks what they are transporting, Erskin tells them they won't be able to board the Chandrila Mistress due to security conditions.

Zeb sets the record straight: they only blew up Tarkin's Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The female pilot sharply tells them to think again before they pull another stunt like that, because the Empire has tightened security across the Outer Rim. She blames the Spectres for making things harder for them. Zeb retorts that they like to do things the hard way. Captain Vander breaks up the argument and chides the Spectres for drawing the Empire's attention by destroying the probe. When the Captain tells them that this assignment is sensitive, Ezra responds that they should have given them more information rather than being so sensitive about their assignment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chopper then utters an insult in Binary at the female pilot, who takes offense. Hera backs her crew and tells the other rebels that her crew did the best they could, but that they did not get sufficient information.

Hera and Chopper rush to detach the hatch."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Captain Vander orders his pilots to form a defensive perimeter around the Chandrila Mistress. Hera and Chopper reach the docking hatch just as they receive word from Erskin Semaj that the transport's shields have been lost. Hera tells him to get everyone onboard the Ghost, while attempting to pull the lever so the two ships can detach.

Mothma disagrees, and says she won't hide because her presence at the meeting is not optional.
