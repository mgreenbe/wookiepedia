The play featured lots of combat, with actors running through the auditorium, holographic effects and plenty of explosions. During the climax, Kinzic realized that the hated clan Towon planned on exterminating her clan; she got revenge by activating a thermal detonator in the midst of a clan Towon victory celebration. The stage would be littered with bodies, as was rather typical of Rodian drama."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
