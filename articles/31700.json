His partner, Tahnchukka, a grey-furred Wookiee, did not object and helped him to smuggle the beings offworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of the nature of the story The Clone Wars: Decide Your Destiny: The Way of the Jedi, multiple endings are possible. In one ending, Crovan Dane is eaten by a Terentatek, while in another he makes the delivery and repays Ziro Desilijic Tiure with the cash Panith gave him. In another he takes Jedi Initiate Jaylen Kos as a partner and together they execute Jedi Master Bant Eerin's Padawan. In another he is arrested and probably killed by Ziro and Goomi or else he is injured by Goomi and rejoins the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
