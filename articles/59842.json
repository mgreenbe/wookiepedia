Notably, Kalonia recommended that Organa incorporate jogan fruit into her diet.

She had a friendly relationship with Greer Sonnel, Senator Organa's personal assistant, whose bloodburn she treated with occasional injections of Hadeira serum. Following the Napkin Bombing which damaged the New Republic senatorial complex's conference building, Kalonia treated Organa and Sonnel's moderate injuries at a nearby medcenter. She told her patients to stop talking so that she could attend to her work. Later, Kalonia and a med droid loaded a treated Organa onto a transport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Kalonia treated Sonnel for a bloodburn attack after she collapsed prior to her mission to Sibensko to investigate Rinnrivin Di's cartel and the Amaxine warriors.

Kalonia tended to Finn in the intensive care unit of the D'Qar base, marking one of the few instances in her career that she treated lightsaber wounds. Finn survived, and Kalonia's prognosis was positive, though his final status would not be certain until he fully recovered. After treating Finn, Kalonia personally informed Rey about his recovery. Finn recovered shortly afterwards, as Kalonia promised."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Harter Kalonia was a light-skinned human female with dark hair and brown eyes.

The silver and red rank badge of an army major was attached to the left side of her chest, and the dark armband of medical services (bearing the word \"MED\" in aurebesh) was wrapped around her left upper arm. Kalonia used a well-equipped medical field kit that allowed her to treat blaster burns. It contained antiseptic field generators, bacta bulbs, and synthflesh dispensera.
