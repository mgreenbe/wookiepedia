Darth Vader visits the smuggler in the prison cell and orders them to open a box. The smuggler is able to open the box due to them being a descendant of Lady Corvax. Vader then leaves at which point a Mustafarian tells the smuggler that he has to get out of there or else Vader will use them to find a crystal called the Bright Star. After handing the smuggler a hydrospanner they are able to escape. They make it to the hangar but are spotted, the Mustafarian says the only way out is to go down into the caves below now and the smuggler and ZO-E3 escape by climbing through the emergency hatch. After crawling through the ductwork of Vader's castle they end up in a maintenance area right by Vader's chambers. Here they overhear Vader being told about a device called the Aeon Engine by a shadowy figure. With it he is told that he can have incredible power and could possibly resurrect the dead. They then see that Vader has an echo of Padm\u00e9 Amidala's soul preserved in a crystal structure, though he is unable to communicate with her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After this the smuggler and ZO-E3 escape to another room where the smuggler finds a lightsaber. After a brief lesson from a training droid they sneak out and into more maintenance ducts. From here they make it to a loading platform and steal a skiff after a quick battle with stormtroopers, and after this they enter a temple that the Empire had uncovered with their excavation. From there a Mustafarian Priestess explains how Mustafar was once a lush green world, where the Mustafarians lived peacefully with Lady Corvax and her husband. When an unknown enemy attacked the planet however, Corvax was mortally wounded. In response Lady Corvax stole the Bright Star and used it to power the Aeon Engine. This resulted in her husband being trapped between worlds and the life energy of Mustafar drained turning it into the planet it now is."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She and a guard quickly depart after saying the smuggler must retrieve the Bright Star and Vader cannot be allowed to have it. After this a squad of stormtroopers enter and Vader quickly tosses the rambling ZO-E3 aside. Vader then gives the smuggler the box and the smuggler uses it to activate a lift. Shortly after lowering however a number of ancient droids activate and begin to attack. Vader orders his men to protect the prisoner however they are wiped out quickly. Once the droids are defeated Vader confiscates the smuggler's lightsaber and says they must continue on and he won't be denied."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Poster gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
