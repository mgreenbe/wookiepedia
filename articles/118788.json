When presented with something they considered a mess, they would attempt to clean it even if their limitations rendered them unable to do so. Though limited, the protocol droid C-3PO considered SP-80s and others of their series the core of droid operations. SP-80 cleaners were blocky and tripod-shaped  with bronze colored plating. They used a droid language that C-3PO could not fully understand, even with his translational analog function."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SP-80 cleaners were among the wide variety of droid models stationed aboard the Eye of Palpatine when Luke Skywalker and C-3PO investigated the massive Dreadnaught in 12 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
