He used a T-28 repeating sniper rifle, and joined the Hand of Judgment after he and his friends, Daric LaRone, Korlo Brightwater, Saberan Marcross, and Joak Quiller were forced to leave (on a TL-1800 Suwantek Systems freighter) after the accidental death of Imperial Security Bureau agent Major Drelfin. He then, after leaving the Reprisal, went to Drunost and stopped a swoop gang from attacking a farmer with brand new equipment. They then fled from Drunost and went to Janusar where they had their speeders confiscated and attacked Cav'Saran to get them back. They later found that Cav'Saran was in cahoots with a pirate gang the Bloodscars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
