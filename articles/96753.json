However, the Pa'lowicks were forced to undertake back-breaking labor, so a number of them abandoned their masters and established New Lowick, which they modeled on a traditional Pa'lowick village."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Word of New Lowick eventually reached the CSA and they sent retrieval teams there, to capture Pa'lowicks who had breached their CSA work contracts. In addition, the CSA also captured a number of Pa'lowicks who were legally free, then brought the captives back to the mines. New Lowick eventually developed into a thriving community, but the CSA continued to raid it occasionally and posed a constant threat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
