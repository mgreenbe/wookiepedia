Throughout its existence, it became increasingly corrupt, the Senators elected to represent the interests of their people beholden to powerful organizations and individuals who controlled events behind the scenes. During the Clone Wars, the Senate ceded increasingly greater powers to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who eventually created the Galactic Empire out of the ashes of Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems that had split from it, and claimed the title of Galactic Emperor. The Galactic Senate was allowed continued existence as a sham of democracy, becoming the Imperial Senate, until it was finally dissolved in 0 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Anakin Skywalker discussed the nature of the Jedi, Anakin tried to argue that the Jedi weren't political, but Palpatine felt that any organization that existed in a democracy was political in some way. As the Delegation of 2000 discussed their growing concern over Palpatine's power grab, Bail Organa expressed that they could not let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight, and Mon Mothma that Palpatine had become an enemy of democracy. Padm\u00e9 Amidala, the wife of Skywalker, then explained that she was involved in the Delegation of 2000's activities, including denouncing the Supreme Chancellor as a threat to Democracy. Skywalker then explained it was all behind them, although Padm\u00e9 questioned whether he meant what she had done, or democracy itself. Later, Palpatine expressed to Skywalker that the Jedi did not trust him, the Senate, the Republic or even democracy itself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When speaking with Anakin Skywalker regarding her growing concerns about the direction of the Clone Wars, Padm\u00e9 Amidala worried that the democracy they were fighting for no longer existed. Later, when Amidala stated that the Jedi Council was the bedrock of the Republic, he replied that its bedrock was democracy, something that the Council didn't like. After Anakin fell to the dark side of the Force and came to visit her, she wondered if democracy was something that was now in the past."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Palpatine gave a speech swearing himself in as Galactic Emperor, he declared \"Now is the time!

George Lucas, when discussing the political elements behind Attack of the Clones, explained that, due to his upbringing in the 1960s, he saw it as democracies devolving into dictatorships due to their being voted in by the people, and cited examples in history such as Julius Caesar regarding the Roman Republic, Napoleon Bonaparte regarding Revolutionary France, and Adolf Hitler regarding the Weimar Republic. During the 2005 Cannes Film Festival showing of Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, George Lucas reiterated his statement, although he also implied that George W. Bush's War in Iraq was one of the first signs of the United States transforming from a democracy into a dictatorship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
