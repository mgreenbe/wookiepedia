Skirata's adopted clone son, Ordo, reminded the veteran Mandalorian that the need to import supplies to a sparse backwater such as Cheravh made it an illogical fall-back choice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cheravh was first mentioned in the 2009 novel, Imperial Commando: 501st, by author Karen Traviss.
