Grievous hired Ay-Dee to oversee the Separatist operations on the planet Hissrich, a job the droid mercenary only accepted after seeing the pay he would get from the job."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While in Hissrich, AD-W4 first heard of some Jedi's arrival when they ambushed one of the droid patrols. AD-W4 learned of this when a B1 battle droid reported it to him. Later on, Rissa Mano accidentally activated a B1-series battle droid scout, which gave AD-W4 the chance to set up an ambush for the four Jedi. During the ambush on the Hissrich operation, AD-W4 faced the Jedi Master Mace Windu in single combat. The robot mercenary eventually bested him for a few seconds and escaped. He attempted to increase his credit payment by lying to General Grievous about besting and killing Windu. To this Grievous asked for Mace Windu's lightsaber as proof, which forced AD-W4 to take further action against the Jedi. Although Ay-Dee bested Windu the first time, Windu managed to critically wound Ay-Dee with his lightsaber during the second duel. Realizing that he had lost, AD-W4 detached his head from his body in an attempt to escape, but Windu managed to blow up AD-W4's head using the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Personality"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "AD-W4 was a tall, fearsome droid of an unknown model, with red photoreceptors and purple plating with red markings.
