Specifically, Aztubek fell within Mugaari Space, a semi-independent grouping of eleven star systems ruled for millennia by the sentient Mugaari species, who were wary of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some thousand years before the Galactic Civil War, Republic traders set out from the terminus of the Corellian Trade Spine at the planet Javin to reach the outer Mugaari worlds of Aztubek, High Chunah, and beyond. They sought to establish contact with the Lutrillians and Nothoiins, two other alien species ripe for trade, but these civilizations could not be reached without surrendering major profit shares to the Mugaari. The Republic eventually defeated the Mugaari in a brief, one-sided war to establish the Javin sector where Mugaari Space had been, and the Greater Javin exploded into an economic powerhouse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Rimward neighbor of Javin, the sector's governmental hub, Aztubek attracted corporate establishment.
