When Revan and his allies arrived at the station, the mercenary begged to be taken back to the surface, and when Revan headed into the station, the mercenary decided to remain in the safety of the hangar. When Revan returned to the hanger, he saw no sign of the mercenary. Instead he engaged in a duel with Darth Bandon, indicating that Bandon might have killed the mercenary."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
