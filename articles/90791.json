They had tanned brown skin, gray or white hair, and did not possess eyes. One Miraluka was Prosset Dibs, a member of the Jedi Order who went on a mission to the planet Hissrich with the Jedi Master Mace Windu and two other Jedi. He turned against his comrades after discovering the Jedi Council's intentions to exploit Hissrich. Following the fall of the Jedi Order, Dibs was a part of the Galactic Empire's Inquisitorius, taking the name Tenth Brother. The Tenth Brother traveled to the planet Mon Cala with Darth Vader and two other Inquisitors to hunt a surviving Jedi. He was killed when the Jedi at hand turned his Purge Troopers against him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Miraluka species' first appeared in Star Wars canon in the comic Jedi of the Republic \u2013 Mace Windu 1, written by Matt Owens, illustrated by Denys Cowan and released on August 30 2017.
