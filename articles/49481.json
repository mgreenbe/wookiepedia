The main principle was to be as flexible as flowing water, such that, when the opponent withdrew his saber, instead of also withdrawing, one would follow the opponent through, cutting through his body. The technique was so named due to it being analogous to the expanding of water into an empty vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After having locked sabers with Dark Jedi Sariss in a duel on Ruusan, Kyle Katarn used this technique (having been taught it by the spirit of Tal) to defeat her, killing her with a slow and deep stab through the chest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
