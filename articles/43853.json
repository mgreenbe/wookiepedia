Following an increase in Separatist activity around the moon Gus Talon during the Clone Wars, Diddar attended a conference that was held on the world to discuss how to address the problem. The meeting took place within an automated facility and the event was hijacked by a rogue Separatist GNK power droid, which took over the structure's controls. Amid the chaos Diddar was ensnared by two mechanical arms that were affixed to the walls of the building.
