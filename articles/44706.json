The Ithorian Doctor Farnsworth used these devices during his study of the jungles around the city of Kachirho on the planet Kashyyyk. In 1 ABY, five of the Ithorian's environmental survey devices stopped transmitting their data to him, likely due to atmospheric disturbance. As a result, Farnsworth hired a spacer to go out and collect the data by hand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Environmental survey devices appeared in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
