This machine was used by Captain Phasma to make her chrome-plated armor. The synthicator was present in the Con Star facility on Parnassos. The machine required one to power it up and Phasma made the armor by feeding the machine chrome sheets and then going through the scanning chamber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
