After individuals were captured by Investigations, they were turned over to the Interrogation branch to find out what information, if any, they had to offer. Information gleaned from the subject was sent back to Investigations. The fate of the subjects in question was unknown after the interrogation had been completed, and no one really endeavored to discover the truth. The official field manual for the Imperial Military forces, Imperial Handbook: A Commander's Guide, claimed that members of the Interrogation branch for the ISB had a much higher success rate than even their counterparts at Imperial Intelligence, at least at the time the manual was written. The Rebel Alliance official, Leia Organa Solo, also noted that the most chilling part of the ISB's stories was what they left out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
