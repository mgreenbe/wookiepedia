Most savvy intelligence operatives knew that he was associated with the Cabal's leader, Loruna Scathe, as he was less secretive than the other Cabal members. This was mainly because he maintained high respect among the Imperials, as he had friends in high places who owed him a favor or two.

One of the Cabal's clients had contacted Lak to obtain information about Gungan hydrostatic technology thought to be lost during the Battle of Naboo. Lak decided to let the new mercenary have a go at this task. With Lak's guidance, the spacer attacked a Gungan camp and finally discovered a long lost Gungan record bauble. The device was encrypted however, so Lak sent the mercenary to a contact of his, a Gungan named Jak Chucka. After the adventurer had fulfilled a series of tasks for Chucka and returned to Lak with the decrypted record bauble, Lak agreed to relay his endorsement to Scathe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Broma Lak was a Non-Player Character (NPC) in Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
