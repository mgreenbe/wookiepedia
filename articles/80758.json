Their quest leads them to the lawless Calamari system which has come under the thralldom of the Sith Lord Darth Luft and his pirates, who have used a scam to lure many Mon Calamari and Quarren refugees to work in the Mon Calamari Shipyards as slave laborers. Jao alerts the Galactic Federation Triumvirate to the pirate presence and the Imperial Knight Yalta Val and Admiral Gar Stazi dispatch a Triumvirate force to liberate the shipyards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Triumvirate fleet wipes out the pirate starfighter defense. Ania and her companions assist the Triumvirate by destroying several Dac pirate droids. In the shipyards, Mon Calamari and Quarren slaves fight against the pirates while Jao Assam engages Darth Luft in a lightsaber duel. Admiral Stazi then deploys the tanker Trand Cappa to flood the Mon Calamari Shipyards; overwhelming the pirates and allowing the Mon Calamari and Quarren slaves to gain the upper hand. Amidst the fighting, Jao's adopted Imperial communications droid narrowly avoids an ice plume by escaping into space. In Family Detention Bay #1, the pirates open the family quarters to zero gravity space with the intention of killing their slaves's families. Seeing the plight of the Mon Calamari and Quarren, Ania and her companions attempt to close the space doors but find that the controls have been frozen over by ice. In the end, Ania summons the comm droid to remotely close the space doors, saving the lives of many captives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Master Yalta Val leads a force of seatroopers and Imperial Knights, who disarm and apprehend the pirates. Within the flooded interiors of the shipyards, Darth Luft and Jao clash with their lightsabers. Luft manages to gain the advantage over his opponent by submerging him under a piece of wreckage. Shortly later, Luft is set upon by two Imperial Knight cadets. Luft manages to best the cadets in combat and almost succeeds in killing them. However, he is killed by Jao in combat. With the defeat of Darth Luft and the pirates, the liberated Mon Calamari and Quarren slaves settle in the flooded shipyards. Later, Jao reunites with Master Val but decides not to return to Coruscant and to instead continue his hunt for Darth Wredd. Jao is aware that he faces desertion charges and that the death penalty looms over his head."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While traveling in AG-37's freighter, Jao receives a transmission from Darth Wredd himself. The rogue Sith thanks the Imperial Knight for helping him to destroy the One Sith and thus bring him closer to his goal of creating a new Sith order based on the Rule of Two. Wredd offers Jao a place in that order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
