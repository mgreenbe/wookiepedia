These sector fleets could be local naval forces, or could also be a major numbered fleet of the Imperial Navy. The Lothal sector fleet was one such fleet that served as a small anti-smuggling task force under the command of Admiral Kassius Konstantine, and blockaded the sector while it hunted insurgents. Its efforts were later considered inadequate by the Governor of the Lothal sector Arihnda Pryce, who requested that the Imperial Seventh Fleet reinforce the Empire in the sector. The Lothal sector fleet consisted of six Imperial I-class Star Destroyers including the flagship Relentless, and two Arquitens-class command cruisers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Anoat sector fleet was another local sector fleet that operated in the Anoat sector under the command of Governor Ubrik Adelhard.
