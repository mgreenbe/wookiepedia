Admiral Ivernus was an intelligent officer who commanded the respect of his inferiors. He managed the fighting from a distance, preoccupied with the Empire's other conflicts, but watched with a keen eye. Ivernus was awarded the Empire's highest medal for planning Balmorra's initial invasion, and in spite of the ensuing quagmire, had continued to rise in esteem, never leaving his ship in Balmorra's orbit. He was designated as a target of the Great Hunt and was eliminated by a young hunter; the hunter thanks to Mako was able to determine a weak link through Major Pirrell, who was looking for help to discredit his superior and gain the favor of Ivernus. He had the Hunter run jobs across Balmorra to that effort, ultimately succeeding in bringing Ivernus away from the protection of his warship. But much to Pirrell's surprise, Ivernus was looking to execute him for his incompetence, before Pirrell's Cathar slave, Murghir, was revealed to be a rival bounty hunter after Ivernus. The Hunter was able to kill both Murghir and Ivernus at the same time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hunter then chose to kill Pirrell when he attempted to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
