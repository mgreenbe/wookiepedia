By 5 ABY, he flew as part of Hail Squadron, a BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber squadron serving in a battle group led by General Hera Syndulla, under the callsign Hail Three. The pilot kept a stash of contraband aboard Syndulla's refitted Star Destroyer, the Deliverance. That year, Syndulla's battle group, including Hail Squadron, pursued the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing through a number of systems, following a series of communications signal bursts from the 204th's flagship, the bulk freighter Yadeez. Both parties reached the ancient manmade ocean planet Chadawa, where the 204th became enclosed under the world's cage of mechanical planetary rings with the local navy. Hail Squadron participated in skirmishes with the 204th when the radiation particle tides produced by the rings had openings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the 204th attempting to sabotage the rings to devastate Chadawa, Hail Squadron, Omir included, were tasked with eliminating the starships carrying out the sabotages, two Raider-class corvettes.
