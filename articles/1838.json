B-wing starfighters had a single 72 twin auto-blaster under the cockpit, with some carrying a second pair in the optional mount next to it. The auto-blaster was capable of automatically firing on enemy targets, but many pilots chose to turn off this capability and directly control the weapon themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
