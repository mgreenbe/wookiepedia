The three first visited Pablo's Pawnshop, where Cad Bane injured the owner, Pablo. Later, when attempting to board a vessel to escape the planet, Kenobi was double-crossed by Bane, and left lying on the ground while Bane and Eval left the planet. By that time, this particular guard had been notified of Bane's wounding Pablo, and easily knocked out a dazed Kenobi. The unconscious Jedi was brought to the Hutts' Palace to be interrogated, where this guard tortured him for information about the two other escapees."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi willfully gave the Nikto the information in exchange for being released, however, once the Nikto got word from another enforcer that the escaping ship had been shot down, he decided the deal was off, gave a hearty laugh, and turned his back on the disguised Jedi. After showing an interest in Kenobi's helmet, the guard soon became distracted. Upon realizing this, Kenobi freed himself, grabbed hold of the guard's staff, and used it against him. The guard was thrown against a control panel and onto the ground where he quickly lost consciousness as Kenobi looked on in disgust."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This guard was a Kajain'sa'Nikto, featuring reddish-brown skin, and yellow eyes. The guard was a member of Nal Hutta's security force, and seemed to hold a pristine position, having command over at least two Gamorreans, though he was abusive of his power. It was a common sight to find members of the security force, who were also Nikto, attacking low-life criminals, such as the Weequay who lived on the planet. It can be inferred that this guard did the same. The guard was also deceiving, tricking Kenobi into giving him information, though the Nikto was eventually stunned by Kenobi a few moments following."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All known Nikto who worked for the Hutt crime lords wore the standard uniform made up of all black attire. This particular guard also wore a helmet and carried a melee weapon of some sort, which doubled as a staff used for interrogation. Many Nikto in employment of the Hutts were also able to pilot HH-87 Starhoppers, presumably to shoot down enemies of the Hutt families."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This guard first appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series episode, Friends and Enemies, which was released in 2012.
