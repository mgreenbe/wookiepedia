When the Dulok King Vulgarr planned to kidnap the woklings of the Ewok settlement known as Bright Tree Village, he created a distraction for the village's warriors by directing them to follow the route of the Whispering River till they reached the third bend. There, he claimed they would find the Canyons of Mist, the home of a monster that had taken the Wokling Malani. The Ewoks followed the river, only to find they had been tricked, as only the lone Dulok Ulgo lived in the Canyons. Following a confrontation between the Dulok and the Ewoks, Ulgo fell from his home toward the river, but was blown by a strong gust of wind onto a flat rock instead, killing him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Whispering River was created for The Adventures of Teebo: A Tale of Magic and Suspense, a children's novel written by Joe Johnston and released in 1984."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
