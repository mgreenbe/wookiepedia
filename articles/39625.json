During the Galactic Civil War, the Hutt Jolla plotted to engineer a dispute between Moska and Jolla's nephew Torga, by arranging for the Clawdite assassin Nomo Sliken to murder Torga's lieutenant and undermine a business deal that Torga was trying to pull off, then framing Moska as having hired Sliken. To incriminate Moska, Jolla had the Kitonak crime broker Moap plant some false evidence that Doronnar had sent instructions and a payment to Sliken. Around the same time, Doronnar visited the planet Tatooine and while he was traveling through hyperspace on his return trip to Nar Shaddaa, Jolla's protocol droid imitated Doronnar and in his guise, the droid ordered some assassins to attack a group of agents that were performing an investigation for Torga, so as to further implicate Moska. On arrival back on Nar Shaddaa, Doronnar visited his mistress, then reported in to Moska."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
