Completing years of training, crafting for himself a yellow-bladed lightsaber, and passing the Trials of Knighthood, Zuth was elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council. Serving the Order valiantly as a Knight, Zuth selected Initiate Tu'ala as his Padawan and began to tutor her in the Jedi ways as they traveled the galaxy together."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Tu'ala's mentor, Zuth attempted to instill in his student the notion that the death of a single individuals might be necessary to ensure that others fulfilled their destines. Tu'ala did not take quickly to this lesson, though Zuth was patient with her. His time as her teacher fell short as he fell in battle defending his Padawan's life during an assassination attempt on an unspecified senator; dying so that she may live on. His body was returned to the Temple where it was cremated in the Jedi custom."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after his death, the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems declared war on each other.
