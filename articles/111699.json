Protected by armed guards, the compound was large and had a landing pad which was used by a large starship. During the Great Hyperspace Disaster, when the Hetzal system came under threat by large numbers of hyperspace anomalies, a mob of people attempted to break into the compound to access the starship, as an evacuation order had been issued for the system, but the guards fired warning shots at them. When Jedi and Galactic Republic assistance arrived, Jedi Master Loden Greatstorm and his Padawan Bell Zettifar were drawn to the compound by the emotional tension they could sense there, leaping out of their Jedi Vector to deal with the situation personally."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
