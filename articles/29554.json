Twice the size of a starfighter, they were hyperspace-capable and could be used as transports, with space onboard for eight to ten warriors. They also sported weapons systems, allowing them to be used as starfighters, or as bombers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Convergence Vehicle was developed by engineers that served the Sith Lord Daiman, in the Daimanate Dynamic Testing Facility on the planet Darkknell. They constructed a prototype version, the Convergence, which was fitted with a testing arm that allowed the simulation of sublight conditions. In 1032 BBY, the Sith Lord Odion sent the Bothan spy Narsk Ka'hane to infiltrate the Daimanate Testing Facility and steal a copy of the Convergence designs, and the agent successfully obtained a copy of the blueprints. However, the Jedi Knight Kerra Holt destroyed his copy of the plans, and detonated some explosives that Ka'hane had placed aboard the Convergence prototype."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
