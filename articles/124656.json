She was traditionally depicted as a winged, female humanoid brandishing a crescent moon-shaped symbol. Padm\u00e9 Amidala, an prominent political figure on Naboo during the last decades of the Galactic Republic, was a worshipper of Shiraya. In Varykino, her family's retreat house, Amidala owned at least two statues of the goddess. When she was Queen of Naboo, Amidala sometimes wore Shiraya fan headdresses in her honor. During her tenure as senator of the Chommell sector, the former queen moved her statues of Shiraya in the open-air private veranda of her apartment on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
