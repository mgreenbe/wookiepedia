For Yerres' part, he recognized that Glongfurrp's intelligence level did not allow him the skills to even comprehend betraying his employer. He was also aware that Glongfurrp tended to devote himself to the protection of any individual as long as they provided him with work, safety, and entertainment. Glongfurrp enjoyed his life under Yerres as he was well fed and cared for. The only downside was the lack of fighting, which caused him to seek out danger for the fight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Glongfurrp was skilled in the use of blaster, as well as unarmed and melee combat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Glongfurrp's tusks were metal-tipped, which were a gift from Yerres, and he kept them pristine.
