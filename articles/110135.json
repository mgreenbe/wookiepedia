I.A. thought the R3 astromech droid would be a succesor to the R2 astromech droid model. R3-T7 was one of the numerous new models. R3-T7 became the property of a promising Senator on Coruscant. For three years, the Senator tasked R3-T7 with arranging and organizing agendas and protection. These tasks were perfect for the astromech droid, thanks to his military knowledge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just before the Clone Wars, the senator was arrested in response to a scandal. He was found guilty by the Senate Disciplinary Committee and sent to his home planet in order to serve a prison sentence. R3-T7 suddenly had no master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the public sale of the senator's property, no one was interested in a specialized model such as R3-T7. Only when he was offered at a bargain price, did a poor merchant from Uscru Entertainment District purchase the droid. R3-T7 had to run errands, pick up and drop off goods."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During an errand, R3-T7 found himself in the seedy underbelly of Coruscant. The droid mistakenly got in the middle of some criminal activities, in which R3-T7 was shot by a street gang. His owner found him, but noticed R3-T7 was not himself. The damage was never fully reversed, so regularly blue sparks would flash from the droid. When that happened R3-T7 would experience a memory loss, and he would wander aimlessly until his owner found him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One day his owner was fed up with the malfunctioning droid, and decided to leave R3-T7 to wander through the streets of Coruscant. What eventually happened to the droid was not known. When Zam Wesell was captured by Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi in the alley behind the Outlander Club, R3-T7 rolled by in the street."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An action figure of R3-T7 was released as part of an Episode II \"Sneak Preview\" toyline.
