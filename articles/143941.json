Therefore, she is sent to the refugee planet of Duro on sick leave to meet up with her family, consisting of her father, Han, and her oldest brother, Jacen, along with the resident Hutt, Randa Besadii Diori, who was a survivor of the Battle of Fondor. While residing on Coruscant, Anakin Solo is still in guilt over his responsibility for the destruction of the Hapan Fleet at the Battle of Fondor, and Jacen has a Force vision of missing a lightsaber tossed to him by his uncle Luke and letting the galaxy fall to the Vong's clutches, and followed by a voice telling him to \"stand firm.\" This leads him to believe that by using the Force any further, he will ultimately tip the galaxy to the Yuuzhan Vong's favor. So Jacen vows to suppress his Force abilities for the rest of his life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "But as the novel progresses with his story, he finds that the galactic tipping point in his vision is still falling to the Yuuzhan Vong's side. Meanwhile, it is revealed that, thanks to the healing tears of Vergere and regular relations with her husband Luke, Mara Jade Skywalker realizes that she is pregnant. After the capture of a Vong agent on Coruscant by Mara and Anakin, which ended with the agent killing herself when she found herself \"tainted\" by the infidelities of the galaxy's natives, Mara, Luke and Anakin go to Duro to investigate if CorDuro Shipping has any affiliation with the Yuuzhan Vong, and even Leia Organa Solo is head of Settlement Thirty-two's partner, the Gateway Dome."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Executor Nom Anor of the Yuuzhan Vong, who survived the events of Vector Prime and is posing as a New Republic scientist at Gateway Dome, unleashes a group of moths that chew on synthplas on Settlement Thirty-two, threatening to expose the refugees there to Duros' caustic atmosphere, leading to an evacuation of Settlement Thirty-two headed by Jacen and Han. The refugees of Settlement Thirty-two are placed in quarantine in Gateway to ensure that the moths do not infest Gateway too. Later, Mara and Jaina figure out that Nom Anor is impersonating a Duro scientist and confront him, only to be trapped under a cave-in while Nom Anor makes his escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this time, Jacen goes to Duro's capital orbital city of Bburru to discuss to Vice-Director Durgard Brarun about undelivered supplies to those of the refugees of both Gateway and the destroyed Settlement Thirty-two.

During the battle, though, Leia is captured and meets up with the Vong's leader, Warmaster Tsavong Lah, and Randa is killed by Lah's subordinate, Priestess Vaecta, while trying to protect Leia. Before she can be executed, however, Jacen breaks his vow of never using the Force anymore and saves his mother from the warmaster. Jacen and Tsavong Lah fight, and Jacen defeats him when he once again hears the voice telling him to \"stand firm\" and he uses a Force wind to knock the Vong out of a window using the objects of Leia's office that they are fighting in."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Battle of Duro comes to its conclusion, the Vong have won again, as usual, and the New Republic saves what refugees it could, including Luke, Han, Leia, C-3PO, R2-D2, Droma and his family, and the Solo kids.

After the Vong find a way to broadcast their living technology to all New Republic tech, Tsavong Lah announces to the galaxy, that if they surrender all the Jedi, or kill them, especially bringing him Jacen Solo, the one who crippled him, alive, the Vong invasion will halt, and they will not attack Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "American"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Foreign"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
