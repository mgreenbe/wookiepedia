He and his brother, Savage Opress sought to draw out the Jedi Master who crippled Maul many years before, Obi-Wan Kenobi, by massacring the inhabitants of a village on Raydonia. The only survivor was an unidentified yellow R4 unit who aimlessly ran into a wall over and over again from either shock or malfunction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
