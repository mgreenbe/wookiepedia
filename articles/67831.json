The IMC had exclusive mining rights to the world of Virmeude, but the planet was actually used as a base of operations for the Alliance. The IMC created a starport on the planet in order to throw off suspicions directed at the company's real purpose, which was to gather and collect information that could be used against the Galactic Empire. To mask their true motives, the IMC was also careful to modify its records accordingly. When mining shipments were brought in to Virmeude, the corporation listed the shipment as profit. Purchases by the company were masked under the pretense that they were for the extensive mining being done on the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
