Over time more would leave; twelve by 990 BBY, and ending with the twentieth member, Master Dooku. Leaving the Order in 32 BBY because of a growing disenchantment with the Galactic Senate, Dooku fell under the tutelage of Darth Sidious and became the next Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Tyranus. Following the dissolution of the Order in 19 BBY, the fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker considered himself the twenty-first member of this group."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Jedi Knight Bardan Jusik, disenchanted with the Republic and the Jedi's treatment of their clone soldiers and believing it to not be the Jedi way, also left the Order before Skywalker, though he was not counted as a member of the Lost Twenty as he was not a Master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Along with the most venerable Masters, the Lost were remembered in the form of bronzium busts in the Jedi Archives, a reminder of the Jedi's greatest failures\u2014though the Jedi did not fault the individuals for leaving, regarding the statues as a reminder that the Jedi were not perfect and that sometimes they might fail to provide what a Jedi might seek out of life.
