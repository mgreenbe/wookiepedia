A student of the renowned Jedi Master Zhar Lestin, she was devoted to Jedi traditions but struggled with controlling her emotions. She became very close to Juhani, a Cathar Padawan. A test of humility devised by Juhani's Master, Quatra, resulted in Juhani lashing out in anger and falling to the dark side when she mistakenly believed she had killed her Master. After the fallen Padawan fled to the nearby Ancient Grove, her dark emotions turned the surrounding wildlife aggressive, but the Jedi Council would not permit Belaya to attempt to redeem her dear companion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the amnesiac Revan arrived on the planet, Belaya confronted him about not being dressed in Jedi apparel, then apologized for her behavior. In Revan's final trial to become a Jedi once again, Master Lestin instructed him to confront and cleanse the darkness in the Ancient Grove. Revan spared Juhani and convinced her to return to the light. Afterward, Belaya expressed her gratitude to Revan for his actions, and she was reunited with Juhani until the redeemed Jedi joined Revan's quest to find the Star Forge and defeat his former apprentice, Darth Malak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point before 3956 BBY, Belaya was a young Force-sensitive who journeyed to the Jedi Enclave on the Outer Rim planet of Dantooine. During the period before the Jedi Civil War, she rose to the rank of Padawan and eventually Jedi Knight as she trained with the renowned Jedi Master Zhar Lestin, a Twi'lek male and member of the Council at the Enclave. Belaya became a Jedi Guardian, a path that focused more on combat skills than mental abilities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Belaya struggled with controlling her emotions, and her Master often reminded her that she must learn to do so. Juhani, who was a Cathar and a fellow female Padawan, also had difficulties with managing her emotions. Throughout their time at the Enclave, Belaya and Juhani were dear companions to each other. They spent many nights alone together under the stars."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Jedi Civil War"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The fallen Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3956 BBY, the former Sith Lord Revan, who had the constructed identity of a Republic soldier, arrived at the Enclave following the destruction of the Outer Rim ecumenopolis of Taris. With him was a party consisting of Bastila Shan, Carth Onasi, and several others. Shan sought the Enclave Council's wisdom to address her growing concerns over Revan's visions and returning memories, and to convince them to re-train Revan in the light as a Jedi once again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the amnesiac Revan was heading towards the Council Chambers, Belaya sensed the Force power within him, and stopped him. She demanded to know why he was not wearing the traditional Jedi apparel, saying that he was making a mockery of the Jedi traditions. He explained that he was not a Jedi and was accompanying Shan. Belaya was familiar with Shan's reputation as a master of battle meditation, though she had also heard Shan took too much pride in her abilities. She expressed disbelief that someone as strong in the Force as the soldier was not already part of the Order, but apologized for how she had addressed him and wished him well in his stay on Dantooine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After weeks of training, Revan was deemed ready to progress to the rank of Padawan. To do so, he needed to complete three trials. During his first two trials, Belaya congratulated him on his quick progress towards the rank of Padawan, which she had discussed with their mutual teacher, Master Lestin. After Revan correctly recited the Jedi code, he constructed his own lightsaber with a crystal from Master Dorak, and Master Lestin advised him to journey to the Crystal Cave as he learned to alter the weapon. Belaya warned the student that the cave on the Khoonda plains was dangerous, and that he should not involve himself in things that were beyond him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Juhani neared the end of her own training with Quatra, the Jedi Master sought to impart a final lesson about the threat of the dark side through a confrontation. When Juhani lashed out in anger, she gravely injured Quatra and mistakenly believed she had killed her Master, an act she considered unforgivable. Juhani fell into darkness and fled to the Ancient Grove near the Enclave. While there, Juhani embraced her dark power, eventually tainting the grove and causing the surrounding Kath Hounds to become violent. Because Belaya had always been close to Juhani, the Jedi Council would not allow her to approach the fallen Padawan herself, believing it may be more harmful than helpful for Belaya to intercede."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Revan's third trial"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For Revan's third and final trial, Master Lestin assigned him to enter the Ancient Grove and cleanse the darkness that tainted it. In the days following Juhani's fall, local settlers had been attacked by the newly-aggressive wildlife. Rumors were circulating about a Jedi apprentice hurting her own master, and that Master Quatra may not survive her injuries. Unbeknownst to Revan, the murmurings regarded the trial he faced."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Revan approached the grove, he was attacked by Juhani, who was blinded by her rage and belief that she had killed Quatra. He disarmed and defeated Juhani, but refused to kill her. Instead, he convinced her to return to the Enclave and seek the judgement of the Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Council told Juhani the truth of Quatra's test and welcomed her to return as a Jedi Knight. Belaya expressed her gratitude to Revan for his part in Juhani's redemption.

She wore a standard brown Jedi robe with a white colored tunic underneath, along with brown pants and dark gloves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Belaya was deeply devoted to honoring the Jedi traditions and saw some deviations as making a mockery of them; for instance, she thought it was inappropriate to make jokes about the Jedi Order and disapproved when others did not wear Jedi robes. Though she was critical of Bastila Shan's pride, Belaya displayed pride of her own in the unsolicited advice she gave to Revan before he rejoined the Order. She saw sacrifice and discipline as ways to achieve mastery, but she continuously had difficulty controlling her emotions and was warned by Master Lestin that she must learn. Belaya shared a deep connection with Juhani, whom she considered a dear companion. The Council was aware that they had always been close and did not permit Belaya to attempt Juhani's redemption herself. When Revan succeeded at returning Juhani to the light side, Belaya was joyous."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Belaya appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.

Belaya is heartbroken and furious at Revan and the Jedi Council for their roles in Juhani's death. She believes Revan did not give Juhani a chance, and the Council should have sent a Jedi with more experience. To Belaya, they all failed to believe Juhani deserved better and was worth saving. Regardless of Revan's intentions, Belaya cannot be consoled for her loss and leaves the Jedi Order. After Belaya's disappearance, Vandar Tokare may express his concerns that because Belaya was so close to Juhani, her death may have hit Belaya hard and led her to do something rash. Vrook Lamar may observe that she failed to show up for a lesson with Master Lestin and was seen leaving the Enclave; he does not know where she may have gone and warns Revan against forcing her to return should they encounter each other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Revan encounters Belaya again during the quest to find the Star Map on Korriban. She has fallen to the dark side and is training as a Sith. Once again, Belaya confronts Revan and angrily questions their presence outside the Sith Academy, threatening to expose them if they are acting on behalf of the Jedi Council. Regardless of Revan's words, she attempts to avenge Juhani and is killed. Revan can take her red-bladed lightsaber and dark Jedi Knight robe. If Dantooine has not yet been attacked, Revan can return there and tell Master Lamar of Belaya's fate. Disturbed by her fall and considering it a failing of the Jedi as her teachers, Lamar cautions Revan not to give in to darkness lest they experience a fate similar to Belaya's."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
