Releasing the skimmers in the upper orbit of gas giants, the Garman stored the gasses collected by skimmers in its vast pressurized holds; once its holds were completely filled, the Garman would recall its skimmers and jump to one of the Lant Mining Corporations refineries to deposit its cargo and begin the process all over again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
