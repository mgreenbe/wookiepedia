Bultar Swan, telling Mundi that the sandstorm was ion-charged and that this battle could be worse than Jabiim, immediately attempted to destroy the Republic's camp to prevent their supplies from falling into Separatist hands, not knowing that Anakin and A'Sharad were still out in the deserts of Aargonar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hiding in a cave, Anakin accidentally attacked Hett as a Tusken Raider due to a berserk rage he was undergoing, nearly killing him.
