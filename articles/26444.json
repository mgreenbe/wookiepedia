In 9 ABY, the Mandalorian Din Djarin visited the inn with the foundling Grogu. He sat down at a table and ordered chowder for him from a Mon Calamari server, paying for it in Calamari Flan. The server used a hose affixed to the ceiling to dispense chowder into a bowl for Grogu, who struggled eat it with a spoon before being attacked by a cephalopod. Djarin helped him remove the cephalopod from his face."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the same time, a pair of Mon Calamari sat nearby eating chowder, along with a group of Quarren, one of whom shook seasoning on the dish. Djarin later returned to the inn along with fellow Mandalorians Bo-Katan Kryze, Koska Reeves, and Axe Woves. While the quartet discussed their future plans, Reeves consumed a bowl of chowder, slurping the cephalopod with ease."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chowder appeared in \"Chapter 11: The Heiress,\" the third episode of season two of The Mandalorian and the eleventh episode of the series overall, which aired on November 13, 2020.
