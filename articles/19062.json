It was a strip-mined planet at the end of the Hydian Way. The densely populated planet housed many exotic species from around the galaxy. Bonadanians found off-world were either from wealthy corporate families or those that had escaped the life of corporate servitude."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Geography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bonadan's yellow, parched surface was heavily eroded, and its topsoil had been destroyed due to constant drilling and construction. The once-beautiful landscape was scorched and barren from years of strip-mining, pollution, and mismanagement. The remaining surface was covered with factories, refineries, docks, and shipbuilding facilities in ten spaceports, the largest being Bonadan Spaceport Southeast II."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A massive weather-control station lay in the mountains to the north of the main cities; it was used to generate sweeper storms that cleaned the polluted air. Despite this, foul smelling rain and pollution was widespread. Weapons were banned on Bonadan, and being caught by one of the omnipresent weapons detectors was grounds for immediate arrest. Newcomers were thoroughly scanned before landing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From space, Bonadan was a yellow sphere covered with rust-red strips.

The Imperials set up a supply commerce consisting of several cargo containers being readied for shipment by CT-11 space tugs.

However, two Y-wings arrived and destroyed the containers and the two freighters before the Imperial Nebulon-B escort frigate Enforcer could arrive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite a claim of neutrality during the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion, representatives of the Corporate Sector were bought off by the alien invaders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bonadan Cough was a contagious virus that originated from Bonadan and caused the sufferer to have a hoarse cough and deep fatigue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
