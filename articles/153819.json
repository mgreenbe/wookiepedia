Three years after the Mandalorians began attacking worlds in the Outer Rim Territories, the woman accompanied forces led by Mandalore the Ultimate's primary strategist Cassus Fett to the planet Cathar. During the attack, she helped the Mandalorians drive a large number of the Cathar species into the sea. After successfully defeating the Cathar, the woman, knowing that Fett intended to commit genocide against the species, pleaded with Fett to spare them. However, Fett was intent on gaining revenge on the Cathar for their role in defeating the Mandalorians during the Great Sith War and told the woman that she could defend the Cathar if she chose to.

Eventually, a team of Jedi led by Jedi Council member Vrook Lamar traveled to Cathar and ordered the Revanchists to abandon their efforts and disperse permanently. However, Revan noticed the Mandalorian woman's helmet underneath his feet and picked it up. When some light struck the helmet, all the Jedi present experienced a vision of the Mandalorians' devastation of the Cathar species, and also witnessed the woman's role in the battle and how she tried to defend the Cathar people. After the vision's end, Revan donned the woman's mask, vowing not to remove it until he and his Jedi successfully defeated the Mandalorians. The Jedi Knight continued to wear the Mandalorian woman's helmet up to the end of the Mandalorian Wars.

Surik returned the mask to Revan, which sparked the return of all of his memories, but it was later melted by the Sith Emperor's Force lightning in a duel. Approximately three hundred years later, Revan repaired the Mandalorian's mask after he was freed, and wore it during the battle at the Foundry, where he vanished in a flash of light after being defeated by agents of the Sith Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mandalorian woman used a blaster during combat and wore gray and red Mandalorian armor.
