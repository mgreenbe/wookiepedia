According to the Wookiee Weebacca's scouts, they were found in Okikuti, so Solo and Chewbacca left Kepitenochan and went there to destroy them. When the Wookiee strike force arrived, however, they discovered an empty city instead of jammers, and they were ambushed by Moff Darcc's forces emanating from a nearby Imperial base, and with the city hemmed in by the forest, their sole exit was blocked. Solo's prior mistrust of Weebacca was justified, as he had betrayed them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unable to withstand Darcc's attack, Solo hit upon the idea of clearing a path through the forest to escape by water. They ordered the Wookiee workers they had brought along to cut through, and they soon reached the lake and quickly built a shipyard and a serviceable transport.
