They did not return. Although the Hutt claimed that the elders never came, Luke Skywalker decided to dispatch Jaden Korr, a student at the Jedi Academy, to investigate the matter. Kyle Katarn was investigating the disappearance of another Jedi student, Rosh Penin, near Nar Kreeta and offered to assist Korr with the Raven's Claw by dropping him to the destination in the beginning and picking him up once the mission was complete."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Korr covertly entered the Hutt's palace through a ventilation system. Eavesdropping on some of the Hutt's guards, he learned that the Hutt arranged betting on vicious blood-sporting that pitted prisoners against a rancor. While investigating the Hutt's palace, Korr was attacked numerous times by the guards. Eventually, Korr discovered a number of control rooms, which were connected to small cantinas scattered around the palace. Each control room contained a lever, which, when pulled, opened a door to a cell where the Mining Guild elders were held captive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Complications"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Korr went to assist the elders, he learned the truth of the Hutt's betting arrangements and the nature of the facility itself. The prison area and the bars surrounding were, in reality, a gambling arena inside which the rancor would chase unarmed prisoners around, and eventually devour them. The Hutt made arrangements for his guests and guards to bet on prisoners escaping the rancor. Stakes were placed on the last prisoner to be eaten. No one had yet managed to escape the rancor. Korr found the elders and instructed them to make their way to the rendezvous point where Katarn was waiting in the Raven's Claw while Korr stayed behind to distract the rancor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The plan was a success, but it is not clear if Korr managed to save all sixteen prisoners. The surviving elders escaped through the ventilation system and were picked up by Katarn in the Raven's Claw."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is possible to kill the rancor in the Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy game by dealing enough damage to it; however, a new one will spawn in its place."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not all sixteen prisoners have to escape alive in order to complete the level. The rancor and also Jaden can kill a few elders without the mission resulting in a failure. After the successful saving of the elders you can see mercenaries firing on the rancor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
