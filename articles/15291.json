Taking place above the Vak homeworld of Primea, the battle was orchestrated by Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo of the Ascendancy. During the battle, Thrawn outsmarted General Yiv and the Nikardun forces, manipulating them into turning the Vak Combine, who Yiv was attempting to conquer, against them. During the battle, Thrawn captured Yiv, who became a prisoner of the Ascendancy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle followed a string of encounters and skirmishes between the Chiss and Nikardun forces, or factions subjugated by the Nikardun. Thrawn sent the caregiver Mitth'ali'astov and the sky-walker Che'ri to return a Vak fighter Thrawn had previously commandeered in an escape from Primea, along with a message to the Vak leadership. Vak forces aligned with the Nikardun organized for the capture of the two Chiss and instead delivered a false message, both of which were expected by Thrawn. Yiv sent a threat to the Ascendancy, demanding that Thrawn deliver him a ransom for the issues he had caused. The Ascendancy's Syndicure decided that the capture of a sky-walker required a military response. Thrawn traveled to Yiv's location in an unarmed freighter with the Pathfinder navigator Qilori, who, having been allied with Yiv, changed the arrival coordinates from above Primea to further out in the system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Yiv confronted Thrawn with four Nikardun Battle Dreadnoughts, including the flagship Deathless, five Chiss warships, led by Admiral Ar'alani arrived at Primea, informing the Vaks of the locations of orbiting Nikardun vessels, as Thrawn had offered to do in his message. The Vaks allowed Ar'alani to fire on the Nikardun, and Yiv sent his three dreadnought escorts to assist his blockade of Primea. With the Springhawk taking damage, the vessel went dark, and Admiral Ar'alani requested humanitarian aid from nearby Vak patrol boats. The Vak complied, but the Nikardun vessels shot down the patrol ships, turning the Vak Combine against the Nikardun. Yiv attempted to pull Thrawn's freighter in with a tractor beam, but Thalias and Che'ri released tava mist into the bridge of the Deathless, allowing Thrawn to break free of the tractor beam and instead crash his freighter into the viewport, with his ship rendered unharmed due to a Galactic Republic energy shield acquired from Mokivj. Thrawn boarded the bridge, rescuing the two Chiss prisoners and capturing Yiv. Following Yiv's disappearance, the Nikardun Destiny was left without a suitably competent successor, and their plans of conquest fell apart."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
