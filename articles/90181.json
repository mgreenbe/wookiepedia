After the internal seed-husk was removed, it was included in many gourmet dishes. In the waning years of the Galactic Republic, it was used by the chef Gormaanda in a recipe called \"Glowblue Noodles and Chav.\" The recipe called for one milkened tuber that was peeled, quartered lengthways, and seeded. When preparing the recipe, Gormaanda instructed to quarter the milkened tuber crossways and to halve each quarter again when the seed-husk was reached to keep it at a uniform size. Gormaanda gave the recipe in an edition of the HoloNet News in the year 22 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Milkened tuber was first mentioned in 2002 in Volume 531, Issue 50 of the HoloNet News feed, which was created by Pablo Hidalgo and Paul Ens.
