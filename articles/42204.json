Used by the New Republic, the EL-16HFE was the Heavy Field Edition of the smaller EL-16 blaster rifle, though it was outdated surplus by the time of the Resistance's fight against the First Order thirty years after the Battle of Endor. It was larger than the standard version and included a stock and a longer barrel. Poe Dameron used a modified EL-16HFE blaster rifle during the attack on the village Tuanul on Jakku. It, alongside the smaller version, were later used during the Battle of Crait."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
