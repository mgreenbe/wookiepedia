Native fungi grew around the vents and few other locations with a steady source of water. The native Advozsec evolved out of reptile-analogs, adapting to the harsh environs and low-level of sun light that pierced the dense cloud cover of the world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A civilization of reptomammals, the Advozsec were able to eke out an existence on their unstable world, though they grew pessimistic as a culture and learning to adapt their construction habits to prevent widespread catastrophe. Developing their own hyperdrive technology before making contact with the greater galaxy, the Advozsec drew the attention of scouts from the Galactic Republic circa 10,000 BBY. Gaining representation in the Galactic Senate on Coruscant, the species was often perceived as being decent bureaucrats."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, the constant earthquakes caused for the ruinous city walls to sway back and forth like ocean waves.

Despite this, a strong Separatist leaning permeated the society and representatives of the Republic were not welcome. This was discovered by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi when he crash-landed on the planet and was assaulted by a gang of smugglers on the planet. While the spacers engaged the Jedi in combat, the native population did not take up arms against the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Galactic Empire came to power, Advozsec involved in Riflor's rich mining operations were cut off from planetary decision making by their Imperial overseers. While most Advozsec supported the Empire, with many serving in its bureaucracy, the Imperial forces on Riflor had to put down several protests demanding a greater Advozse voice. In the decades following the Galactic Civil War, the world was invaded by the Yuuzhan Vong as they waged their campaign of conquest and terror across the galaxy. Creating a bio-virus which killed off Riflor's plant life, the Advozsec who remained on the world died of malnutrition. The species survived only through those Advozsec found on other planets and colonies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite Riflor's apparent fate during the Yuuzhan Vong War, the maps of the conflict in The Essential Atlas show Riflor to not have been conquered, or even ventured near, by the Yuuzhan Vong."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
