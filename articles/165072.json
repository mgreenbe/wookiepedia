It took sixteen wupiupi to equal a trugut, which itself was a quarter of a peggat. The value of one wupiupi was around 0.625 Galactic Credits, the main currency in use in the galaxy. According to Gragra, a gorgmonger that worked in the marketplace of Mos Espa, the gorgs at her shop cost seven wupiupi. The young Bothan Dorn reported that it took ten thousand wupiupi to smuggle a slave off world, while five wupiupi would generally be enough to buy a ticket to a public slave execution."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
