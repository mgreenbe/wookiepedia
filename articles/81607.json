Opposition to the Devisors' rule had been a constant problem for the ruling caste, ever since the colony ship Exocros Cabal had arrived at the planet. Elements of the populace felt that the Devisors were denying them their birthright, but the Devisors held onto their power through the control of advanced technology."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sharden and her insurgents agreed to help the crew of the FarStar free their ship and liberate their captain since she knew that such a strike would cause the downfall of the Devisors as well.

The Bremarc fired a rocket barrage at the New Republic X-wings, which the nimble fighters avoided. They engaged the Skyraptors, utilizing their superior agility and firepower to deal with them. With the way clear, the X-wings launched a proton torpedo attack on the bunker, but found their weapons unable to pentrate the thick walls. They realized that they had to drop their torpedoes in the narrow slit of the bunker where the tractor beam was emanating from. However, a second wave of Skyraptors engaged the X-wings before they could launch a second attack run."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After dealing with the second wave of Skyraptors, the X-wings launched their second attack run, dropping their torpedoes through the narrow slit.
