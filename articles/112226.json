When they escaped to Arnot Station they encountered the Alderaan gunship 'Aegis' that had turned pirates attacking a freighter. When Metara, Captain of the 'Aegis', learned of Leia being onboard she asked to meet. Leia, Han, Sian and Kifar used an escape pod to meet with Metara. Metara explained that they survived the destruction of Alderaan and became pirates afterwards. Now they were in debt with the Lorddian pirate leader Viest. Metara and Leia went to meet with her. Viest made them participate in a game that almost got them killed. Meanwhile, Han went to find the captured slaves and found Davit among them. Han helped Leia defeat a crazy mining droid and Leia won the game. Viest, however, did not honor her promise and sent Leia back to the Aegis. Leia had made an ally, the Twi'lek Anakaret. Anakaret helped Leia and the crew by broadcasting a warning signal when leaving the system which functioned as a distraction. Han and Kifar were captured. Leia went to set charges to the control room. When they got there they faced Viest again. Viest and Metara were killed. Luke and Chewie came in the Millennium Falcon to aid Leia and Han. On their way back they learned that the Gamble had been taken under Imperial control. Setting a meeting point to negotiate Kifar revealed himself as Imperial spy and got Luke captured. Leia arranged for most of the rebel crew to escape and exchanged Luke for an Imperial ship they had taken over. Before that happened pirates entered the system having tracked the Aegis from the pirate clearinghouse via an installed tracker. Imperials, pirates, rebels and the Aegis engaged in a battle. Leia, Han, Chewie, Luke, Sian and the crew of the Aegis (now led by Kelvan) escaped and rendezvoused a month later with the rebels joining the rebellion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The novel was set to be released on November 5,[source?] but it was moved up to October 1, before being set as September 24, 2013."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wells finished the final complete draft of the novel on January 15, 2013 and sent it in to editorial on the eighteenth.
