Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Ovarra was one of the judges at the trial of Ikvizi, a Geonosian scientist who had come to Kachirho to study the Wookiees. While on Kashyyyk, Ikvizi had heard about a scientific camp in the outskirts of Kachirho, but when he went to meet them, he discovered the research camp was actually a group of Trandoshan slavers conducting painful experiments on Wookiee captives. Ikvizi decided he needed to help the Wookiee slaves, and sneaked into the camp to find proof and take it back to Kachirho. While he was going through the slavers' items, however, one of the Trandoshans found Ikvizi and knocked him out. Ikvizi was later found unconscious by a Wookiee hunting party in the woods with documents saying the Geonosian was planning on performing harmful experiments on the Wookiee population. He was captured by the Wookiees, thrown in jail, and was later sent to trial."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the trial, there were suddenly many people testifying against Ikvizi, saying they had seen the Geonosian engaging in suspicious activities around the city. The most notable of these testimonies was when Ikvizi bribed a guard to let him examine the corpse of a Wookiee hunter who had died in the Shadowlands, the dark ground level of Kashyyyk. While presiding over the trial, Ovarra was very skeptical of the evidence provided, but it still seemed that Ikvizi was going to be found guilty by the other judges."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the trial, Ovarra was visited by a spacer while at Kachirho's center tree, the center of government for Kachirho. The spacer had been hired by Ikvizi to find documents in the Trandoshans' camp that proved that the slavers had framed the Geonosian. After a brief fight, the spacer killed several slavers and made it into the camp. There, the spacer found eight documents proving Ikvizi had not planned anything, and that the Trandoshans were guilty of doing illegal experiments on the Wookiees. The spacer gave these documents to Ovarra, and she cleared Ikvizi of the charges of planning to conduct dangerous experiments on the Wookiees. While Ikvizi was still charged with bribing the guard, Ovarra said she would try to get Ikvizi a lenient sentence.
