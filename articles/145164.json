After luring the temporary shop keeper Kazuda Xiono into a cargo container, Kee stole the phase connector after subduing the droid BB-8. Kee attempted to escape aboard his Darius G-class freighter with the stolen phase connector. However, Xiono managed to sabotage the ship's engine, causing it to crash into the sea.

A Keteerian named Teroj Kee tried to steal from them over the years but failed due to Flix and Orka's vigilance. Teroj subsequently came into the service of the First Order, a remnant of the Old Empire seeking to reconquer the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teroj monitored Flix and Orka's communications, seeking an opportunity to steal from them. He was interested in a phase connector, a technology used to crack open asteroids and planetoids for mining purposes. An opportunity emerged when Flix and Orka left for one day to visit Flix's mother. The two shopkeepers left Kazuda Xiono, an undercover Resistance spy, in charge of their store for the day. Unfamiliar with Kaz, Teroj thought he could take advantage of the youth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The heist"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teroj traveled to the Colossus aboard a Darius G-class freighter accompanied by at least three stormtroopers. Posing as a member of the Mining Guild, Kee claimed that he had come to collect an order for a phase connector. Kaz checked the store records and found that the Mining Guild nor Teroj had placed such an order. While the Office did have a phase connector in the backroom, Kaz clarified that it was not for sale since it had already been sold to a mining colony offworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Teroj was bitten by the pet Gorg Bitey, Kaz agreed to sell three tool kits, ten lenses, and a crate of connector rods as compensation. Under Teroj's instructions, Kaz delivered the goods to a crate in the loading docks. However, he was cornered by Teroj who locked him inside the crate, which was scheduled to be dropped into the sea."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kaz managed to free himself from the crate and hung on to the crane just as the crate was dropped into the sea. Meanwhile, Teroj stole the phase connector from the Office of Acquisitions. BB-8 put up a fight but Teroj trapped him under a cupboard, leaving the store in a mess. Teroj then returned to his freighter where he was joined by the First Order stormtroopers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Denying the enemy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kaz and Bitey followed Teroj and the phase connector aboard his Darius G-class freighter.

This caused the ship's engines to overload and explode."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teroj tried to stop Bitey by shooting at him but instead hit a power circuity, causing the second engine to explode. As the freighter began to descend into the oceans, Kaz and Bitey tried to escape but the two were separated by debris. Despite this, Kaz managed to reach an escape pod. Teroj and two of the stormtroopers also managed to escape in three escape pods before the freighter sank into the sea and exploded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kaz initially feared that Bitey did not survived but was relieved when the gorg surfaced.

Flix and Orka were shocked to see their shop in a mess but were mollified when Kaz told them about Teroj's attempted heist and how he had downed the freighter to avoid the First Order getting their hands on the phase connector. Nevertheless, they ordered Kaz to clean their shop.
