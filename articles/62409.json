Around thirty years after the Battle of Endor, he was cleaning scrap he had recovered while seated at one of the many washing tables in Niima Outpost on Jakku when he overheard an individual bothering the scavenger Rey, who was working at another washing table. Hoogenz laughed at what the other scavenger said before returning to his washing. He was later queued several places behind Rey to trade in his scrap to the junk dealer Unkar Plutt, who ran Niima. While at Niima, Hoogenz wore a green shirt and a mask that covered his face."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hoogenz first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in 2015.

Despite the game being non-canon, Lucasfilm Story Group member Pablo Hidalgo confirmed on Twitter that the names provided by the game for previously unidentified characters, including Hoogenz, were considered canon.
