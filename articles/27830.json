They begin to wonder why such a massive invasion has not attempted to attack the Jedi Temple or the Galactic Senate, and realize that the invasion is a distraction from the Confederacy's real target\u2014Palpatine. Windu jumps aboard an overflying Republic gunship, and orders the pilot to turn around."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Palpatine and his three Jedi protectors reach a hover capsule in a tunnel, and Shaak Ti orders the others to get to the bunker while she holds off their pursuers.

The latest subject manages to burst free of his restraints, smashes the tank and rips the cybernetic chestplates off two of the Nelvaanians.

Skywalker leaps to the top of the generator, then lowers himself into the crystal chamber. Screaming in agony, he reaches his prosthetic arm into the energy sphere, uses the Force to pull the crystal from its socket, and then shatters it into a thousand shards. The energy surge causes the generator to explode, and Skywalker leaps to safety, his arm destroyed. The Nelvaan warriors reach the planet's surface, where the waiting battle droids are destroyed as the planet's ice age comes to an end. An enraged Skywalker clambers to the surface, where he kills the Techno Union scientists trying to flee in their ship. Seeing Skywalker's ravaged arm, the Nelvaan mutants worship him as \"holt kezed\"\u2014\"ghost hand\"\u2014their savior, and in solidarity they tear the implanted weapons from their own arms.

Once they are locked inside, they discover that General Grievous has beaten them to it, and the two Jedi leap forward to defend their leader, who sinks, seemingly unconcerned by the danger, into the shadows. As Moudama and Corobb manage to get Grievous in a saber-lock, his arms split along their lengths into four. His extra two arms then grab the remaining two lightsabers on his waist, and Grievous lunges forward."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shaak Ti continues to fight off Grievous's MagnaGuards, but when the droids suddenly retreat, she realizes they've been keeping her busy while Grievous reaches the others.
