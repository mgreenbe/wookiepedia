Composed primarily of calcified wood, it would break free of its parent tree to roam the swamps and devour animals. After gathering enough nutrients, the spider would find a clear spot to anchor its legs, and if it survived that period, it would eventually transform into roots that allow the spider to grow into a towering tree. During this period it was vulnerable to bogwings and jubba birds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to the very large ones, there were also some smaller, knee-height ones; Luke Skywalker ended up facing a number of these in his training."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
