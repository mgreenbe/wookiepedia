After the captain took the liner too close to a gas giant, ignoring the engineers' warnings of magnetic fields interfering with the electronics, the liner became caught in the planet's gravity well. The liner and its eight thousand passengers were rescued by Senior Commander Thrawn, with the assistance of Senior Captain Ziara, at the cost of the liner's luxury external wings. As the Ufsa family were close allies, the Boadil instead turned their anger over the situation to Thrawn, but three of the other Nine Ruling Families who had representatives aboard the liner backed him in his hearing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
