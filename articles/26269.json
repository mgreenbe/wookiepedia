Other methods include altering the angle of one's parry to catch the opponent's wrist instead of the blade or sliding the weapon inside an opponent's guard during a bladelock to cut off their hand. An even more vicious method consisted of grabbing the opponent's wrist and holding it in place while cutting it off. Executing cho mai was often a question of recognizing an opening and exploiting it, attacking when the opponent left their weapon hand vulnerable. Jedi Knights commonly used it against blaster-wielding opponents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable examples"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 5000 BBY, in their first duel, Saes Rrogon used cho mai on Relin Druur."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3951 BBY, aboard the Hammerhead-class cruiser, Harbinger, Darth Sion initiated cho mai against Kreia.
