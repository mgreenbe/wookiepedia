Kuras III was a dry, volcanic world, and thanks to a mixture of heavy metals, harmful bacteria and airborne poisons, the environment was considered lethal to Humans and many other species. Three indigenous life-forms managed to evolve in Kuras III's inhospitable atmosphere; the Aganof, the Pulra, and Hairy Savages. Because The Drift made travel to and from the planet difficult, much of Kuras III remained unexplored. The average day lasted for eighteen standard hours on Kuras III, and a year encompassed four hundred days."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, it was considered extremely dangerous to travel to Kuras III due to a stellar dustcloud.
