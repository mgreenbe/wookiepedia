The formation was comprised of groups of All Terrain Armored Transports or All Terrain Scout Transports traveling in either vertical or horizontal lines. Although they were often single file formations, double file formations were used on occasion. The formation was used by groups of walkers that had to quickly traverse open ground before engaging the enemy and shifting into other attack patterns."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
