They had sheer faces well suited toward sponsored speeder races. The Kiallquis Mountains were considered ideal for rock climbers and adventurers. Tarasin used to test criminals by lowering them over precipices in the range, but had discontinued the practice by 32 BBY. Like other Cularin ranges, Tarasin villages and other life dwelled on the lower ridges, but the higher ridges were devoid of life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
