They eventually developed spaceflight and, against the wishes of their elders, began the colonization of other worlds. This drew the attention of the Rakata, who conquered, enslaved, and annexed them to their Infinite Empire in 25,793 BBY. The Kumumgah eventually rebelled and were punished by the Rakata, who bombed the surface of the once-lush world of Tatooine into little more than fused glass. This glass eventually crumbled and became desert sand. The extreme climate change had the Kumumgah evolve into two races: the Ghorfas (the Sand People), and the Jawas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic puts forth the hypothesis that perhaps the Kumumgah, and subsequently the Ghorfas and Jawas are, in fact, Human, or at least are related to them.
