They also had wider visor plates that allowed a larger visual area. They usually were armed with either DC-15A blaster rifles or DC-15Ss, they also use the DC-15x sniper rifle. The armor would be camouflaged to blend into the surroundings on forest and swamp worlds. They would be assigned two vehicles: BARC speeders for mounted reconnaissance duty and AT-APs for attacking and defending. Using BARC speeders could make them look very similar to BARC troopers, some of which also wore a form of clone scout armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The game Star Wars: Battlefront II uses a variation of the clone scout trooper as a sniper unit on the planets Kashyyyk and Felucia.
