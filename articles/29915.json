Its first issue was published nearly three centuries before the Battle of Yavin. The journal's articles covered horticulture but its editorial staff also sent researchers all over Corellia's landscape to report on the planet's wild plant life. Rostek Horn wrote several columns for this publication, encrypting messages to Jedi in the genetic codes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 ABY one of the journal's researchers was following a lead regarding trioecious cycad carpophylls when he stumbled into a lair of dangerous beasts. He managed to hide himself in a safe place and called the journal's staff before his comlink was eaten. The journal immediately hired a spacer who killed the creatures and rescued the researcher."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
