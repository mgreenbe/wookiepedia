Sometime after the Battle of Yavin, during the Galactic Civil War, a spacer visited the tribe, hoping to help them with their problems and gain their trust. Kallaarac instructed the visitor to seek out the members of his tribe within the caverns to see if they needed any help. When the spacer returned to Kallaarac after gaining the tribe's confidence, the chieftain charged the outsider with ending an infestation of Urnsor'is spiders within the caverns. Kallaarac tasked the spacer with several duties to achieve this, the last of which was to exterminate the infestation's source, a ferocious Urnsor'is known as the Mother Queen. When the visitor returned to Kallaraac victorious, the chief was overjoyed and rewarded the spacer for the deed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Wookiee male, Kallaarac was a member of the Myyydril, a tribe that consisted of various species who lived together within the Myyydril Caverns in the Kkowir Forest on the planet Kashyyyk. Kallaarac and the Myyydril tribe had long suffered from attacks and disease caused by the Urnsor'is, a ferocious parasitic spider species that had infested the caverns. During the years leading up to the Clone Wars, he discovered Nak'tra crystals were an effective weapon against the Urnsor'is parasites. At the height of the Galactic Civil War, he was named the chieftain of his village. At some point after sustaining an injury in an Urnsor'is attack, Kallaarac had to replace his entire left arm with a cybernetic one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point after the Battle of Yavin, Kallaarac and the Myydril tribe were visited by a spacer who wished to assist them in their plight. The visitor spoke with Kallaarac, who was initially skeptical of the outsider's motives, but the Wookiee chief offered to let the fellow sentient demonstrate friendly intentions. The chief instructed the spacer to seek out the people of his tribe within the caverns and assist them first, stating that if the stranger did this, it would prove to the Wookiee that further trust was warranted. During this time, the spacer assisted the Twi'lek Tala'oree in thinning the amount of uwari beetles near the entrance of the caverns, helped the Human Kirrir gather warrl leaves for her Warrl Surprise beverage, and retrieved the Wookiee Nawika's jewelry box from deep within the cave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The spacer returned to Kallaarac after completing these duties and wondered if the actions had earned the tribe's and the chieftain's trust. Kallaarac declared that the outsider had indeed proved worthy and named the individual a member of the tribe. The Wookiee further entrusted the newcomer with a true test of loyalty and nobility: the utter destruction of the Urnsor'is infestation within the caverns. The chieftain first tasked the spacer with thinning the Urnsor'is by killing fifteen of the creatures that had amassed near the tribe's compound. The visitor returned successful, and Kallaarac offered another mission: to strike at the Urnsor'is nests, collect twenty of their eggs, and return with them, a task that the spacer was successful in doing. Kallaarac's final strike against the Urnsor'is was to send the newcomer to destroy the infestation's source, the ferocious Mother Queen. After doing battle with the queen and her guard, the spacer finally slew the beast and returned to Kallaarac a hero. The grateful chieftain rewarded the spacer with 7,000 and a unique, one-handed sword known as the Urnsor'is SoulLeecher."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kallaarac cared deeply for his people and considered the problems of the Myyydril tribe before his own needs. He was very reluctant to ask for help from people in whom he did not have confidence or who did not have the confidence of the tribe. Kallaarac's people respected him immensely and considered him a great leader and a very noble being. He had dark brown fur and, like the majority of his species, spoke only the Shyriiwook language."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kallaarac is a non-playable character who appears in Rage of the Wookiees, the 2005 expansion pack for Star Wars Galaxies developed by Sony Online Entertainment.
