Though he worked for a number of clients, his loyalty was ultimately to credits\u2014and by extension, the highest bidder. Bane employed a variety of weapons and allies to ensure that he always got his pay, and he became the leader in his line of work after fellow bounty hunter Jango Fett perished in the opening battle of the war. His renown attracted the attention of Count Dooku and even the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, the latter of whom employed him numerous times for his own means. Working for Sidious, Bane stole a Jedi holocron from the Jedi Temple to unlock the Kyber memory crystal, a repository of all recorded Force-sensitive infants in the galaxy. After pilfering the crystal from Jedi Master Bolla Ropal on Devaron and forcing Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to unlock it, Bane was sent to kidnap four of the infants listed in the crystal. Despite being captured halfway through his job by Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, Bane escaped from Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Mace Windu by luring them into a trap on his hideout, Black Stall Station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane was later hired by the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure and the Hutt Grand Council to break Jabba's criminal uncle, Ziro Desilijic Tiure, out of Republic custody on Coruscant. Forming a team of hunters to execute his job, Bane launched a brazen raid on the Republic Executive Building and captured ten prominent members of the Galactic Senate, using them as hostages to force Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to free Ziro. Once he had secured Ziro's release from the high-security Central Detention Center, Bane disbanded his posse and delivered Ziro to the Hutt Council. When Ziro escaped from their custody on Nal Hutta, Bane was re-hired to track down the crime lord. Though he arrived on Teth too late to secure his bounty, he managed to evade Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Quinlan Vos, who failed to apprehend him for his crimes. At the close of the bounty hunting season, Bane's total bounties surpassed those of all others in field."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After breaking criminal mastermind Moralo Eval out of the Republic's Central Detention Center, Bane became a candidate in Eval's plot to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine for Count Dooku and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Bane thus entered Eval's Box competition to become one of the five mercenaries who would be hired for the job. After passing the tournament alongside fellow hunters Embo, Derrown, Twazzi, and Rako Hardeen, Bane was personally selected by Dooku to lead the operation, and they traveled to Naboo to capture Chancellor Palpatine during the Festival of Light. Despite Bane's success with abducting Palpatine, Dooku betrayed him, having intended for the bounty hunters' operation to simply be a diversion for his own attempt to kidnap the Supreme Chancellor. Abandoned by Dooku, Bane was defeated by Hardeen, who turned out to be none other than Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had gone undercover to infiltrate and foil Eval's plans. Bane nevertheless retained his formidable reputation throughout the Clone Wars, after which he became one of the preferred freelancers for the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Building a reputation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Duros male Cad Bane lived during the last decades of the Galactic Republic and hailed from the planet Duro. He grew up on New Tayana, a space city orbiting the polluted surface of Duro. As a resident of the Descent Ghetto, his best friend became fellow Duros Soopan. He entered bounty hunting by the year 24 BBY, beginning his career by tracking down bail jumpers and other low-level criminals in the slums of his hometown. When he eventually left New Tayana, he swore he would never return. Although he became attached to the financial reward of his missions, Bane recognized that a reputation would be necessary for success in the war-torn climate that he sensed was on the horizon, with rumors of secession abound in the Republic's Outer Rim star systems. To build a name for himself in the galactic community, he decided to kill a Jedi and thus took on a job from Akris Ur'etu, the crime boss of the Skar'kla Consortium, a criminal organization based on the galactic capital of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tasked with eliminating a Jedi who was threatening Ur'etu's operations, Bane worked independently of the gangster's bodyguard retinue and placed a portable sensor field on the compound's roof, which eventually alerted him to the arrival of the Jedi. As the Jedi broke into Ur'etu's compound, Bane followed from afar, noting the intruder's odd usage of several non-Jedi weapons such as a thermal detonator, as well as a long-hilted lightsaber that looked like it had been grafted onto a small pike. In addition, the Jedi appeared as though he was using small jetpacks attached to his feet, instead of jumping with the aid of the Force as Jedi usually did. Bane realized that he was not dealing with a Jedi, but rather an impostor using technology to mimic one. He followed the enemy agent to the Skar'kla Consortium's security center, where he saw him kill Ur'etu's security chief and then Force-choke the crime boss himself. Yet Bane did nothing to help Ur'etu, letting his employer die so that he could confront the false Jedi himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Calling the agent out on his imitation of a Jedi, Bane summarily eliminated his lightsaber and then his right jetpack boot with two blaster shots, causing him to crash into a wall. When the false Jedi apparently used the Force to pull his blaster out of his hand, Bane recognized that the agent was using a monofilament cable with a magnetic grapple and thwarted his alleged Force pull, then discovered upon inspection of the agent's wrist gauntlets that his Force choke of Ur'etu had been nothing more than the use of a gas emitter. Speaking with the defeated agent, Bane confirmed his suspicion that the infiltrator was working as an enforcer for Ur'etu's Hutt rivals, posing as a Jedi to mask his affiliations. Because he would gain no credit for killing a false Jedi, the bounty hunter decided to spare the enemy agent on the condition that he explained how to build miniaturized equipment like his, as such technology would be an incredible asset in the coming war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Basing his technology on that of the Hutt enforcer, Bane constructed a distinctive arsenal of weapons for himself, coming to rely on it in his line of work. He worked for the highest bidder, caring little for who employed him or the faction that his client represented, as long as he received his pay. His usual rate became quite considerable, and his allegiance to credits was so potent that if his quarry offered him a better fee, he had no qualms with turning on his original client. He established bases for himself in a number of locations across the galaxy, from a base of operations in the Outer Rim's Rogue Antar system named Black Stall Station to a secret hideout on the planet Tatooine. He outfitted the former with several booby traps and a laser defense grid to stop his adversaries, countermeasures that no one was reportedly able to survive. Numerous encounters with members of the Jedi Order furthered Bane's respect for them and their Force powers, though he was not intimidated by the Force and even began to specialize in fighting Jedi with his trademark equipment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane opted to remain an independent bounty hunter rather than work through the Bounty Hunters' Guild, an ancient institution that dominated his profession. At one point, he claimed at least three Guild-contracted bounties in the Expansion Region that the Hutt Cartel had posted over a year prior. All of the acquisitions were as deadly as they were elusive, as one of the targets had claimed the lives of two Guild hunters before Bane successfully hunted down the target. Although Bane had kept a low profile while dealing with the Hutts, he attracted the attention of the Guild's leader, Cradossk, who was outraged that an independent hunter had claimed bounties promised to the Guild. Seeking to put a stop to Bane's interference with Guild contracts, Cradossk arranged a meeting with Bane on the planet Ord Mantell. There, Cradossk attempted to trap and kill Bane, who outmaneuvered his rival but chose not to murder him for alleged professional reasons. However, according to Cradossk's own account of the incident in his autobiography Making a Killing, the two met on more cordial terms, merely agreeing to stay out of each other's way."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Wartime fame"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As he gained prominence over the next few years, Bane earned notoriety and a reputation as the galaxy's preeminent mercenary.

With Fett out of the picture, Bane's reputation grew as the war continued between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. He worked with several underworld dregs in his jobs; among their number was the shapeshifting Clawdite Cato Parasitti, a lethal assassin who shared his allegiance to credits. Parasitti subcontracted assignments for him and recruited extra help as he required. During the war, Bane flew the Sleight of Hand, a Telgorn dropship that he extensively modified; he used the ship's ion cannon many a time to disable merchant cargo ships. His work earned him some powerful enemies, and a 500,000 bounty was placed on his head for crimes against the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane was captured at least once by the Republic and was incarcerated in the high-level Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center on Coruscant, which was staffed by the clone troopers of the Coruscant Guard. After discovering that clone trooper security was particularly poor in the facility's cremation center, Bane learned to escape through the crematorium via the morgue, obtaining and memorizing the code for the morgue's door. From the crematorium, he found easy access to the prison's lower landing platforms, which opened out onto the ecumenopolis of Galactic City. Some came to wonder if Bane had allowed himself to be captured on purpose so as to devise a way to escape from the prison. From his numerous exploits, Bane attracted the attention of the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious and his Sith apprentice, Count Dooku, whom he worked for during the war. At some point, Bane had a run-in with Jedi Master Quinlan Vos, who swore to get even with him following the incident. On another occasion, Bane formed a temporary alliance with a pirate gang to advance his own interests. Once his business with the pirates was finished, he took one of the group's swoop bikes as part of his payment."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Manipulations on Kynachi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, the first year of the war, Bane was residing in a shabby hotel room on Coruscant when Darth Sidious contacted him through his compact holoprojector for a job. In what was to grow into an increasingly complex scheme, Bane was contracted to pursue Jedi Master Ring-Sol Ambase, who was embarking on a mission to the planet Kynachi with his Padawan, Nuru Kungurama, and a clone trooper squad. Though he raised his fee due to the involvement of a Jedi, Bane accepted the assignment and immediately left for Kynachi. After bypassing the Trade Federation's blockade of the planet and arriving on the Federation-controlled world, Bane hired the local diner owner Lalo Gunn to befriend and stick close to Kungurama and his squad's clone troopers, who had all been stranded on Kynachi following sabotage to their ship. He also recruited a food vendor to identify any strangers in a town on the planet, hoping to track Kungurama's progress. He provided the vendor with a special comlink that overrode the Federation's frequency jammer, which had been disrupting communications on the planet for over a decade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While staying at a hotel on Kynachi, Bane was contacted by the food vendor, who reported that Kungurama and the three of his squad's clone troopers were headed with Gunn to her diner. Complying with Sidious's latest instructions, Bane proceeded to the diner and staged an elaborate deception in order to manipulate the group's actions, summoning four BX-series droid commandos to fake a fight with him at Gunn's starship, the Hasty Harpy. After the battle droids attacked Kungurama and the clones and were destroyed by the Republic squad, Bane pretended that a luma grenade had blinded him, and troopers CT-5177, nicknamed \"Chatterbox,\" and Knuckles found him lying on the ground in front of the diner. The clones brought Bane into the building, where Kungurama, Dunn, and trooper CT-8863, nicknamed \"Breaker,\" questioned him on his identity and business. Taking the risk of revealing to the trio that he was a bounty hunter in order to more effectively deceive them, Bane lied and stated that the droid commandos had been trying to arrest him and had opened fire on him when he had tried to run away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Gunn questioned why he was on Kynachi, Bane flatly replied that a job had brought him there, but the unsatisfied Gunn put one of the fallen droids' E-5 blaster rifles to his forehead and demanded to know how he had bypassed the Trade Federation's blockade. Bane stated that he had been hired to break someone out of the KynachTech Industries factory prison and that his client had provided him with a datatape of the facility's schematics and pass codes to get through the Federation blockade. His disclosures earned him freedom from the blaster on his forehead. However, Bane truthfully reported that earlier he had seen the factory's droid guards escorting into the prison four Republic troopers and an unconscious Ring-Sol Ambase\u2014the latter of whom, unbeknownst to the others, Bane had been hired to capture alive. With the scenario that Bane had provided, Kungurama, determined to rescue his Master, developed a plan to have Breaker build a new droid\u2014using parts from the disabled droid commandos and the Genetech brain of Gunn's assistant droid, Teejay, who had been destroyed in the droid ambush\u2014to break into the prison. That idea was, in fact, the exact plan that Bane had intended for Kungurama to devise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane accompanied Chatterbox, Knuckles, and Gunn as they reconnoitered the prison, and he then took them to the Kynachi spaceport's Docking Bay 21 to check out his ship, the Sleight of Hand, which the group planned to use to escape from the planet once they had rescued the prisoners from the KynachTech prison. The four then returned to Gunn's transport, where Breaker and Kungurama were assembling the new droid. The unit was successfully reactivated and was renamed \"Cleaver.\" Bane proposed a risky plan to break into the prison and liberate the captives, and the group proceeded to put the stratagem into motion. With Kungurama, Gunn, the troopers, and a poncho-adorned Bane posing as prisoners and Cleaver acting as their droid captor, they were admitted into the facility. Upon entering the prison, the members of the squad dropped their disguises and confronted the facility's Techno Union overseer, Umbrag. As Kungurama cornered Umbrag and demanded information from him, the Overseer inadvertently caused a battle droid to fire its blaster rifle. At the sound of blaster fire, Bane drew his LL-30 blaster pistols and began to shoot at the nearest battle droids, sparking a chaotic firefight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the others' attention focused on the battle, Bane was able to slip away and capture Ring-Sol Ambase, who had been taken prisoner by battle droids. Bane placed the comatose Ambase in a transparisteel stasis pod to keep him in his near-death condition. Bane later returned to the prison with Ambase's lightsaber and found Kungurama, Gunn, and the troopers, who had driven Umbrag away and had been reunited with the rest of their clone squad. Bane continued to deceive the group, stating that he had been unsuccessful in finding his previous quarry. Despite lacking the clones' trust, Bane gave Ambase's lightsaber to Kungurama with the lie that it was all he had found of Ambase; he received Kungurama's thanks before departing, though he refused to give the Padawan his name. Bane used a hoversled taken from the KynachTech factory to transport Ambase's stasis pod and returned to the Sleight of Hand in Docking Bay 21, bringing Ambase's body onto the vessel. Departing from the planet, Bane used his pass codes to bypass several Republic Navy Star Destroyers that had arrived in orbit of the world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After activating his ship's autopilot mode, Bane returned to the main cabin and contacted Sidious, to whom he reported his success. The Sith Lord was pleased with the result and told Bane to deliver Ambase to Bogg 5, the fifth moon of the Bogden system. During the Sleight of Hand's hyperspace trip to Bogg 5, Bane passed the time by watching The Bounty Hunters' Guild's Greatest Hits: Volume VII, a collection of holorecorded assassinations compiled by the Bounty Hunters' Guild that featured the Guild's leader, Cradossk, and his son, Bossk. Bane also corrected a fluctuation in the Telgorn dropship's null quantum field generator and kept watch on Ambase's vital signs. When the Sleight of Hand exited hyperspace near the planet Bogden, Bane piloted his ship to the starship traffic\u2013heavy Bogg 5 and obtained his landing coordinates from a satellite in orbit of the moon. Although his designated landing area on Bogg 5\u2014an unpopulated spot north of Mong'tar City\u2014was empty save for a waiting Punworcca 116-class interstellar sloop, he spent the next two hours circling the vicinity to ensure that he was not being followed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once he had confirmed as much, Bane touched down near the solar sailer and met with the Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress, an agent of Sidious's associate, the Confederate Head of State Count Dooku. After showing Ventress how to operate Ambase's stasis pod, the monitor of which frequently built up with ice that required an ice pick to break, Bane handed the inert Ambase over to her. He then received Sidious's next assignment from her and left for the Bilbringi system to execute the job. He also sent a transmission to Gunn, promising to pay her more credits to ensure that Kungurama and the clone troopers of Breakout Squad, as they had become known, reached the planet Vaced, a task that she accepted. In addition, Bane received information from his client regarding the Black Hole Pirates, a pirate gang that had been stranded in the Black Hole sector due to a black hole that prevented interstellar travel out of the sector. Because Kungurama and Breakout Squad were being led to make a stop there, Bane subcontracted the Patrolian slicer Robonino to infiltrate the Black Hole Pirates, which would allow Robonino to monitor Breakout Squad and ensure that no harm came to any of its members. Bane supplied Robonino with his client's coordinates to the Black Hole sector and told Robonino to take backup with him for the job.

He brought an old leather satchel with one thousand peggats from Sidious to buy the depot from its owner, Drixo the Hutt, but he also took along three deadly IG-86 sentinel droids in case Drixo refused to sell her property. Arriving at Bilbringi Depot, Bane was stopped by two Gamorrean guards at the entrance to Drixo's headquarters, and he used chips of precious metal to bribe them into admitting him to the compound. When the Gamorreans demanded more, Bane simply killed them with his silencer-capped blasters, retrieved his metal offerings, and admitted himself to the depot, with his IG-86 sentinel droids secretly following behind. Proceeding to Drixo's chamber, Bane was intercepted by several of her bodyguards, and a pair of Klatooinian guards stripped him of his blasters while a Rodian guard took the peggat satchel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Speaking with Drixo from the chamber overlooking her pit, Bane conveyed his client's offer to buy Bilbringi Depot for the one thousand peggats. Although Drixo dismissed the bid, she also refused to return the peggats, an action that displeased Bane. With Drixo remaining uncooperative, Bane resorted to his backup plan and had his IG-86 sentinel droids enter the room and open fire on everyone there. In the ensuing chaos of blaster fire, he retrieved his blasters from the Klatooinians and promptly killed them too. With all of Drixo's guards dead, Bane dispatched the two Theelin servants that were down with her in the pit. Though Drixo begged for her life and offered to give Bilbringi Depot to him for free, Bane simply had his droids eliminate her, claiming the depot by force. Leaving no evidence of his work, Bane reported to Sidious the successful capture of Bilbringi Depot, and a pleased Sidious transferred payment to his account. Bilbringi Depot was meanwhile used to further manipulate Breakout Squad."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane next traveled to Vaced Spaceport on Vaced to meet with Lalo Gunn, who had covertly ensured that Breakout Squad had reached there. However, the job had cost Gunn the Hasty Harpy, and she had subsequently been stranded on Vaced. Finding Gunn in a cantina at the spaceport, Bane assured the cross Gunn that she would be well paid for her exploits. As night fell on Vaced, Bane and Gunn waited at the cantina for the bounty hunter Doxun Feez to bring Gunn's payment. While they waited, Gunn attempted to make sense of the \"coincidences\" surrounding Breakout Squad, many of which had been orchestrated by Bane in line with Sidious's plans for Kungurama. Bane nevertheless remained tight-lipped when responding to Gunn's observations, though Guun thought that he seemed surprised to learn that a saboteur on the Hasty Harpy had been responsible for Breakout Squad's detour to the Black Hole sector. Eventually, Robonino showed up with Gunn's pay instead of Feez, who had joined the Black Hole Pirates. Discussion between Gunn and Robonino further revealed that the latter had subcontracted the bounty hunter Bossk, whose capability Bane severely doubted, as \"backup\" for the infiltration of the Black Hole Pirates. After giving Gunn the pouch of credit chips that Robonino had brought, Bane left the cantina to have a brief word in private with Robonino outside."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Besides not being pleased to learn that Doxun Feez had failed to bring Gunn's payment, Bane was further irked that Robonino had subcontracted Bossk for the job involving the Black Hole Pirates. Just as he was lecturing Robonino on subcontracting, Bane noticed a small transmitter on his comrade's shoulder and realized that Gunn, looking to eavesdrop on their conversation after Bane's withholding of information, had secretly placed it there. After alerting Robonino to the device, Bane immediately strode back into the cantina to confront Gunn, who had anticipated and evaded him by hiding in the tavern's storeroom. Failing to find Gunn, Bane returned outside and crushed the transmitter, but an incoming transmission on his holocomm stopped him from pursuing Gunn. Taking the message privately, Bane was hired by Sidious for an assignment that required him to leave Vaced immediately. He was surprised to learn that it again involved Ring-Sol Ambase, who had escaped from Bogg 5 with the clone trooper CT-4012, nicknamed \"Sharp.\" Sharp had been previously captured on Kynachi by Asajj Ventress as Bane had captured Ambase, who\u2014under the impression that he could not trust his fellow Jedi\u2014was now headed with Sharp for Coruscant, where he intended to secure an exotic Chiss escape pod that was currently under study by the Jedi Order. Sidious thus hired Bane to help Ambase retrieve the escape pod."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Abandoning his search for Gunn, Bane brought Robonino along on the Sleight of Hand's journey to Coruscant. There, they located Ambase, who was traveling with Sharp aboard a Corona-class transport to Moxonnic Manufacturing, an abandoned establishment in the Dacho District that had been converted to house the Jedi's laboratory for examining the Chiss escape pod. Heading for Coruscant's night side, Bane landed the Sleight of Hand on the rooftop where Ambase and Sharp had landed, and he went with Robonino to meet them. Speaking with Ambase, Bane told the Jedi Master that he had been hired to help him retrieve the escape pod, having been provided by Sidious with the access codes and equipment to bypass the laboratory's security systems. Bane also provided Ambase and Sharp with Republic Navy officers' uniforms to gain access to the lab building from the guards stationed inside. Though Ambase, whom Dooku had manipulated, was skeptical of Bane, he conceded that they were wasting time and followed the bounty hunter's plan. Entering the lab, Bane, Ambase, Sharp, and Robonino bypassed both automated and guard security, with Robonino sealing the checkpoint door behind them with a magna lock. Along the way to the room housing the escape pod, Bane shot down three sentry droids that Sidious had not made him aware of, while Robonino was forced to use thermal detonators to open the door to the room."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once inside the main laboratory room, Bane powered up the Sleight of Hand from his gauntlets while Robonino planted explosives on the far wall, so that Bane could use his Telgorn dropship's tractor beam to remove the escape pod from the lab.

With everything in place, Robonino blew apart the westward wall, allowing Bane to remotely guide the Sleight of Hand through the hole to lock onto the Chiss spacecraft. After Ambase had unlocked the Jedi energy lock keeping the pod secured to the ground, Bane climbed into his dropship and locked onto the pod with the tractor beam. Robonino, Ambase, and Sharp then joined him aboard the ship, which Bane piloted out of the laboratory, heading for the building's roof. There, Bane and Robonino helped Ambase and Sharp load the Chiss spacecraft onto their Corona-class transport. As soon as they had finished, Bane heard the whine of an approaching starship's engine and sighted an incoming TL-1800 freighter, which in fact contained Kungurama and Breakout Squad, who intended to prevent Ambase from stealing the escape pod. Before Kungurama could land, Bane immediately boarded the Sleight of Hand with Robonino, firing a missile at Kungurama's freighter before departing from the vicinity. Focused on Ambase, Kungurama believed that Ambase had been responsible for the missile, and a duel between the two erupted as soon as Bane had left, as Darth Sidious had planned."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Theft from Kul Teska"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that year, using the Sleight of Hand, Bane hijacked one of the two Gravitic Cores of the gravitic polarization beam weapon manufactured by the Separatist scientist Kul Teska\u2014a \"competitor\" of his\u2014over the ice world Alzoc III. After stealing one crate containing the Core, Bane detonated the other Core to cover his escape from Teska's Munificent-class star frigate, leaving it to be hit by the ensuing explosion. He took the Sleight of Hand to the planet Ryloth, which the Grand Army of the Republic had recently liberated from the Confederacy. In the city of Resdin, Bane captured Clone Captain CT-7567 and Clone Sergeant CS-2207\u2014nicknamed \"Rex\" and \"Boomer,\" respectively\u2014to assist him in his exploits. Bringing Rex and Boomer to a hangar and placing them in explosive-wired binders, Bane forced the clones to comply with his demands. As Separatist battle droids broke into the hangar, Rex and Boomer agreed to defend Bane's crate and take the cargo to his ship elsewhere on the planet. With the pair's promised cooperation, the bounty hunter released the links on the pair's handcuffs, allowing them to operate freely.

After the group had taken down a large octuptarra magna tri-droid, Bane directed his blaster fire at the Jedi and clones. Skywalker rebounded the laser shots, causing the bounty hunter to lose his balance atop a platform and tumble to the ground; the Jedi then held Bane at lightsaber point. The bounty hunter's bargaining chips were rendered defunct when Skywalker severed the clones' binders. Rex and Boomer then disarmed Bane, though he kept an extra pistol hidden elsewhere. As explosions went off outside, Bane proposed the Sleight of Hand as a means of escape. With no other options, Skywalker took Bane up on his offer and sent Rex and Boomer to provide covering fire from an elevated position. Though unaware of the crate's contents, Skywalker and Tano were unwilling to let it fall into Separatist hands and forced Bane to carry the Core to his ship.

Skywalker and Tano jumped across a gap in their path and used the Force to collapse a fighter wing, enabling Bane to cross the divide with the Gravitic Core. When Skywalker, Tano, and Bane took a cliff-side path, they gradually moved beyond the clones' range and were forced to cope without their covering fire. After Skywalker and Tano had eliminated a thicket of B1, DSD1, sabotage, and destroyer droids in addition to a squad of LM-432 crab droids, Bane followed the pair to the ground and across a destroyed droid tank to an adjacent ridge. Arriving at the Sleight of Hand, Bane set his crate down and slowly retrieved his alternate pistol as Skywalker conferred with his Padawan. At that moment, some of the wreckage surrounding the dropship exploded.

As the Jedi and Teska engaged each other in a duel, Bane sneaked away and made his own escape from Ryloth. Although Teska fled with the Core and stole the Sleight of Hand, Bane later intervened in the Republic's siege of Teska's facility on the planet Behpour. While Teska's gravitic beam powered up to attack the Naboo sun, Bane exacted his revenge on the scientist by firing at Teska's rocket boosters during the scientist's fight with Skywalker and Tano in the weapon's core room, stranding Teska on the central platform. Leaving Teska to be defeated by Skywalker and Tano, Bane retrieved his Telgorn dropship and escaped from Behpour.

It was not long, however, before Bane was fighting the very same Jedi Knight. When the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure hired Bane to deal with an ongoing conflict between the Jedi and a pirate gang in Tatooine's Dune Sea, the Jedi Knight became Bane's target. Eventually, Count Dooku hired Bane to spread a clone trooper virus at the Republic's Kaliida Shoals Medical Center. During the course of that gambit, Bane was captured and incarcerated in a Republic detention center, but he approached the Jedi Knight he had dealt with earlier, offering to make a deal while instead intending to escape from the prison.

He moved Enisence's body to his apartment in a seedy Coruscant underworld hotel, where Sidious personally contacted him with his real mission: stealing a holocron from the Jedi Temple's Archives. Sidious required the holocron to access the Kyber memory crystal, a repository of all Force-sensitive children in the galaxy that was under the protection of Jedi Master Bolla Ropal; the Sith Lord also employed Bane to purloin the crystal. Bane initially believed infiltrating the Temple to be impossible, but when Sidious put his reputation into question, Bane agreed to the assignment regardless of its costs, albeit with the request for an elite Rogue-class starfighter and triple his usual rate.

That decision earned Bane a confrontation from Kenobi, who abandoned his cover to protect the Chancellor. As a fight broke out, Bane knocked Kenobi backward and fired upon him, using his rocket boots to gain elevation over his opponent. Just as he did so, Kenobi brazenly jumped after him and grabbed onto his legs, forcing Bane back down before throwing him straight into Eval. Kenobi's victory was soon followed by the arrival of Skywalker and Windu, along with a squad of clone shock troopers, who rescued the Chancellor from the bounty hunters. Bane and Eval were taken into custody by the clone troopers, with Windu finally revealing the real identity of \"Hardeen\" to Bane. Furious with being deceived, Bane spat venom at Kenobi as he was escorted away, his work for Dooku going unpaid.

After landing in docking bay TH X-11-38, Bane left the rest of his crew behind, promising that it would be a quick stop. At the sheriff's office, he informed the sheriff that he intended to collect the bounty on himself. Bane was unfazed when his statement was met with laughter, opening fire with his blasters and frightening the sheriff into giving him the information on the bounty. He then made his way to the impostor's stronghold\u2014a converted Descent Shopping Mall, where he confronted Soopan. From his office at the top of the building, Soopan kept up the act of being the \"real\" Cad Bane and sent his criminal underlings into battle against Bane. Nevertheless, Bane made it through the twenty-plus floors of the building and broke into Soopan's office. Faced with accusations of his forgery, Soopan admitted to his sham, stating that he had only wanted a taste of real power. For old time's sake, Bane decided to spare his former friend, telling him that he would decide how the story ended. He also refused to accept the credits on the bounty for the impostor. With that, Bane returned to the docking bay and gathered Ttekket and their crew, departing from New Tayana shortly thereafter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane maintained his reputation as a veteran hunter throughout the Clone Wars, even until the war ended in 19 BBY.

He was still active as of 18 BBY. According to Cradossk, though Bane's frequent clashes with the Jedi Order had earned him the reputation of an outlaw during the Clone Wars, Emperor Palpatine's degradation of the Jedi resulted in popular perception of Bane becoming much more favorable during Imperial times.

One of the galaxy's most lethal, ruthless, fearsome, and deadly bounty hunters, he earned the reputation of the foremost blaster-for-hire during the Clone Wars, filling the position that fellow mercenary Jango Fett had occupied until his death. Quintessentially cold, cruel, and capable in his line of work, Bane was unscrupulous and had much less moral content than his closest rival, Boba Fett; Bane ignored the morality of his work and often turned upon his own clients unless he was paid. His loyalty was ultimately to credits and therefore to the highest bidder who offered them. His usual rate was considerable, but so was his reputation, to the point that his quarries knew that nothing would stop him from capturing them. He regarded credits with the highest importance, and though he did not pass up the opportunity to demand more pay from his clients, he was very dedicated to his work if paid the right amount for it. He took on jobs that were considered to be tough, costly, dangerous, and even impossible, earning respect for accepting and accomplishing such tasks. If offered enough pay, he did not place any restrictions on the client or contracted quarry, regardless of whether the latter was a person or a possession."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Crafty, resourceful, vicious, and brutally ruthless, Bane was good at what he did. He was a clever strategist and carefully planned his trap for the Jedi during the Battle of Devaron; he was willing to sacrifice anything, even an entire Trade Federation fleet, to lure the Jedi into it. Displays of his astuteness included his setup for rival mercenary Davtokk to unwittingly serve as a test for his own team of hunters, his pilferage of the murdered Denal's armor to ensure his own escape at Devaron, and his ruse for Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi at Black Stall Station that allowed him another getaway. The fact that Bane was able to free Ziro the Hutt with consummate ease was a testament to his overall abilities. He chose to orchestrate his raid on the Senate during guard shift changes to maximize his element of surprise\u2014and his casualties\u2014by eliminating the majority of the active Senate security all at once, thereby showing his opponents no mercy. He was autonomous as a bounty hunter and did not place his trust in others easily or often, believing that the best way to ensure that a task was completed was to do it himself. As such, when his frigate was crippled over Devaron, he ordered his battle droid crew to transfer full control of the ship to his wrist-com so that he could use it against his opponents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane was tenacious, and it was said that he could not be stopped and would pursue his prey across the galaxy if necessary, no matter how dangerous the mission or the target. He even enjoyed difficult assignments. Early on in his career, he believed that war was on the horizon and sought to best profit from it, leading to his widespread success during the resultant Clone Wars. He was both respected and feared in his line of work, and he would not let anyone stand in his way. To him, a good bounty hunter made his own rules and ensured that the odds were in his favor. He was smooth and thorough in his jobs and did not leave a mess behind unless paid to do so; as such, he derided Sy Snootles's assassination of Ziro as sloppy. One of his worst pet peeves was when someone else did his assignment for him and denied him his client's payment, as was the case when Snootles killed Ziro before he could reach him. Despite his penchant for a good fight, Bane preferred to use stealth and surprise tactics to avoid a direct fight when possible. Although he would have enjoyed taking down the likes of Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker and indeed pursued them on several occasions, Bane did not let personal feelings get in the way of his work. Even so, he pursued Kul Teska\u2014a \"competitor\" of his\u2014to Behpour after Teska retrieved the Gravitic Core and stole his ship on Ryloth. Bane took his revenge on Teska by firing at him, trapping him during his fight with Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano and leading to his death. In spite of his professionalism, he took it personally when people spied on him, as was the case when Lalo Gunn attempted to eavesdrop on him on Vaced. Bane did not hesitate to fight Kenobi and Quinlan Vos on Teth for the Separatist bounties on Jedi, and he also pursued killing Skywalker when their paths crossed on Orondia. Yet regardless of how tough he was, Bane always kept his cool under control. Whereas his client, Moralo Eval, panicked on several occasions due to setbacks to their escape from Republic custody, Bane kept a cool head and took time to think out a solution to their problems, not allowing unfavorable odds to get the better of him."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Solo hunter, effective leader"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Bane did not always operate alone, he usually worked solo, as doing so gave him the freedom of improvisation and more credits that did not have to be split with others. When he recognized that the job was big enough, he employed his fellow hunters for assistance, though he preferred to keep both his methods for selecting comrades for joint operations and his introduction into the bounty business itself obscure to the galaxy at large. He proved his skill as a leader while commanding the posse that he formed to free Ziro the Hutt from Republic custody, and his assured manner and brutal methods earned him respect from his underlings. Bane frequently displayed a lack of concern for his accomplices, caring little what happened to his team after they had liberated Ziro, provided that they avoided capture by the Republic. When the Jedi captured his comrade, Cato Parasitti, during their joint infiltration of the Jedi Temple, Bane did not attempt to rescue her. Instead, he ignored her plight and left her in the Jedi's custody to continue his work for Darth Sidious. He even swore to return the favor when Parasitti tipped the Jedi off to his next target."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When he subcontracted bounty hunters for his jobs, Bane chose his comrades carefully. At various times, he worked with Cato Parasitti, Robonino, Aurra Sing, and Boba Fett on more than one occasion. He did not particularly care for the mercenary Bossk, whom he saw as a bumbling fool. He disliked operating in groups when not in charge, as was the case while working for Moralo Eval alongside Rako Hardeen. He took an immediate disliking to Hardeen, who was in actuality a disguised Obi-Wan Kenobi, while working with him to escape from the Central Detention Center. He went so far as to punch Kenobi on one occasion for hesitating to take a clone trooper's life during their escape, and also attempted to strand him on Nal Hutta to take the fall for his and Moralo Eval's crimes. As he admitted to Eval, the latter exploit came from both business and personal reasons. Nevertheless, the undercover Kenobi began to earn Bane's trust as they worked together on Orondia, and later in the Box as part of Count Dooku's mercenary competition on Serenno. When Eval attempted to kill Kenobi by deactivating his platform above a flame emitter field, Bane, who had amassed some measure of respect for the undercover Jedi Master, saved him by firing his cable launcher at him, telling Eval to kill Kenobi like a man instead of from afar in the Box. Even when working with such successful hunters as Embo, Twazzi, Derrown, and Moralo Eval, Bane did not tell his accomplices more than they needed to know in regards to the plan to kidnap Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.

He was fearless and unflappable in the face of danger, and he remained undaunted by the Senate Commandos' attempt to arrest him, Palpatine's threats of retribution for his crimes, and the Jedi's interrogation of him aboard the Resolute. During the latter situation, Bane refused to disclose the identity of his wealthy and powerful Sith Lord client, though Mace Windu simply attributed his lack of submission to the questioning to his fear of his hirer. Seeing as no client was too \"wicked\" for him, the grim-faced Bane worked for the shadowy Darth Sidious on numerous occasions, as the bounty hunter's reputation was distinguished enough to attract Sidious's attention. When Sidious recruited his services for infiltrating the Jedi Temple, Bane believed the mission to be a tough challenge, if not impossible and foolhardy. However, he immediately agreed to the costly assignment when Sidious challenged his reputation. He was gutsy enough to haggle with the Sith Lord, requesting three times his usual rate for the job."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane took pleasure in striking fear in his quarries and captives, as evidenced by his treatment of the senators during his brazen hostage-taking in the Senate. He responded to Senator Philo's refusal to submit to his \"insolence\" by killing Philo without hesitation, showing the other senators that he meant business. Bolla Ropal's refusal to help Bane open the holocron prompted the mercenary to intensify his torture of the Jedi Master, ultimately killing him. Bane deemed Ropal's sacrifice to be foolish and held little regard for his life, walking away from the murder scene without a backward glance and seeing the death as only a slight delay in achieving his objective. A dispassionate realist and an arrogant killer, the callous Bane was happy to cause collateral damage as part of his work. He did not take prisoners, preferring to instead obliterate everything and everyone in his path to his intended victims, regardless of the trail of carnage he left. As such, he sought to kill his senator hostages even after he had used them to secure Ziro the Hutt's freedom. He had no problems with going back on his word, exemplified in his discharge of the explosives that were keeping the senators trapped in the Executive Building's atrium, even after he and his Hutt quarry had successfully escaped from the Senate. Similarly, when Skywalker attempted to attack him during a standoff aboard his frigate, Bane opened the airlock that Tano was trapped in and endangered her life despite bargaining just minutes before for her safe release."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Tactics and methods"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A master bounty hunter, Bane saw preparation as the key to any operation's success, being able to quickly assess his opponents and correspondingly equip himself. Even though he could not plan for every outcome, he tried to minimize the need to improvise on the spot by always having a plan ready, devising as many options as possible to ensure that there would always be a profitable way out. Whenever possible, he exploited his opponents' weaknesses, which was most often their overconfidence or their care for each others' well-being. He put much effort into protecting the locations of his hideouts, specifically on Coruscant; he often commandeered civilian airspeeders while operating there to eliminate direct trails to his hideouts. Bane's heavy restrictions on the allotment of his trust led him to develop several special skills\u2014including the ability to gather and make use of data to control situations\u2014that rivaled his adeptness at creating chaos. He preferred that everything operated his way, and his perennial belief in the chance that someone was after him fueled his skill for staying ahead of his opponents. He valued security over punctuality, and while preparing to land on Bogg 5, he did not hesitate to spend an extra two hours executing a roundabout landing course to ensure that he was not being followed, regardless of the setback that he caused to his waiting client."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane made sure that he did not place all of his trust in starship sensors and developed several habits, including the constant monitoring of shipboard displays and reports, as part of his ongoing routine to ensure that he would not become a victim to anyone or anything, faulty technology included. He did not waste his time while out of combat, using a hyperspace trip from Kynachi to Bogg 5 as an opportunity to hone and broaden his bounty hunting skills by watching a pirated Bounty Hunters' Guild's Greatest Hits holovid. Although he did so intending to acquire the holovid's exclusive Guild techniques for killing amphibious targets, he only received a few laughs from watching the film's portrayal of the entertainingly disagreeable pair of Cradossk and his son, Bossk, who were both contemporaries of his. Bane frequently resorted to bribery and deception to achieve his own ends. He was a good liar, to the point that only experienced individuals like Lalo Gunn were able to tell when he was keeping information to himself. A talented actor, he was able to deceive Nuru Kungurama and a squad of clone troopers while on Kynachi, though the clones eventually came to mistrust him. He secretly manipulated the group into raiding the KynachTech prison by staging an elaborate fight with several droid commandos to mask his machinations. To gain the group's trust, Bane revealed that he was a bounty hunter; regardless of the risk he took in doing so, he knew that it was easier to deceive someone by telling most of the truth rather than a complete lie.

When the Jedi turned out to be an impostor working for the Hutts, he had no qualms with allowing Ur'etu to die so that he could learn how to construct the agent's miniature equipment, in which he saw incredible promise. Bane came to specialize in fighting Jedi and did not fear them like other bounty hunters did. Although he developed a certain level of respect for them and their abilities, he was not intimidated by the Force and believed that they sometimes placed too much faith in it. He was capable of outwitting and posing a significant challenge to the Jedi, and he even welcomed the chance to test his abilities against their legendary prowess. In the case of Ring-Sol Ambase, Bane would have gladly killed his Jedi target on the spot, but refrained from doing so because he had not been paid to. Despite the fact that his mind was too sharp and his will too strong to be bent by Jedi mind tricks, the combined influence exerted by Anakin Skywalker, Mace Windu, and Obi-Wan Kenobi forced him to submit to their demands. Because he lacked sensitivity to the Force, Bane evened the odds against his Jedi opponents by employing his surroundings as weapons, countering Skywalker's forces with his frigate's shipboard functions and escaping from Windu and Kenobi by maneuvering them into Black Stall Station's deadly laser grid.

He took every chance to turn their \"misplaced chivalry\"\u2014their inclination to capture rather than kill their quarries\u2014against them, and he even exploited Ahsoka Tano's pride and overbearing faith in her own abilities. Bane found that the trick with defeating Jedi was to stave off an open fight for as long as possible, thereby whittling them down by attrition. He also discovered several effective ways of wearing down a Jedi's concentration and ability to use the Force: bombarding the Jedi with sonics and dense blaster fire, disorienting him or her by assuming complete control of the surrounding environment, and cutting his adversary off from any means of support. Bane recognized Skywalker as a deadly fighter in open combat, and instead of engaging him directly, he elected to confront the overly compassionate Skywalker with difficult moral choices by employing those close to him as hostages. He was careful to keep Skywalker occupied to prevent him from planning ahead. In the case of Tano, Bane found it easy to exploit the Padawan's pride and overbearing faith in her abilities by isolating her and waiting for the right moment to strike back. Even Grand Master Yoda's skill with the Force was not a source of intimidation for Bane; rather, he believed that given the right circumstances, Yoda could be pushed into a corner and then executed by means of an expertly timed sniper shot.

Given his formidable reputation, Bane was a highly skilled mercenary. He possessed a stoic tolerance for pain and Jedi mind tricks, the latter of which he was normally\u2014though not always\u2014immune to. A cunning fighter who was skilled in the various forms of the art of combat, Bane was well known for his prowess in combat and was one of the deadliest beings in the galaxy with a blaster. Said to rarely miss a target, he was able to kill targets with precise shots at point-blank range. He was also able to hit moving targets, such as clone troopers during the firefight aboard his frigate at Devaron. Although Ahsoka Tano got the better of him during that engagement by disarming him, he simply used her \"victory\" as a distraction to electrocute her and take her hostage.

His usual choice of clothing included a wide-brimmed hat and a nashtah-hide tunic with a heavy cloak, an outfit that became his trademark appearance. For head gear, he preferred a hat to a helmet, the latter of which he refused to hide under in spite of its extra protection.

At one point, Bane sacrificed Todo as a distraction to escape from the Jedi Temple, but the droid was later reconstructed and returned to serve him.

According to Bane's StarWars.com Databank entry, some first season publicity materials mistakenly implied that Darth Sidious and the Separatists had hired Bane to free Ziro. Although the Databank entry went on to state that Bane was working for the Hutts when he liberated Ziro, the 2009 Star Wars: The Clone Wars \u2013 The Official Episode Guide: Season 1 publication further complicated the matter by claiming that Bane's employer had yet to be identified in Season Two, though none of the episodes featuring Bane even alluded to the Senate hostage crisis. The issue was finally resolved in the 2010 third season episode \"Evil Plans,\" which solidified the Databank's claim that the Hutts had hired Bane, despite Jabba the Hutt's grudge against Ziro. Furthermore, an in-universe explanation for the mistaken involvement of the Separatists was provided in the 2012 Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded, which stated that the Hutts had framed the Confederacy for Bane's actions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The storyline of the Nintendo DS edition of Republic Heroes greatly contradicts the plot of episodes within the television series' first season, as well as the other editions of Republic Heroes. In the DS edition, Bane contacts the Republic from a Separatist prison on Ryloth, where he is being held, and offers to sell information about a secret Confederate facility, but insists on only dealing with Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala. The Jedi believe the bounty hunter's information to be critical in uncovering a large Separatist plot and decide to rescue Bane, sending Jedi Master Kit Fisto as Amidala's escort. The two infiltrate the prison and rescue Bane, but Fisto gets separated from the senator in the process. Bane promises to reveal the information if Amidala takes him to his ship, the Xanadu Blood, and they fight through battle droids before eventually reaching the craft. Sticking to his word, Bane tells the senator of Juma 9\u2014which, in this case, is a strategic Confederate outpost, while in the other editions of the game it is an active Republic mining facility. It is protected by a defense perimeter, which can only be bypassed with recent Separatist clearance codes. This leads into a storyline involving the Confederate General Grievous's castle on the third moon of Vassek that ignores the plot and aims of the Jedi raid on the lair already portrayed in the television series' first season. Because of this story's extremely conflicting plot that would otherwise require too much fan-based speculation to integrate into the canonical biography, this article assumes that the Nintendo DS edition of Republic Heroes is non-canonical."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The publication Star Wars: The Clone Wars Comic UK 6.15 introduced an Infinities\u2014non-canonical\u2014version of the episode \"Hostage Crisis.\" While taking the Senate hostage to free Ziro the Hutt, Bane and his accomplices are confronted by Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who is in possession of Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber.

While Grievous and IG-86 assassin droids battle the Jedi in a firefight, Bane simply sits back and watches the show. After Grievous flees from the cantina, Bane is hired by several battle droids to hunt down R2-D2, and he calls in several of his mercenary accomplices to assist him in the gambit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to presenting more humorous and comical depictions of Bane in \"Hostage Crisis,\" the LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars video game also modified the episode's storyline.

The level featuring the Senate hostage crisis ends after the Republic Executive Building's power generator is shut down.
