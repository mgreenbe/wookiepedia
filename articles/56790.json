Inside the pit was a creature known as a sarlacc, which could swallow an individual whole and slowly digest them over one thousand years. Due to its proximity to Jabba the Hutt's palace, the crime lord used the pit and its sarlacc for torturous executions. The pit was the location of the rescue of Han Solo, which took place shortly before the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sound of the sarlacc was created from sounds of alligator hisses, as well as the sounds of some of the Jedi crew's stomachs after eating pizza."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
