The base was actually a recruiting station for the Empire Reborn, and was commanded by a member of the Reborn, Force-imbued soldiers. Katarn killed all residents of the base, except for one soldier, who was left horrified by the encounter. NRI Captain Hantor Loftus later led a recovery and incarceration team to the base to clean up. Little information was gathered from the Imperial survivor but he did reveal that his orders originated from Kejim. Kyle Katarn was then sent to this planet by Mon Mothma in order to investigate the information."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
