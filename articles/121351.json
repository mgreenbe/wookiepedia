In 18 ABY, New Republic Intelligence agent Belindi Kalenda set up a pair of macrobinoculars in a window of an unoccupied house on the planet Corellia to alert her to any activity outside the house down the street where New Republic Chief of State Leia Organa Solo was staying with her family. The macrobinoculars were sensitive enough that they would go off if a sea skimmer flew past the window."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sea skimmer was first mentioned in Ambush at Corellia, the first novel in The Corellian Trilogy, written by Roger MacBride Allen and published in March 1995.
