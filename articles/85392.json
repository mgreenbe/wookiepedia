He was hired by the Corporate Alliance many times, often for clandestine and illegal missions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 39 BBY, Passel Argente hired Magus to assassinate twenty leaders at a conference on Rondai-2. Magus assembled a group of bounty hunters that included Raptor, Pilot, Lunasa, as well as the notorious Gorm the Dissolver in order to carry out the mission. However, after a young boy, Talesan Fry, or Taly, discovered their plans, they were forced to hunt him down before he brought the information before the Galactic Senate. A group of pirates captured Taly and returned the boy to Magus. He then set off for Rondai-2 to carry out his mission, bringing Taly along to use as a shield. Unfortunately for Magus, a group of Jedi Knights composed of Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Adi Gallia, and Siri Tachi disrupted the assassination attempt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Jedi killed Raptor and captured Lunasa and Gorm, Magus and Pilot attempted to escape with Talesan. Magus fled the Jedi on an airspeeder, forcing both Pilot and Talesan to fall off. Pilot fell to his death, but Taly was rescued by Siri Tachi. After having his plans foiled, Magus retaliated by hunting down Taly's parents and murdering them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Magus then went into hiding, not reappearing for some twenty years, again working for Passel Argente and the Corporate Alliance, now part of the Separatist movement. Argente dispatched him to the neutral world Genian to recover a top-secret device from Helina Dow. He retrieved the codebreaker, and shot Helina during his escape. Unknown to Magus, however, the codebreaker he had stolen had been a useless prototype. However, a tracer installed in the real device by Helina allowed the Separatists to track it to Azure. On Azure, Magus joined the Separatist in their attack on a secret Republic base. He attempted to eliminate Taly once and for all, but his ship was disabled by Siri Tachi. During the ensuing struggle, Magus fatally shot Siri, who managed to render him unconscious. Siri died from her wounds, and Magus was taken into Republic custody."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
