The compound consisted of a central headquarters and two dome shaped structures protected by a wall, which separated them from a credit vault, two credit markets and a landing pad. Five autoturrets defended the base, which was also built around a number of womp rat nests. Between the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Hoth during the Galactic Civil War, a gang of mercenaries led by the Human Saponza and his partner began searching for the source of increased attacks by womp rats on locals. The gang was alerted to the presence of the base by an ally faction which lent them troops to attack the base. Saponza and his men managed to destroy the base despite a defense by seventeen womp rats and the turrets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The base first appeared as a map in the first chapter of Star Wars: Commander, a mobile strategy game released by Disney Interactive in 2014."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
