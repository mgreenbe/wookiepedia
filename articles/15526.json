During the waning years of the Galactic Republic, a secret base of the Metatheran Cartel trade alliance on the moon Tilnes was kitted with a bean juice boiler. Circa 21 BBY, the Caarite technician Celis Bol spat in some bean juice prepared for the Cartel base's overseer Ko Bas and was threatened with being tasked with re-programming the bean juice boiler to identify impurities in the juice as a punishment. Bol regarded this as a tempting proposition because such a task would have allowed the technician to program the boiler to their identity their own spittle as a contaminant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bean juice boiler was created by Morrie Mullins and mentioned in Caaried Away, a roleplaying adventure published in March 2003 that formed part of the Metatheran Caution trilogy of the Living Force roleplaying campaign."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
