It lasted at least seventeen days, and involved extracting a prisoner-to-be going by the name of \"Rax\" from Alderaan, before delivering him to Coruscant. Solo and Chewbacca managed to collect their cargo, but their ship took minor damage to almost all of its parts when the border guard caught them flying without official papers. When \"Rax\" complained about the lack of luxury of his sleeping quarters, Chewbacca, finding him ungrateful, told him to be quiet. Because the man did not understand Shyriiwook, he nearly fainted in terror, thinking that the Wookiee had threatened him. During the mission, Chewbacca kept logs that documented its progress."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
