He had just crash-landed the cruiser Valcyn on the surface of Dxun. He was badly injured and needed something immediately. He found a medpac kit in the cockpit,and inside he found several health stims still intact. He injected himself in the thigh with one, and within seconds, the health stim had kicked his body's own natural healing properties into overdrive.
