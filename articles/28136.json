Such regulators were extremely cold in temperature, and shot a green beam of energy into a ship's engines which was powerful enough to tear a vessel in two if the regulator was dislodged. During the Great Hyperspace Disaster in 232 BBY, the transport Vessel's coaxium regulator became unhitched from its station after the starship was sideswiped by hyperspace debris from the Legacy Run. Copilot Affie Hollow and Jedi Padawan Reath Silas, one of the ship's passengers, were able to repair the regulator mounting and prevent further damage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
