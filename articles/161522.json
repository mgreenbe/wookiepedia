Appointed as the battlemaster of the Coruscant Jedi Temple by the Jedi High Council, Faalo was regarded as one of the most proficient instructors of his time. During his time as battlemaster, Faalo authored the Book of Practical Lightsaber Technique. In his book, he detailed a series of training cadences in which a Jedi attempted to manipulate small steel bearings atop candles with their lightsabers. He also described a telekinetic lightsaber technique, which would be later named \"Faalo's Will\" after him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Long after Faalo's physical death, his teachings lived on in the Jedi Order for several centuries.
