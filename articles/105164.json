Wookiees would use scented compounds to lure them into mesh lanterns and use them for light. They were one of the many bioluminescent organisms found in the lower levels of the wroshyr tree forests, which experienced continual darkness due to the thick canopy above. Because they could fly, they would make nightly migrations to the upper reaches of the forest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
