It was very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although Talon Karrde's smugglers found a way, enabling Grand Admiral Thrawn to do it as well. Thrawn used ysalamiri for defense by attaching them to a back harness or a nutrient frame which allowed him and his men to remain safely inside the ysalamiri's Force repelling bubble. He used this trick to gain the attention of cloned Dark Jedi Master Joruus C'baoth and accelerated the Spaarti cloning process without the usual side-effects (which occurred when similar Force imprints interfered with one another)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ysalamiri did not actually negate the Force; since all existence was infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they projected a bubble inside which users were unable to exert any influence over the Force.

According to Zahn, the idea of a creature that could impede a Jedi's access to The Force was the first idea he had for the story after hearing from his agent about the offer to write a book series that continued the story of Star Wars after Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. The author initially received many complaints from readers regarding Thrawn's explanation in Heir to the Empire that ysalamiri could \"push back\" the Force on the grounds that the Force was created by all living beings and could not be \"pushed back\" in that manner. He would clarify that Thrawn's explanation was inaccurate and ysalamiri simply supress the level of the Force present, a distinction that was later shown more clearly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
