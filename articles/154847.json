Jace encountered this Sith on the bridge and immediately began firing at her, to which she gracefully evaded his fire. Jace slammed into her, damaging her ribs and tried to strike her head with his elbow. The Sith was too fast and she hit him with Force lightning. Jace managed to hold onto his blaster rifle and survived death due to his armor, yet his helmet's visuals were damaged. The Sith went for her lightsaber, but discovered she had dropped it. Paying dearly for her mistake, Jace shot her in the chest and lungs, her dying command telling the crew to initiate the self-destruct."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
