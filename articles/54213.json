They were capable of movement on land and in water, though their speed was far greater in the latter. Ghests possessed a long serpentine body covered in green scales and had powerful arms ending in clawed hands with four digits. Their heads included a mouth full of sharp teeth and two pale, round eyes. Ghests were strong enough to toss speeder bikes short distances with their arms. They were capable of roaring and hissing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ghests' prey usually consisted of birds and herbivores. The creatures lived in the jungle swamps of their homeworld, Rodia. When hunting, ghests preferred to ambush their prey by moving quietly through the murky swamp water before striking at creatures on the shore. They rarely hunted on land, as they were far slower out of water and perceived such slowness as a weakness, preferring to strike quickly. Ghests were intelligent enough to learn from their mistakes, knowing not to attack targets that they had already found inedible. When frustrated, ghests would roar. They were capable of hibernating for extended periods of time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A dangerous prey"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sentient Rodian species of Rodia hunted ghests in teams, although by the time of the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, ghest hunts had become less frequent. Hunters faced notorious difficulty in getting a kill shot on a ghest before the creature bit them in half, resulting in many ghest-hunting parties sustaining at least one casualty. At least one ghest ended up as a specimen in the Shadow Stacks collection of the Graf Archive on the moon Orchis 2. One student hoping to become an archivist examined the ghest under the belief that it was mummified but realized he was in danger when it turned out to have simply been hibernating."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Hunting at Huulik's mausoleum"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, the Jedi Luke Skywalker and the Rodian Taneetch Soonta encountered a ghest in the jungles of Rodia while trying to visit the mausoleum of Soonta's uncle Huulik, who had served as a Jedi Knight during the Clone Wars. The pair landed on a swamp shoreline near the mausoleum on a pair of speeder bikes, one of which the ghest pounced upon after the travelers had dismounted. The beast lifted the vehicle and bit down upon its steering vanes before realizing it could not eat the bike, which caused it to roar in anger and hurl the speeder into a nearby rock shelf. With the bike destroyed, the ghest stared and hissed at Skywalker and Soonta before retreating to the water."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two then made their way to the mausoleum, where Soonta recovered Huulik's lightsaber from her uncle's sarcophagus and gifted it to Skywalker, who had revealed he wished to become a Jedi Knight. Upon Soonta's encouragement, Skywalker returned as bait to the water's edge with both his own and Huulik's lightsaber drawn. After a moment of waiting, Skywalker questioned if the beast had simply left, but the ghest pounced immediately after from the Jedi's left. Skywalker swung one of his sabers at the predator and decapitated it, but not before its teeth had sunk into his shoulder. After the separated head was removed from Skywalker's shoulder, Soonta captured images of its corpse and the destroyed bike before the pair left the jungle so that Skywalker could get to an infirmary."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ghests were originally created by Peter Venters and Chuck Truett for Creatures of the Galaxy, a Star Wars Legends sourcebook released in 1994 for West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.
