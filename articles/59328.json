Although normally the Je'daii would have found the case to be too trivial to intervene, the site held suspected archaeological significance in the form of a possible Gree structure a kilometer below ground. The Je'daii Ranger Lanoree Brock was thus sent to arbitrate between the three parties while covertly ensuring that the ancient site was protected. This she achieved through Force illusions of rockfalls and ravines blocking the cave network to the ancient ruins, illusions she intended would persist for at least a century. With due success, she successfully helped the three factions negotiate a peaceful division of the island between them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
