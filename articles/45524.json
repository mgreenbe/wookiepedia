Around 31 BBY, Carolinden and the League were aboard a shuttle traveling close to the planet Cularin when they were attacked by a rival group of criminals and crashed in the grounds of the Blue Star Centre, a philosophical research facility. Carolinden and the Intarsa League entered the facility and took its inhabitants hostage in an attempt to gain passage off of Cularin.
