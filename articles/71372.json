When Steen encountered a Nebulon-B frigate en route from the Nopces system to join a convoy at the Brentaal system, he cooperated fully with the instructions given to him by this apparently legitimate Imperial Navy vessel. In fact, the frigate was the Alliance Privateer vessel Far Orbit, and Steen's misplaced trust resulted in the loss of his cargo of power cells and power system components worth approximately 35 million credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
