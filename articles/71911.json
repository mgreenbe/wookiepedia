Sometime between 3645 BBY and 3640 BBY, Jorsooda had purchased three pet vorantiki and bet that they could kill Karagga's prized rancor, Bonethrasher. The starved and crazed animals were injected with adrenals and released into the pit of Karagga's Palace on the planet Nal Hutta\u2014only to be slain by Bonethrasher within one minute.
