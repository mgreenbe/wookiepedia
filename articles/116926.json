A few months after the start of the conflict, he commanded a fleet in orbit around Iridonia from his flagship, the Hammerhead-class cruiser Champion of Iridonia. During a battle against Sith forces above Iridonia, Sith commandos led by Acaadi infiltrated the Champion. Slightly wounded during the battle, Rokon tracked the interlopers from the ship's bridge and enlisted the help of a group of Jedi who had been on the planet below. The admiral asked them to head to a section of the ship and deal with the Sith, but Acaadi sabotaged the ship's systems thus causing an electrical explosion at the bridge consoles. The explosion killed most of the bridge crew and incapacitated Rokon, leaving the defense of the Champion in the hands of the Republic agents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rokon was a minor ally character included in Iridonian Darkness, a Wizards of the Coast adventure written by Sterling Hershey for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game, which was made available for free online from Wizards.com in October 2008.
