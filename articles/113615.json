Rumored to have previously been a pirate, he was sponsored by anonymous members of the Hutt Cartel closely linked to Kaltho the Hutt to take part in the Cloud City Grand Prix, a cloud car racing event held around Cloud City on the planet Bespin. Carrae, who was considered the most dangerous pilot taking part in the race, made the news several times in the weeks leading up to the event by being thrown out of high-profile casinos and engagements around Cloud City for his behavior. While in Cloud City his cloud car was kept in a private berth which was constantly observed by electronic surveillance equipment to prevent sabotage. Flying with his Xexto co-pilot Garulo, Carrae attempted to fly as fast as possible for as long as possible during the race, although ultimately he lost to a team of spacers hired by the Pantoran criminal Arend Shen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Carrae was renowned for his violent behavior, although some suspected this was partially due to his extensive facial tattooing and various unnatural augmentation.
