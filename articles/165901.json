When the family was part of the Ruling Families, it had the right to possess a small fleet of genuine warships, as all other Ruling Families did. After the Xodlak family was demoted to the Great Families, they lost their right to the majority of the fleet, and only possessed a handful of Xodlak patrol ships that served as gunboats and two Xodlak cruisers, including the Apogee, that served as defense platforms. Additionally, the fleet contained the frigate named Midsummer. Task Force Xodlak was dispatched to the planet \"Sunrise\" and consisted of the Midsummer and the Apogee."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
