Such offworld communities notably existed on Naboo and Sullust. Generations before the Galactic Civil War, a number of Alderaanians also established their presence on the planet of Espirion, which was known for being open to refugees and wanderers. There, they intermarried with the natives, a species of red-skinned humanoids with tapered ears. As a result, a population of half-Alderaanians, exhibiting non-human characteristics, arose on Espirion. In the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Yavin, their community was led by Chief Beon Beonel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Alderaan was destroyed by the Galactic Empire to test the capabilities of their new Death Star battle station, most Alderaanians perished along with their home planet.
