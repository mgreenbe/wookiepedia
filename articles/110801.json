As an Overseer at the Sith Academy of Korriban, Ragate was tasked with instructing multiple acolytes in the ways of the dark side of the Force. By the time of the Galactic War, Overseer Ragate had become an old, frail-looking woman. As the administrator of the rite of blood and bone, she supervised the test of many acolytes. During her tenure as administrator of the rite, Ragate supervised the tests of a promising Sith warrior and of the soon-to-be Lord Kallig. In 3637 BBY, the Republic devised a plan to retrieve a set of data from the chambers of the Empire's Dark Council, which were located in the Sith Academy. When a group of four Republic heroes broke into the Academy, Ragate and her fellow overseers tried to block access to the turbolift leading to the Dark Council chambers. However, the old overseer proved unable to stop the enemy strike team, and she died defending the Sith Academy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Galactic War, Overseer Ragate was a gray-haired, elderly woman with red eyes who described herself as a guardian of ancient traditions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ragate was skilled in precognition, as she could see glimpses of the future.
