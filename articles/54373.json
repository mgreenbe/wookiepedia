Flog survived in the gladiator arena for two years. He wielded a huge flail consisting of a craggy hunk of rock on a chain. His origins remained unknown, and he had little command over any language. Rumors abounded that Flog was the result of an occult summoning by a demon, or a crude amalgamation of the parts of dead gladiators."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Asajj Ventress entered The Cauldron to challenge the Rattatakan gladiators, Flog attempted to defeat her.

Ventress's skill far surpassed Flog's clumsy attacks, and she felled the creature with her twin lightsabers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Flog's species' name has not been given in any official source."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
