Chris breaks the fourth wall by saying, \"But didn't Robot Chicken do this a few months ago?\" His father, Peter, then starts saying how bad Robot Chicken is and that no one knows about the show. Angered by this, Chris runs from the room, although not before angrily calling out Peter as being \"a really big jerk\". The sequel specials Something, Something, Something, Dark Side and to a lesser extent Family Guy: It's A Trap! featured similar references to Robot Chicken, the former where Peter tries to dare Robot Chicken to \"top\" his story only for Chris to state it already did and was determined not to let Peter get to him, but ultimately stormed out of the room when Peter off-handedly mentioned that Chris could tell Without a Paddle (an allusion to Seth Green's role in the failed film of the same name)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
