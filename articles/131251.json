During production of The Star Wars Holiday Special in 1978, director David Acomba showed Lucas a recent film made by Clive A. Smith's animation company Nelvana. This convinced Lucas to hire the company to produce the animated segment for that film. Lucas was pleased with their work, and in 1984, he again hired them to work on the two animated series he was developing, Droids and Ewoks. These two subjects were chosen because they would appeal to young audiences and because, as the future of the film franchise was uncertain, they would be the least likely characters to conflict with the stories of the feature films. With these two shows, Lucas (who served as executive producer) hoped to raise the standards for Saturday morning animation; he wanted the animation and voice acting to be better than the average shows of the time. Anthony Daniels felt the same: \"I didn't want to do it. I had to be convinced that it was going to be better. I'm no mug\u2014I wouldn't support something just because Lucasfilm was doing it.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pre-production began in May of 1984. During this time Lucas met with the series' producers, directors and writers, who collaborated on story ideas. The stories were inspired by the science-fiction stories of Jean Giraud\u2014specifically The Airtight Garage. The production team tried to convince Lucas to bring other main characters from the original trilogy, but he insisted it be focused on the droids. Lucas laid out his basic ideas for the series, but wasn't involved with day-to-day matters. As the episodes were being worked on, rough cuts were screened for him. After reading the scripts, Daniels would sometimes rewrite lines of dialogue if he felt they didn't fit his character. The series was under strict broadcast standards, and there were limitations\u2014set by ABC's Standards and Practices Board\u2014as to what could be shown or dealt with in the episodes. Writer Paul Dini commented on this in a 2004 interview: \"...we were dealing with a regime at the network that just wanted safe children's programming. Every time we wanted to stretch it a little bit, they would kick up a fuss over it.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The show's animators tended to specialize in either characters, locales or machinery. The Korean company Hanho Heung-Up struggled with the show's designs, which often encompassed up to 24,000 cels per episode. As a result, Clive Smith moved to Korea for eight months in order to assist the company. Smith estimated that each hour-long pair of Droids and Ewoks episodes cost approximately $500,000 to $600,000 to produce, making them amongst the more expensive animated series for that time. The opening theme\u2014\"In Trouble Again\"\u2014was performed by Stewart Copeland of the band The Police and written by Copeland and Derek Holt, and the show's new-wave score was created by Patricia Cullen, David Greene and David Shaw."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Release"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Droids debuted on September 7, 1985 as part of the Ewoks and Droids Adventure Hour. ABC aired a preview special a few days prior entitled The ABC Saturday Sneak Peek and Fun Fit Test w/ Tony Danza, C-3PO and R2-D2. (In the special, Olympic gymnast Mary Lou Retton teaches gymnastics to Danza and the droids.) After airing a full season of 13 episodes, Droids was cancelled, due in part to to its high production costs (which were a result the high level of design required relative to other Saturday morning animation of the time). However, a new one-hour special later aired in 1986, and the first season was rebroadcast alongside the second season of Ewoks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the mid 1990s, beginning in 1994, the US Sci-Fi Channel ran episodes of the series, along with those of its counterpart, Star Wars: Ewoks, on its \"Cartoon Quest\" and \"Animation Station\" blocks of programming."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Merchandising"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1985, Kenner produced a toy line based on the series, including action figures, ship models, and other items. Random House also published a series of children's books based on various episodes of the series. An LP record and a cassette featuring music from the show were released in France. In 1986, Marvel Comics' Star Comics imprint published a Droids comic book, which was based on the cartoon series. The comic also had the name Star Wars: Droids. The comic series takes place between 10-6 BBY, unlike the TV series which was placed around 15 BBY. The bimonthly series ran for a year, ending with issue #8. Significant issues include #4, which crossed over with the Ewoks comics series, and # 6-8, whose story was titled \"Star Wars According to the Droids\", retelling Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope with new scenes told from the perspective of the droids. It is of note that the series was drawn by comic legend John Romita. Dark Horse Comics also ran a couple of Droids mini-series in 1994 and 1995. A Droids computer game was released in 1988 for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC home computers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the series finished production, Nelvana sent the majority of pre-production materials to Lucasfilm, who later partnered with the former company Royal Animated Art to sell these materials to private owners.

In 2007, Gentle Giant released an animated maquette of Boba Fett based on Fett's appearance in the series. It was a Celebration exclusive; out of the 1000 produced, 700 were sold at Celebration IV, while the remianing 300 were sold at Celebration Europe.

Definitely. At some point after we're finished with Episode III, we'd really like to make all of that material available to our fans on DVD. Unfortunately, we won't be even thinking of making any firm plans until we're finished with this trilogy.\" He also expressed this privately to Paul Ens. According to Pablo Hidalgo, a full series release was considered as an alternative to the Animated Adventures DVDs: \"I don't know what numbers are run in the mysterious background that decides to say 'You know what? That doesn't look like a product that we can move.'\" At 2005's Celebration III, McCallum and Lucasfilm's Vice President of marketing Jim Ward dodged questions about a complete DVD release of the series."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the Celebration VI \"StarWars.com and Beyond\" panel, it was mentioned that both Droids and Ewoks may be streamed on StarWars.com in the future.

Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide explains this continuity issue, mentioning that the droids were \"accidentally separated\" from Antilles \"before returning to Captain Antilles' ship, the Tantive IV.\" This explanation was further detailed when Corla Metonae's backstory was developed by Billy Buehler (AKA The2ndQuest) for Hyperspace's What's The Story? feature, according to which, she was the person responsible for this separation. The circumstances behind the separation were further elaborated on in the StarWars.com blog series The Droids Re-Animated, which specifically cited an unexpected raid on the Tantive IV by the pirate group Lok Revenants that forced them to abandon the escape pods they had jettisoned during a routine test, which R2-D2 and C-3PO had been inside at the time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Star Wars prequel trilogy contains many elements which appear to reference and/or resemble elements from Droids.
