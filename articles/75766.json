Unbeknownst to them, the Sith apprentice Darth Maul was lurking in the shadows, watching them. As they traversed through the crowds of alien species, Qiyn noted to her Padawan that she felt someone's presence watching them, to which he replied that he could sense it too, and that he felt cold. Qiyn then went on to warn Jace of how shadows hold great rage, so much so that it could metaphorically swallow you whole. Jumping to conclusions, Jace suggested that their senses could be betraying them, as he was unable to see anything. Keeping cool and collected, Khaat Qiyn told him to remain steady, and to always trust in the Force, while cautioning that such distractions could cause his undoing."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Battle of Geonosis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 22 BBY, tensions between the Galactic Republic and a rising faction known as the Confederacy of Independent Systems were growing at an alarming rate.

Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi subsequently followed the Fett to the barren world of Geonosis, discovering that the Separatists had been developing their own droid army, and contacted the Jedi Temple about his findings. Moments after sending a hologram, the Jedi was discovered and captured. Mace Windu then made the decision to assemble a Jedi assault team, made up of over two-hundred Jedi to crush the droid army the Separatists had been creating and to rescue Kenobi as well as Anakin Skywalker and Amidala, who had followed Kenobi to the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Khaat Qiyn, as well as Jace, were two of the many Jedi sent out to Geonosis, as part of the Jedi assault team.

After Windu revealed himself to Count Dooku, the leader of the Separatists, they deployed their newfound droid army, and so the Jedi revealed themselves. With thousands of droids in front of them, Khaat ignited her blue-bladed lightsaber, and alongside her fellow Jedi, she engaged the droid army and began cutting her droid adversaries down one by one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the battle raged on the droid forces began to overwhelm the Jedi with a large quantity of their numbers being shot down.
