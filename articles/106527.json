After the Battle of Yavin, Handerin got into serious trouble because of wild creatures and bandits that plagued the farm. Around 1 ABY, CorSec Lieutenant Mack Jasper dispatched a recruit to help the farmer. The CorSec agent first eliminated a pack of enraged carrion spats, including the pack leader Gravefeather, that did a lot of damage to the farm. The CorSec agent then successfully dealt with a group of criminals, the Nedgarr Bandits, who damaged crops and stole grain in the farm. The CorSec agent recovered the stolen grain and eliminated several bandits, including their leader Trae Nedgarr. Pol Handerin was thankful for the help he received and that solved all the problems in his farm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pol Handerin's farm appeared as a location in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pol Handerin's farm was added to the game with the expansion Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan, released on November 1, 2005.
