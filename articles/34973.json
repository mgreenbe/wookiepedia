It was released on April 28, 2015. The title takes a humorous look at friendships within the Star Wars franchise. The move away from the focus of parenting made the book a struggle for author/artist Jeffrey Brown to complete, but he describes himself as happy with how it turns out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Publisher's summary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In this funny and sweet new book in the bestselling Darth Vader\u2122 series, Eisner Award\u2013winning author Jeffrey Brown offers an intimate look at the friendships between best pals in the Star Wars universe, from Darth Vader and the Emperor to Leia and her Ewok pals, Han and Chewie, C-3PO and R2-D2, the bounty hunters, and other favorite characters. Jealousy, birthday parties, lightsaber battles, sharing, intergalactic rebellion and more all come into play as Brown's charming illustrations and humor irresistibly combine the adventures of our friends in a galaxy far, far away with everyday events closer to home."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This non-canon look at the Star Wars films focuses on the idea of friendship. Many of the scenes are scenes from the original trilogy, but the child forms of characters like Luke Skywalker and Han Solo inserted into familiar scenes. In one such scene, the child Luke Skywalker uses a mind trick on a stormtrooper to convince him that C-3PO and R2-D2 \"aren't the droids he's looking for,\" then complains about him repeating everything he says. In another Cornelius Evazan tells little Luke that he and Ponda Baba don't like him, causing him to cry. \"Uh, we were just kidding... don't cry, kid...\" When Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader duel, Kenobi comments \"Remember when we were, like, best friends?
