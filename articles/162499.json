In 2 BBY, Wadda went with Zlarb and several others on a run to the planet Lur, where they attempted to strong arm a pair of unsuspecting pilots, Han Solo and Chewbacca, into carrying a number of Lurrian captives. Morally opposed to slavery, Solo and Chewbacca fought back, killing Zlarb and several others. Although a confrontation with the Wookiee Chewbacca left Wadda battered and bruised, he survived for Solo and Chewbacca to leave him at the mercy of Lurrians they had attempted to sell into slavery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wadda first appeared in Han Solo's Revenge, a novel written by Brian Daley and released in 1979.
