She was pursued by a dozen TIE Fighters and suffered minor damages. The TIE Interceptor they were pursuing, which Donos learned was part of the 181st Imperial Fighter Group, suddenly returned just as they were about to retreat. Her starfighter's engines were badly damaged by the Interceptor's laser strikes and was ordered to eject by Donos. The canopy of her fighter refused to give way and she found herself slammed into it by her ejection seat. When the canopy finally gave way, she was unconscious and soon killed when she was ejected into a rift wall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
