The reference book, written by Daniel Wallace and published in 2010, was intended to represent a single in-universe manual passed from master to apprentice, with each Jedi notating the book while it was in their possession. A comment scrawled by Thame Cerulian in the margins of a passage about the Matukai organization provides the information about the adept.
