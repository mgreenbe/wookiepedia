The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. Due to the nature of many older quests in Star Wars Galaxies, the species and appearance of Pytor Tuko changed each time a player performed this quest. Therefore, it is impossible to verify the canonical species of Tuko. However, the quest dialogue given by Muse indicated that Pytor Tuko was a male.
