She embarks upon a bold maneuver with which to conceal the fleet's location from the prying eyes of Imperial scouts. Using a device known as a Kerts-Bhrg generator, the Rebels construct a large, pyramid-shaped force field that envelops the entire fleet. They move the ships within the corona of Arbra's sun, secure in the notion that the field generator will protect them from the deadly ultraviolet rays."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Princess Leia boards a shuttle craft to return to the planet's surface. Moments later, she discovers that the Kerts-Bhrg generators have malfunctioned. An absorption circuit within the cone of the control generator overloads flooding the maintenance bay with noxious fumes. All of the service personnel pass out from the chemicals. The only ones unaffected are the droids, C-3PO and R2-D2. In order to save the fleet, the droids space-walk between the control generator and one of the star cruisers. They run a conduit cable into the Kerts-Bhrg generator and stabilize the fluctuating power levels. After the near-disaster, C-3PO contacts Princess Leia and provides an update on the crisis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the Millennium Falcon emerges from lightspeed and arrives at the space station known as Bazarre."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "First appearances of Rebel Alliance personnel: Falltower, Hilly, Mesa, and Shahn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The subplot involving Luke and Lando's mission to Bazarre continues in issue #59."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arbra's sun, Arbran, is not specified by name in this issue.
