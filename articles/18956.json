In exchange for food and resources for his people, Onaconda captures Padm\u00e9 and promises to deliver her to Nute Gunray. Sensing Padm\u00e9 is in trouble, Jar Jar Binks disguises himself as a Jedi, and with the help of C-3PO, courageously fights to rescue his friend and fellow senator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Padm\u00e9 Amidala travels to Rodia in an attempt to persuade Senator Onaconda Farr, whom she fondly addresses as Uncle Ono since a time when he had helped out her father, to keep his allegiance to the Galactic Republic. She brings along C-3PO and Jar Jar Binks, despite Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's advice to rather take along a bodyguard force. But upon arrival, she learns that Onaconda has already pledged allegiance to the Separatists and Viceroy Nute Gunray is delivering supplies as the Republic could not. Already, there are battle droids in his city. The droids shackle Padm\u00e9's arms to the wall, as Gunray ordered as a precaution before he personally comes for her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jar Jar and Threepio get into even more trouble when droids come to arrest them. Though Jar Jar's bumbling with the magnetic crane destroys the droids, he also destroys their ship, ruining their chance to contact help. He puts on a Jedi robe Padm\u00e9 had stored in the back closet (most likely belonging to Anakin Skywalker), but droids spot them and everyone presumes he's a Jedi. Jar Jar manages to escape to the water down below, where he promptly has to run from a marine monster, while Threepio is taken off to be scrapped. Word of a Jedi around gives Padm\u00e9 an idea: while she bluffs the droids into thinking the Jedi has rescued her already, she slips out of her shackles using a key from her boot, roundhouse kicks the droid, steals its blaster and escapes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Padm\u00e9 rescues Threepio but is dismayed to learn that Jar Jar is the presumed Jedi.

He again dives into the water as droids throw down thermal detonators and fire a rocket at him.

In the ensuring chaos, Gunray tries to get away, but his shuttle is pushed into the swamp by the monster and Padm\u00e9 holds him at gunpoint. Onaconda appears behind Padm\u00e9, his own blaster at the ready, and Gunray orders the Rodian to shoot \"the Jedi\" and then her. However, upon seeing Onaconda's expression, Padm\u00e9 tells Gunray about their \"little secret,\" that Onaconda planned to trap Gunray all along.
