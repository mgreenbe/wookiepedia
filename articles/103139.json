The surviving Jedi Knights remained on Pamorjal and constructed the Temples of Vormijj, in which they put a map to the Soulsaber's hiding place."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pamorjal had no other significant contact with the wider galaxy until about twenty years before the Galactic Civil War and it became under the control of the Galactic Empire. It was ruled by Imperial Governor Taj Vellion, although he left most of the day to day running to the Pamorjal planetary ruling council. The wood from Garna trees, a species indigenous to Pamorjal, became popular in the Core Worlds, so mega-corporations such as TaggeCo began harvesting the trees. An underground movement called the Pamorjal Freeman's League, or PFL, which opposed the mega-corporations and began attacking their assets on the planet, to try and force them out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, the Dark Jedi Thaum Rystra came to Pamorjal to discover the location of the Soulsaber.
