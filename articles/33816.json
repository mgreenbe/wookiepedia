The attack did far more than merely reducing the small Rebel fortress to wreckage, leaving Dankayo's surface thoroughly cratered, blasting dark clouds of dust into the sky, and even stripping away the atmosphere. Agent ZNT-8 later emerged to discover that the Rebel self-destruct charges had failed to detonate fully, and that key areas of the base remained intact."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial stormtrooper search-teams from the Imperial Armored Transport Elusive recovered several datapacks from the planet, containing the locations of safe worlds and the identities of contacts and undercover agents within the area served by Dankayo.

However, the Star Destroyers' instructions to \"reduce the tiny base to molten slag\" indicates that they received a formal order for a high-intensity bombardment, comparable to the parameters of a Base Delta Zero, and in the aftermath, the planetary surface is described as \"evenly cratered,\" there is a reference to the \"dense clouds of atomized topsoil\" being formed, and \"the last of the atmosphere\" is described as drifting away, implying that the assault had planet-wide effects. The description is confusing, though, since stormtroopers are later described scouring the wreckage of the Rebel base on the surface, although their ability to operate here can perhaps be explained by their armor's limited vacuum capability."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
