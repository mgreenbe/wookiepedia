Its members, composed of a secret cabal of plutocrats, supported Senator Palpatine and were rewarded by being made controlling members of the newly-formed Corporate Sector Authority when he became Emperor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sourcebook that detailed the league stated that it supported Palpatine's bid for \"Presidency;\" petitioned him to limit government economic controls; and were made \"founding\" members of the CSA. All of these seem to be in conflict with later information from the Prequel era; Palpatine's election to Supreme Chancellor was too sudden to include outside campaigning; it has been stated that the Galactic Empire nationalized major industries (and the type of laissez-faire policy the League seems to have supported would likely have seen them join the Separatists). Additionally, sources refer to the CSA as early as 26-27 BBY, at least eight years before it was formed from the GCPL."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
