The house of the farm was a building made of wood and stone, with a quaint-peaked roof. The farm was also comprised of several fields of cultivated flowers which varied in color, size and shape. They had a heady fragrance and were used to manufacture blossom wine. In 32 BBY, during the Trade Federation's blockade of Naboo, Sith Lord Darth Maul was sent to the farm by his Master, Darth Sidious. It is there that Maul met and eventually killed Maris Magneta, the head of security of the late King Veruna."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
