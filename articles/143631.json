It included an account of the band's time playing on Tatooine, for both the crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure and at Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina. It was initially published prior to Jabba's assassination, and due to this the publishers asked G'ont for permission to change a passage in which she promised to get Jabba a drink of slime in the present tense. She did not give them permission, so a publisher's note was inserted explaining the context for the benefit of any confused readers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The memoir first appeared as the framing device of the short story \"Not for Nothing\" in the anthology From a Certain Point of View, written by Mur Lafferty.
