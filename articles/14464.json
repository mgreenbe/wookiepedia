In 3963 BBY, the Mandalorians launched a Coreward assault from Mandalorian space into the Galactic Republic. After taking the planet Serroco, the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders proceeded along their invasion corridor to Nouane and conquered the world; as a result, representatives of the beleaguered planet turned to the Republic for assistance. After taking Nouane, the Mandalorians proceeded to a victory at Dagary Minor before their advance was haulted following a battle on the planet of Omonoth. Eventually the Mandalorians were driven off the planet of Nouane, and the government joined the Republic as a semi-autonomous Allied Region."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the keynote address at the four-hundred-twelfth Proceedings of Galactic Anthropology and History, in 24 ABY, Vilnau Teupt spoke of the Mandalorian race's development, mentioning the capture of Nouane while talking through the Mandalorian Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle was mentioned in The Essential Atlas, a book written by Jason Fry and Daniel Wallace that was released in 2009.
