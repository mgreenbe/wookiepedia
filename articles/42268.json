However, she had a programming defect that caused her to exhibit cruelty toward other droids, a flaw many of her fellow EV units shared. She was acquired by the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, who made her chief of cyborg operations at his Tatooine palace. She was well suited for the position after being reprogrammed in a Mos Eisley spaceport scrapyard, by which point she was already known for her sadistic behavior toward other droids. Before leaving the spaceport, EV-9D9 took advantage of Tatooine's lax moral codes to have an extra photoreceptor installed that allowed her to \"see\" droid pain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having charged EV-9D9 with managing all of the droids that kept his cartel running, Jabba partnered her with 8D8, an equally ruthless 8D-series smelter droid reprogrammed for torture, to bring out the worst in both droids. With the assistance of her devotee, she converted a dank boiler room in the murky depths of the palace's dungeons into a droid \"assessment\" room. This was in actuality a grim torture chamber where 8D8 assisted her in terrorizing Jabba's droid pool into submission. During her time at Jabba's Palace, MerenData issued a mass recall of the EV-series. EV-9D9 was one of the few to escape recall and continued working in the dungeons for many years."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The fall of a criminal empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 0 BBY, 261, a rogue Imperial astromech droid, was captured and brought to Jabba's Palace, where he was forced to join Jabba's droid pool. However, the droid was able to escape, making EV-9D9 furious. When the bounty hunter Bossk tracked 261 to the palace after having been hired to retrieve the droid by the Empire, he questioned the supervisor droid as to the astromech's whereabouts. EV-9D9 explained to the Trandoshan that 261 had escaped, claiming that he would soon learn some respect. Bossk later recovered the droid from a clan of Jawas, meter-tall humanoids native to Tatooine that scavenged the deserts for discarded scrap and wayward droids, and brought him back to the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker gifted Jabba the astromech R2-D2 and protocol droid C-3PO in 4 ABY, shortly before the Battle of Endor, they were escorted down to EV-9D9's torture chamber so she could assign them positions in her master's droid pool. C-3PO was made Jabba's new interpreter\u2014as his last one was disintegrated after it had angered him\u2014and was fitted with a restraining bolt before being returned to the palace's main audience chamber.

When the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin visited the cantina looking for work, he approached the droid, who was cleaning the counter. When Djarin asked the droid if any jobs were available, she informed him that the Bounty Hunters' Guild no longer worked from Tatooine. The Mandalorian clarified that he operated separately from the Guild, but EV-9D9 stated that it did not help his situation as no work was currently available. However, their conversation was interrupted when another bounty hunter known as Toro Calican disputed the droid's claim and invited Djarin over to his booth to discuss a job; the Mandalorian accepted his offer while EV-9D9 returned to wiping down the counter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Djarin later revisited Chalmun's to speak with Peli Motto, the proprietor of Mos Eisley's Hangar 3-5, EV-9D9 was working the establishment's bar, attempting to serve a distracted patron their drink."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, an artist visited Jabba's Palace and wrote about EV-9D9 in his journal, though he did not reference her by name.

She was also mentioned in the \"droidography,\" a volume on droids compiled by the B1 battle droid R0-GR during his time serving in the Resistance, in which he condemned her attitude toward her fellow droids. EV-9D9 would also go on to be mentioned in the Hazards of Technology section of the How Not to Get Eaten by Ewoks and Other Galactic Survival Skills survival guide. The book's author characterized her as a rogue droid whose actions had helped fuel anti-droid sentiment after the Clone Wars, fought between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, the latter's use of a droid army having caused such feelings to become common throughout the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Personality"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally peaceful and hardworking, EV-9D9 was corrupted by a programming flaw that was intentionally exasperated by reprogramming depriving her of all empathy toward other droids. A malicious, sadistic, and psychotic mechanic murderer, she enjoyed tormenting and dismembering other droids, reveling in working them until they fell apart or their processors blew and employing bizarre forms of droid torture to increase motivation. EV-9D9 relished her role as the taskmaster of all the palace's droids and loved disintegrating her subordinates. She would also hang droids upside down as a form of punishment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "EV-9D9 ordered the torture of any droid that disobeyed her commands and, more often than not, even those that obeyed her. She was quickly annoyed with the antics of C-3PO, cutting him off whenever she got the answers she wanted or when he started to stray from the question at hand. The droid supervisor also demeaned her fellow droids by assigning them tasks far beneath their programming. For example, when R2-D2 acted feistily toward her, the supervisor droid assigned him to serve drinks aboard her master's sail barge to teach him respect. However, the astromech had been threatened with and experienced far worse than EV-9D9 in his long lifetime."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While working at Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina after the fall of the Empire, EV-9D9 was one of several EV-series droids that doled out carefully calculated commentary and precisely measured beverages to patrons of the establishment."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Physical traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An EV-series supervisor droid with feminine programming, EV-9D9 was missing various parts, lending her a skeletal appearance. Her key areas were protected with low-quality plastron plating that was bronze in color and cheap to replace when damaged. EV-9D9 sported four gray rectangular markings on the right side of her chest plating, though these were absent by around 9 ABY. Just below her chest plating was a recharge coupling and access port. Her pelvic mount could be locked into legs or motorized carts. When equipped with a pair of legs, EV-9D9 stood 1.9 meters in height."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though spindly in appearance, EV-9D9's durasteel hydraulic piston limbs were deceptively strong, if cheaply made. As EV units were not expected to do anything more than press switches and computer keys, they were given only the most basic three-fingered servogrip pincers. She was also equipped with three white photoreceptors. Tiny and basic, they allowed her to see well enough to perform her duties and not much more. The third was custom-fitted and, along with some additional coding, was sensitive to the electronic and electromagnetic output of droids, allowing EV-9D9 to \"see\" the suffering she inflicted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As an EV-series supervisor droid, EV-9D9 was equipped with an EV-series droid brain. However, the logic circuits used in the droid brain's construction were faulty and showed signs of critical degradation across several EV units, including EV-9D9, to the point where it overrode their behavioral programming to instead favor cold logic and cruelty. Speaking in harsh and buzzing tones, she had a synthesized female voice that sounded as if it had been stolen from an elderly prison matron. Her expressiveness was \"enhanced\" by a speech mimic flap, a hinged vocoder that simulated the movement of a mouth by flapping up and down beneath her sharp metal chin. Though designed to make EV units more relatable to potential owners, the effort was wasted because the flapping rarely matched their speech. She was also equipped with a broadband antenna receiver and built-in comlink that allowed her to wirelessly link to local computer systems and monitor all droid activity to ensure that the labor pool was operating at peak efficiency."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Conception and portrayal"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally created for the original trilogy film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, released May 25, 1983, EV-9D9 first appeared in a Star Wars Legends novelization of the film written by James Kahn and published on May 12, 1983, thirteen days before the film was released in theaters on May 25. The character was identified as EV-9D9 in the novel, a name that originated in the third draft of Return of the Jedi but was not used in the final film.

In the third draft, she received her final name and her smelter droid assistant inherited the name 8D8."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "EV-9D9 was portrayed using a marionette, which was based on Ralph McQuarrie sketches of a tall, thin robot that was considered an \"assassin droid\" at that stage of pre-production. This design resulted from McQuarrie's revisions to concept sketches for a droid bounty hunter that had earlier been used for IG-88 in the 1980 film Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. Though it did not appear in any version of the film's screenplay, the assassin robot was explored by McQuarrie in several forms, including a version with an oversized cutting wheel. An unused assassin droid sketch would later become the basis for the transport ticketing droid featured in the 2018 animated series Star Wars Resistance. EV-9D9's marionette began with a sculpted head and chest piece, with its limbs and neck having been built by Supervising Prop Maker Bill Hargreaves. Everything on the marionette moved so that it could be animated for the torture chamber scene, which Hargreaves was involved in the shooting of. She was voiced on set by Return of the Jedi director Richard Marquand, whose voice was later redubbed during post-production. At one point in the film's production, she was to be able to walk, though it was later decided that she would sit after the special effects department failed to make it work by George Lucas' deadline."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An interactive gallery of EV-9D9's marionette was included on Bonus Disc 2 of Star Wars: The Complete Saga, a Blu-ray set that comprised the first six main Star Wars films along with three additional discs of bonus material that was released on September 12, 2011.
