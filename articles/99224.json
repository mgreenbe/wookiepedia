It contains every common attribute of its predecessors but with the modifications made by Jedi Master Saesee Tiin, now includes a fight mode feature which enables the ship's pilot to, in any emergency, eject the outer hull of the fighter's nose which exposes a vast array of deadly armament."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This includes multiple laser cannons, two proton torpedo launchers, and supplemented with unfolded S-foils. With these upgrades, the pilot of said ship could devastate its target with the multiple projectile launchers in a matter of moments, making this one of the Jedi Order's most deadly starfighters at the time. Obi-Wan Kenobi regards this ship as being \"full of surprises\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obi-Wan Kenobi most notably used this starfighter while on a mission to the Albecus system. During his journey he was pursued by the bounty hunter Jango Fett in Slave I. Fett's deadly maneuvers forced Obi-Wan to engage the ship in Fight Mode  and with the overwhelming firepower, forced Fett into full retreat. He was able to safely carry out the rest of his mission afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
