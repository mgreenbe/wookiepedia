A trade dispute soon developed between the megacorperation, the Trade Federation and the Republic, resulting in the blockade of Naboo, and the Invasion of Naboo shortly thereafter. While Theed, the capital city of Naboo was occupied, several students from Naboo's Royal House of Learning joined the Naboo Underground, but were eventually captured by the Trade Federation occupying forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The students were held in Prison Compound 32, a Trade Federation prison camp that was built from portable energy walls within the city of Theed. The group was imprisoned with Ruto Graven, who was Assistant Minister of Internal Affairs for Queen Amidala; Private Boraso, an RSF Security Guard; and the artist Ela Sivel. Boraso, who had been wounded in battle, had managed to hide a set of security tools in his belt when he was captured, but did not have the personal expertise to use the tools."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While talking with the other prisoners, one of the students, a Jedi Padawan, felt a distubance in the Force. The Padawan traced the feeling to a figure in black robes walking past the prison with a pair of high ranking Neimoidians. The robed figure briefly scrutinized the Padawan, before continuing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the students attempted to escape. Most of the students attempted to distract the pair of OOM security battle droids guarding the energy gate while another student set about disabling the gate's console. The students managed to disable the gate and grab their weapons and gear, stored in a crate just outside the prison entrance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After defeating the immediate guards, the students held off a squad of four B1-Series battle droids while their cellmates escaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This article is based on Adventure 3A: Escape, a pre-packaged adventure included in the Star Wars: Invasion of Theed Adventure Game, designed for streamlined play.
