The sigil was comprised of the Mandalorian runes for M and S, and short for the word mir'shupur\u2014\"brain injury,\" when translated from Mando'a to Basic. It served to notify others of the wearer's disability, while at the same time acting as a badge of honor recognizing the wounded individual's prior service. Mandalorians who saw the mir'shupur sigil on another's armor knew to treat the wearer gently, and to offer ready aid should they appear to be in need of it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 19 BBY, after being taken to Mandalore following a traumatic brain injury suffered on Gaftikar that left him temporarily brain dead, the former Republic commando Fi Skirata had his helmet adorned with the mir'shupur sigil by his girlfriend Parja Bralor. While waiting for Bralor one day in Enceri's marketplace, Skirata's sigil attracted the attention of former Mand'alor Spar, who stayed with the wounded soldier and kept him company until Bralor arrived. Shortly after, while ordering at an Enceri cantina, Skirata's mir'shupur sigil softened the demeanor of the elderly bartender waiting on him; while initially been suspicious of his inability to speak Mando'a as most other Enceri residents did, she quickly warmed to the injured veteran upon realizing his condition."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mir'shupur sigil was first introduced to the Star Wars universe in the Republic Commando novel Order 66, written by author Karen Traviss and published September 16, 2008."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
