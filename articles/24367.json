In 3 ABY, the Ewok Wicket Wystri Warrick returned to Bright Tree Village from a distant section of the forest, where he encountered a savage, red-furred Ewok. When Warrick told his friend Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka about the encounter, she believed that the wild Ewok was her long-lost sister, Asha, and asked Warrick where she could find her. Warrick stated that by glider, the journey consisted of half a day's flight east, a southern turn at the Caves of Thunder, and then a turn eastward. Failing to give exact directions, Warrick decided to accompany Kintaka."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Caves of Thunder were first mentioned in \"Asha,\" the thirteenth episode of the animated television series Ewoks.
