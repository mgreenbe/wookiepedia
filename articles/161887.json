At the time, he was working on a project titled \"Official History of the Rebel Movements, Volume One\" with Major Arhul Hextrophon. Na'al was in the briefing room at Base One when Jyn Erso was brought before Chancellor Mon Mothma and the rest of the Alliance High Command, and he summarized the proceedings of this meeting in a report to Hextrophon. This report was later included in a compilation of documents prepared by General Airen Cracken, Chief of Rebel Intelligence, for Mothma. Later, Na'al was also at the ceremony held in honor of Luke Skywalker and other heroes of the Battle of Yavin. He bore one of the Medals of Bravery, which General Jan Dodonna handed to Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, who awarded it to Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the New Republic, Na'al had become a bona fide historian.
