Suddenly, the droids deactivate, and Obi-Wan Kenobi tells Monn that the InterGalactic Banking Clan have surrendered, and the Galactic Republic is victorious. As Kenobi supervises the loading of Muun and Neimoidian prisoners-of-war onto Republic transports, Captain Fordo reports that a ship matching the one that Anakin Skywalker had pursued is approaching. Kenobi orders him to hold fire, and Skywalker exits the starfighter, apologizing for his disobedience and confirming the chase had been a Sith trap. As Kenobi upbraids his Padawan, he receives an urgent distress call from Jedi Master Daakman Barrek on Hypori. Barrek's forces have been wiped out by \"a new droid general.\" The signal cuts out abruptly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Hypori, Barrek's dead hand drops his holo-communicator, which is crushed by a robotic clawed foot. Thousands of B2 super battle droids encircle a crashed Republic Acclamator, firing their blasters at it until the clawed hand of the caped figure in front of them signals for them to stop. Inside the wreckage, Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi wonders why the attack has ceased. Five other Jedi, wounded and weary, surround him: Shaak Ti, K'Kruhk, Aayla Secura, Tarr Seirr, and Sha'a Gi. As the Jedi wonder how they could have been defeated by mere battle droids, a voice calls out to them: General Grievous."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sound of Grievous's approaching footsteps panics some of the Jedi, but Ki-Adi-Mundi urges them to remain calm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It's too much for Sha'a Gi, who charges into the open air where he is crushed to death as the metallic frame of General Grievous lands on top of him. Just as quickly, the general leaps out of sight, before dropping onto the remaining Jedi wielding two lightsabers. Spinning his torso around, Grievous easily holds off the four attacking Jedi, finally downing K'Kruhk. His clawed metal limbs get hold of Tarr Seirr and snap his neck, before hurling him and Aayla Secura across the chamber, followed by Ki-Adi-Mundi. Shaak Ti manages to hold off Grievous for some time, before she is hit by one of his spinning lightsabers and thrown into the wreckage. His own lightsaber held by Grievous's foot, Mundi uses the Force to pull one from Grievous's belt, which he ignites and raises into a guard.
