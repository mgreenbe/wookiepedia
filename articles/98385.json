The language was evidenced only in Dha Werda Verda, a poem recounting the conquest of Coruscant by a warrior race called the Taungs, which was translated at the Baobab Archives on Manda. Presumably it was the basis for the creation of Old Galactic Standard (along with the influences of Durese and Bothese) although to what extent and what was their exact relationship remain unknown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Notron Cant was created by Ben Burtt for the lyrics to \"Dha Werda Verda\" specifically for the Shadows of the Empire CD. Karen Traviss later incorporated the words \"Dha Werda Verda\" in her corpus of the Mando'a conlang, therefore constituting them Mando'a proper. It is possible therefore that this ancient knowledge is directly related to Mando'a, not only Basic. Fans have noted that the language is highly influenced by German; specifically, Old High German, which was spoken in what is now Germany, Austria, eastern France, and the Low Countries roughly 1,000 years ago."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
