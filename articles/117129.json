Ronnadam was the senior ISB officer onboard the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator and later the Executor-class Star Destroyer Executor. He wore a white-jacketed uniform."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ronnadam was an Imperial Security Bureau Captain during the Age of the Empire. During the secret mission to Tatooine prior to the Battle of Yavin, Ronnadam was stationed aboard the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator. He was in his office when Lieutenant Ciena Ree handed him data packets taken from Princess Leia Organa's captured CR90 corvette Tantive IV. Ronnadam, who was preoccupied with his monitor, took the packets without glancing back at her. Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin was present in the room via hologram and chastised Ronnadam for his lax protocols while complimenting Lieutenant Ree for her diligence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the TIE fighter pilot Thane Kyrell disappeared from his posting on the planet Kerev Doi, Captain Ronnadam questioned Thane's friend Nash Windrider about Thane's loyalties and political beliefs. Nash told Ronnadam that Thane was not a rebel but the ISB officer was dissatisfied. The now Lieutenant Commander Ciena, who was Thane's lover, visited Ronnadam to reassure the ISB officer that her friend was not a traitor and that he had expressed deep sorrow and anguish about the destruction of the Death Star. Ronnadam was unsympathetic to Ciena's explanation that Thane was reacting to despair and charged him with ensuring that Lieutenant Kyrell returned to active duty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Ciena suggested that Thane had returned to his homeworld of Jelucan, Ronnadam ordered Ciena to travel to the planet on the next transport. He told Ciena that the ISB was preoccupied with other matters and could not spare personnel to question Thane. He ordered Ciena to search for him and to investigate any reports of Thane's involvement with the Rebel Alliance. Ciena found Thane on Jelucan but was unable to convince her friend to return to Imperial service. Instead, she fabricated a report that Thane had committed suicide by throwing himself from a high cliff; being unable to cope with the death of his comrades aboard the Death Star. Ciena delivered the report to Captain Ronnadam. When Ciena explained the Jelucani custom of sky burials, Ronnadam derided it as a barbaric custom. Since Ronnadam was preoccupied with more pressing matters, he accepted her report and listed Thane as dead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ronnadam was later posted aboard the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor. Following the Escape from Cloud City, Ciena visited Ronnadam and sought permission from the ISB officer to visit her homeworld in order to support her mother Verine Ree, who was on trial for embezzlement. Ronnadam was unsympathetic to Ciena's plight and reminded the officer that the charges against her mother had been brought by the Imperial authorities. Ronnadam allowed Ciena to take leave after she explained that she wanted to investigate the matter for herself. Before leaving, he reminded her to report on the verdict of the case."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ciena traveled to Jelucan to support her parents during the trial. Due to the trumped up charges, Verine was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to six years of hard labor. Following the trial, Ciena reported to Captain Ronnadam. Despite being dissatisfied with the verdict, she reported that she was satisfied that justice had been delivered. Ronnadam expressed surprise that Ciena accepted the verdict. He remarked that she had used up two weeks' leave, but that her record was still unblemished and told Ciena that she could expect a promotion in the future. Ronnadam's prophecy was proven right, and Ciena was promoted to Captain shortly before the Battle of Jakku."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ronnadam was a human man with gray eyebrows, a thin mustache, and a receding hairline. He was a Captain in the Imperial Security Bureau. Ronnadam was brusque and quick tempered man who had a habit of interjecting and raising his voice when questioning Imperial personnel like Ciena Ree. Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin had a dim view of Ronnadam for his bad manners and lax attention to protocol. As an ISB officer, Ronnadam was concerned with rooting out any rebels and rebel sympathizers from the ranks of the Imperial Military. He regarded the Jelucani custom of sky burials as a barbaric custom. Since Ronnadam was preoccupied with other matters, he did not closely scrutinize Ciena's report that her friend Thane had committed suicide."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ronnadam was a staunch supporter of the Galactic Empire who intimidated Ciena into not questioning the Empire's actions and decisions. Ciena regarded him as a hypocrite for forcing her to lie that justice had been delivered in the case of her mother Verine, who was wrongly accused and convicted for embezzlement."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ronnadam appeared as a minor antagonist in Claudia Gray's 2015 young adult Lost Stars.
