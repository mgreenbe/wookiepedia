Eluos was one of the few Jedi who survived Order 66, an event that ended the Clone Wars and brought about the destruction of the Jedi Order, and was able to hide themself from the subsequent Great Jedi Purge enforced by Darth Vader and his Inquisitors. Shortly after the hunt for Eeth Koth, Darth Vader and The Grand Inquisitor met at a conference in the Inquisitorius Headquarters to review a holographic list of confirmed survivors that had hidden themselves well. Eluos was part of the list, as was Coleman Kcaj, Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Oppo Rancisis, and Ka-Moon Kholi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Selrahc Eluos was first mentioned in a holographic list written in Aurebesh that appeared in the 2018 comic book Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 19, written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Giuseppe Camuncoli. The name Selrahc Eluos is a tuckerization of Soule's full name, as it is the name's reversed spelling.
