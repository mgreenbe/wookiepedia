She wrote popular protest songs condemning the tyranny of the Empire. In response, the Empire blockaded the Drabatan homeworld of Pipada and deployed garrisons of swamptroopers to its surface and eventually Sa'Kalla was captured by the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Sa'Kalla's time in captivity, a movement organized in her name, and when it threatened to overwhelm the Imperial occupation, Sa'Kalla was brought to the Pipada Auditorium in front of half a million Drabatans. The Empire, believing that it had broken Sa'Kalla through torture, ordered her to convince her people to submit to Imperial rule. However, Sa'Kalla informed her people that they should continue to resist the Empire before she was immediately killed on stage. The stadium erupted with the Drabatans enraged and some managed to tear Imperials to shreds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after, the Drabatans adapted Sa'Kalla's name in a war cry as they charged into battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sa'Kalla's name was first mentioned as a battle cry in the 2016 anthology film, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, directed by Gareth Edwards.
