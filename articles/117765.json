During the War on Shu-Torun, in which Rubix and the other ore-barons rebelled against the Imperial-backed Queen Trios, Rubix sent his vessel the Lava Leviathan to kill Trios in the ancestral retreat of the Shu-Torun royalty, a site considered sacred and peaceful. The attack was unsuccessful and the leviathan destroyed, causing Trios to request that her Imperial allies destroy Rubix's citadel as punishment for his blasphemy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rubix' delving citadel was first mentioned in the comic book Darth Vader 17, which was written by Kieron Gillen and released in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
