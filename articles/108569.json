He named his new ship after a sea creature it resembled, and used it in his spice-smuggling operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One recurring port of call for the Pulsar Skate in these early days was the Gus Treta space station in the Corellian sector, where Terrik's friends Jagged and Zena Antilles operated the refueling depot. In 6 BBY, their fifteen-year-old son Wedge replaced the ship's starboard fusion engine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next year, the Pulsar Skate was once again at Gus Treta, when Loka Hask and his Bonestar Pirates destroyed the refuelling depot, killing Wedge's parents. Booster maneuvered the ship clear, while his co-pilot, Polipe, kept the boy restrained on the flight deck."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Booster was arrested, his daughter Mirax took over that part of his operations that were not seized by Jorj Car'das, and continued to use the Pulsar Skate in the same way. In 7 ABY, the ship came under attack by Imperial Interdictor cruiser Black Asp, but was rescued by Rogue Squadron. During this battle, Corran Horn was rescued by the ship, because his X-Wing had been damaged and was unable to fly properly. Mirax and her pilot, Liat Tsayv, agreed to use the Skate in smuggling operations for the New Republic, and it was vital in the effort to supply Coruscant with bacta when it was ravaged by the Krytos virus. The Pulsar Skate, using the alias Merisee Hope, was also vital in transporting Rogue Squadron pilots to the surface of Coruscant in an effort to take the planetary shields down. After leaving the ship in the hands of Black Sun, Mirax found Wedge and helped in the shield operation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mirax continued to use the Pulsar Skate after her marriage to Rogue Squadron pilot Corran Horn, establishing herself primarily as an interstellar art dealer. However, she continued to help out her husband and his friends, and in 25 ABY, the ship took Luke Skywalker, Anakin Solo, and Mara Jade to Vortex to search for Daeshara'cor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 40 ABY, the Pulsar Skate was involved in the evacuation the Horn family and Antilles family from Corellia when premier Dur Gejjen turned against Wedge during the Second Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There is something of a discrepancy about the appearance of the Pulsar Skate. The visual depictions of the ship in the Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron comics and CCG have been internally consistent, but these do not match the earlier illustration of the Baudo-class design in Galaxy Guide 6: Tramp Freighters and Pirates & Privateers, which seems to have served as the basis for some descriptions in novels, most recently in Legacy of the Force: Exile. No canonical explanation has been offered to resolve the discrepancy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
