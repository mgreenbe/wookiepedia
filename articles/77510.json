Despite pointing a blaster at Calrissian and claiming that almost nothing could make her want to work with Calrissian, Pers decided to join Calrissian once seeing the datapad with information about the job. Calrissian revealed that the job was stealing an Imperial pleasure craft full of potential rare and priceless antiquities. While Toren would receive the ship, the group could keep anything inside the starship. She then assisted Calrissian, Lobot, Aleksin, and Pavol in stealing the Imperialis.

Upon feeling the Imperialis thrum as the ship's automatic defense system destroy the gravity-based mines deployed by the Star Destroyers, Pers, Aleksin, and Pavol entered the cockpit where Calrissian and Lobot were present. Outside the viewport, Pers spotted a Star Destroyer and reprimanded Calrissian for risking their lives. Calrissian navigated the Imperialis away from the Star Destroyers. Once safely in deep space, Pers claimed the ship was full of treasures, including a Gungan fertility totem. While guiding the group through the ship, Pers suggested the Imperialis was a work of art, custom created by Raith Sienar, who supposedly kept his unique technology for preferred clients.

After a visit to the armory, Pers and Calrissian returned to help the twins but found that the twins had killed the Royal Guards. Pers proceeded to take the helmet of one of the dead guards, finding the corrupted face of the guard. Tossing the helmet aside, Pers continued into the central chamber to find the something that the guards were left to protect.

After identifying the artifacts as being created by the Sith sculptor, Darth Momin, Pers told Calrissian that the price of the artifacts could be worth enough credits for a moon or two to the correct buyer. However, the mask of Lord Momin corrupted Aleskin, who grabbed a red lightsaber and attacked Pavol. Calrissian and Pers escaped Aleskin and closed the central chamber. Reflecting on her past research into the Sith, Pers suggested that proximity to the Sith artifacts might have corrupted the Royal Guards and Aleksin.

Cha told the two that she would help them escape and proceeded to self-destruct the ship despite the pleas of Pers and Calrissian for assistance in stealing the artifacts. Once Calrissian brought up Lobot, Cha stopped inputting the self-destruct codes. Suddenly, Aleksin and Pavol appeared and provided Pers the opportunity to join their side.
