The loss of internal heating allowed the star to collapse onto itself to form a neutron star or a black hole. Supernova could happen naturally or be induced by a superweapon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many systems had been destroyed or rendered uninhabitable after their suns exploded. A supernova had also killed life in neighboring systems, and thus interstellar evacuations had been necessary many times in galactic history. In a placid spiral galaxy as large as the extent of the Galactic Empire, approximately three supernovae occurred every century.[source?] Nonetheless, gas and dust within the plane of the galactic disk could limit a supernova's visibility to a few thousand light years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If a star was massive enough to perish in a supernova explosion, it produced, in its final stages of nuclear fusion, large amounts of heavy elements in its core. The supernova then scattered these elements into the surrounding nebulae."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known supernovae in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
