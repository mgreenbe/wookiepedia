At least one cannus solix may have been entered into Sok Brok's Fiftieth Annual Pet Show, a pet show held on the planet Taris in 43 ABY. When attempting to distract the Jedi Knight Seff Hellin later that year, Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo, who had attended the pet show and seen Seff there when he helped save their granddaughter from a kidnapping attempt, pretended to argue about which creature had nearly bitten Han's ankle at the show, with Han believing it was an Ornuk and Leia stating that it was the cannus solix. Leia claimed Han didn't know the difference between the species as he had missed one of the show's judges explaining it whilst he was away starting a fight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cannus solix were first mentioned in the 2009 novel Fate of the Jedi: Abyss by Troy Denning. The species is mentioned during an acted conversation between Han and Leia whilst they try and distract Seff and it is unclear how much of the exchanged is based on real events. The pet show in question appeared in a previous novel, Millennium Falcon by James Luceno and no mention of the cannus solix was made, with a Kowakian monkey-lizard being the only animal to bite Han's ankle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
