The mercenaries are hired onto the Argent Lady that was hauling a group of R5-series astromech droid. The ship's captain, Xalto Sneerzick, and his crew were secretly part of the Droid Abolitionist Movement and en route uploaded a virus to the R5 droids in hopes of causing them to break their programming and become independent. A malfunction in some of the R5 caused them to revolt against their liberators and they killed the Argent Lady crew. The mercenaries then had to escape from the Cutlass, an Imperial Patrol Ship that appeared in their path and demanded the ship power down for a 'routine inspection.'"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
