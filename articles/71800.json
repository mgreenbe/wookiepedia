During this time, Malli was a member of the Jedi High Council, and was the master of Padawan Reath Silas. Before Silas, Malli had trained two other apprentices, including most recently, the Jedi Knight Dez Rydan. She was placed in command of the Jedi quarter of the space station Starlight Beacon after its completion, with the Trandoshan Master Sskeer as her second-in-command. Avar Kriss sensed their approach responding to the call to save the Hetzal system from the Great Hyperspace Disaster in the Force. Malli was later killed during a battle with the Nihil at the Kur Nebula, something which Estala Maru speculated that Sskeer blamed himself for after Maru was unable to locate the Trandoshan before Starlight Beacon's dedication ceremony. Following her death, her spot on the Council was succeeded by Ry Ki Sakka."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jora was a petite orange-skinned Togruta female."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jora wore white-and-gold Jedi robes and wielded a white-bladed lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
