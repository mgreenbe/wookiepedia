It was a 1.5 square meter of durable fiber coated with a layer of dormant microorganisms. The microorganisms fed off bio-electricity. When a creature stood on the fiber, a remote control would trigger other organisms that activate the microorganisms. They fed off the target's bio-electrictiy, swarming overing the creature and creating a porous biological cocoon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
