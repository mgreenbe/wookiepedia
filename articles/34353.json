Only three Phase III prototypes were on board Arc Hammer. One of these was used by the originator of the project, General Rom Mohc. It was a more powerful variant of the Phase II model and was able to be worn as a battle exosuit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Dark Trooper Project, building on the previous L8-L9 and Z-X3 projects, was the brainchild of General Rom Mohc, who strongly advocated the martial virtues of close combat with one's enemy, and thus disagreed with the philosophy that created such superweapons as the Death Star. He operated the Dark Trooper Project from his customized starship, Arc Hammer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first iteration of the project came years before the Battle of Yavin. Stationed aboard the Empirical research station and using most of the same technology that had been used to transform Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader, the Empire started building clone trooper veterans into gruesome cyborgs, the so-called Phase Zero dark troopers. As the Empire started to become less dependent on its clone troopers, the Phase Zero project declined and was eventually shut down, but the efficiency of the cybernetic soldiers had become apparent to most, including the man overseeing the space station: a young Imperial officer called Rom Mohc. The Phase Zero troopers were deployed on battlefields shortly before the Battle of Yavin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, the Dark Trooper Project was finally greenlit. The main goal for the Dark Trooper Project was to create the next generation of the stormtrooper. It consisted of the armor and the application of weaponry so it was intended for use with the basic stormtrooper (clone and the like) but looking forward to whatever internal system that might be developed. The dark troopers were first used against the Rebel Tak Base in the attack on Tak Base, in retaliation for the destruction of the first Death Star. They slaughtered all the Rebels in the base. Concerned about the potential threat of the dark troopers, Mon Mothma tasked Kyle Katarn with the program's destruction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Squads of the dark troopers were characteristically deployed alongside the standard Imperial stormtroopers and the Imperial Army regulars in battles to add their distinctive advantage. They used their advanced combat techniques and jetpacks to drop behind enemy lines or outflank enemy positions, contributing to the overall effectiveness of battle maneuvers by creating havoc amongst their foes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were equipped with specialized assault cannons, which were modifications on the Imperial repeaters, rather than the standard E-11 blaster rifle; they were also issued additional fragmentation grenades, thermal detonators, and concussion grenades. Dark troopers wore dark gray armor made of the nearly indestructible metal phrik, mined on the moon Gromas 16. In addition to providing superior protection against enemy fire including energy weapons such as lightsabers, the armor was equipped with acceleration compensators to allow a soldier inside to endure the extreme maneuvers the unit was designed to perform."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Katarn succeeded in destroying Arc Hammer after killing Mohc. With the death of Mohc and the destruction of Arc Hammer, all official research into the Dark Trooper Project, and all research into other battle droid programs, ended."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, it is evident that not all of the dark troopers were destroyed along with the Arc Hammer; some were seen being stationed on Kessel, Felucia, Coruscant, and other worlds."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the dark troopers were deactivated during the mission to the Arc Hammer, at the Battle of Ord Sedra, a number of Imperial Remnant stormtroopers wore armor that was vaguely similar to the dark trooper designs.

Phrik alloys were tested on a laboratory on Fest and they were refined in Ice Station Beta on Anteevy, where, presumably, the Phase II was produced. The weapons of the dark troopers were manufactured and supplied by Moff Rebus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dark troopers stayed on Arc Hammer, whose location was always secret, and were jettisoned to their planetary targets in hyperspace pods."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were several different phases of these troopers:"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Phase Zero"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The original dark troopers were not combat droids but cyborg clone troopers with over 70% body parts replaced by mechanical components.

It served primarily as an installation sentry."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Phase I dark trooper had visible power cords and couplings, which were prime weak points.

One variant was the Triumphant-class dark trooper, some of which escorted Darth Vader during several operations in 1.5 ABY. The Inquisitorius also had their own dark trooper variant, the Inquisitorium dark trooper. The purge trooper was an earlier dark trooper model, specifically designed for combat against Jedi and other Force-wielders.

The game Star Wars: Rebellion and Star Wars: Rebellion: Prima's Official Strategy Guide describe the dark troopers as Force wielders wearing exosuits; however, this is probably non-canon within Star Wars Legends, especially since The Essential Guide to Droids was later the first source to explicitly establish that the dark troopers are droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several other \"variants\" of dark troopers appeared in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. Most of the dark troopers in the game are white, as opposed to the dark gray of Dark Forces, although a variation of the droids (known as the dark novatroopers) found during the Rebel corvette missions are colored black. Due to the nature of combat in the game, the dark troopers do not use their jetpacks or their assault cannons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some non-canon appearances of dark troopers differ from the canonical Legends version. In Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption, the Phase II variant seems to use a large chaingun, and the Phase III variant has two shoulder-mounted rocket launchers. However, in the Star Wars Miniatures game, Phase III dark troopers have small missile launchers. In Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, they were about as powerful as an AT-PT, although this is probably game mechanics. They were produced at Imperial Fortresses at a cost of 50 units of food and 85 units of carbon, and were upgradeable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dark troopers have been produced as toys.
