While some relay stations and transmitters were attacked by heavily armed freighters, most of them were sabotaged to self-destruct. Nevertheless, most stations reported few casualties. The blackout was widespread but backup systems quickly came online. Heavily populated areas reported few problems but long distance communications were disrupted for several hours and some outlying areas remained isolated for nearly one day."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
