Hoping to alleviate Serra's pain, Lucia arranged for the assassination of a mining caste leader, Gelba; however, a Jedi Knight, Medd Tandar, was also killed in the attack. Serra traveled to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to reassure the Jedi that the assassination was not the fault of the Doan Royal House. While in the Jedi Temple, Master Obba showed Serra a monument which honored the five Jedi who died at Tython, as well as Caleb. Shocked to find that her father had died, Serra swore vengeance and hired the same assassin that Lucia had hired to kill Gelba\u2014known as the Huntress\u2014to capture Bane, whom she believed had killed her father, thus taking her first step toward the dark side."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Torturing Darth Bane and Lucia's death"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Bane was captured by the Huntress and about twenty mercenaries provided by Serra.

Serra, hoping to kill the two Sith, activated the self-destruct sequence for the prison before fleeing with the corpse of Lucia, who had been killed by Zannah.

Serra refused Bane's proposal to serve him as a healer and she tried to convince Cognus that the dark side would destroy her. However, Cognus merely requested Bane's permission to kill Serra.
