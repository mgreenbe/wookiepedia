During the Sith\u2013Imperial War, he was made responsible for ensuring that Admiral Gar Stazi of the Galactic Alliance didn't escape Caamas. However, Valan underestimated Stazi and he failed to prevent his escape.

When the Galactic Alliance, under the command of Rear Admiral Piers Petan surrendered, Admiral Gar Stazi chose to escape and continue the fight against the Empire. Grand Admiral Morlish Veed commanded Valan to make certain Stazi couldn't escape so he and his fleet could be destroyed for their defiance. But Valan underestimated Stazi, who escaped using a spacer hyperspace route. Valan was blamed for Stazi's escape.

But after the Sith Lord Darth Azard executed Sha Dun for failing to stop Stazi's attacks on the Empire, Valan was placed in command of the fleet and tasked with hunting down Stazi. Valan believed in Human High Culture and ordered his second in command the removal of all alien crew from the fleet to ensure that \"only the best\" would serve under him. He even crushed a part of the Kel Dor's breathing mask under his foot after his former commander had been eliminated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Now in the command of the Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer Relentless, Admiral Valan plotted to set up a trap for Stazi by baiting him with the possibility of capturing the Imperious-class Star Destroyer Imperious. Having analyzed Stazi's tactics, he presumed that the Alliance admiral could not think strategically. A female Toydarian named Niffla told him she had seen Gial Gahan's niece, who was also a member of Rogue Squadron, at the shipyards. Valan was then certain that he would soon redeem himself from allowing Stazi to escape at Caamas."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Disgraced Again"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several days later, Stazi's fleet jumped into the system to take the Imperious. But Gial Gahan had been arrested for trying to disable the shipyard's defenses and stormtroopers had re-seized the Imperious from Stazi's troops. When Valan's fleet arrived in the system, it appeared to him that Stazi's fleet was trapped between his fleet and the shipyards. But Stazi had prepared for Valan's trap by setting up one himself. Monia Gahan hacked the shipyard's automated defenses to fire on Imperial ships, and the combined firepower from the Alliance fleet and the Shipyards inflicted heavy damage on Valan's fleet. To add insult to injury, the stormtroopers that had re-seized the Imperious were actually Alliance Remnant troops. They hijacked the advanced Star Destroyer and got it to one of the Alliance's bases."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite being outmaneuvered, Valan ordered his ships to fire on the Indomitable, hoping to eliminate Stazi and cripple the Remnant.
