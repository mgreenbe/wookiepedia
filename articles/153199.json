Skywalker, however, was lurking nearby and held the commander hostage. He then pointed out that he was still infected with Bledsoe's disease (which was technically true, as the vaccination he took hadn't fully kicked in yet), and also implied that he'll take the commander down with him by the stormtroopers blaster fire if he doesn't let the droids go. However, the commander ordered for the Stormtroopers to fire on him anyhow, as he preferred to die loyal to the Galactic Empire. However, the Stormtroopers were killed by Anduvil, and the commander was instead captured and brought onto Skywalker's ship as insurance to leave the system, with the base being destroyed from Anduvil's earlier sabotage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
