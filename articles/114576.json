However, the mission was complicated when their younger brother Rowan Freemaker came along for the ride and convinced his older siblings to visit Maz Kanata's castle on the planet Takodana, which lay on the way to Major Derlin's coordinates. The rebel spy's escape pod was floating in a junk field off the acidic planet of Taul. Rowan wanted to seek Maz Kanata's help for information on how to obtain a proton suspension housing from a Corellian Defender, which was large enough to contain a bantha\u2013sized kyber crystal.

After braving the dangerous elements and acidic lakes, the Freemakers managed to make their way to the wreck of a Corellian Defender, which was floating on top of an acidic lake. Unable to lift the Corellian Defender out of the lake without destroying it, the Freemakers used the Mini Scavenger to enter the wrecked starship.
