Starting from a waterfall near the ruins of the temple-cities of Kaleth and Vur Tepe, the river wound its way through several mountains and valleys and past the Jedi Temple before it reached the Tythonian Gnarls, where it spread into several small tributaries that later rejoined at the far end of the area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
