Each family maintained an Office of the Patriarch within their homestead. When most of the population of Csilla emigrated due to the freezing of the planet, most of the Ruling Families of the Chiss Ascendancy chose to keep their homesteads on their ancestral lands of the Chiss homeworld. Nevertheless, most of the remaining population was relocated underground, and the homesteads were as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In most cases of rematching, a prospective recruit on a given planet would have to interview several family  Councilors and possibly the family Patriel of that planet. The Patriel and Councilors would then send a report to their family homestead, where officials would deliberate whether or not to admit that individual as a merit adoptive. This process typically took two to three months. However, in Thrawn's case, Mitth family Patriarch Mitth'oor'akiord directly circumvented these interviews to accept then-Vurawn as a merit adoptive of the Mitth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mitth family homestead was located in a cavern underneath that family's ancestral lands.
