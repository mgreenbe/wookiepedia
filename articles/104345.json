After several of her lifestock had been poisoned after drinking from a river outside Naboo's capital Theed, Peppi learned from Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Representative Jar Jar Binks that her animals had been the victim of a Separatist biological weapon that had contaminated the river. Bow led the two politicians to the source of the poisoning, which came from the Eastern swamps. After Amidala and Binks were captured by the Separatist scientist Nuvo Vindi, Bow helped the Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano to locate the two missing politicians. Bow and Tano discovered the existence of a secret facility beneath the swamps, which was responsible for developing the Blue Shadow Virus. While Tano and clone troopers assaulted Dr Vindi's laboratory, Peppi waited in the swamps to prevent any Separatist forces from escaping. She played an important role in intercepting and tackling Vindi, who was subsequently arrested by Republic forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
