Considered very mature for his age by many Jedi, Olin was well-respected for his dedication to the Jedi Order. He often clashed with fellow Padawan learner Anakin Skywalker, who disagreed with his strict adherence to Jedi rules and protocol. The two and their masters, Tachi and Obi-Wan Kenobi, often worked together on missions, traveling to such varied worlds as Radnor, Euceron, Andara, Typha-Dor, Romin, Falleen, and finally, Korriban. Many of these missions were orchestrated with the goal of capturing the escaped scientist and criminal Jenna Zan Arbor, who the Jedi later discovered was working with Granta Omega, the murderer of the Jedi Council member Yaddle. However, Zan Arbor consistently eluded them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the onset of the Clone Wars, Olin resigned from the Jedi Order due to the guilt he felt over the inadvertent death of fellow Padawan Darra Thel-Tanis on Korriban, where Omega was finally killed in battle with Kenobi present.

Olin and Lands would produce fake, brand-new identities for anyone that wanted to escape from the empire. Olin grew fond enough of Bellassa to adopt it as his homeworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after the execution of Order 66, Olin founded a rebel organization on Bellassa in opposition to the Galactic Empire, newly in control of the galaxy. He would later retrain himself in the Jedi ways with the aid of Obi-Wan Kenobi, one of the few Jedi to survive the Great Jedi Purge. Olin also created a safehouse for fugitive Jedi on an asteroid hidden within an atmospheric storm. Here he would begin to form the early stages of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. During his search for Jedi refugees from the Empire, he was blackmailed into aiding Emperor Palpatine, but would act as a double-agent, seeking information and attempting to undermine the Empire from the inside, eventually confronting Darth Vader himself. His resistance movement spanned the galaxy from Bellassa, Acherin, Coruscant, Naboo, Samaria to Alderaan as well as other planets. This lasted until the Empire thwarted his plans for early rebellion by destroying his secret asteroid base. He eventually accepted a mission from Obi-Wan to watch over Princess Leia Organa on Alderaan where he would reside for many years until Darth Vader killed him a year after that planet was completely destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi apprentice"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Evacuation of Radnor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Olin first worked closely with Anakin Skywalker in 27 BBY during a mission to evacuate the planet Radnor when the release of a deadly airborne toxin left many of its citizens unable to flee in the face of near-certain death. The two were sent to the planet along with their Masters, Siri Tachi and Obi-Wan Kenobi, and four other Jedi \u2014 Ry-Gaul with his apprentice Tru Veld, and Soara Antana with her Padawan Darra Thel-Tanis. During the mission, the Masters and Padawans were forced to separate, since there were not enough bio-isolation suits to enable all of the Jedi to investigate the area already afflicted by the toxin. Left to their own devices, the more experienced Padawans Olin and Skywalker quickly clashed over issues of leadership."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite these tensions, the four Jedi were able to cooperate well enough to gradually discover the explanation for the release of the toxin. While tracing a group of raiders who were ransacking the homes of fleeing civilians to steal their valuables, the Padawans discovered that the criminals had managed to obtain the evacuation schedule for the citizens of the still-unaffected city of Tacto, enabling them to steal from the fleeing citizens in a suspiciously organized and efficient manner. This information, combined with Skywalker and Veld's discovery that the planet's communications were being jammed from orbit rather than suffering from malfunction, led them to deduce that the natives of the neighboring planet of Avon were planning to invade Radnor, using an offer of assistance in the evacuation as a smokescreen to allow them to land an army of battle droids to quickly conquer the planet. The Jedi teams thwarted the invasion and exposed Galen, the Radnoran scientist who had originally developed the toxin, as a traitor, but Skywalker and Olin remained at odds even after their success. At the end of the mission, Olin, distrusting his fellow Padawan due to the desire for control he had shown, warned him that he would watch him in the future, further infuriating Skywalker and cementing the two apprentices' rivalry and mutual dislike for one another."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Galactic Games"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several months later, in 26 BBY, the two apprentices met again, along with their masters, at the Galactic Games on the planet Euceron.

When Skywalker discovered that an illegal podrace was rigged in favor of one competitor, he decided to compete in it to discover how the race would be manipulated and who was behind it. Olin opposed this plan, believing that Skywalker was racing as much for the thrill as for the mission's success, and his opinions irritated his rival. Skywalker did enter the race, but discovered that he was the racer with the advantage rather than Hekula, the son of his former podracing rival Sebulba. However, he narrowly escaped death when his pod was sabotaged in an attempt to force a dramatic crash into the crowd. Unable to prove the corruption and crimes of the celebrity athlete Maxo Vista and his confederate Liviani Sarno, head of the Games Council, the Jedi left Euceron with a hollow victory and mutual feelings of animosity between Olin and Skywalker still lingering."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Skywalker took private lightsaber training lessons with Soara Antana, the Jedi Master chose Olin to surprise him with an attack after one of their lessons. With no love lost between the two Padawans and Skywalker already exhausted from training, Olin took the upper hand at first before Skywalker gave into his feelings of anger, which fueled him and allowed him to defeat his fellow apprentice. However, the display of rage and Skywalker's lack of awareness of his error gave Antana serious doubts about the young Padawan.

Coincidentally, a squad of young mercenaries was suspected by the Jedi Council to be using the Leadership School as a training ground. In order to look into both Gillam's disappearance and the secret squad, Olin was sent with Skywalker to infiltrate the school disguised as students; with this cover, the two would be able to identify and investigate the mercenaries in hopes of finding a clue to the motive behind Gillam Tarturi's disappearance. When they arrived at the school, Olin befriended a troublesome student named Reymet Autem, the son of Senate Guard Sagoro Autem, who seemed to know something about the inner workings of the school. While Olin began to get to know Autem in an attempt to learn about the mercenaries from the student, Skywalker managed to infiltrate the secret squad. However, as he learned more about them, he gradually became more and more in agreement with the unit's ideals\u2014this led him to decide to join them on a mission to penetrate Andara's airspace. The mission was based on Ieria, a planet in the system, and Skywalker suggested Gillam might be there, trying to justify his planned participation in the raid. However, Olin adamantly opposed the violation of the Jedi Code, and attempted to convince his rival not to participate in such a potentially inflammatory act. Skywalker agreed to meet with him later to consult Kenobi, but before the two Padawans had a chance to contact Skywalker's master, Olin disappeared."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He had began a search for Gillam in an effort to find him before Skywalker left the school, hoping to eliminate Kenobi's apprentice's rationale for seeking Gillam on Ieria. However, Tarturi, actually hidden in the old and abandoned system rooms inside the school, stumbled upon him. Along with a few members of the secret squad, Tarturi imprisoned Olin there, before leaving for Ieria in secret. Skywalker, even after discovering that Olin was missing, chose to go with the secret squad instead of searching for him, which left the young Jedi imprisoned until Kenobi and Tachi arrived at the Leadership School to rescue him, under the cover of parents considering enrolling their children in classes there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his explorations of the system rooms, Olin had discovered Gillam's datapad. Using the Force to deflect the mercenaries' attention from it, he managed to keep it from being confiscated. With study of the datapad, he and the Masters discovered that the Senator's son had staged his own kidnapping, and planned to pin it on his own father. The Jedi also realized that he was preparing to stage his own death, killing Skywalker instead; he would then disguise the young Jedi's corpse as his own. The trio traveled to Ieria in an attempt to rescue Skywalker. Tarturi had underestimated the power of the Jedi, though, for the teenager easily disabled the squad's starfighters, along with attack droids sent in to assassinate him. The other Jedi then arrived in time to take the mercenaries into custody. However, the fact that Skywalker had not even looked for Olin when he discovered that he had disappeared infuriated Kenobi, creating a rift between the Master and his Padawan that would take some time to heal."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Invasion of Typha-Dor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25 BBY, Skywalker and Kenobi were sent into the Uziel system to the planet Typha-Dor, the only planet that continued to hold out against the invasions masterminded by the system's largest planet, Vanqor. Their mission was to inform the members of a Typha-Dorian surveillance post that the Vanqors had nearly discovered their position, and they needed to evacuate. When the two Jedi arrived, however, they discovered that the members of the surveillance post had obtained the invasion plans the Vanqors intended to use in their invasion of Typha-Dor. During the attempted escape of the team, Skywalker was captured by the Vanqors and taken to Vanqor itself, where he was placed in the Zone of Self-Containment, a drug that induced a state of blissful content, by the criminal scientist Jenna Zan Arbor. Skywalker also discovered later that the Zone interfered with his ability to use the Force. While this occurred, Olin and Tachi, along with the Jedi Garen Muln, Clee Rhara, Ry-Gaul, and Tru Veld, were dispatched to rescue Kenobi and Skywalker and aid them in getting the invasion plans to Typha-Dor. Kenobi managed to spring Skywalker from the Vanqor prison, and the Jedi team arrived just in time to rescue the two from Vanqor forces. Evading enemy starships, the Jedi team arrived safely at Typha-Dor. When the Typha-Dorian General Bycha mentioned that rumors had arose of medical experiments being performed on the prisoners in the camp Skywalker was imprisoned in, the young Jedi revealed that he had undergone the procedure. This surprised all of the Jedi, but most of all Kenobi\u2014none of them had yet been told this by Skywalker. This made Olin believe that Skywalker had refrained from telling his Master because he enjoyed the lack of feeling, saying that it even overcame his loyalty to Kenobi, and causing Skywalker to become defensive of his actions. Although with the Jedi's aid the Typha-Dorians managed to force the Vanqor forces into surrendering without firing a shot, Jenna Zan Arbor escaped Vanqor, after which the four Jedi chose to continue their attempts to track her down."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Mission to Quas Killam"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Olin and Tachi embarked on a mission to the mining planet of Quas Killam, although the exact date of the mission is unclear. On the planet, they oversaw peace talks between a trinium mining cartel and another faction; the two groups wanted to form a coalition government of the planet. Although their mission was successful, Olin was uneasy with the result, believing that the cartel had made too many concessions to the other group. However, Tachi reminded him that their mission was complete, and they could not interfere with the government to investigate the Padawan's suspicions. At the beginning of the Clone Wars, however, Olin's misgivings were proved correct. The cartel allied with the Trade Federation to take control of Quas Killam's government, giving the Separatists control of all the factories and trinium mines. Many Killams not in the cartel were conscripted or killed. Later, during a mission undertaken by Tachi, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Padm\u00e9 Amidala, the female Jedi Master recalled the mission to Quas Killam with regret, wishing that she had observed more of the occurrences there, and possibly prevented the Separatists' takeover of the planet."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Tracking Jenna Zan Arbor"}, {"tag": "h5", "text": "Uprising on Romin"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the following few months, Kenobi and Skywalker tracked Zan Arbor across the galaxy, while Tachi and Olin only assisted them occasionally.

This did not deter Kenobi, however, and when he learned that a gang of thieves known as the Slams had just been captured by the Republic, and their capture had not yet been publicized, he managed to convince the Jedi Council to allow the four Jedi to impersonate the Slams in effort to gain entrance to Romin, despite the disagreement of Olin, who argued that the Jedi were above using trickery to capture Zan Arbor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arriving on Romin, Kenobi and Tachi split up with their Padawans, meeting with Zan Arbor and stealing her datapad while Skywalker and Olin explored the city.

Their attackers took them to Joylin, leader of the anti-Teda resistance, who revealed to them that a coup was planned against Teda in one day, at the reception Teda held for the wealthy residents of Romin. Believing the Jedi to be the Slams, Joylin asked them to steal codes from Teda's palace that would allow the resistance to deactivate his droid army, allowing a nearly bloodless transition of power. Despite Olin's objections to the plan, the Jedi agreed to assist the resistance in removing Teda from power, believing it to be an act of justice against the dictator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That night, Olin, unable to sleep, came across Kenobi in the garden of the villa the Jedi were staying in. He confessed to the Jedi Master his fears about Skywalker's power, but Kenobi disagreed. This would later haunt him after Skywalker became Darth Vader; he would remember that Olin had warned him about the dangers of Skywalker's incredible potential, and he had not heeded the young Padawan's warning. However, confessing his fears for his rival seemed to release a weight from Olin, and the two Jedi later became, if not friends, certainly much less antagonistic towards one another during much of the remainder of their search for Zan Arbor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the reception the next day, the Jedi successfully managed to steal the codes required by the resistance. However, with Teda's droids out of commission, the revolters vandalized much of the city, proving that Olin's misgivings were warranted. Teda and Zan Arbor fled the capital, and summoned the Slams for a job. When the Jedi reached the hideout of the two, though, the real Slams, freshly escaped from prison, arrived, denouncing the Jedi as impostors. Zan Arbor then recognized Skywalker from her experiments upon him on Vanqor, and realized the impostors were Jedi; after this the four were taken captive and sent into the prisons. Before they could be locked away, they freed the other prisoners of Teda, and demoralized the dictator's army, forcing them to surrender. Teda and Zan Arbor were captured and taken before Joylin, the new leader of Romin, making it seem like the Jedi had won. Unfortunately, Joylin had other plans. He released Teda and Zan Arbor, and gave the true Slams permission to leave, attempting to use their flight as justification for his planned execution of Teda's followers. Skywalker sensed his plan soon enough that the Jedi would have been able to capture their enemies, if not for a bit of information discovered on Jenna Zan Arbor's datapad by Kenobi She had been corresponding with Granta Omega, a notable enemy of the Jedi responsible for the murder of Jedi Master Yaddle.
