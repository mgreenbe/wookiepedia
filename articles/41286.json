Vetter dropped her lightsaber and collapsed to the ground, but she was content in the knowledge that Marasiah had escaped. However, Talon informed her conquered foe that such had been her intention, and she used the Force to drain knowledge of the Princess's destination from Vetter's mind.

The two arranged passage offworld on the pirate vessel Mynock, but Talon was already aware of their destination and followed them there. When the Sith Hand attacked the group, Marasiah fought furiously in order to prevent Talon from again killing someone who had risen to the Princess's defense. News of Vetter's death and Marasiah's escape reached Roan Fel's ears on his new fortress world of Bastion, but he resisted the urge to mount a rescue attempt in order to keep his recent capture of Bastion a secret.
