Almost always working solo or in small groups, they utilized Stealth field generators and the rare art of Force camouflage to aid their surprise attacks. While some elite assassins fought with lightsabers, the majority utilized less remarkable melee weapons, such as force pikes. These stealth warriors were also unusual in that they drew their power from the Force presence of their prey.
