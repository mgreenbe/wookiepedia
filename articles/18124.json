Although the Blood Monarch was the world's ruler, it was the elected parliament that dealt with most planetary matters. The Blood Monarch traditionally lived in the alcazar of Ramatesh. Oppo Rancisis's mother had been a Blood Monarch of Thisspias. After her death, she was replaced with Oppo's younger sister. However, this Monarch was assassinated in the alcazar. The crown would have gone to Oppo, but he chose to abdicate in favor of the following person in the succession, to continue his work as a Jedi. Later on, Oppo decided that the Republic needed to ensure Thisspias' loyalty and even help for the Clone Wars, so he challenged and defeated the Blood Monarch in personal combat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
