When the Resistance reached Exegol, its forces would attempt to destroy it to prevent the tower from sending the navigation signal so that the Sith Star Destroyers would not be able to leave the planet. To do this, a ground team led by General Finn would be in charge of attacking the navigation tower, while an air team led by General Poe Dameron had to defend them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ground forces traveled to Exegol in the Fortress transport, but after their arrival, a First Order officer realized that the Resistance wanted to attack the navigation tower, so Allegiant General Enric Pryde changed the navigation signal of the tower to his command ship, the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Steadfast, forcing the Resistance ground team to turn to the Resurgent Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
