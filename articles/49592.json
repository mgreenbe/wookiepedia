He loaded cargo onto ships that arrived at the Czerka base on the planet. He had no strong political views, favoring neither the Republic or the Sith. His reasoning behind this was no matter who ruled, they'd need somebody to load crates. In his free time, he could be seen playing pazaak with the various travelers that visited Kashyyyk. He may have played pazaak with Revan during his search for the Star Map on Kashyyyk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
