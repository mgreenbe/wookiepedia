Although Falud was a committed Rebel willing to die for his cause, his son Choyd did not share his sympathies, and instead fell in with a notorious delinquent gang known as the Freelies. In 1 ABY, Falud was captured by Imperials along with Rebel leaders Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, and another Rebel agent named Paxin. However, the group was freed from their bonds by Skywalker's droids, C-3PO and R2-D2, and managed to overcome their stormtrooper guards and seize their weapons. The foursome was soon rushed by another group of stormtroopers during their escape attempt, and Falud was struck by a blaster bolt and killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Falud made his first and only appearance in the Star Wars Legends continuity in Gambler's World, a comic strip story arc written and illustrated by Russ Manning and released in 1979."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
