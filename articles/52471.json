Nevertheless, the Gama-Senn's acquiescence merely angered Palpatine, who disdained the species for only capitulating due to fear.

The art style used employs colored lighting in the scenes featuring the Gama-Senn character, so ascertaining the species' skin color is difficult; the description above assumes the representative's skin tone and clothing color is not distorted significantly by lighting effects. Similarly, the top of the character's head is black, but it is difficult to determine whether this represents hair or some sort of hat. The species is mentioned in the Gama system's entries in both 1998's Star Wars Encyclopedia and 2008's The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
