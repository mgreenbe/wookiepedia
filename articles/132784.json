Kligson agrees to repair the droid, but R2-D2 and C-3PO must accompany the warbot to observe the operation since Kligson intends to keep the droid after it's repaired. However, another droid on Kligson's moon has other ideas as the former Imperial Z-X3 experimental droid trooper, Zee-Exthree, plans to use parts of the warbot to repair his own war droid and lead a revolt against Kligson. But Kligson had anticipated this and sent a decoy to lure the Zee-Exthree and his followers out into the open when he would launch his own warbot against them. With the battle over, R2-D2 and C-3PO record the schematics of the warbot and return to the Rebels, while Kligson moves his station from its current orbit to a more secret location where the Empire cannot find it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
