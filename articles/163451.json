During the Imperial Era, the dealer arranged a trade with a criminal syndicate, the Pykes, but found the clients dead at the meetup point. There remained standing only a Chagrian, who told Wef that the Hidden Hand criminal organization was offering a deal three times better than the Pykes. In order to stay alive, Wef accepted the deal and went into business with the Hidden Hand. Sales skyrocketed for Wef, who traded with various Hidden Hand go-betweens over the years, including a few humans and a green-skinned individual, and the arms dealer eventually came to operate from a Hidden Hand outpost on the world of Heva."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point prior to the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, Rebak, a member of the Rebellion, expressed interest in purchasing a collection of bot-drones belonging to the Hidden Hand that Wef had been in possession of for years. The weapons were originally intended for use by the Galactic Empire but were ultimately rejected due to their unstable technology. However, Wef found another interested buyer in a crew of bounty hunters led by the cyborg Beilert Valance who had come to the Hidden Hand outpost on Heva during their hunt for the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Dealing with bounty hunters"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Wef led Dengar and Honnah, two members of Valance's crew, through the Heva outpost, the arms dealer revealed that they had competition for buying the bot-drones. Wef would have given the bot-drones to the hunters for nothing because of their unreliability but explained that the Hidden Hand had found another buyer, so the hunters would need to offer more money. When the hunters asked what Wef knew about the Hidden Hand, the dealer spoke to the group's secrecy but remarked how partnering with the criminal organization had brought great business. However, Wef also noted that there had been something strange in the behavior of all the Hidden Hand contacts, likening them to bounty hunters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Valance's team inspected Wef's bot-drones at the outpost's command center, the arms dealer asked them why they needed the drones. Valance then pointed to the sky, revealing that the Imperial Star Destroyer Formidable had arrived at Heva with Vader on board. The Dark Lord had tracked down the hunters, having received information about their whereabouts from Dengar, the informant in Valance's crew. Upon sighting the Star Destroyer, Wef stated that they were all going to die.

Wef expressed a personal affinity and trust for the hunters Dengar and Honnah. However, Wef later scolded Valance's slicer, Chio Fain, after seeing him tinkering with the bot-drones and treating them like \"toys.\" The presence of the Imperial Star Destroyer Formidable in Heva's skies convinced Wef that their entire party was doomed.
