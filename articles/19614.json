The mercenary crew of Ranzar Malk were sent to rescue the prisoner Qin from the prison ship, utilizing the Razor Crest, the starship of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin. Against Djarin's wishes, the crew killed the sole living crewmember aboard, Lieutenant Davan, who activated a distress signal before his death, leading New Republic forces to the prison ship's location. After rescuing Qin, the crew betrayed Djarin and left him trapped aboard the ship, but Djarin escaped and incapacitated the mercenaries, imprisoning them within a cell aboard Bothan-Five. Eventually, the ship was found derelict near the Dilestri system, with security records showing that Djarin had risked his life to save that of Davan, and the bounty hunter left three wanted fugitives aboard, including Migs Mayfeld, who was apprehended for his part in the rescue. Those records, once accessed by a pair of X-wings on patrol, convinced the pilots not to arrest Djarin when they encountered him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
