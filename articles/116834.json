Soon Farrs and Gann remove the seed-partners that are clinging to Obi-Wan and Anakin and place each one each in a Lamina box. Farrs explains that three of the seed-partners, one of Obi-Wan's and two of Anakin's, had chosen a client before, but that the client did not stay long enough to grow a ship.
