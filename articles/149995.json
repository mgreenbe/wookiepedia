Tuggs used his modified Sienar-Chall Utilipede Transport as a traveling kitchen to bring Tuggs' Grubs to various locations \"from Bespin to Batuu.\" Tuggs founded the restaurant after the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY. At some time during that year, he made recurring visits to operate the restaurant for one week out of each month at Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo in Black Spire Outpost on the planet Batuu. This led local Batuuans such as Savi's Gatherers to eat there every day of the week that Tuggs was the visiting chef."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
