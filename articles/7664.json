It laid in a sector with frequent meteor activity, meaning that starships in the area required a magnetogravitic shield in order to stay intact.

During the confrontation, the Separatists tested a new type of land mine with such a destructive power that it created a volcano on the unstable planet. Although both parties first fought to the point of reaching a Mandalorian standoff, the unexpected side effect of the weapon compelled the Republic and Separatist forces to temporarily forgo their enmity, and work together to leave the planet alive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
