She was a maidservant of the Khai family, a Human family in the Lost Tribe of Sith, in 41 ABY. She often attended to Sith Tyro Vestara Khai, the only daughter of Sith Saber Gavar Khai and his wife, Lahka Khai. On the morning that Vestara was to travel to the Circle Chambers in the capital city of Tahv for a meeting with the Circle of Lords, the planet's governing council, Muura prepared Vestara with vor'shandi markings\u2014which were made from the nectar of the S'rai plant\u2014particularly of the dalsa flower, and intricately braided her hair. Afterward, Muura was no longer needed as his daughter's attendant, as Vestara was chosen to be the apprentice of Lady Rhea, and would have to live in the Sith Temple. Gavar informed Muura that the family no longer had need of her at their estate, and he gave her clothing and food to last several days. Gavar also told a few of his friends that Muura had become available for work elsewhere."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Standing over 1.5 meters tall, Muura had the soft purple skin and lilting accent of her species. Muura was accustomed to Vestara's unhappiness at the marring scar on her face, and she fawned over the Tyro, praising her beauty even though Vestara herself thought that Muura was more attractive. Muura was skilled in the artistry of vor'shandi markings, beautiful designs painted onto members of the Tribe for special ceremonies. She was also highly dexterous, as she was able to weave her mistress' long brown hair into intricate braids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Muura was confused by Gavar's sadness in the house as his daughter left, and when he informed her that her services would no longer be needed; but she knew better than to ask for a reference upon her dismissal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Muura was created by author Christie Golden for her first Star Wars novel, Fate of the Jedi: Omen, the second novel in the nine-part Fate of the Jedi series.
