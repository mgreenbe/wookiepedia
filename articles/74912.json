Originally the Padawan of the Trandoshan Jedi Master Sskeer, Trennis rose to the rank of Knight in 232 BBY after saving a city of diminuitive Ximpi on the planet Shuraden from space-faring ridadi. She found herself stationed aboard the newly-christened Starlight Beacon, a Republic space station that stood as a symbol of hope and prosperity in the Outer Rim Territories. Although she had great skills, Trennis harbored feelings of self-doubt while stationed on the Beacon. Nevertheless, she resolved to be the best Jedi she could be while in service to the Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Path to knighthood"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Trial by ordeal"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Keeve Trennis underwent training in the ways of the Jedi Order during the High Republic Era, becoming the Padawan of the Jedi Master Sskeer. The two went on dozens of missions together as master and apprentice as the Trandoshan taught Trennis the ways of the Force. After suffering the loss of both his right arm and his fellow Jedi, Jora Malli, at the Battle of Kur, Sskeer took Trennis to the planet Shuraden aboard a Jedi Vector in 232 BBY. Once on the colorful world in the Galactic Frontier, Trennis encountered an inquisitive local, a Ximpi named Kanrii, who excitedly followed her until the Padawan was ambushed by her master, engaging his student in a sparring match. The duel ended with Trennis sending Sskeer hurtling through a tree. The young Padawan helped her master off the ground and confessed that she was confused why he had brought her to this place when she should have been preparing for her Jedi Trials. The Trandoshan revealed to her that they had come to Shuraden for exactly that reason."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sskeer led her to a place known as the Needles, a group of ancient rock pillars that rose above the planet's surface. After informing her that many individuals had tried and failed to climb the Needles for millennia, the Jedi Master instructed her to scale the pillars and find a Tythonian pendant that he had hung from one of the peaks. Although she questioned how the one-armed man had climbed the supposedly unclimbable, Trennis began her work. She was followed by the winged Kanrii, who curiously wondered how the Jedi could brave the ascension without her own pair of wings. As she reassured the alien that she would be fine, the fragile pillar broke under the weight of Trennis' hands. She drew her lightsaber and stabbed it's blade into the rock, bringing her descent to a halt. Hanging from her lightsaber hilt, Trennis was less than thrilled when a  second inquisitive Ximpi, Lekaki, flew up to greet his friend Kanrii. The two tiny beings discussed the Jedi's predicament when a swarm of enormous insects burst through the Needles, killing Lekaki and sending Trennis plummeting to the ground."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As she caught her bearings, the insects proceeded to swarm a nearby Ximpi city, throwing its inhabitants into chaos. Trennis chose to abandon her Trial and boarded the Vector starfighter, ignoring her master as he called to her. Landing outside the city, she contacted Jedi Master Estala Maru aboard the Starlight Beacon and informed him of the carnage. He told Trennis that the beasts were a species of star-locust known as ridadi that traveled through space once a generation, though their natural instincts should have caused them to avoid an inhabited world like Shuraden. Reaching out through the Force, Trennis connected with the hive mind of the creatures and realized that the signal of the newly constructed Starlight Beacon had disrupted the ridadi's senses and thrown them off-course. Trennis rigged her Vector to give off the same signal as Starlight and sent it flying off into the atmosphere on autopilot while Maru recalibrated the space station to transmit on a different frequency. Their plan worked, and the ridadi followed the starfighter off into space as Trennis and Kanrii returned to the ravaged city."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Knight of Starlight"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trennis helped the displaced Ximpi repair their homes, using the Force to lift the stone of their buildings back into place. She was confronted by Sskeer, who questioned her as to the whereabouts of their Vector. Learning that it was gone, he left his Padawan alone with the Ximpi to contact Starlight for the delivery of a transport, causing Trennis to suspect that she was in trouble. On the return trip to the Beacon aboard the Radiant Blessing, the duo stopped at the moon Wevo in the Haileap system, where they rescued the stranded passengers of the Steady Wing, a Galactic Republic ship that had been bombed in a Nihil attack. The passengers included the young Jedi Vernestra Rwoh and Imri Cantaros as well as Avon Starros, daughter of Senator Ghirra Starros."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The group then returned to Starlight Beacon, which was scheduled to have its formal dedication very soon. Sskeer brought his Padawan before Jedi Master Avar Kriss, who had just been named marshal of the station. Still believing she was about to be reprimanded, Trennis was surprised when Kriss ignited her lightsaber. The Jedi Master proclaimed Trennis as a Jedi Knight, protector of light in the galaxy. All three attended the dedication ceremony afterwards, where Trennis reflected on her journey thus far. She guessed that Sskeer had somehow known that the ridadi would attack and planned for her to be there to save the Ximpi. As she and every other Jedi present raised their lightsabers to the sky, Trennis shed tears and personally vowed to always uphold light and life."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Darkness of the Drengir"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Corpses in the Kazlin system"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later, the Starlight Beacon picked up a faint, scrambled distress signal from the Kazlin system. Trennis was one of a team of Jedi dispatched in a T-1 shuttle to assist, along with her former Master Sskeer as well as Terec and Ceret, Kotabi bond-twins whom Trennis had difficulty distinguishing. Piloting the shuttle, Trennis brought the ship into the star system to discover that the group had been too late: all of the Jedi beheld a ravaged starship with bodies and wreckage floating around it. Trennis and her companions, however, sensed life aboard the vessel, prompting the newly-minted Jedi Knight to bring the shuttle in to dock."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boarding through the T-1's docking tube, Sskeer ordered the team to don their rebreathers upon realizing that the ship was filled with noxious gas and slaughtered corpses, which likely meant that the vessel had fallen victim to the Nihil, the group of maruaders that Sskeer had battled at Kur. The Trandoshan ordered Trennis and Ceret to head for the flight deck while he and Terec searched the rest of the ship. As they ventured further into the ship, Trennis began to worry about Sskeer, sensing his unrest and noting his atypical communication with her. She and Ceret soon stumbled upon the corpse of a large Hutt riddled with stab wounds and blaster burns. In another part of the ship, Sskeer and Terec were attacked by a Nihil sniper. As Trennis ran to find them, she found that her former master had not only killed the assassin but also violently mutilated the enemy's remains."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sskeer left for the planet Sedri Minor with Terec on orders from Marshal Kriss to investigate the origins of a barley crop found aboard the Hutt ship. Worried about her master, Trennis volunteered to go along with Sskeer, but he ordered the young Knight to remain aboard the vessel and tend to Terec's injuries until Kriss and Vernestra Rwoh arrived aboard the Ataraxia.  Once the cruiser arrived, Trennis showed Kriss the Nihil's shattered corpse and confessed her worries to the marshal, who realized she should not have sent Sskeer on missions after his trauma at Kur. As they spoke, Terec collapsed into the arms of Jedi Knight Rwoh. The Kotabi had sensed their twin falling victim to an unknown danger on Sedri Minor."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Rotten roots"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving at Sedri aboard the Ataraxia, Trennis was forced to watch as Terec grew increasingly wild and hostile, frothing at the mouth as they lashed out against Sskeer. The Trandoshan, in turn, struck back, condemning the Kotabi as a mindless fool while Kriss tried to steady the two squabbling Jedi. Feeling helpless, Trennis left the ship and encountered a group of concerned locals who offered her and her companions bread, thinking they may be hungry. In conversation, Trennis was told that several settlers had recently disappeared, including a young Rodian boy named Julus. The boy's mother confessed that some considered Sedri Minor to be cursed, a belief bolstered by the fact that their crop of Vratixian barley was mysteriously rotting in the fields. Before Trennis could discover more, she was accosted by Kalo Sulman, the town's isolationist Speaker who viewed the Jedi as trespassers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unsatisfied, Trennis set out on her own to learn more about the disappearances. Although she intended to go alone, she was followed by a human child named Bartol, a friend of Julus desperate to find the missing Rodian. As the two made their way through the Vratixia fields, Trennis began to sense an encroaching darkness before coming across a massive sinkhole. Bartol eagerly jumped down the pit, forcing Trennis to catch the boy with the Force before impacting the ground below. Deeper in the cavern, Trennis felt an ominous, expectant shadow waiting for them. At the end of the tunnel, the duo discovered the bodies of Ceret and Julus hanging above them, with rotting vines protruding from their mouths, ears, and noses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cutting them down, Trennis determined that Ceret held onto life, but the boy Julus had died. Devastated, Bartol sought solace with the young Jedi Knight. Trennis consoled the child as best she could, embracing him in the dark pit. Still needing to tend to Ceret, she trusted Bartol to hold her saber as a light so that she could inspect the vines growing from the Kotabi's body. Ceret regained consciousness, but they were not themselves; their mind had been infected by the Drengir, an ancient race of sentient plant-based beings that desired to consume all flesh. Ceret turned on Trennis as Drengir began to converge on them from deeper within the tunnel. Avar Kriss arrived, bursting in from the surface and slicing a Drengir in twain. Although Kriss was able to talk some sense into Ceret, the group was halted in their tracks by an infected Sskeer, who held his lightsaber in a newly-grown arm of vines and roots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Keeve Trennis was a human female with dark skin and brown eyes. She wore her curly brown hair to the right side of her face, whereas the hair on her left side was shaved short. Trennis was a determined Jedi who trusted deeply in her connection with the Force, though she was prone to feelings of self-doubt. Although she was skilled in the Force, she thought to herself that others believed she wasn't ready for knighthood. In truth, several beings believed that the young Jedi had a bright future ahead of her. Trennis believed in hope, and trusted that good could prevail if it was worked towards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trennis was inspired by individuals like Avar Kriss, whom she admired for her accomplishments on Hetzal Prime during the Great Hyperspace Disaster. She had some trouble controlling her excitement around the esteemed Jedi Master, and found herself starstruck after learning of Kriss' great actions in the past. Trennis was aware of the fact that she negatively compared herself to more experienced Jedi like Kriss and the bond-twins Terec and Ceret, whom she considered to to be living legends. Despite the conflicts within herself, Trennis vowed to never let down people like Kriss and Sskeer who truly believed in her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Still, Trennis was not perfect, and it was impossible for her to ensure that pain would not befall the people she cared about. During her master's struggles with the dark side of the Force, Trennis felt helpless. She desired to help Sskeer make it through his troubles, but she had no idea how to do so. Trennis was fiercely protective of the defenseless, but she learned from experience that she could not stop death, no matter how much she wished it could always be prevented. Upon discovering the corpse of the boy Julus on Sedri Minor, she consoled the child's friend Bartol, confessing to him that it was normal to feel sorrow for another."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trennis was a young firebrand, and more impulsive than was becoming of a Jedi Knight. She was a sarcastic and quick-witted individual, trading barbs with her master Sskeer while on missions that poked fun at each others abilities. She was easily annoyed by beings like the Ximpi of Shuraden, thinking to herself that she had been cursed by the Force to have them in her presence. Trennis was prone to swearing, using expletives like kriff in formal settings when even she knew it was best to avoid such language."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trennis was trained in the Jedi arts, and as such could use the Force to accomplish tasks. She was able to telekinetically move objects as well as telepathically sense danger and communicate with other beings. While on Shuraden, Trennis connected with the hive mind of the ridadi, sensing the whole of their journey through space and seeing a possible future in which the locusts attacked the Starlight Beacon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Knight was trained in the usage of a lightsaber by her master, Sskeer. During their training session on Shuraden, she was able to best her one-armed master in combat, though the Trandoshan criticized her technique, instructing her to improve on her lateral sweep. She was also able to fly several types of ships, including the T-1 shuttle as well as the Jedi Vector, a highly dangerous starship that only a skilled Force-sensitive could properly operate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trennis carried a green double-bladed lightsaber. The weapon was ornately designed and could be split down the middle, allowing her to use two single-bladed sabers. She possessed Jedi clothing that was the standard for her time, with two sets each; one was a mostly brown attire for missions out in the galaxy and the other was a set of ceremonial white and yellow robes reserved for important occasions. As a Padawan, Trennis wore a Padawan braid that signified her position. For dangerous situations in which oxygen was a scarcity, Trennis carried a rebreather. She flew a Jedi Vector on Shuraden that she purposefully lost in order to lure away a swarm of ridadi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Keeve Trennis is a character created for the Star Wars: The High Republic comic series written by Cavan Scott  as part of the Star Wars: The High Republic multimedia project.
