When the decision was made to construct a shipyard to produce warships, it was ordered to lead a convoy of ships into the area with the needed supplies and personnel. The corvette's own cargo consisted of the technicians whose skills would be needed. Unfortunately for the Croisade, the Galactic Empire learned of the convoy and readied a trap for it in the Rocrin system. Trapped by the gravity well projectors of the Interdictor cruiser Compellor, pinned down by the Star Destroyer Rage, and its convoy swarmed by Avenger Squadron, the Croisade fell at the hands of torpedos loosed from Imperial bombers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
