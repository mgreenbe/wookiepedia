The air on the surface of Aleen was poisonous to those botanical beings, who guarded the passages between the two biotopes and were capable of provoking earthquakes to seal any breaches. At some point during the Clone Wars, the droid partners C-3PO and R2-D2 fell into the underworld, where they encountered four Kindalo who directed them to Orphne. The Kindalo's government was unique to their species, as they only took action at a societal level if every Kindalo agreed. This led some off-world xenobiologists to believe that the total Kindalo population was small."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
