During the reign of the Old Republic, Zygerria controlled a powerful Slave Empire that stretched across a number of sectors, making the planet rich and powerful. They and their customers prospered off slavery for thousands of years, but the Jedi Order eventually fought and destroyed the Zygerrian slave trade. When slavery was outlawed in Republic territory, the Jedi Knights liberated numerous beings, and the trade was pushed into the underworld."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fall of the Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the Galactic Republic had outlawed slavery, locations outside Republic jurisdiction were able to continue the practice. The Outer Rim planet of Tatooine had a slave population living in Mos Espa, and slaves had transmitter chips implanted into their bodies that would explode if the slave attempted to escape. By 40 BBY, Hosnian Prime was known for hosting a factory complex run by the arms manufacturer Czerka Arms, whose activities included the use of slavery, taking forcefully all the workers they wanted. Also, the Neimoidians used indentured worker drones, whose growth was deliberately stunted. Such drones were even employed by the Trade Federation's senatorial delegation in the very heart of the Republic's Senate Building. In 32 BBY, Erdan was a slave in Mos Espa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, fought between the Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Grand Army of the Republic was made up of loyal clone troopers, Clone Sergeant \"Slick,\" however, came to believe that the clones had been enslaved by the Jedi Order, though he was taken into custody during the Battle of Christophsis. By 20 BBY, Queen Miraj Scintel took advantage of the fighting to revive the Zygerria's ancient slave empire. Striking a deal with Separatist leader Count Dooku, Zygerrian forces under Commander Darts D'Nar enslaved the Togruta colonists on the Expansion Region world of Kiros. In response, the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, and Clone Captain \"Rex\" undertook an undercover mission to Zygerria in an attempt to investigate the Zygerrians and free the Togruta colonists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, they were captured by Queen Scintel, who planned to enslave her Jedi captives. Since this went against the Sith's planned Great Jedi Purge, Scintel was murdered by Count Dooku.

The murder of his father and the death of his mother while en-route to Zygerria convinced Penn to become an Imperial cadet. The raid occurred at a time when the Imperial Military had not expanded into the Outer Rim."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Age of the Empire, slavery once again became commonplace, particularly among alien species, which were considered inferior by the human-dominated Galactic Empire. With the rise of the Empire, the softening and eventual repeal of laws outlawing slavery led to the classification of some species, such as the Wookiees, as non-sentient. As a result, the Wookiees were pressed into slavery building much of the Imperial war machine, or serving in the notorious spice mines of Kessel following the Empire's conquest of their homeworld of Kashyyyk. Another example were the reptilian Bodach'i species who were enslaved and forced to work in the species mines of Kerev Doi as \"reparations\" for their homeworld's repeated defiance of Imperial decrees. In addition, the Empire used slaves from several alien species to keep Weapons Factory Alpha, the largest weapons factory in the galaxy, on Cymoon 1 running day and night."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being given command of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Chimaera, Commodore Thrawn discovered that the Empire was trafficking Wookiee slaves after responding to a distress call from the troop transport Sempre.

Thrawn led a successful military operation to neutralize the insurgents, forcing their surrender. When Lieutenant Commander Eli Vanto expressed his unease about slavery, Thrawn tried to rationalize the Empire's actions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tentacle-headed Twi'lek, mostly their females, were often captured and sold into slavery as they were considered beautiful. Many females of other races, not just the Twi'lek, were often forced to wear revealing outfits and to dance for their owners. In many other cases, those that were not actually slaves in name nevertheless worked in near slave-like existences, forced to endure grueling jobs to eke out a meager living while also often having to contend with corrupt Imperial officials.

Often, the Grysks enslaved entire species, by finding their weaknesses and breaking their souls. The Grysks sought to conquer the Chiss Ascendancy by enslaving and torturing the Chiss' beloved ozyly-esehembo navigators. Among the species enslaved by the Grysks were the Darshi and the Scratchlings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the rescue of navigator Un'hee, who had been enslaved to the Grysks, by Imperial forces; her fellow navigator Vah'nya touched her mind through Second Sight. Vah'nya told Lieutenant Eli Vanto that she experienced the Grysks probing Un'hee's mind and soul, twisting and tarnishing the young girl's deepest desires and fears to force her to perform their will. She convinced Vanto that such enslavement was a fate worse than death, and asked Vanto to kill her and any other ozyly-esehembo if they should fall into Grysk captivity. Killing a Chiss navigator was a capital offense in the Chiss Ascendancy, so deeply ingrained in Chiss society that no Chiss could even conceive of killing a Chiss navigator. Vanto promised that, if it came to it, he would kill captured ozyly-esehembo to spare them the misery of Grysk slavery, and do so in a way that would kill as many Grysks as possible along with the navigators."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle of Endor, the New Republic's provisional Galactic Senate in Chandrila diverted substantial resources to compensating alien species that had been enslaved by the Galactic Empire.

One of Tolruck's subordinates, Commandant Theodane Sardo, toyed with the idea of farming enslaved Wookiees for their meat. As part of the plan, the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus disabled the inhibitor chips controlling the Wookiee slaves with a hyperspace transceiver spike. Following a battle on the ground and space above Kashyyyk, the planet was liberated by New Republic forces led by Admiral Ackbar and Princess Leia Organa.
