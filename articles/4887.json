They walked on four clawed feet and had sharp spikes protruding out their backs from their necks to the end of their tail. Despite their small stature, albeks were intrepid and highly territorial creatures who would stow away on board any vessel that landed within their territory, viewing the intrusion as a challenge. Once established, albeks were very difficult to remove due to their aggressive nature, fearless stubbornness and their ability to use the Force to anticipate attacks and Force-pull a limb within reach of their sharp-toothed mouths."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
