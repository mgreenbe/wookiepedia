In 22 BBY, he was one of only around twenty hermits in the order and became the first Pontifex to legitimise a marriage in over 300 years when he secretly officiated the wedding of Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala. The ceremony took place on a balcony of the Varykino retreat in the Lake Country of the planet Naboo and was witnessed only by the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. Agolerga had light skin and wore dark robes for the ceremony."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maxiron Agolerga first appeared in the 2002 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. The scenes at Varykino were filmed in Villa del Balbianello on Lake Como in Italy. The wedding scene was nearly postponed by overnight rainfall, but the skies cleared fifteen minutes before the shoot. In the new Star Wars canon, Agolerga's name was first used in the 2016 magazine Star Wars: Build the Millennium Falcon 54. In the Star Wars Legends continuity, the character appeared prior to the film in its 2002 novelization by R. A. Salvatore and was identified by Tim Veekhoven through StarWars.com's Hyperspace feature What's The Story? in an entry written in 2007. Veekhoven named Agolerga after Manuel Aringarosa, a character from Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
