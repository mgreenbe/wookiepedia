There was no known antidote for the venom of the Kodashi viper, and those who were subjected to its effects cried out in absolute agony before they died. The Nightsisters of the planet Dathomir made use of Kodashi vipers to attack several members of the Broken Columns Clan of male Dathomiri warriors.
