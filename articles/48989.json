Sweeg was the captain of the starship Darkfire, and was regarded by Sosakar, the narrator, as a dangerous spacer who ruled by force rather than affection, earning him little love from his crew. Sweeg, deeply in debt with repossession agents tailing him, decided to recoup his wealth by capturing the legendary space slug Grendel, whose million-plus kilogram body would be worth a fortune at the going rate of a thousand credits per kilo. His crew abandoned him, realizing that they'd be facing the treacherous Borkeen Belt where Grendel lived for nothing if Grendel was only a legend, or facing the monstrous ship-eating space slug itself if the legend was true. Nonetheless, Sweeg pressed on, with the na\u00efve and debt-ridden Sosakar signed on as crew."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The work Flandon Sweeg appeared in bears strong similarities with the 1851 novel Moby Dick, authored by Herman Melville. Such similarities includes the formatting of the first line and the narrative of the protagonist who has joined a crew upon a quest led by a captain of questionable morals after a sizable limbless, ship-destroying creature colored white."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
