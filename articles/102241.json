Four Overseers controlled the guild at any given time so that the leaders' individual interests would counteract each other, and each Overseer was to remain anonymous for his or her own protection. One of the more notable Overseers was Hulas, who may have attempted to eliminate his three peers and take sole control of the GenoHaradan in 3956 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
