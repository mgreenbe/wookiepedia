Members of the army wore gray uniforms, and were likely a branch of the Republic Judicial Forces. Though many Jedi helped the army, it was led by regular military officers. Members of the Republican Army were sent to deal with Governor Vrox of Mandalore when it was discovered that he had sent small but potent Mandalorian forces to attack neighboring star systems as well as that he was possibly producing illegal war droids. The Republic forces managed to restore order to the planet by capturing Vrox and very nearly wiping out the Mandalorian forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
