Near to the end of the Mandalorian Wars, Lern and many of his followers left the planet, to participate in the Battle of Malachor V. The Mandalorians were defeated during the battle and Lern and his followers returned to Unity, to find that, in their absence, the base had been stripped by some other Mandalorians.
