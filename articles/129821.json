Because of these attributes, the pod had a loud, unique, fast-paced, high-pitched engine rumble. The estimated maximum speed is 829 km/h and had a maximum altitude of 85 meters. Because of the caustic nature of the tradium pumping through it, the Split-X was prone to spontaneous combustion. Requiring constant maintenance which entailed an entire tear down and rebuild, the Split-X was temperamental and fragile."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
