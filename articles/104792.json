He became one of the most successful crew crew leaders on the professional swoop racing circuit, and was on Tatooine when his success caught up with him and a group of rival crews waylaid Pg'lax and his team, sabotaging their starship and stranding them on Tatooine. A brief career as a mechanic at the Mos Espa Grand Arena was followed by another attempt to destroy his career, and Pg'lax fled to Mos Eisley. There, where he discovered his niche as a starship servicer, and he eventually was able to earn enough credits to start the Quick Pit operation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
