During the Clone Wars, CC-1119 received training from the ARC trooper Alpha-17, where he was given the name \"Appo.\" Around 21 BBY, Appo, who was a clone sergeant at the time, was part of a Republic battle group that was sent to the Confederate planet Umbara. In the war's final year, Commander Appo led the 501st Legion in a Republic attack on the Jedi Temple. He served under Darth Vader during the Temple attack and later, when the Republic transformed into the Galactic Empire.

The chase took him from Murkhana to the Jedi Temple to Alderaan, where the path of the fugitive Jedi intersected that of Senator Fang Zar\u2014a wanted man by the Empire\u2014and at last to Kashyyyk.

A special operations trooper, CC-1119 participated in a training program during the war run by fellow clone Alpha-17, who stressed the importance of improvisational thinking and individuality. It was this emphasis on individualism that led to Alpha-17 bestowing names upon the graduates of his program; CC-1119 received the name \"Appo.\" Around the second year of the war, Appo was a clone sergeant that served in the Grand Army's 501st Legion. Around that time, Appo was part of a Republic battle group that was dispatched to the Confederate planet Umbara, a world that was once aligned with the Republic. After the initial attack on the stationed Umbaran Soldiers of the Umbaran militia, the 501st's commanding officer on the world, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, was relieved of his duties after the arrival of another Jedi, General Pong Krell, a Besalisk, who took over the command of the 501st Legion as an interim."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under Krell's command, Appo stood by the Jedi General on the top of a cliff, while the other clone squads, led by Clone Captain CT-7567\u2014nicknamed \"Rex\"\u2014engaged the Umbarans in combat. After receiving the order of forming clone trooper platoons from Krell, Appo obeyed the order and organized a number of clone platoons that consisted of clone troopers and AT-RT-mounted troops. As Rex and his men were taking causalities while battling six-legged Umbaran mobile heavy cannons, Appo informed Krell that his task of forming the platoons was complete. The Clone Sergeant also wanted to send the troops to aid Rex on the battlefield, although Krell dismissed Appo, by stating he would give out the order of deploying the soldiers. When Rex contacted Krell via hologram, Appo held the hologram's transmitting device in his hand while the Besalisk Jedi talked to the Clone Captain. Rex informed the General that he formulated a plan to infiltrate a nearby Umbaran airbase: he dispatched two troopers\u2014Hardcase and Fives\u2014who would enter the base undetected and board separate Umbaran starfighters. The use of the starfighters would help them take out the attacking six-legged mobile cannons. Though Krell did not support the idea, Rex, nevertheless, carried out his plan. As Hardcase and Fives left to infiltrate the airbase, Rex and the rest of his team stayed behind to continue their battle against the mobile cannons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the cliff, both Appo and Krell witnessed the destruction of the mobile cannons after Hardcase and Fives arrived aboard two separate Umbaran starfighters. Noticing the airbase's defensive systems were down, Krell ordered Appo to mobilize his troops and attack the airbase. Appo's men took over the airbase, which forced the remaining Umbaran troops stationed there to surrender. With the airbase captured, Krell and the rest of the 501st Legion troops fortified themselves in the base. After the Republic battle group learned of a Confederate supply ship in orbit over Umbara, Fives wanted to use the Umbaran starfighters to board the ship and destroy it. Krell, however, ordered the clones to disregard any use of the starfighters, but Fives, with troopers Jesse and Hardcase, disobeyed the order. After Hardcase sacrificed himself by staying behind to destroy the supply ship, Fives and Jesse returned to the airbase on Umbara. After learning of the clones' actions, Krell told Appo to bring Fives and Jesse to him in the airbase's central command tower. Appo relayed the order to Fives and Jesse and the clones met with Krell in the tower. Krell informed the two clones that because they disobeyed a direct order, they would be imprisoned for their actions and be sent to the Grand Army's court-martial."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though they were imprisoned and were ready to be sent to the court-martial, Krell changed his mind, due to the court-martial's lengthy trail time. Instead, Krell decided to execute Fives and Jesse for their crimes. Rex, with Appo, was ordered to take the two clones outside so they could be executed by a firing squad. As Appo stood by the handcuffed Fives and Jesse, the firing squad prepared to shoot the two clones, although their concentration was cut off after Fives pleaded for them to rethink. Trooper Dogma, however, did not care for Fives' words and ordered the firing squad to fire on Fives and Jesse. Fives' words affected them, however, which caused them to misfire. Rex ordered Appo and another clone to take off Fives and Jesse's binders. However, on Krell's orders, the two clones were taken back to the airbase's prison, while Rex's men regrouped to mobilize. Their mission was to attack Umbaran soldiers that disguised themselves as clones. Although Rex and his men believed the Umbarans were dressed in clone armor at first, the troops were soon to be revealed as clone troopers from General Obi-Wan Kenobi's group."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A dying trooper from Kenobi's unit told Rex that Krell had given them the order to hunt down Umbaran troopers that disguised themselves in clone armor. With Krell's betrayal revealed, Rex returned to Fives and Jesse to release them from the airbase's prison. Appo joined Rex and the clone troopers that went to the airbase's central tower to arrest Krell for treason. The Besalisk, however, avoided capture by attacking the clone troopers. After battling the clones in the jungles of Umbara near the airbase, Krell was knocked unconscious by trooper CT-5385, nicknamed \"Tup,\" and was taken to the airbase's prison. There, Krell revealed to Rex, Dogma, and the other troopers present that he was a Confederate sympathizer, wanting to become Count Dooku's apprentice. Dogma, however, did not hesitate to kill Krell, who shot the Besalisk in the back with a blaster. With Krell dead, Appo and the rest of the 501st Legion troops regrouped outside the prison. The Republic won the battle."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Order 66"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the final year of the Clone Wars, Appo became a clone trooper commander and the leader of the 501st Legion. In that same year, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine declared the Jedi Order enemies of the Republic and issued Order 66, a contingency order for the Republic's Grand Army. Appo led the 501st Legion against the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant, serving alongside the Chancellor's new apprentice Darth Vader, formerly Anakin Skywalker. Appo and his soldiers killed a number of Jedi that night. When Senator Bail Organa came to the Temple to investigate what had happened, Appo and several troopers met him on one of the Temple's landing platforms. Appo informed Organa that there had been a rebellion, but when Organa tried to enter the Temple, he drew his blaster upon the Senator and ordered him to leave. As Organa turned to go, a Padawan, Zett Jukassa, rushed onto the pad and began slashing at troopers with his lightsaber. Appo ordered his troops to open fire on Jukassa, only to be cut down by the Padawan. His fellow soldier Sergeant Fox killed Jukassa, but allowed Organa to escape. Jukassa's attack seriously wounded Appo, but he survived and recovered, later filing a report on the death of Jukassa and a number of other Jedi killed in the Temple."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "In the Empire's service"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the execution of the Jedi Order, Chancellor Palpatine reorganized the Republic into the Galactic Empire.

Approximately a month after the declaration of the Empire, Vader received word from spies that his former master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, was on Kessel; against the orders of now-Emperor Palpatine, he set off for that world. Unbeknownst to Vader, Palpatine dispatched Appo and Commander Bow to follow. This was fortunate for Vader\u2014the intelligence about Kenobi had been bait for a trap laid by Jedi Master Shadday Potkin, and a group of Jedi waited on Kessel to kill him. Though Vader was able to slay several of them, including Potkin, the last three Jedi survivors\u2014Tsui Choi, Roblio Dart\u00e9, and Jastus Farr\u2014combined their powers against Vader. Before they could kill him, Appo and Bow arrived and opened fire on the Jedi.

Working with Clone Commander Vill, Appo oversaw the removal of forces from the world. Shortly thereafter, Palpatine ordered the Exactor to Murkhana, following reports of surviving Jedi on that world. A squad of clone commandos had refused to obey Order 66 and allowed their Jedi Generals to escape, and Appo and his stormtroopers accompanied Vader down to the planet's surface to deal with the situation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Commander Salvo, the leader of the Imperial forces on the world, greeted Vader upon his arrival in front of a crowd of Separatist prisoners, then presented him with the bodies and lightsabers of three Jedi who the clones had killed. Vader passed the lightsabers onto Appo, then queried Salvo as to the location of the other three Jedi that had been assigned to Murkhana. Salvo informed him that they had escaped and brought forth the commando squad that had been responsible for letting them live, Ion Team. When Vader drew his own lightsaber and prepared to execute them, Ion Team opened fire; Vader killed two of the clones, and the other two fled into the forest. The Dark Lord ordered Appo to pursue and bring them back alive. It was not long before the traitorous clones were apprehended; upon the return of Appo's men, Vader had Salvo load the Separatist prisoners onto a transport for transfer to an Imperial prison. While processing them, Appo noticed a discrepancy in the prisoner count and realized that two Jedi had escaped after disguising themselves as Separatists and hiding within the group. Vader decided to deal with the problem himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Appo was unable to find any sign of the two Jedi, Roan Shryne and Olee Starstone, but he did locate Cash Garrulan, a Twi'lek crime lord with former ties to Shryne. Vader, Appo, and his troopers stormed Garrulan's offices, and Vader was able to catch the escaping crime lord. Garrulan attempted to play dumb, but eventually admitted that Shryne had contacted him; however, he stated that he had refused to help and had turned Shryne's name over to the local garrison. Appo verified his claim. Garrulan then suggested Vader look for a Koorivar named Bioto, who he implied might smuggle out the Jedi in his ship, the Dead Ringer. Appo reported that the Ringer had taken flight, and Vader ordered him to have the Exactor intercept the ship; the two then returned to the Star Destroyer. As Vader interrogated Bioto, Appo learned that two humans had been found in one of the Ringer's smuggling compartments. Vader and Appo questioned them, learning they had been hired by Garrulan as a distraction. What they were being distracted from became obvious as Appo learned that a CloakShape fighter was launching from Murkhana and would pass through the space the Exactor had occupied before it had moved to intercept the Ringer. Vader prepared to go after the CloakShape in his own personal starfighter and had Appo select his wingmen. He ordered the commander to destroy Garrulan's ship when the crime lord attempted to flee Murkhana. Vader was unsuccessful in his mission, though, and the fugitive Jedi escaped to hyperspace in the CloakShape. Garrulan was killed shortly thereafter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Appo returned with Vader to Coruscant, later accompanying him when Palpatine sent Vader to the Jedi Temple in search of Sith holocrons. Armand Isard and a crew of technicians came too, on their own mission, only to detect that Shryne was accessing Temple records from a remote site. One of Isard's technicians traced it to a moon of Jaguada, and Appo relayed information on the location to Vader, including the fact that an Imperial garrison was present on Jaguada. Vader had Appo order the garrison commander to pursue Shryne and his cohorts. The Jedi escaped nonetheless; Appo had the garrison find all possible hyperspace vectors for their ship, but they were unsuccessful in catching it."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Alderaan and death"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the year, Vader and Appo's search would not be thwarted for long, though. Former Senator Fang Zar of Sern Prime, who had opposed Palpatine's rise to power, had thwarted Imperial orders to remain on Coruscant and fled the planet, finding refuge with Bail Organa on the planet Alderaan. When Palpatine learned that Zar had been in contact with a crime lord on Murkhana to arrange for passage off Alderaan, he concluded that Zar's escape plan was tied to Vader's Jedi fugitives and sent Vader to deal with Zar. Appo and his stormtroopers accompanied Vader on his shuttle to the planet's surface and stood by as Vader ordered Organa to turn over Zar. Organa prepared to comply, but they soon learned that Zar had fled his quarters. Vader sent Appo in pursuit of the former senator and headed off on his own to find Zar, while Organa dispatched his men with the same goal. Vader reached Zar first and executed him as the senator attempted to flee."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Vader encountered Shryne on Alderaan, the Jedi escaped yet again; Palpatine soon informed Vader that Shryne and the party of Jedi survivors that he had gathered were headed for the Wookiee homeworld Kashyyyk. Some weeks later, Vader and Appo traveled to that world in the Exactor. Vader met with Moff Wilhuff Tarkin aboard Tarkin's ship Executrix; there, Tarkin informed Vader that the Jedi ship had been spotted arriving on Kashyyyk, then told Vader of the plan that he and Palpatine had devised. Tarkin would use the presence of Jedi on Kashyyyk as a pretense to invade the planet and enslave the native Wookiees as enemies of the Empire. Appo and Vader supervised the initial part of the invasion from the bridge of the Exactor; the commander summoned the officers in charge of the various theaters of battle to meet with the Dark Lord, then joined them as Vader briefed the group. Once the officers were clear on their duties, Vader and Appo descended to the surface of Kashyyyk to take on the Jedi. As they landed, Vader was informed over the comm by one of the officers that the Wookiees were fleeing into the safety of Kashyyyk's forest and would soon become impossible to root out. Appo suggested that they initiate surgical orbital bombardments to flush the Wookiees out, and Vader gave the order to do so."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the shuttle touched down, Appo and his stormtroopers rushed out, Vader right behind them. A heavy firefight with the Wookiees ensued, and several of Appo's stormtroopers fell. Vader dealt with the Wookiees and waved Appo forward, only to have several of the Jedi fugitives step out and meet them in combat, some engaging Vader and some Appo. As Vader killed those attacking him, the Jedi fighting Appo withdrew and set their sights on the Dark Lord, only to be slain in turn. At last only Olee Starstone remained, and Vader ordered Appo and his men to leave her to him and deal with the last few surviving Wookiees. A new ship arrived next to the stormtroopers, though, with Roan Shryne on board. Shryne used the Force to pull one of the fallen Jedi's lightsabers to him, and with it he decapitated Appo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "501st Commander Bow filed the report on Appo's death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During CC-1119's training under Alpha-17, the Commander developed his sense of individuality, learning how to apply it to combat situations.

During the Clone Wars, Appo demonstrated this on Umbara, where he obeyed orders given to him by his commanding officer, Krell. After the Republic transformed into the Empire, Appo was concerned that his role would be downgraded to law enforcement and was grateful to be assigned actual missions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his service to the Empire, Appo had an easy relationship with his superior Darth Vader. Though the black armor that Vader covered himself in often inspired fear in others, to Appo it was only natural that Vader should protect himself from harm.

Vader kept Appo at his side much of the time, sometimes asking for the Commander's analysis of military matters.

Revenge of the Sith includes a number of clone troopers who meet with Bail Organa on the landing platform of the Jedi Temple. The script identifies the trooper who speaks with Organa and raises his gun as a \"Clone Sergeant\", with Appo stated to be a separate trooper who says \"Take care of him.\" The novelization of the movie agrees with this version, establishing both a clone sergeant who speaks with Organa and an unnamed commander who says Appo's lines. However, an official poster of Appo given out at Comic-Con in 2006 identifies him as the clone who speaks with Organa\u2014the \"clone sergeant\" character.

While the movie, as mentioned above, does not make clear which trooper is Appo, the clone who confronts Organa is amongst those injured by Jukassa.
