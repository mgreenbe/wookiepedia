From Frego, Crote allowed Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi to take the ship to Coruscant while escorting Lena Cobral there so she could testify against the Cobral family. Wary of an attack, the Jedi opted to find a different means of passage back to the capital. When the Jedi arrived on Coruscant, they learned that the Degarian II had been attacked and destroyed while en route; there were no survivors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
