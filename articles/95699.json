Betuine was responsible for the concept and layout of the Millennial Celebration Invitation produced with final execution by Dashira Dobeq in preparation for the millennial anniversary of the Galactic Republic. Due to Valorum's indecisiveness on what he wanted from the invitation, the design went through 250 revisions before the task of overseeing its design was delegated to Senator Sheev Palpatine. Ultimately, the invitation was never distributed as the Republic was reformed into the Galactic Empire before reaching the anniversary."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Naveela Betuine was first mentioned in Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released on October 25, 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
