It was used by Jos Vondar, the chief medical officer of Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 7 when there was explosion on the MedStar-class frigate, where Tolk le Trene, the woman he was in love with, was currently stationed. He also used it later when thinking of the planet Drongar. Den Dhur, a Sullustan journalist, used the word upon realizing grimly that Teedle, a waitress droid and a friend of his, had donated an essential component of hers to repair the shield generator around the base, saving the lives of all the inhabitants."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The DS-1 Orbital Battle Station (0 BBY\u20140 ABY)"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was used aboard imperial prisoner transport GLTB-3181 by an unidentified Bakuran, expressing that he did not know \"whatever the kark\" the Empire was creating with very large orders of components he'd heard about. Later, in the NCO cantina of the Star Destroyer Steel Talon, the term was used by Olzal Erne expressing incredulity when he was beaten by Tenn Graneet. In the burned out Soft Heart Cantina on the DS-1 Orbital Battle Station, otherwise known as the Death Star, Memah Roothes used the term as a curse, realizing that her cantina had been the target of arson for an insurance payout. Kornell Divini used the term while thinking of the Clone Wars aboard the Death Star. Nova Stihl said it, meaning \"forget it,\" when he was wondering who could have escaped from Detention Block AA on Deck 5. He concluded that he'd know them when he saw them. Villian Dance, a former TIE Fighter pilot, thought \"What the kark\" when an order suddenly came down to stop their practice drills and set their ships' guns to combat mode. His squadron, as well as others were sent to destroy the Lucrehulk-class battleship Fortressa, a part of the Alliance to Restore the Republic's fleet. Celot Ratua Dil, a smuggler, used this term when the Empire tested the Death Star's superlaser on his old home of Despayre. Stihl once again used the term when a group of prisoners escaped from Detention Block AA 23. He, once again, had no idea who to look for or what to expect, so he resigned himself to the assumption that he'd know them when he saw them. Just after the Death Star was destroyed by Luke Skywalker, Dance used the term again, after he defected to the Alliance following the Destruction of Alderaan, while trying to stabilize an ambulance that was caught in the shockwave of the battle station's explosion."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Federation of Free Alliances (40 ABY)"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was still in use during the time of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, a galactic government, and the Second Galactic Civil War. Jaina Solo used the term \"karking\" to describe the shields raised to keep starfighter squadrons restrained during the Battle of Tralus. During the same battle, her mother, Leia Organa Solo, used the same term telling Wedge Antilles that it would be a \"karking shame\" if his own daughter, Syal Antilles shot him down as they were fighting on opposite sides. Later that year, Alema Rar encountered Tiz, a member of the Galactic Alliance Guard, while she was having an intimate moment with her fellow trooper, the latter of which yelled this term at the Twi'lek when the pair noticed her. In the following year, Han Solo, the father of Jaina, used the term suggesting to the people around him that they \"get the kark\" off Uroro Station before the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances Super-class Star Destroyer Megador destroyed it."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "After the Sith-Imperial War (130 ABY\u2014137 ABY)"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "130 years after the Death Star I was destroyed, the term was still in use. Cade Skywalker, a Human Padawan, used it to describe enemy Imperial pilots flying Predator-class fighters in the aftermath of the Massacre at Ossus. It was later used twice during the Skirmish on Vendaxa, first as a derogatory standalone word by Deliah Blue and second, again, by the same Skywalker, uttering the phrase \"kark it\" when Deliah urged him to cut their losses and flee the fight. Vax Potorr, during the Battle of Borosk, exclaimed \"kark me\" upon stepping on a mine while distracted by gun emplacements before it exploded, killing him. Cade, while having a vision in the Jedi Academy on the planet Ossus, said this phrase in defiance to his ancestor, Anakin Skywalker, appearing to him as his Sith Lord identity, Darth Vader, when the latter began lecturing him about his destiny. After his vision subsided, Skywalker then said \"karking\" to Jedi Master K'Kruhk while the Whiphid, whom he assumed was a vision brought on by having just used death sticks, was healing him of a stab wound he received from his visionary duel with Vader as well as toxins from death sticks he had just taken. Two weeks later, he used the variation \"karking\" to describe the job of taking care of and defending Jedi artifacts at the temple as slavery. He then again used the term during a fight with his former Master, Wolf Sazen, saying that he sounded just like Kol Skywalker, his father, when the Zabrak told him that \"we take what we are given,\" something Kol told Cade just before he died in the Massacre at Ossus. A member of Skull Squadron used the term after they lost track of the Mynock, Cade Skywalker's ship, in the Undercity of Coruscant. Skywalker, in turn, later used the word while fighting Darth Talon in the Sith Temple, complaining to her that, after he faked his death at Ossus, he was outside of the struggle between the Sith and the scattered Jedi but everyone was trying to pull him back into it. Skywalker, after being captured and tortured in the temple after the duel, called Darth Krayt a \"karking sleemo when he infected Blue and his other friend, Jariah Syn, with Yorik-Kul seeds in an attempt to force Cade to use his special healing Force abilities and save them. He succeeded and three days later, Syn described Skywalker to Blue as \"the karking reason we almost died\" as the Sith did not care about them as bounty hunters until it was revealed that Skywalker was a former Jedi. Weeks later, after Skywalker became Talon's Sith apprentice in exchange for his friends' freedom that day, Krayt wanted him to kill Hosk Trey'lis, a Bothan Jedi Master that Skywalker had given over to the Sith several weeks earlier. Skywalker declined and Krayt killed Trey'lis himself, Cade then called the Dark Lord a \"karking Sith murglak.\" In the ensuing skrmish between Skywalker and Darth Krayt, who fought alongside his hands Darth Talon and Darth Nihl. Talon became the first casualty when Skywalker stabbed her through the abdomen, uttering the word \"karkin'\" to her before she fell. Just afterwards, while fighting Nihl with Krayt egging Skywalker towards killing the Sith Lord who killed his father, he told Krayt to \"kark that.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Variations"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
