It used CryoBan technology adapted from the carbon-freezing process. Used as a weapon, the CryoBan grenade covered targets in its blast radius with supercooled chemicals, causing pain and temporarily trapping a person within the ice formed by the blast. The cold itself could also damage equipment such as droids, electronics, and vehicles that were not specially adapted for cold-weather use."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Models manufactured by Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc. included the WW-41 CryoBan grenade and WW-47 CryoBan grenade.
