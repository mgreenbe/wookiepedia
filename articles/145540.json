Ajax was subsequently reassigned to the 61st Mobile Infantry, but continued to wear the Thirty-Second's \"Bleeding Roughneck\" badge until his death during a raid. During Ajax's funeral, another soldier named Twitch proclaimed that he was a Bleeding Roughneck until the end for his one line eulogy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Thirty-Second Infantry was mentioned in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
