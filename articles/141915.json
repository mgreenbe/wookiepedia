At an unknown point prior to the New Republic's creation, the desert planet of Bar Neth was terraformed from an inhabitable desert."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Yuuzhan Vong War of the galaxy from 25\u201330 ABY, the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong terraformed many subject worlds to better suit them. The Yuuzhan Vong phrase was known as worldshaping, but others referred to it as Vongforming or Vongformation which was performed by Yuuzhan Vong called shapers. Coruscant, Duro, and Ossus were examples of terraformed planets.
