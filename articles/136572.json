In 32 BBY, the Federation launched a blockade of the planet in protest of the taxation of Free Trade Zones by the Galactic Republic. In preparation for their full scale invasion of the planet, Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray sent an invasion force commanded by the B1-Series battle droid OOM-9 to eliminate the Naboo's capacity for offworld communications."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "OOM-9 approached the city New Centrif first, but turned their attention to the nearby city Vis after finding it too well defended. There, the battle droids razed Vis and its transmitter with the help of reinforcements commanded by the droid EEK-176. Afterwards, the strengthened Droid Army marched on New Centrif and destroyed its transmitter. Then they turned to Parrlay, receiving more reinforcements from Gunray and destroying the final transmitter. The destruction of the communications technology was immediately noticed in Theed, Naboo's capital, where a conversation between an offworld Senator Palpatine and Queen Amidala of Naboo was halted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 32 BBY, the planet Naboo was blockaded by the Trade Federation in response to Senate Resolution BR-0371, a Galactic Senate ruling that placed a tariff on Free Trade Zones. The blockade was orchestrated by Palpatine, Naboo's senator, who was also secretly the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious. Following a failed ambush on Jedi ambassadors sent to resolve the blockade, Sidious ordered Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray to begin landing the Droid Army on the planet. Following a hostile conversation via transmission with Naboo Queen Amidala, Gunray's legal advisor Rune Haako asked if the queen suspected an attack, to which Gunray responded that he was unsure if the she did, but knew that they had to move to disrupt the Naboo's ability to report the invasion to the Galactic Republic capital planet Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To that end, Gunray delegated the responsibility of destroying three transmitters in the Naboo cities of New Centrif, Vis, and Parrlay to the OOM command battle droid OOM-9. OOM-9 landed north of New Centrif aboard a C-9979 landing craft with a force that included his personal Armored Assault Tank, eight B1-Series battle droids, four heavy beetle droids, and two Single Trooper Aerial Platforms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The subjugation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Droid Army approached New Centrif first, but OOM-9 observed that the city was too well defended and would require reinforcements to attack. He directed his battle droids to Vis, a short distance east of New Centrif. At their arrival, Gunray dispatched another force commanded by the droid EEK-176, which included three droidekas, four heavy beetle droids, and four B1 battle droids. EEK-176's forces flanked Vis from the south while OOM-9's forces entered from the west. The droids killed the Royal Naboo Security Forces there, which included four royal troopers, eight trooper recruits, a V-19 landspeeder, and two Tuskcat Troopers. Afterwards, they destroyed the rest of the city and its transmitter, and EEK-176 declared the capture of Vis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "OOM-9 marched the Droid Army towards New Centrif next, accessing it through its southern entrance rather than the more heavily defended north. They killed four royal troopers on the path before entering the city, where they eliminated five PKN-49 worker droids that gathered nova crystals, and worked as farmers there, as well as their defenders. As a a result, the vast majority of New Centrif's population, which included seventeen troopers, five tuskcat Troopers, and three V-19 landspeeders, descended on the invaders. OOM-9 kept his beetle droids in reserve while gunning down the Naboo, suffering minimal casualties. Afterwards, OOM-9 sent his droids further into the city to clear out any stragglers and used the beetle droids to burn New Centrif and its transmitter to the ground. EEK-176 again declared the results."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droids encountered and dispatched two separate groups of three Parrlayan soldiers on the road to the last transmitter. As OOM-9's army entered Parrlay. Gunray sent another landing craft to reinforce the droids from the north of the city; two heavy beetle droids, two droidekas, two energy pummels, and three Armored Assault Tanks. The combined droid forces pressed through Parrlay's defenders, which included nine royal troopers, six tuskcat troopers, four V-19 landspeeders, and two champions, a type of repulsorcraft. They eventually reached the walled area of Parrlay that contained the transmitter. A troop center was located behind the wall, from which royal troopers began emerging. OOM-9 placed his battle droids along the wall to shoot them while his beetle droids burned through the wall and destroyed the transmitter, completing the mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The destruction of the transmitters allowed the Trade Federation to continue their invasion without alerting the Galactic Republic. Gunray reported the subjugation of Parrlay to Sidious, acknowledging that it was merely the beginning of the invasion. At the time of the communications disruption, Queen Amidala of Naboo was in Theed, Naboo's capital, in a hologram meeting with Palpatine, who was offworld. Palpatine's hologram faded away, leading Royal Naboo Security Forces Captain Quarsh Panaka to speculate that the Trade Federation was jamming their communications, while Governor Sio Bibble concluded that an invasion had begun. When the Trade Federation Droid Army took Theed, Bibble chastized Gunray for interupting their communications with Palpatine while arguments were still underway in the Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Fall of Theed, the Jedi ambassadors Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi snuck into Theed to rescue Amidala, planning to make contact with the Republic and report the invasion. Panaka responded that their communications were still knocked out, leading the Jedi to decide to acquire a transport offworld. OOM-9 was credited for destroying the communications capabilities of New Centrif and Vis, of which word later reached Sidious's Sith apprentice Darth Maul."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The disruption of Naboo's communications was first depicted in a scene in the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, written and directed by George Lucas. In the 2001 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, the events concerning the disruption were depicted as a battle in the first level of the Trade Federation campaign; \"Beachhead.\" The battle's name was given in the introductory cutscene of the following level \"Behind the Lines.\" Unused audio files from the game involved an attack by the droid OOM-14 on the city Pontel, and a Naboo trooper declaring that Parrlay had to be warned of the incoming attack. The strategy guide describes several differences in the subjugation from the finished game. It depicted spaceports as the targets in each city, rather than transmitters. The guide also stated that the player would receive two droidekas when attacking Vis, while in the game the player receives three."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the original version of the game, the Naboo mounted troopers rode kaadu, which were changed to tusk cats in the 2002 expansion Clone Campaigns. The number of enemy units faced by the player in Galactic Battlegrounds changes depending on the difficulty level. In Vis, the four royal troopers and the V-19 landspeeder are only present on hard difficulty. In New Centrif, the turrets at its entrance are not present in easy difficulty, and three royal troopers and two landspeeders are added in hard difficulty. On easy mode in Parrlay, there are three less troopers, two less V-19 landspeeders, one less turret, and royal troopers do not spawn from the southern troop center. All of those units aside from the initial three troopers appear in moderate difficulty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
