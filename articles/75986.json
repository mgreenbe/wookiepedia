They had a slender thorax and abdomen, and four legs, which provided stability. In addition to these limbs, the Kibnon also had two arms, which were typically held close to their bodies. They were green in coloration, and could grow to a height of 2.8 meters, as demonstrated by the Kibnon Sinthia Pulchatt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kibnon had roughly triangular heads, with two bulbous, stalk-mounted eyes projecting from the top surface. A thin antenna grew from each side of their heads, which could point either up or down. Two small mandibles grew by their mouths. The combination of these features made the Kibnon appear exotic to many other species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Kibnon in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the Kibnon Sinthia Pulchatt operated as a spice merchant on the planet Tatooine, located in the Arkanis sector of the Outer Rim Territories. Groomed for the occupation from a young age, Pulchatt operated out of the Mos Eisley settlement, serving as a liaison between her boss and Jabba Desilijic Tiure, a local Hutt crime lord. She was a regular at Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, often looking for new spice customers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this period, another Kibnon visited Tresidiss, an Outer Rim planet notorious for its Herglic-operated gambling halls and casinos. This Kibnon was accompanied by a diminutive stalk-eyed alien. Kibnon were also among the numerous species\u2014including Wookiees, Givins, and Devaronians\u2014that Doctor Cornelius Evazan experimented on while on the planet Ando. Evazan sought to discover a way to become immortal using a mind-transference machine, but his experiments were thwarted when one of his patients attempted to assassinate him using a thermal detonator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kibnon were first described in the West End Games sourcebook Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley, published in 1993.
