In 23 BBY, a patrol ship was sent to look for a lost Nallastian freighter that had failed to return from Esseles in the Darpa sector, but instead encountered what appeared to be an ancient passenger freighter, the Sun Runner. But after sending out an orb-shaped messenger droid to report its find to Fondor authorities, the Space Patrol ship itself ended up vanishing also. The Space Patrol ship was later discovered by the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker within the pressurized hangar of a counterfeit Sun Runner, held captive by a force field generated by a tractor-beam projector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Space Patrol continued to aid the Jedi in their 23 BBY mission to Fondor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
