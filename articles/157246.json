At some point, the resistance fighter was wounded and captured by the Moff's forces and taken to a detention block for interrogation. Restrained in a strap-chair, the man met his interrogator, a Mon Calamari doctor named Akanseh. Although Akanseh abhorred causing pain in others, the Moff forced him to use his medical techniques for interrogation against his will. Rather than torturing his charges, Akanseh attempted to gain their trust and persuade them to reveal their secrets to him. The resistance fighter had his wounds treated by Akanseh while the Mon Calamari implored him to reveal the location of his fellow rebels and their plans. The resistance fighter, however, would not reveal any information to Akanseh. He knew that if he revealed the location of his compatriots, the Moff would send his soldiers to eliminate them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sarne interrupted the interrogation, flanked by two guards, claiming to be performing a surprise inspection on Akanseh's skills. Akanseh once again tried to get the resistance fighter to reveal the location of his friends, noting that he could no longer guarantee that he would be unharmed. The man again refused to betray his fellow rebels. Sarne offered a hypo-syringe to Akanseh, stating that the resistance fighter would not be as stubborn once the contents started to make his blood boil in his veins. When Akanseh visibly hesitated in administering the liquid, one of the Moff's guards produced a second hypo-syringe with the same contents. Sarne implied that if Akanseh failed to get the required information from the man, then he would have the doctor share his charge's pain, and that the concoction was vastly more potent on Mon Calamari physiology than it was on Human."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his time in Akanseh's care, the resistance fighter displayed a cocky and stubborn attitude, refusing to give away the location of his fellow resistance fighters, even when faced with the threat of torture.
