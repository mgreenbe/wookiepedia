Most Nikto had cold black obsidian eyes. These were sometimes covered by a protective membrane.

The five sub-species inhabited different geographic areas of Kintan, developing unique adaptations to suit the different environments on the planet. Only five were known to the galaxy at large; the sixth, the Numol'elrul, were a water-breathing subspecies that lived in the caverns below Glussa Island but were considered nothing more than a legend to the others, as they cut off all contact with the rest of their species around 5000 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The varying appearance of the Nikto sub-species caused confusion amongst those who were unfamiliar with the Nikto, but all Nikto had certain similarities; leathery skin, sometimes covered with spikes or horns, as well as eyes that included a protective membrane to shield against Kintan's harsh environment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mutation caused by the planet's radiation atmosphere were triggered in the race that resulted in five different subspecies that were each adapted to a specific environmental niche. These five reptilian species all displayed unique cosmetic features. While each subspecies of the Nikto was physically distinct and originated from different parts of Kintan, Nikto from different subspecies could easily interbreed. 93% of the offspring from such unions ended up with the characteristics of only one parent's race, with the rest combining the traits of two subspecies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nikto are known be particularly susceptible to the mind trick."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Kajain'sa'Nikto"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The most common subspecies, the Kajain'sa'Nikto or \"Red Nikto\", adapted to survive in the Wannschok, or \"Endless Wastes\", a desert region on Kintan. They had a series of forehead ridges and small facial horns surrounding their eyes and on the chin. Their noses were covered with a movable flap of skin and a semi-permeable membrane which allowed the Nikto to breathe without ingesting sand and grit. The Kajain'sa'Nikto also had a pair of breathing tubes on each side of the neck with openings covered by similar membranes. These membranes also trapped exhaled water vapor and sent it back into their system.

Many millennia ago, a massive amount of radiation was hurled from the dying star that reached the blue-green world. This radiation impacted the biosphere and affected the indigenous inhabitants. Many native inhabitants died as a result whilst the survivors were horribly mutated into fearsome monsters that rivalled the Rancors of Dathomir or the warbeasts of Onderon. Over thousands of years, the mutation led to the rise of animals such as spine dragons, gigantic gray-eyed tuskbeasts, and the immense horned trogwhale. It was in this environment that a diminutive hairless reptile race evolved into intelligence that eventually became known as Nikto. Under constant threat from predators, the Nikto people were strengthened and unified in order to survive. Their civilization emerged from the watch camps that had been built to warn of tuskbeast attacks. In addition, the predators forced the Nikto to take up arms which in turn led to the evolution of tools as their civilization developed. Being a hearty people, they survived on Kintan despite the odds and conquered their environment where they placed themselves at the top of the food chain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following standard cultural paradigms, Nikto society developed technology and eventually discovered atomic level technology. Their civilization at this point consisted of many isolated city-states that were all walled to keep the wildlife out. By this point, many of Kintan's forests and swamps had been burnt down to force the more dangerous creatures into extinction. Thus, the Nikto destroyed their own world's biosphere to preserve themselves that transformed it into a barren wasteland. In this time, numerous devastating planetary conflicts erupted on their home planet. During this time, the Nikto became more involved in astronomy as their technological base advanced. After the fourth planetary war, the Nikto discovered the M'dweeshu Nova and determined that it was the source of the numerous monstrous beasts that emerged on their world. The discovery of the star's effects led to news of its effects quickly spreading around their war-torn planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In circa 26,000 BBY, the ancient Nikto astronomers discovered the M'dweshuu Nova star. After learning of it, a strange and bizarre faith was a formed known as the Cult of M'dweshuu. None truly knew how the cult was formed or what its initial interests were at the time. However, they quickly spread throughout Kintan where it rose in power and number with terror spreading throughout the planet as a result of their actions. This religious movement worshipped the Mdweshuu star and offered blood sacrifices that they believed appeased the spirit of the celestial body. They also began to \"purify\" those that they believed were not worthy descendants of M'dweshuu. This saw thousands of Nikto slain for not subscribing to the beliefs of the Cult during a bloody inquisition. As the Cult of M'dweshuu dominated their culture, many joined their ranks whilst many more hid in fear and even more paid the price for not being deemed \"pure\". The Cult of M'dweshuu became the rulers of Kintan and controlled the planet for thirty years."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Allegiance to the Hutts"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After thirty years, Kintan remained under the rule of the Cult until a new interstellar development rocked Nikto civilization. During this time, the Hutts were expanding into the Si'Klaata Cluster in the Pre-Republic era which became a point of contention in the conflict with Warlord Xim's empire. The expansion of Hutt Space would bring about the end of the short lived reign of the Cult of M'dweeshu when the Nikto were discovered in 25,130 BBY. By this point, the Hutts had long recruited the Klatooinians and Vodrans. Unlike the other two species, the Nikto proved to be much more technologically advanced, and that made them a challenge for the Hutts. Hutt merchants visited Kintan and intended to seek control of the star system in order to secure a strategic advantage over competitors. Upon visiting Kintan, the Hutts desired in taking the planet for themselves and witnessed the Cult in action."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The envoys from the Hutts was led by Churabba the Hutt who had a cunning business being. Upon \"her\" arrival in the Kintan system, she came to realize that the Cult of M'dweeshu held a stranglehold over the planet and that the Nikto feared them. Legends spoke of \"her\" respecting the Cult but recognizing them as being fierce and unpredictable. Churabba also saw that many of the Cult's \"loyal followers\" were a disgruntled people and thus ripe for a rebellion. Thus, instead of finagling or bargaining with the Nikto, Churabba decided to destroy the cultist's seat of power from orbit and had no regrets in doing the act. Not only did this act show the Hutt's power but demonstrated that the Cult was not infallible to common Nikto. Many of the cultists were killed when their stronghold was destroyed and earnt the gratitude of the Nikto who saw the Hutts along with Charubba as saviors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following their control of Kintan, the Hutts had no qualms with forcing the powerful Nikto into servitude. The grateful Nikto almost immediately joined in a pact with the other two servant races of the Hutts. Thus, by circa 25,100 BBY, the Nikto alongside the Klatoonians and Vodrans were bound into permanent servitude to the Hutts following the signing of the Treaty of Vontor. Kossak Inijic Ar'durv was known to had worked to lure the Nikto into Hutt service so that they would tip the balance in the eventual Battle of Vontor. They would serve their Hutt masters in the Third Battle of Vontor where Nikto warriors fought alongside conscripts from the Vodrans and Weequay races. In the ground battle, Xim's warbots and janissaries were overwhelmed by the berserker Nikto, Klatoonian and Vodrans that were being led by Boonta Hestilic Shad'ruu. These hordes of fighters battled against Xim's war-robots where Xim would be utterly vanquished as a result. Legends would be spoken of how the Nikto aided in the defeat of Xim at Vontor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hutts later used the Nikto to maintain their hold over Hutt Space and eventually build a powerful criminal empire within the Old Republic.

In this time, they began to question the value the Hutts had on their lives and began to believe that they were having less and less say on their own affairs. They noted that millions had died protecting the interests of the Hutts leading to general discontentment. Looking into their own past, the Nikto learnt that the Cult of M'dweeshu had opposed the Hutts during distant times. This led to a new period where many Nikto embraced the ideals of the Cult in the hopes of gaining freedom that led to a re-emergence in the Cult of M'dweeshu. Rapid popularity in the Cult led it to overthrowing the minimal Hutt presence on Kintan. In response, the Hutts dispatched their armies of mercenaries to retake control. At this time, the Great Sith War was being waged in the galaxy that prevented the Republic from being involved in the conflict as they were already mired in their own war. The control for Kintan, fought over a millennia ago, saw the Hutts forced off the Nikto homeworld and led to a series of blood mercenary strikes. After a short time, the Hutts regained control of Kintan though the struggle had left almost a third of the planetary population dead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Jedi Civil War, the rank-and-file membership of the Black Vulkars swoop gang on Taris was composed largely of Kadas'sa'Nikto.

During the Cold War, groups such as the Kintan Kings consisted of Nikto who operated against the Republic. On Taris, a group of Nikto settlers were targeted by the Sith Empire's Mandalorian allies for extermination.

This led to a warning being issued by the Bureau of Ships and Services for travelers in the region due to the death of numerous beings as part of occult mutilations. As a result, local businesses and planetary governments issued open bounties on free Nikto in the Periphery with rewards ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 credits for Nikto; either dead or alive.
