Derriphan could feed off any creature, but preferred Force-sensitives. The Devouring was a three-stage process. The first stage was known as Probing; the Derriphan selected a victim and sought to enter the body. Once successful, the Derriphan moved onto the next stage of the Devouring, known as Hosting. During this stage, the Derriphan sought to suppress its victim's consciousness and take control. With the victim under its full control, the Derriphan moved on to the Feeding stage. The creature slowly drained its victim of their thoughts and experiences, eventually leaving their target as an empty husk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
