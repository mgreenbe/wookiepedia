Filoni said that the \"coyote people\" look of the Zygerrian species, which made their canon debut in the arc, had originally been developed for a \"trickster\" character, the false Jedi, in an as-of-yet unreleased story written by Filoni which would show how Ahsoka Tano was found by the Jedi Order. The false Jedi was later mentioned in the novel Ahsoka, written by E. K. Johnston and released on October 11, 2016."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Months before Ahsoka's release, sketches of the false Jedi\u2014named Latrans\u2014were shown at Celebration Europe in 2016, during the Ahsoka's Untold Tales Panel held on July 15. The first part of the panel showcased sketches by Dave Filoni for the story he had written of Tano's discovery by the Jedi. The story would see an alien female Jedi, Latrans, come to Tano's town on her homeworld Shili to take the child back to the Jedi Order. In truth, however, Latrans would be revealed to be a bounty hunter posing as a Jedi Knight in an attempt to kidnap Tano. A true Jedi, Master Plo Koon, would soon arrive and take Tano back to the Jedi Temple to be trained. A small portion of this story, showing Koon with Tano on Shili, was seen in the opening \"newsreel\" of \"The Gathering\", a Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode that aired on November 3, 2012."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The story, Filoni said, would show that you should not \"judge a book by its cover\" and \"the way someone looks can deceive you\", as the beautiful look of Latrans, the story's villain, would stand in stark contrast to the more \"creepy\" and \"sinister\" appearance of the Kel Dor Plo Koon, the story's hero."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Filoni presumed that, due to the rarity of Force-sensitives in the galaxy, they were highly sought after and some may have attempted to kidnap them. The residents of Tano's town, having never met a Jedi before, would have been none the wiser to Latrans' ruse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first of the three Latrans sketches showcased during the panel showed her wearing Jedi robes. The second was concepts of her bounty hunting outfit, and the third gave a closer look at her hair. At the panel, Filoni also restated that Latrans' design went on to inspire the Zygerrians' design in The Clone Wars. He said that, while Zygerrian queen Miraj Scintel had a \"rat-like\" look, he wanted Latrans' appearance to more resemble a \"coyote person\", as she would be a trickster, deceiving the people of Shili into believing she was a Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
