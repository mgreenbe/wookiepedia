Over the centuries the Temple expanded to completely cover the mountain, eventually establishing the Spires of the four Jedi Councils. At the base of each spire was built a small entry hall that allowed rooftop access to the tower and the rest of the Temple complex. The Tower atria stood for several years until the Temple was destroyed by the resurgent Sith Empire during the Sacking of Coruscant in 3653 BBY. Over the next millennia the Galactic Republic Senate eventually raised enough funds to rebuild the Temple, with the Council Spires being rebuilt as of 1000 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next several decades, the Tower atrium would stand, welcoming many foreign diplomats to meet with the Jedi Councils and conduct business with the Order. In 33 BBY while many members of the Jedi High Council were conducting separate missions in the Yinchorri system, a band of Yinchorri rebels were hired by Darth Sidious, Dark Lord of the Sith to attack the Jedi Temple. Using flutter-packs, the warriors landed on the Temple Ziggurat without trouble. Approaching the Atrium of the High Council Tower, the warriors attacked Jedi Knight Jude Rozess who was stationed at the entrance on guard duty. While Rozess was overcome and killed, she managed to kill the leader of the attack squad, leaving the rest of the warriors with out leadership. Inside the atrium, the surviving warriors were met with the lightsabers of Grand Master Yoda those Jedi stationed at the Temple. Disoriented and without guidance, the invaders were quickly defeated, killing only one other Jedi, Tieren Nie-Tan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the height of the Clone Wars, Sidious was discovered to be the alter-ego of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. After a failed arrest by Master Mace Windu, Sidious declared the Temple under martial law and demanded that the 501st Legion of the Grand Army of the Republic quell the \"Jedi uprising\" taking place there. Led by Darth Vader, the clone troopers eliminated all the Temple's occupants and secured the complex. During the fighting there, the Council atria sustained damage as the Jedi fought back against the might of the Republic's war machines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the months following the Temple's abandonment, ex-Jedi Padawan Ferus Olin broke into his former home for the final time in search of Darth Vader. Entering the Temple though a rooftop breakfast room, Olin made his way to the base of the High Council Tower. Confronting the Sith Lord, Olin leapt around the rubble strewn in the High Council Atrium, fleeing the chamber via the steps leading up to the High Council Chamber at the summit of the Tower."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several years after the fall of the Jedi Order and the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Spire atria were still being guarded by Shadow Troopers and Imperial Senate Sentinels. In 2 ABY, Starkiller, Darth Vader's former Sith apprentice ventured to the Temple in order to complete his training in the Jedi traditions. Entering through the grand entrance of the Tower of First Knowledge Atrium, the former assassin slaughtered all the troopers stationed in the hall, climbing across the rubble strewn floor to gain access to the Holocron Chamber opposite the entrance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The atria of the Temple would lie in abandonment for the duration of the Galactic Civil War, even standing while the Temple was briefly re-inhabited. However, when the Lusankya broke free of Coruscant's skyscraper crust, the Towers of the Temple collapsed, destroying all four atria. Over the ruins of the Temple's roof Luke Skywalker, founder of the New Jedi Order, would erect the Jedi Headquarters; though the entire complex would crumble during the Yuuzhan Vong War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Galactic Alliance recaptured the capital, Chief of State Cal Omas commissioned the construction of a new Jedi Temple as a gift to the Order for their service during the war.

At the top of a short flight of stairs, the entry area emptied into a hall lined with bronzium statues of past Jedi Masters. On either side of the hall, doors gave access to the chambers that made up the base of the Tower. Directly at the end of the hall was a bridge that spanned the chasm-like shaft at the center of the Tower. A giant statue was suspended in the shaft, forcing the bridge to encircle it to reach the platform on the other side. In the Tower of First Knowledge, the entrance to the Holocron Chamber was set on that platform. Also in the atrium was an antiquated turbolift that took its passengers to the summit of the Tower and the Council Chambers that were located there. Additionally, a stone stairwell encircled the shaft, leading from the atrium to the uppermost chambers of the Spire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The High Council Atrium was accessible through a breakfast room at the top of the Temple Ziggurat. After the abandonment of the Temple during the Great Jedi Purge, the windows of the atrium were covered with plasteel and the columns had once lined the hall had been toppled, scattered in pieces on the floor. The same could be said for the other atria as their statues and arching ceilings crumbled across the once well-polished floor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
