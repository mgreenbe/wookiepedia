The Silver Sand Consortium traded with glassblowers from the world of Naboo. However, in 21 BBY, after the Consortium raised its prices, the glassblowers objected and the Silver Sand Consortium became engaged in a trade dispute with the Artisans' Guild. The Consortium's board became so irked by the glassblowers' objections that they threatened to pass legislation banning the sale of silica to Naboo in perpetuity if any of the glassblowers can within fifty parsecs of Bonadan. In an attempt to resolve the contention, Queen Jamillia of the Naboo asked Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala to negotiate a resolution to the crisis. Jamilia hoped that if the Silver Sand Consortium's board members could be convinced to meet with Amidala to discuss the glassblowers' concerns the disagreement could be resolved."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
