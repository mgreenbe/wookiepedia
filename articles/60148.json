Upon seeing the pair he became angry after believing R2 had challenged his authority, but then grew bored when C-3PO tried to explain that the pair needed help repairing their crashed ship. Unmoved by the droids request for help, Hay-Zu ordered the droids to leave his world and had them unbound so they could go. Once free, R2 approached the ruler and made a surly comment causing C-3PO to smack him on the dome and knock him over, crushing Hay-Zu. Seeing that their ruler was dead, the Patitites cheered and chanted in joy. They then aided the droids in repairing their ship but asked C-3PO to stay as Hay-Zu's replacement.
