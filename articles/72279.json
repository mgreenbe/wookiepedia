The film's casting team put out calls to local basketball teams asking for \"taller-than-tall guys\" to do some \"extra work,\" and the six-feet-eleven-inches-tall Khazzouh responded. Although he was not a Star Wars fan, he had a very positive time on set and recalls being \"well-looked after.\" Four years later, while signing autographs, Khazzouh did not recall who George Lucas was. In the film, Khazzouh played either Lachichuk, Guanta, Grakchawwaa, or Eugroothwa. Following his role in the film, Khazzouh was sometimes referred to in the Australian media as Julian 'Wookiee' Khazzouh."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
