It contained many roleplaying articles, including a rules supplement for the West End Games Star Wars D6 system. The article was called \"What's so Bad About the Dark Side? The Ethical Dilemma of Force-Users\" and was written by Lester Smith. Like all supplements printed in Polyhedron prior to 2002, the article is considered ambiguously canon."}]}
