As Master Plo Koon's fleet patrolled the Abregado system, General Grievous' mystery weapon, the starship Malevolence, ambushed the ship with its massive mega-ion cannon, removing all the craft's defenses and making it vulnerable to the Malevolence's turbolasers. As Koon's ship was bombarded, all of its escape pods were jettisoned, including Pod 1977. Later, as the pod floated through space, it was breached by rocket battle droids from a pod hunter, killing all those inside."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This pod was named after the year 1977, when Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope was released.
