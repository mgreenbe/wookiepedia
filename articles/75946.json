Born in 92 BBY, Mundi was discovered at age four by the Jedi An'ya Kuro and became one of the few permitted by the Jedi Order to be trained starting beyond infancy. After more than two decades as a Padawan to Master Yoda, Mundi was named a Jedi Knight and returned to Cerea to liberate his home village from a gang of raiders. Assigned the Jedi Watchman of the Cerean sector, Mundi was granted a rare exception to the Jedi Order's ban on marriage due to his species' low birth rate and had a polygamous family of five wives and seven children, although he tried to avoid developing emotional attachments to them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like many Cereans of his generation, Mundi favored his homeworld's isolation from the galaxy, speaking out against off-worlder technology and encouraging Cerea to maintain their independence from the Republic. Mundi was held in high regard by members of the Jedi High Council, on which he occasionally sat in during the absence of Master Micah Giiett. He was eventually offered a permanent seat on the Council despite not yet having obtained the rank of Jedi Master. Before accepting, Mundi rescued his daughter Sylvn from the captivity of an agent of the crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, and in doing so uncovered a secret Cerean smuggling ring and illegal Trade Federation activities. Shortly after formally joining the Council in 33 BBY, Mundi was sent to seek the lost Jedi Sharad Hett on Tatooine. Following Hett's death, Mundi agreed to continue the Jedi training of his son, A'Sharad Hett."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Mundi and Hett grew close, the Cerean eventually agreed to turn his training over to Kuro after Hett felt tempted by the dark side of the Force during a lightsaber duel with bounty hunter Aurra Sing. As the Confederacy of Independent Systems uprising threatened the stability of the Republic, Mundi was among the Jedi dispatched to Geonosis in 22 BBY to confront the Separatist Droid Army, marking the beginning of the Clone Wars. Now a Jedi General commanding the Galactic Marines branch of the Grand Army of the Republic, Mundi participated in several major battles, including the battle of Hypori, where he barely survived a lightsaber duel against General Grievous. Mundi's entire family was killed during the Battle of Cerea, but the Jedi overcame his grief by further committing to his Jedi duties. He briefly assumed the Jedi training of Anakin Skywalker following Obi-Wan Kenobi's presumed death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mundi also dueled the Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress on Coruscant after exposing a spy from within the Galactic Senate working with her. Along with Kenobi and Luminara Unduli, Mundi led an assault against several Separatist battle droid foundries on Geonosis. Following the assault Mundi earned the \"everlasting respect\" of Anakin Skywalker, as Mundi killed a total of 65 droids and Geonosians during the assault. As the Clone Wars approached conclusion, Mundi suggested to the Jedi High Council that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine may have become too powerful and that the Jedi Order might need to assume control of the Republic for an interim period until a transition of power could commence. Mundi was leading the Galactic Marines to battle on Mygeeto in 19 BBY when Palpatine began the Great Jedi Purge with Order 66, resulting in Mundi being shot to death by his own clone troopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Birth and infancy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ki-Adi-Mundi, a Cerean male, was born in 92 BBY on Cerea. He was one of several children in the Mundi family but was the only boy among his siblings and one of the few males in his home village, as the birth rate for male Cereans to females was one-to-twenty. Among his siblings was an older sister, Droe. His father was a farmer and, for the first four years of his life, Mundi lived on the family farm, where his father and mother were content to raise him in a secluded lifestyle typical of Cereans, who largely shunned technology and lived in isolation from the rest of the galaxy. As a youth, Mundi was drawn to off-worlder technology, but his father warned him embracing it would come at too high a price, something that Mundi did not understand as a young child."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout his early childhood, Mundi demonstrated great skill with the Force and was able to levitate items and sense danger, although his abilities were unstable due to lack of proper training. On at least one occasion, an item Mundi lifted with the Force exploded in mid-air due to this instability. Mundi's home village was periodically attacked and pillaged by a gang of raiders led by Bin-Garda-Zon. During these raids, Zon repeatedly broke into the Mundi household, smashed their belongings and demanded financial tributes from them, which the family always paid to avoid problems. Mundi could sense Zon's approach prior to these attacks, and his family would hide Mundi in concealed floor compartment before Zon arrived because the raiders would kidnap male children due to the species' low birth rate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the family's seclusion, rumors of Mundi's abilities with the Force began to spread even outside of Cerea. In 88 BBY, when Mundi was four years old, a Jedi Knight named An'ya Kuro, better known simply as the Dark Woman, traveled to Cerea after hearing stories about the child. Although most Jedi are trained starting from infancy, she nevertheless hoped to take Mundi to Coruscant, the capital of the Galactic Republic, where the Jedi Order could test him and assign him a Master to train him in the ways of the Force. When Kuro arrived in her starship, which Mundi called the \"metal beast,\" Mundi's siblings fled at the sight of the unfamiliar technology, but Mundi stood his ground and insisted he was not afraid. When Kuro descended from the craft, Mundi immediately sensed she had come for him, even before she identified herself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once she explained her motives to his family, Mundi demonstrated his Force abilities for Kuro by levitating items and describing his sensory abilities. After Kuro announced her desire to take Mundi to Coruscant, Mundi's father asked whether he simply be taught in his home village or at the Cerean capital of Tecave City. When Kuro said this was impossible due to the commitment required by the Jedi lifestyle, Mundi's father angrily refused to allow him to leave. During this conversation, however, Mundi sensed that Zon's raiders were approaching the village and that an attack was imminent. As Mundi and his sister Droe were hidden away, Kuro volunteered to defend the village against the raiders, but Mundi's father urged against it because he believed the gang would only act more aggressively toward them later, once Kuro had departed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mundi listened as Zon smashed the door in, physically beat his father and stole several of their belongings, although they did not find Mundi himself. Once Zon and his men had departed, Mundi's father lifted him out of the hidden compartment, tearfully wished him goodbye and told Kuro she could take him to Coruscant. He believed Cerea needed a Jedi protector of their own or the attacks from raiders like Zon would never stop. An emotional Mundi promised his father he would work hard in his training, become as powerful and strong as possible, and then come back to Cerea to protect his family and defeat Zon's men."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Jedi training"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some Jedi expressed concern that, having missed four critical years of instruction, Mundi was too old to begin his training and that his childhood on Cerea would impair his judgment. Nevertheless, the Jedi Council agreed to let Mundi be trained, making him one of a very few Jedi, along with Jedi Knights Eeth Koth and Anakin Skywalker, to be accepted at such a late age prior to the New Jedi Order, and he became relatively well-known as a result of this distinction. Kuro would have liked to have taken Mundi as a Padawan herself, and sensed he had the potential to be her greatest apprentice, but the Council only entrusted her with more challenging students. Instead, Jedi Master Yoda was assigned to train Mundi. Nevertheless, Mundi often referred to Kuro as \"First Teacher\" and remained immensely grateful to her for the rest of his life. While many regarded Kuro with suspicion for her unorthodox and aggressive Jedi training techniques, Mundi regularly defended her and her methods, and refused to refer to her by the name Dark Woman as others called her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the next 21 years, Mundi learned the ways of the Force under Yoda's tutelage. Mundi traveled to many different planets as part of his Jedi training, and eventually built his own lightsaber, which had a purple blade. As Mundi got older, his ability with the Force proved strong and his ability with the lightsaber exceptional; he had no difficulty deflecting shots from multiple remotes during training sessions. However, Mundi also showed occasional signs of arrogance and willfulness during his training, which Yoda sought to counter by teaching him humility. During one session, when Mundi fought off remotes, Yoda warned him to watch his \"blind spot\" and, when Mundi insisted he had no blind spot, Yoda tripped him with his gimer stick. Like most Jedi, Mundi also occasionally experienced difficulty with his both his Force power and lightsaber training, but Yoda provided him reassurance on those occasions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout his training, Mundi had always made clear his intention to one day return to Cerea and free his family from the persecution of the criminal raiders there. Although Yoda did not sense anger or fear in his Padawan, he was concerned Mundi's motivations were based on a desire for vengeance, which could often lead to the dark side of the Force. Mundi insisted this was not the case and that he was driven by the desire for justice, not revenge. Nevertheless, Mundi admitted he hated Bin-Garda-Zon for what he had done to his family, and Yoda urged him to avoid feelings of hatred and to instead pity Zon, who Yoda said had already lost his own personal battle with the dark side. The Jedi Master also encouraged Mundi to seek out and cherish the nobility in the hearts of other living beings, and taught him the future was constantly in motion and that the truth of any given situation is not always clear until more time passes. Mundi was the last Jedi directly trained by Yoda before he retired from direct Padawan-Master training and became a staff instructor teaching Jedi Initiates at the Jedi Temple."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Return to Cerea"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After passing his Jedi Trials, Mundi was named the Jedi Watchman of the sector that included his home planet of Cerea, just as many Jedi return to the service of their birth planets. Mundi returned to Cerea in 67 BBY at age 25 with the intention of following through on his promise to protect his family from the raider gang, although Yoda again warned him not to become consumed with revenge or anger. Upon arriving home, Mundi was greeted with love and excitement from his family, who he entertained with tales of his Jedi training and experiences on other worlds. Later, his father informed him the village was still persecuted by the raiders, although Zon himself no longer participated in the raids. Although the raider base was rumored to be very dangerous, Mundi insisted he did not require any additional assistance from the villagers and would confront Zon and his men himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mundi rode an Aryx at night to Zon's camp in the hills outside the village, where he disguised himself as a drifter until reaching the inside of the camp. Upon arriving, Mundi revealed his identity and announced his intention to challenge Zon, hoping eliminating the leader would disorganize the rest of the gang and allow the local authorities to deal with the remnants. Mundi overconfidently boasted he could beat the man with both hands tied behind his back. Mundi was taken to the gang's new leader, Bin-Garda-Zon's daughter, who had previously defeated her father in combat to take control of the raiders. Treating Mundi's boast literally, she ordered her guards to tie his hands behind his back, then engaged Mundi in combat with her spear. Taken aback by how quickly his plan fell apart, and not yet strong enough in the Force to win under such circumstances, Mundi was quickly defeated and rendered unconscious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mundi later awakened tied to a wooden post inside a tent, where an older and weaker Zon threatened him with a vibroknife. Zon intended to slit Mundi's throat, then use that accomplishment to attempt to regain power from his daughter. However, Mundi used the Force to loosen the ropes binding his wrists, then subdued both Zon and the guards who responded to the commotion. Upon exiting the tent he was confronted by the gang leader, who this time said she would battle him to the death. Mundi offered her the chance to surrender, but she instead attacked. More cautious this time and no longer restrained, Mundi easily disarmed her and won the fight, although he did not kill her. Surrounded by dozens of her fellow raiders, Mundi knew he could not defeat them all based on sheer numbers, so he feigned bravado and ordered them all to disband and stop pillaging the villagers, or else they would have to face him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This threat largely worked and the gang began to dissipate except for Zon, who hurled a vibroblade at Mundi with the hopes of winning his command back. Mundi used the Force to easily push the blade aside, but left Zon alive, recognizing that leaving the former gang leader powerless and inconsequential was a fate worse than death for Zon. The victorious Mundi then returned to his family."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi Knight"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Establishing home and family"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the planet's Jedi Watchman, Mundi lived on Cerea and quickly cultivated a deep love and appreciation for his homeworld, and gained a great deal of respect among the Cerean community. Despite having been drawn to off-worlder technology in his youth, Mundi came to develop a very different perspective in his adulthood, as did many other Cereans his age. Like his father before him, Mundi now believed Cereans should take pride in their technologically-primitive culture and resist opening itself too much to outside worlds that would seek to change and modernize their planet, which he felt could lead to unexpected and disastrous consequences. As a Jedi Watchman, Mundi developed a network of contacts who provided him information about the activities on and around Cerea, including the Ortolan Ydde, who outwardly claimed to only care about the money Mundi gave him, but secretly admired the Jedi Knight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the Cerean's social customs and low birth rate for males, Mundi was granted an extremely rare exception to be allowed to marry and have children, which was usually strictly forbidden by the Jedi Order as Jedi were not allowed personal attachments. Although Mundi cared for his family, he was required by the Jedi Order not to view them as attachments, a balance that Mundi found extremely difficult. Like all Cereans, Mundi practiced polygamy due to the 1-to-20 male-to-female ratio among his species. Mundi first married Shea, his bond-wife, and later married four honor-wives, including Mawin. Shea remained Mundi's closest and most trusted wife, and he felt he could hide nothing from her, so much so that Mundi suspected she had some of the Force within her. Mundi had seven daughters with his wives, none of whom were born by Shea, which bitterly disappointed her. Mundi desperately wanted a boy, but tried to conceal his disappointment from his wives; he avoided having children with Shea because he did not believe he could hide his feelings from her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mundi and his family lived in a large house not far from Concave City. The polygamist nature of Mundi's family inevitably led to tension and arguments among his wives. The honor-wives occasionally envied Shea's status as the bond-wife and, in turn, Shea was often jealous of them because she had never bore any children. Mundi often had trouble understanding his wives' emotions and responding accordingly, which would upset them further. Among Mundi's daughters was Sylvn, who he had with Mawin. Sylvn demonstrated rebellious tendencies and anger issues as early as age six, when she regularly drew pictures of angry faces. Although this concerned Mawin, Mundi assured her it was normal youthful behavior and nothing to be worried about. Sylvn's rebellious tendencies continued into her teenage years, when she began spending time with the dissident Maj-Odo-Nomor and his swoop gang, the Techrats, but Mundi nevertheless felt she was a good girl and that her actions were not a source of concern."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Early Jedi Council service"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ki-Adi-Mundi was held in high regard by members of the Jedi High Council, and he was occasionally asked to sit in on High Council meetings and participate in their decisions in the absence of Jedi Master Micah Giiett. Yoda, already very familiar with Mundi from his training, held the Cerean in high regard, and Jedi Master Mace Windu believed he demonstrated excellent judgment and courage. Mundi sat temporarily on the Jedi Council in 44 BBY, a time of particularly high tension and increased security due to a failed assassination attempt against Yoda within the Jedi Temple. Also during this time, Obi-Wan Kenobi, then 13 years old, briefly left the Jedi Order and tutelage of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn to assist with the Melida/Daan Civil War. Mundi was present at the meeting when Kenobi appeared before the Jedi Council to apologize for his brief departure, requesting to return to the Order. Like the other Council members, Mundi expressed reluctance and disappointment with Kenobi, and said he did not believe Kenobi recognized that he had violated the trust not only of Jinn, but of the entire Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Also in 44 BBY, Mundi was present when Sha Koon, a Kel Dor Padawan and niece of Jedi Master Plo Koon, appeared before the Jedi High Council at the behest of her Ithorian Jedi Master Saldith during the Stark Hyperspace War. Sha Koon explained that her uncle had communicated with her via telepathy and asked her to approach the Council so they could speak to Plo Koon through her. When Saldith vouched for Sha Koon's credibility, the Council agreed to join their minds with her, which led them to dispatch a Jedi strike force to Troiken to assist with Plo Koon's mission there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the death of Giiett during the Yinchorri Uprising in 33 BBY, the Jedi Council was forced to consider a permanent replacement for Giiett. Although some considered Jinn for this vacancy, Windu advised against it because of Jinn's headstrong and iconoclastic personality and instead strongly supported Mundi for the position. Yoda did not object to Mundi's selection, but did not immediately voice support for it either, as he was distracted by his concerns over who was responsible for causing the Yinchorri Uprising. The possibility of Mundi joining the Jedi Council was expressed to him during this time, but before formally accepting the invitation, Mundi returned to Cerea and his duties as a Jedi Watchman so he could consider the matter."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Conflict on Cerea"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his allegiance to the Jedi Order, Mundi actively lobbied for Cerea to reject proposals to join the Republic, in doing so, encouraging his species to maintain their neutrality. In 33 BBY, Silais, a Twi'lek representative, encouraged the Council of Elders to join the Republic and called Cerea a backward world due to its lack of technology. In response to these remarks, Mundi spoke passionately in defense of the planet, calling Cerea's lack of technology as a virtue rather than a detriment. He argued giving greater power to off-worlder influences would make the planet as unpleasant and corrupt as the Outsider Citadel cities. The Elders were so moved by Mundi's speech that they rejected Silais' request without even taking the matter to a vote, which prompted the Twi'lek to view Mundi as an enemy. Shortly after this speech, a distraught Mawin informed Mundi that Sylvn had run away with Maj-Odo-Nomor, and Mundi promised to find her and bring her home. He found both Sylvn and Nomor at a Pro-Tech Movement rally, where Republic diplomat Bron was encouraging an agitated crowd of young Cereans to reject their elders advice and embrace off-worlder technology."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Emboldened by his earlier speech before the Council of Elders, Mundi attempted to sway the crowd against Bron's way of thinking, but succeeded only in antagonizing them further. Too late, Mundi realized Bron tricked him into addressing the crowd because Bron knew it would anger them and make Bron himself appear accepting of outsider opinions. Incensed by Mundi's words, Nomor encouraged the crowd to physically remove Mundi from the rally. They picked him up and began carrying him, but Mundi resisted fighting back because he felt they were only children and presented no real danger. Distracted while calling out for his daughter, Nomor grabbed Mundi's lightsaber, but accidentally activated it and killed a Cerean bystander. Nomor and Sylvn fled and the confused crowd mistakenly believed Mundi killed the bystander himself, much to Bron's delight. Although the crowd called on Mundi to be charged with murder, surveillance footage and an examination on the skin cells on Mundi's lightsaber proved that Nomor was responsible for the death. Nevertheless, Bron used the incident to spread rumors and create a sense of mistrust about Mundi and the Council of Elders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The elders allowed Mundi to go free and bring Nomor and his accomplices to justice, which they indicated included Sylvn. They did not, return Mundi's lightsaber, however, because they claimed it was required for evidence. Mundi immediately returned home, where he found four members of the Techrats gang\u2014Skeel, Kordren, Twin and Sylvn herself\u2014had broken into his house and stolen his groceries. Mundi suspected they had stolen the food because they were harboring Nomor, and he traveled via Aryx to the Outsider Citadel to find him. There he sought his source Ydde, but learned he had gone into hiding and was missing for the last two days. Ydde's wife told Mundi he had was afraid for his life after overhearing the smuggler Ephant Mon speaking to somebody else about a shipment. Believing the shipment to be related to the Swoops, Mundi found Ydde in a nearby cantina, but Ydde refused to talk to him despite offers of money and stormed off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the rumors Bron had spread about Mundi, most of the Outsider Citadel citizens distrusted Mundi. A group of alien outsiders\u2014led by a Devaronian who previously lost half of his left horn in a fight with Mundi\u2014attacked the Cerean, overconfident because he lacked a lightsaber. Mundi easily fended them off with hand-to-hand combat, but when the attackers continued to heavily outnumber him, he summoned his Aryx, who rushed into the fray and helped Mundi defeat them. Citadel security forces arrived after the scene ended, which meant Mundi had to face another inquiry before the Elders the next day. Not far away, Mundi discovered the dead body of Ydde, who had been shot to death at close range by what a Mundi determined was likely a skilled assassin. The guilt-stricken Jedi blamed himself for Ydde's death. During the inquiry the next day, Elder Nar-Somo-Dali, a friend of Mundi, insisted the search for Nomor was growing out of control and considered relieving Mundi of the duty due to his personal involvement because of his daughter. Dali refused to return Mundi's lightsaber and explained the Council was proceeding with caution because some members of the public saw the pursuit of Nomor as prosecution for his Pro-Tech beliefs, but Mundi said the Council should instead be focused on doing the right thing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After using a Jedi mind trick on a Gran prisoner with knowledge of Ephant Mon's activities, Mundi learned where the smuggler was hiding Nomor, but they were gone before Mundi arrived. He discovered a sketch of an angry face that Sylvn used to draw when she was young, and felt despair over never recognizing how troubled she was. Distracted, he nearly failed to detect an attack by FLTCH R-1, a huge mercenary droid left behind by Mon to attack the Jedi. In his haste to depart, however, Mon failed to calibrate the droid's target system, so Mundi was able to dodge it's attacks and escape. As he was fleeing, Mundi ran into a Cerean messenger sent by Nar-Somo-Dali. The Jedi directed the messenger into the sewers with him and drew FLTCH R-1's fire away from the boy, but was struck and injured by one of the droid's blasts and nearly crushed by falling debris. The messenger ran to assist him and delivered Dali's message by returning Mundi's lightsaber and explaining that Dali had taken to heart Mundi's earlier statement about doing the right thing. The now-armed Mundi disabled the approaching FLTCH R-1 with one swoop of his lightsaber, then collapsed. The messenger took the unconscious Mundi back to Dali, who placed Mundi into a bacta tank to treat his injuries. Upon learning that Mon had fled the planet with Nomor and Sylvn, Dali obtained permission from the Jedi Council to extend Mundi's jurisdiction, freeing the Jedi to pursue Nomor anywhere in the galaxy. These efforts furthered Bron's arguments that the Cerean search for Nomor was personal and unjust, as many Cereans felt the pursuit should be dropped now that he was off the planet."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Rescuing Mundi's daughter"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dali received word that Mon's ship was located in orbit around the planet Tatooine, but that it was infested with 2,000 dangerous divvik pupae ready to hatch. When communication with the ship failed, Dali freed Mundi from the bacta tank early so he could continue his pursuit right away, even though the Jedi was still not fully recovered. Silais provided Mundi with a starship and a crew of marginally-effective droid prototypes from a bankrupt manufacturer, which Silais insisted were the best he could provide on short notice. They included maintenance droid J1M, navigator B3NK, medical droid 2-ROB and pilot FLTCH R-1, who had been reprogrammed since previously attacking Mundi. After a 10-hour flight, the crew arrived at Tatooine, where it was impossible for B3NK to detect whether Sylvn was alive because the thousands of divviks aboard Mon's ship made it impossible to separate lifeforms. Mundi detected Mon's presence aboard the ship and, despite the mortal danger presented by the divviks, donned a spacesuit and boarded the craft. Aware there were too many divviks to fight single-handedly, Mundi attempted to move quickly through them and fought his way through the ship. Mundi used the Force to navigate himself to an escape pod where Mon, Sylvn, Nomor and Twin were hidden inside."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mundi offered to bring them back to his ship, but Mon instead explained the pod's electrical circuit was damaged and the outside hatch could only be opened manually from outside the pod. Mon ordered Mundi to open the hatch, which could fatally expose Mundi to the vacuum of space, or else Mon would manually eject the pod himself and kill all the occupants, including Mundi's daughter. When Nomor tried to resist Mon, the smuggler shot him to death. Mundi recognized Mon intended to follow through with this threat and agreed, but first ordered FLTCH R-1 to get a reading on both the escape pod and Mundi himself. After opening the hatch and allowing the pod to eject, Mundi leapt through the airlock door and toward his own ship, where the robot crew quickly picked him up and safely brought him aboard. Mundi pursued the escape pod into Tatooine's atmosphere, where they initially met resistance from Trade Federation ships, despite the fact that Tatooine was outside the Trade Federation's jurisdiction. Mundi used the Force to trick the pilots into abandoning their pursuit, then landed the ship on Tatooine and tracked the pod, but found it empty besides Nomor's body.

Mundi secretly ordered J1M to enter the cargo bay, where he planned to drop the droid along with non-essential material from the ship. Mundi hoped Jabba would believe unloading the cargo was an attempt by Mundi to simulate damage to his own ship, but in fact, Mundi planned to have J1M infiltrate Jabba's shuttle and download his cargo manifest. Mundi then ordered his crew to prepare for an air battle and piloted the ship toward the Hutt Citadel, where they were pursued by several atmospheric flyers. Mundi recognized they depended upon air circulation to fly, so he flew his ship close to the planet's surface to create a sandstorm, clogging their air intakes and destroying several of the ships. He then dropped his cargo, including J1M, and Jabba fell for the ruse and launched a shuttle to collect the debris. Upon arriving at the Hutt Citadel, Mundi found Sylvn and Twin surrounded by guards and chained to an ion attractor atop of a tower during an ion storm, where they were at risk of becoming electrocuted by bursts of plasma. Mundi had the robot crew take over piloting, then dropped onto the tower along with FLTCH R-1 to assist the girls.

Mundi decided not to continue pursuing Ephant Mon and instead left Tatooine and dispatched the Trade Federation information to Coruscant. After returning to Cerea, testimony from Sylvn and Twin dispelled the public's suspicions about the pursuit against Mundi and calmed the hysteria previously caused by Bron's rumors. Around this time, Mundi sensed a disturbance in the Force among the Republic, but it was too diffuse for him to determine a specific cause. Dali suggested he spend as much time with his family as possible before Jedi Order business would force him away from Cerea.

Mundi was one of seven Jedi\u2014along with Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Saesee Tiin, Yaddle, Vergere and Depa Billaba\u2014selected to investigate the attempted assassination and apprehend leaders of the Nebula Front. Following a lead, the Jedi traveled to the planet Asmeru aboard the Consular-class cruiser Prominence, accompanied by another cruiser, Ecliptic. Mundi watched from a starboard viewpoint as the Prominence navigated the minefield around the planet and listened into the Nebula Front contacting the ship and asking them to leave one of their vessels in orbit around the planet, as a sign of good faith, while the other one landed.

The survivors traveled to a high vantage point among the boulders where they watched vehicles searching for them and, when a Human from the Nebula Front approached and asked to speak peacefully to them, Mundi revealed himself to him along with Jinn and Tinn. The man said they felt the Republic was allying itself with their enemy, the Trade Federation, by hosting the upcoming Eriadu Trade Summit. While the Nebula Front said they would not attack the Jedi and other survivors, they intended to leave them stranded on Asmeru and effectively hold them hostage unless the Republic canceled the summit.

Mundi and Tiin patrolled the seats of Seswenna Hall, where the Summit was held, searching for any disturbances in the Force. The two Jedi learned that Cohl's freighter had been spotted at a nearby customs warehouse, where several custom agents were attacked and tied up by armed assailants. Mundi and the other Jedi traveled to the warehouse, where they split up on airspeeders to search for the assailants. Mundi, riding along with Vergere, helped locate the Nebula Front militants, who opened fire on the airspeeders with missile launchers from the rooftop of a building.

Kenobi suggested ordering all droids removed from the delegation, but Mundi said that could prompt the Nebula Front to trigger the droids into opening fire. Mundi suggested getting someone aboard the Trade Federation freighter to shut down the central control computer, thus disabling the droids, but there was no time. Mundi, Tiin and Kenobi took positions in front of the Trade Federation rostrum with their lightsabers ready to deflect fire from the droids. However, when the Trade Federation Directorate activated their force fields, thus ensuring no blaster shots could enter or leave their shielded area, their droids suddenly turned on them and opened fire, killing all present Directorate members as Mundi and the other Jedi looked on helplessly.

Mundi and the other Jedi were skeptical, but agreed to see the boy. Upon meeting Skywalker, Mundi sensed a danger in the child that he could not fully explain, and felt leery not of the boy himself but of what he could become in the future. The Cerean came to believe the disturbance he felt in the Force during his previous trip to Tatooine was somehow connected to Skywalker's presence on the planet.

Mundi grew extremely troubled by his failure, and the failure of the Council, to recognize that the Sith had indeed returned as Jinn foresaw. He had trouble finding peace in the months that followed, even during meditation. Under the circumstances, Mundi and the rest of the Council agreed that Skywalker would be trained as a Jedi, but Mundi secretly harbored feelings of discomfort about the boy and intended to be more watchful of him than of other Padawans.

Yoda and Eeth Koth spoke privately to Mundi about the matter in the Jedi Temple, and revealed they believes one of the Tusken leaders was Sharad Hett, a famous Jedi Knight who had gone missing 15 years earlier. Mundi knew Hett by reputation, but had falsely believed him to be dead. In light of the recent reemergence of the Sith, Yoda feared that if Hett were still alive, or whether he had succumbed to the dark side of the Force, which they felt could make him vulnerable to being recruited by the Sith. Yoda asked Mundi to seek Hett because they believed he was the only Jedi powerful enough to fight him who did not know him personally, thus Mundi would harbor no reservations if Hett had to be fought or killed. When Mundi accepted, Yoda explained he would first have to seek an audience with Jabba Desilijic Tiure to request safe passage through the desert without Jabba's forces interfering with the mission. Mundi expressed disgust with the concept of meeting the Hutt, still angry over Jabba's previous abduction of his daughter Sylvn, but he agreed to do so and departed for Tatooine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the secretive nature of Mundi's assignment, he was to depart from Coruscant in a Consular-class cruiser via a nondescript building rooftop rather than a spaceport.

Mundi comforted Kuro and assured her Sing's fate was not her fault. He could not tell Kuro details about his upcoming mission, but as his ship arrived, Kuro warned him she had dreamt of a great darkness awaiting him on the planet he was visiting, and urged him to beware of the dark side of the Force. Mundi traveled to Tatooine and landed at one of the Mos Eisley spaceport docking bays owned by Ohwun and Chachi De Maal which, although run-down and cheap, provided Mundi's mission with further cover and was the closest available port to Jabba's Desilijic Complex. Unbeknownst to him, Mundi's movements were being tracked by Sing, now a bounty hunter, who had been hired by the Hutt crime lord Gardulla Besadii the Elder to find and kill Hett.

The Jedi suspected it was a trap, but nevertheless accepted. His suspicions proved true when the skiff was piloted into a dangerous sandstorm and the guards attacked the Cerean. Mundi tried to persuade them to surrender, but when they instead attack, the Jedi easily killed them all with his lightsaber and Force skills. However, the skiff crashed and flipped over, leaving Mundi with a broken arm and forcing him to travel the rest of the trip on foot. While climbing the mountain foothills at The Needles, Mundi was attacked by womp rats and, while fending them off, fell into a krayt dragon lair. As Mundi attempted to fend off the creature, he was watched from above by a band of Tusken Raiders, including Sharad Hett and his son and Jedi learner, A'Sharad Hett.

Mundi condemned Hett's justifications, claiming the Jedi should use their power to defend and protect others rather than attack. Nevertheless, Mundi detected that Hett remained with the light side of the Force and asked him to return to the Jedi Order to help combat the rising threat of the Sith. Hett refused to abandon his fellow Tuskens.

Mundi tried to persuade her to turn away from the dark side of the Force, but she nevertheless attempted to finish off Sharad with her lightsaber. When A'Sharad stopped her and nearly killed her himself, Mundi implored him not to do so for fear of succoring to the dark side himself. A'Sharad hesitated long enough for Sing to escape. With the majority of their Tusken tribe wiped out from the battle, A'Sharad announced his intention to return with Mundi to Coruscant to further learn the ways of the Force.

The Jedi gave chase and Mundi questioned two nearby Gran guards as to their whereabouts but, much to the Cerean's frustration, the Grans claimed not to have seen anybody pass by and the duo escaped.

Mundi, A'Sharad, Yaddle and Koon rode on an airspeeder with two Lannik escorts, while Windu, Piell and Gallia rode in a second with Zash and another Lannik. However, it turned out to be an ambush: the Lanniks wore thermite bombs around their torsos with the hopes that sacrificing themselves to kill the Jedi would help Red Iaro's cause. Piell thwarted the attack on his airspeeder by literally cutting the vehicle in half with his lightsaber, causing the three Jedi occupants to fall into the path of podracers participating in the Phoebos Memorial Run. The Lannik on Mundi's airspeeder were so distracted by this development that the Jedi was able to push them both out of the vehicle.

The Republic proved victorious in defending the planet, but Vookto was killed in the battle, which also resulted in many clone and civilian casualties, along with the devastation of much of the planet's surface. Afterward, Mundi attended Vookto's Jedi Funeral, where he stood alongside the deceased Jedi's former Padawan, Dama Montalvo. Windu gave Mundi command of Vookto's troops and temporarily assigned Montalvo as his Padawan, although the assignment would prove very brief before Montalvo was reassigned to another Jedi Master. Shortly after the battle on Lianna, Mundi attended the funerals of Jedi masters Knol Ven'nari, Jon Antilles, Nico Diath and Fay, all of whom were killed during a mission on the planet Queyta seeking an antidote for the chemical weapon swamp gas, which was used to destroy a Gungan on Ohma-D'un."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Four months after the battle of Geonosis, Mundi was assigned to a task force led by Jedi Master Daakman Barrek that was dispatched to the planet Hypori, along with fellow Jedi Shaak Ti, Aayla Secura, K'Kruhk, Tarr Seirr and Sha'a Gi. Following up on intelligence gathered by Barrek and Gi, the Jedi and their accompanying clone troopers were to destroy a large droid factory on that planet. However, the mission became a disaster almost immediately upon the task force's arrival at Hypori. Space mines destroyed all of the Republic's transport ships, causing the Acclamator-class assault ship carrying the Jedi to crash behind enemy lines on the planet. Barrek was quickly killed and the Republic forces were soon surrounded by thousands of B2 super battle droids. The clone troopers who survived the crash were all killed by blaster fire and the six surviving Jedi were forced to take cover among the debris of the assault ship.

General Grievous, the cyborg Supreme Commander of the Confederacy armies, who had never before been seen by surviving members Republic, called out to the Jedi and promised them a noble death if the surrendered. A panicked Gi insisted they could not face Grievous, but Mundi said they had to try. Mundi remained calm and cautious, but Gi panicked and ran out of the ship, where Grievous leapt onto him and crushed him to death. Grievous then battled the remaining five Jedi simultaneously, using two lightsabers in a form of combat the Jedi Order had never faced before. Mundi was nearly struck down, but leaped onto an overhead rafter and launched a powerful Force push at Grievous. The general dodged the attack, however, and continued his duel with the Jedi, striking down K'Kruhk and killing Seirr.

The two dueled for several more minutes, which left the Cerean exhausted and his shirt torn. Grievous disarmed Mundi and was about to strike him down when a company of Advanced Recon Commandos reinforcements led by Captain ARC-77 arrived. Mundi leaped away as the clones opened fire, forcing Grievous to take cover. After ARC-77 ordered the clones to fall back, Mundi tried to insist they pursue the general, but the captain said they did not have time and the surviving Jedi would die if they stayed. Mundi hesitantly returned to the clones' LAAT/i gunship, where he was horrified to find Ti and Secura were on life support and the other Jedi were presumed dead.

Windu explained that Bulq's fall to the dark side stemmed from his use of Vaapad, a form of lightsaber combat created by Windu and Bulq that forced the combatant to tread dangerously close to the dark side when using it. Windu also shared with Mundi and Kolar his fears that Quinlan Vos had learned the technique and could be at similar risk. Additionally, when Vos appeared to succumb to the dark side and joined the Confederacy, Mundi was one of the few Jedi who knew that Vos was actually an undercover double agent still working for the Republic. In 21 BBY, Mundi was present at the Jedi Temple with Yoda, Windu and Tholme when Kolar contacted them via holocomm to inform them of his discovery on Nar Shaddaa that Vos was a traitor to the Jedi Order.

Mundi considered Bacara unusually aggressive for a clone and made repeatedly reports about those concerns. Nevertheless, the two had respect for each other and maintained an effective working relationship despite their occasional animosity.

Although Mundi had always strived not to become attached toward his family per the Jedi Code, he nevertheless felt the attachment following the tragedy.

Mundi was particularly overjoyed to once again see his old Padawan Hett, who by now had attained the title Jedi Master. Mundi and his fellow Jedi brought an army of clone troopers to Aargonar, where they were met with heavy fire from the battle droids and debilitating sandstorms on the desert world. Mundi established his troops on a Republic base on Aargonar, but the transport ship carrying Skywalker, Hett and Jul was shot down and crashed elsewhere on the planet and Mundi had no immediate word on their survival.

Mundi fought alongside his troops right up until they all retreated back to the canyon, where the battle droids could not reach them due to the sandstorms, although Mundi knew the droid would attack once the storms cleared. When the droid army indeed began advancing on them, the clone troopers' targeting and communication systems failed due to storm damage. Swan lamented that they could suffer a loss even more devastating than Jabiim, but Mundi said they must place their trust in the Force and rallied the troops.

Mundi's forces sustained heavily casualties from the battle droids and IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tanks, prompting Swan to order the units to fall back while she and Mundi flew low and provided covering fire from the air. At that moment, however, Skywalker and Hett emerged in a Gunship Bomber Enhanced from an underground tunnel in the middle of the battlefield. They were being chased by an enormous gouka dragon, which emerged from the tunnel and destroyed many of the Droid Army forces. With Skywalker and Hett joining the fight, Mundi's forces quickly drove back and defeated the Separatists. Although the battle proved a Republic victory, it was also among the bitterest and most costly battles that Mundi experienced throughout the Clone Wars. Mundi was later surprised to learn Hett was no longer wearing his Tusken Raider mask, something Hett said was inspired by his experiences with Skywalker. When informed Jul had been killed, Mundi mistakenly assumed the disturbance he felt earlier was caused by the Padawan's death. With the battle complete, the Cerean then tended to the prisoners his forces had taken.

While Mundi's troops were being refitted, Mundi was ordered to look into reports of increased piracy against Republic starcraft in the Varonat system. Around this time the Galactic Senate passed the Enhanced Security and Enforcement Act, a law that expanded Palpatine's powers, and one Mundi feared would make the Republic's enemies more combative and make the Jedi's efforts policing the galaxy more difficult. After a brief audience with Palpatine, Mundi and Skywalker departed along with Plo Koon and Adi Gallia for the planet Varonat. Skywalker had trouble opening up to Mundi, but the Cerean hoped that would change in time. Skywalker strongly believed Kenobi was still alive, although Mundi pragmatically claimed that Skywalker's thoughts were misleading him and suggested the Jedi Master would have tried to contact them if survived Jabiim.

Skywalker took a pass at the mothership, despite Mundi's orders to fall back because it was too dangerous. As he approached the ship, however, Skywalker was suddenly distracted by a Force call from Kenobi, who was indeed still alive and stranded on the planet Riflor. Skywalker nearly crashed directly into the mothership but was called back to attention by Mundi just in time for him to fire his shots, destroying the pirate ship. Mundi chided Anakin for his reckless behavior. When Skywalker explained he felt Obi-Wan's presence on Riflor, Mundi initially did not believe him because he felt nothing himself.

However, when Kenobi insisted the threat presented by Ventress was too significant to ignore, the Council ultimately agreed to allow him to pursue with caution. When Kenobi's pursuit ultimately uncovered intelligence that the Separatists had established a major blockage on the planet Boz Pity, the size of which suggested the presence of the Confederacy leadership. The Jedi Order believed the Clone Wars could be brought to an end if these leaders were captured, so they dispatched several of their best Jedi Masters, including Mundi, for a mission to investigate. In order to infiltrate the planet, the Jedi planned to bring the Venator-class Star Destroyer Intervention to come out of hyperspace between the blockade and the planet. Mundi was aboard the Intervention when Anakin Skywalker piloted the ship and attempted the maneuver. However, the spacecraft came out of hyperspace too close to Boz Pity's gravitational pull, causing the Intervention to crash onto the planet's surface. Mundi, the Jedi and most of their clone forces survived the crash, but having lost the element of surprise were forced to engage the Separatist armies in battle immediately. Despite the presence of Count Dooku, General Grievous and Ventress on the planet, the attack went as planned, and the Republic forces successfully infiltrated the Separatist's surface installations and headquarters.

As part of Mundi's supposed mission, he and Secura ordered the new Jedi Knight Anise I'Zak to deliver a canister across enemy territory to a clone army commander at a base elsewhere on the planet. However, the canister was actually empty, and I'Zak was unaware that her mission was simply meant to distract the clones while Mundi and Secura tended to their own top-secret mission. The two Jedi Master performed their mission and later met I'Zak at the base, where she was disappointed that the canister she was meant to deliver was destroyed. When they explained to her that her mission was simply a decoy, she was initially angry, but later came to accept that she was contributing to a greater cause.

Some days alter, Mundi remotely participated in a Council meeting where Secura reported that a biological agent had been released on the planet Felucia shortly after the destruction of Confederate ally Shu Mai's compound there. Secura explained the compound could potentially contaminate Felucia's water supply in a matter of days and kill everyone on the planet. Also in 19 BBY, Mundi discussed with the Council a State of the Republic address Palpatine made before the Galactic Senate. The Jedi were concerned with the amount of power Palpatine had accumulated throughout the Clone Wars and remained suspicious of his claims that he would end the conflict and return that power to the Senate when the war was done. They also believed Palpatine's decision to deploy massive troops in the Outer Rim was a show of power designed to acquire additional worlds for the Republic by force, and rejected his declaration of the planets Felucia, Mygeeto and Saleucami as a \"Triad of Evil\" to false, as those worlds were remote and strategically insignificant."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Sacrifice of Rivi-Anu"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mundi was given command of hundreds of clone troopers and ordered to attack a Separatist base on a besieged planet.

After Mundi's forces established themselves on the planet, Rivi-Anu admitted to the Cerean that she was afraid of the upcoming conflict, but Mundi assured her the fear was nothing to be ashamed of because it humbled her to the power of the Force. Rivi-Anu was strongly comforted by these words. Later, Mundi led his clone and Jedi forces into battle against a large contingent of battle droids outside the Separatist base. After an intense fight, the battle droids began to retreat and Mundi ordered the clone troopers to continue their advance. He ordered Rivi-Anu to secure the west flank of the battlefield, but she was shot in the right arm by blaster fire and briefly incapacitated. As the battle raged on, a Venator-class Star Destroyed in orbit around the planet was destroyed and began crashing toward the planet.

Rivi-Anu reached out with the force and, to Mundi's astonishment, successfully slowed the massive ship's descent through the atmosphere. She held the ship aloft long enough for Mundi to direct his forces away from the battlefield and, once they were clear, the Star Destroyer crashed. The explosion killed Rivi-Anu instantly and destroyed much of the battle droid army, but the Republic forces survived and the battle was victorious. Mundi was extremely moved by Rivi-Anu's sacrifice and it instilled him with a sense of hope and pride.

Furthermore, the Council decided to ask Skywalker to spy on Palpatine and report his actions back to the Council. Kenobi voiced strong opposition to this plan and Mundi himself had reservations about it, but ultimately felt it was necessary given how dire the state of the galaxy was growing. Mundi also felt that if Skywalker were indeed the Chosen One as prophesied, he should be kept close in play to events as they unfolded in Coruscant so he could be in a position to strike against the Sith should they arise. Later, when the Council informed Skywalker that he would not receive the rank of Jedi Master, Mundi was visibly disturbed by Skywalker's angry reaction. During a later meeting, Skywalker presented intelligence from Palpatine that Grievous was in hiding on the planet Utapau. Mundi was concerned about this report, as the Jedi Order's own agents on Utapau had no such information.

Unbeknownst to Mundi, they were actually seeking a power crystal from the planet that Palpatine needed for a top-secret superlaser weapon he was developing under the code name Hammertong. For reasons he could not identify, Mundi was suspicious of the presence of the 501st and the fact that they were operating outside of his direct control, but felt reassured after Bacara assured him they were trustworthy. Mundi accompanied the 501st on their mission on Mygeeto, helping them push through their battle droid forces and reach what the Cerean believed was the droid energy collector. As they reached it, the Jedi also helped them destroy a Separatist shield generator so the 501st could reach and obtain the technology, which was taken back to a LAAT/i dropship.

Mundi suggested that if such an extreme measure indeed became necessary, the Order might have to code with major political ramifications from the Republic, since Palpatine's dictatorship was technically obtained legally through the super-majority he controlled in the Galactic Senate. Mundi advised it would be up to the Jedi Order to take control of the Senate for an interim period until a new transition of power could commence, an unprecedented and potentially treasonous suggestion, but one the Council ultimately agreed was necessary. Prior to engaging in his final push during the battle on Mygeeto, Mundi meditated and reflected once again upon the sacrifice Rivi-Anu, which helped inspire him to continue on with his duties. As he finished this meditation, Bacara informed him the troops were ready for deployment. Mundi led his clone troopers into the battle, which consisted mainly of urban fighting among the remains of the modern Mygeeto towers.

The opportunity presented itself as they reached a narrow bridge into one of Mygeeto's massive cities, where they were met with heavy resistance fire from the other side. Mundi encouraged his men to follow him and charged toward the enemy without hesitation. The clones, however, immediately stopped in their tracks, prompting a surprised and confused Mundi to turn around and face them. Bacara hesitated only a brief moment before executing Order 66 because he was shocked by the idea of a Jedi coup, but he had no doubt of the order's authenticity and grew furious with the Jedi, thinking back to all his men who had died following Mundi's command. Bacara and his fellow troopers raised their blaster rifles and opened fire on the Cerean Jedi. Realizing too late he had been betrayed, Mundi raised his lightsaber and deflected a handful of the shots, sending them hurling back toward the clones and killing three of them.

His elongated head made him stand out among his peers on the Jedi High Council, but also gave him a stately, introspective appearance. Mundi had great empathy for other living beings, particularly his fellow Jedi. During his meditations in the Clone Wars, he preferred to have drops of water falling on his head because each drop reminded him of a Jedi who fell in battle. As a Jedi Master, Mundi had no fear of death, and believed that to die simply meant becoming one with the Living Force. Mundi believed the greatest honor was to sacrifice oneself for others and for a greater cause. During his time as a Jedi General during the Clone Wars, Mundi believed that as a leader, he should not only give orders his forces but personally lead them into battle. During battle against the Droid Army on Aargonar, fellow Jedi Bultar Swan questioned his decision to monitor the battlefield from a LAAT/i gunships because it placed him in mortal jeopardy by exposing his position, but Mundi insisted it was his duty as a leader.

He further showed this attachment by his strong desire to have a son in addition to his daughters. Nevertheless, Mundi was able to put his service to the Jedi Order ahead of his feelings toward his family, thus demonstrating a large amount of control over his emotions. This was particularly evident when, after his family was killed following the Battle of Cerea, Mundi was able to remain focused on his Jedi service and overcome his grief during a situation in which other Jedi would risk falling to the dark side of the Force. Despite this control over his emotions, however, Mundi often felt awkward when dealing with problems involving his family and had trouble positively resolving them.

Although drawn to off-worlder technology during his youth, Mundi in his adulthood came to respect what his Cerean ancestors had built, such as the planetary capital, Tecave City. He also came to look upon the Outsider Citadels, more modern cities built by off-worlders, with disgust and contempt. Mundi spoke so passionately about this subject that, when arguing against Silais's offer to join the Republic, he immediately persuaded the Council of Elders to reject the proposal after a single speech. Mundi did not completely oppose the use of all technology, but felt that it should be used in moderation and not simply for the sake of having it.

When encouraged by Yoda during a training session to watch his blind spot in combat, the adolescent Mundi boasted that he did not have a blind spot.

Likewise, Mundi's past experience with Count Dooku and strong belief in the infallibility of the Jedi blinded him to the fact that Dooku had become a murderous leader of the Separatist movement. Mundi also refused to stand by padawan Ahsoka Tano when she was framed for treason, and alongside the rest of the Jedi Council, stripped her of her status as a Jedi and turned her over to the Republic military courts. Though Tano was completely honest when she claimed her innocence, Mundi did not believe her, as he felt that the circumstantial evidence against Tano was enough for her to be convicted.

Despite getting disarmed and nearly killed, Mundi was able to successfully defend himself against a combat style which had never been seen before by the Jedi, as Hypori marked Grievous' first appearance against a Jedi who lived to recall the experience, as well as being fatigued and having his Force Augmentation greatly weakened by the deaths of the Jedi around him. Likewise, Mundi engaged the Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress on Coruscant and not only survived the duel, but fought Ventress to a stalemate and forced her to retreat.

In doing so, McCaig experimented by drawing some unusual parodies of the elderly Obi-Wan Kenobi, including one with whale-like features, with an elongated head and ridges along the back of the neck. While drawing early conceptual sketches of the Jedi characters for the final film in the trilogy, Revenge of the Sith (2005), concept artist Derek Thompson proposed a version of Mundi that had lost his left eye during the battles of the Clone Wars and now wore an eye patch along with a black and gold cape.

However, George Lucas screened a video of Silas' audition and was so impressed he encouraged the actor to accept the role of Mundi, which led him to play the other parts as well. In addition to appearing on-screen, Carson also performed Mundi's voice, mimicking that of an elderly man who speaks slowly and deliberately. During the filming of The Phantom Menace, executive producer George Lucas had not yet decided whether he would keep Carson's voice or dub in that of another actor, as he had done for several other characters, but Lucas found he liked Carson's vocal performance and decided to keep it. To create Mundi's movements, Carson spent time with elderly people and watched the ways they moved and spoke.

Lucas did not give Carson any backstory from which to build his performance as Mundi, but simply left it up to the actor to create. Once the shooting of each film was completed, Carson did not know right away whether he would be returning for the next film.

However, while the process took longer to prepare for Mundi than it did for Nute Gunray or Lott Dod, Carson said the Mundi make-up was less hot and comfortable to wear than those other character and that he would often walk around off-set and forget he had the make-up on at all. During filming for Attack of the Clones (2002), the make-up artists used a different brand of make-up glues and removers, causing Silas' skin to break out due to allergies.

Upon learning Mundi would be fighting in that film, Carson worked out a great deal before filming began to get physically fit, and claimed he was even outrunning some of the stunt performers.

To explain the continuity error created by Mundi's family, a retcon was later established that due to the Cerean gender ratio of 20 females to 1 male, Mundi was granted an exception to allow the continuation of his species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the theatrical release of The Phantom Menace, several Star Wars reference books such as Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace Scrapbook and The New Essential Guide to Characters established that Mundi was the sole Jedi Knight on the Jedi High Council, while the others were Masters. This conflicted with dialogue in Revenge of the Sith, when Anakin Skywalker becomes angry that he is appointed to the Council without being promoted to Jedi Master, and claims it has never happened in the history of the Jedi. Since the films remain the highest level of canon at G-canon, the Expanded Universe and the StarWars.com Databank established that Mundi's promotion to Jedi Master was still in progress right before the Naboo crisis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
