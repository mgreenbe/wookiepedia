He won 1,500 credits in a game of sabacc with a spacer on Tekurr'k. Shortly thereafter, while running a courier job in the city of Lis'an on Antiquity, Woetar ran afoul of a displeased former customer who surrounded his ship with goons, preventing him from escaping. Soon after, Woetar noticed the arrival of the ship belonging to the spacer he'd met on Tekurr'k; out of options, he approached the spacer to make a deal that would enable him to complete his courier run while eluding his enemies. The spacer agreed to hear Woetar out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Diminutive and hairless, Woetar had thick, resilient green skin and a high, nasal voice.
