The prison was protected from the planet's high gravity by a gravity field generated by an orbiting space station. Megalox was considered by the New Republic to be a dumping ground for the worst galactic criminals, who were left to fend for themselves. Kan Be commanded a gang and was a rival of Grakkus the Hutt, who commanded his own posse of Hutts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the First Order Agent Terex's deal with Grakkus fell apart, Terex met with Kan Be and the other crime lords Isin and Papa Toren. When Terex introduced himself, Kan Be dismissed as a \"garbage sniffer\" and likened his uniform to a \"hat on an aiwha.\" When Terex told the crime lords about his failed deal, Kan Be remarked that Terex was trying to rub their faces. Terex offered to break the crime lords out of the prison if they helped him to storm Grakkus' fortress, kill the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron and his Black Squadron and Grakkus' guards. Terex planned to interrogate Grakkus and then kill him. The crime lords agreed to Terex's bargain after he threw a knife on the table."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the gangsters' combined gangs fought Black Squadron and Grakkus' guards, Kan Be and the other crime lords watched the fighting with Terex.
