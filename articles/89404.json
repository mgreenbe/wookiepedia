Around the year 83 BBY, the production capacity of a star system in the Oplovis sector surpassed that of Metalorn, by which point had become a famous industrial world. During the Clone Wars, a conflict fought between the Confederacy of Independent Systems and Galactic Republic that began in 22 BBY, Metalorn was aligned with the Separatists and defended by a mixed fleet of overstock and prototype ships and fighters from Techno Union member corporations and design firms, such as SoroSuub Corporation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Clone Wars ended and the Republic transitioned into the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, the Empire dissolved the Techno Union and nationalized its assets, including Metalorn. During the Galactic Civil War, the manufacturing world supplied the Imperial Military, featuring a medium security status and production output.  Metalorn was among the major Imperial shipyards and drydocks and key mining centers marked by General Crix Madine as potential targets for the Alliance to Restore the Republic following the conclusion of Operation Ringbreaker in 3 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 5 ABY, the Alliance had transitioned into the New Republic and driven the Empire into remnants and holdouts throughout the galaxy. In order to find the Empire's secret base, the New Republic used Metalorn and the planet Troithe to manufacture probe droids to drive the search."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Metalorn was inhabited by members of the sentient Skakoan species. Humanoids native to the ecumenopolis planet Skako in the Core Worlds region, they were required to wear special pressure suits that emulated their homeworld's high-pressure methane atmosphere when traveling offworld, lest they explode when exposed to a standard, oxygen-based atmosphere. However, Skakoans were also capable of surviving on the nearby planet Skako Minor, which had an atmosphere of pressurized hydrogen sulfide."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Few left Skako due to its unique atmospheric pressure, and most that were willing to travel, even if only as far as Skako Minor, tended to be technological industrialists. This established the species as technologically obsessed in the eye of the galactic community, despite Skakoans having actually possessed a wide variety of interests and professions. As few Skakoans ventured offworld, most did not learn Galactic Basic Standard and instead spoke their native Skakoverbal, a complex language that shared similarities with Binary. Those that did travel abroad largely relied upon translation units attached to their pressure suits, furthering the myth that Skakoans were cybernetic or machine beings. They had majority control of the Techno Union by the Clone Wars, by which point there was a mistaken belief that Skakoans had founded the organization."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At an early age, the Skakoan Wat Tambor left his homeworld of Skako to begin a career in technology on Metalorn. He would go on to become Foreman of the Techno Union and represent the organization in the Galactic Senate. Tambor also became Skako's  de facto representative in the Republic, despite the industrialist Skakoans having originally avoided membership due to their belief that technology and industry knew no political borders. While the Techno Union officially declared neutrality during the Clone Wars, Tambor and other Skakoan business interests sided with the Confederacy of Independent Systems out of fear of Republic overreach, with him and Skako providing the Separatists with indirect support. Tambor's expansionist leanings turned the Republic against Skako, who captured the planet during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Tambor's assassination and the dissolution of the Seperatists, the Empire inherited the Republic's prejudice and Skakoans found themselves shunned as enemies of Emperor Palpatine. Though Skako was sanctioned and an emigration restriction was put in place, the majority of Skakoans preferred being cut off from the galaxy and were content, or at least willing, to remain on their homeworld with the Empire watching from above. However, some believed that their people had learned the wrong lessons from Tambor's failures and, rather than withdrawing from galactic participation, wanted Skakoans to decide the fate of Skako and its citizens, not the Empire. In addition, the Empire enslaved Metalorn's Skakoan population for having supported the Separatists. As a result, some Skakoans joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic in order to avenge their fallen comrades. Others joined because they knew that hiding from the galaxy would not save them or their homeworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Metalorn was the site of Unreal City, one of the many private prisons in which the majority of prisoners taken by the Separatists were incarcerated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Metalorn was first mentioned in the Star Wars canon in the 2016 reference book Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded, written by Pablo Hidalgo.
