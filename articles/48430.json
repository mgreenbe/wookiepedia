They were exterminated from the populated areas of Taanab about thirty years before the Clone Wars, but still lived in the more remote areas of the planet, like Ba-Taanab Peninsula. In 43 BBY, the Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi fell into a firebeetle pit there and was almost eaten alive, although was able to escape unharmed. He later had a dream about them in 22 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
