In 44 ABY, he was exiled after the uprising of the slaves on Qaras along with the rest of his people. This revolution had been instigated by the organization Freedom Flight, which was secretly founded by Moff Drikl Lecersen to follow through the resulting crises by Chief of State Natasi Daala of the Galactic Alliance.
