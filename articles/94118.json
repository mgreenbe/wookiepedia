The base of the sword was cut into jagged triangles allowing the wielder to better damage their enemy in close quarter fighting. The blade itself was not very lengthy which reduced its weight and allowed it to be balanced better during combat. It was the secondary weapon used by the Mustafarian crime organization the Phantoms bandits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
