The mission suffered a setback as Fett killed Mari's friend in a cantina where Mari herself and a group of spacers were also present. As Mari was hiding in the shadows, Fett did not spot her, but announced that he was looking for her and willing to pay a hefty reward to anyone who could point him to her. The spacers noted Mari hiding in the dark - partially because of her beautiful face and because of a single tear running down her cheek."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Danger in the streets"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not knowing that the spacers had seen her, Mari sneaked out of the cantina and into the dark streets outside. Here, she was attacked by a gang of hoodlums, who had heard about the bounty on her head. Having been encircled by the gang, Mari desperately screamed out for help. Unbeknownst to her, the spacers had decided to try and find her and had heard the screams. The spacers arrived just in time and interrupted the gang. The gang leader invited the spacers to a brawl where only blades and batons were allowed. The spacers agreed and managed to defeat the gang. As the gang leader saw his minions defeated, he pulled a blaster on the spacers, but was assaulted out of the blue by Zardra. While Zadra disposed of the gang leader with her force pike, Mari and the spacers ran off and hid in a dark alley."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Here Mari thanked them for saving her and, after they convinced her that they wanted to help her, Mari revealed her identity and mission, and implored the spacers to help her offworld.
