During one field exercise, he encounters Captain Piers Roddance, who orders the cadets to secure droids that have been designated as \"high priority targets.\" While most of the staff and his fellow cadets accept Leonis' story that he had heroically resisted the rebel attackers, the antagonistic Nazhros Oleg believes that he is a rebel sympathizer working with Dev Morgan and makes life difficult for him.

Since he is unable to find any compelling evidence, Roddance is forced to release Zare but warns that cadet that he is watching him. Roddance also subjects Leonis to a strange test which he realizes is a test for Force sensitivity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the winter break, Zare returns home from the Imperial Academy and stays with his parents Leo and Tepha. While on holiday, he advises his girlfriend Merei to stop dealing with Laxo. However, Merei is unwilling and unable to do so since that would involve her having to come clean about her illegal activities. In private, Leonis discusses his plan to travel to Arkanis to rescue his sister Dhara with his mother, who fears that she would lose both her children. Leonis also witnesses the Empire's growing repression on Lothal and later learns that the Imperial authorities have launched a security crackdown on Lothal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the winter break, Leonis and his fellow cadets are conscripted to assist the Imperial crackdown. Their operations include questioning local residents about their knowledge of illegal activities and detaining the children of fugitives. For these operations, Zare is paired up with his nemesis Oleg as part of Roddance's efforts to provoke him into breaking the law and getting him expelled from the Academy. To project Leonis from Roddance's machinations, his mentor Lieutenant Chiron arranges for Leonis to be transferred to the Arkanis Academy the next Fall.

Her problems are further complicated when the Gray Syndicate boss Yahenna Laxo, who had earlier supplied her with the snooper programs, hires her services for several courier jobs in Capital City. Merei hides her illegal activities from her parents by pretending that she is doing revision with her classmates at her school's anti-intrusion club. Her dad Gandr also provides his daughter with a locator for security precautions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unhappy at being indebted to Laxo, Merei confided in her Pantoran classmate Jix Hekyl, who deduced that Laxo was calling a favor from her since one of their snooper programs had been detected by Imperial investigators. In addition, Merei also has to deal with the witness who saw her at the Transportation Ministry and find a way to erase her account at the repeater service Bakiska's; a problem complicated by the fact that her information is stored at a secure warehouse in Capital City. To delay the Imperial investigators, Merei and Jix replace her profile picture with that of a similar-aged schoolgirl named Hestia Tarleton, a student at the Young Ladies' Seminary of Lothal Settlers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Jix's ploy in changing her photo succeeds in delaying her parents' investigation, Merei is fearful when she learns that her mother Jessa plans to get a warrant to view accounts at Bakiska's. Later that day, Laxo assigns a new job to Merei: collecting Credits from fugitives who had paid the Gray Syndicate to hide them. During the course of her new job, Merei strikes a friendship with Holshef, an elderly poet and artist who had drawn the ire of the Galactic Empire. During the winter-break, Merei meets up with her boyfriend Leonis but is taken aback by his preoccupation with his problems.

Unwilling to draw further attention to herself, Merei tells them to send their droid Chopper to contact Leonis. In a final act of desperation, Merei records a fake hostage message to her parents before visiting Laxo's headquarters. As punishment for visiting Bakiska's warehouse, Laxo decides to sell her friend Holshef to a bounty hunter. Before he can carry out his plan, Laxo and his fellow criminals are killed during an Imperial raid.

After receiving a recorded message from Leonis informing her about his transfer to Arkanis, Merei used her stolen decoder to access the Imperial Security Bureau's network. To her horror, she discovered that Leonis' transfer was not a promotion but was part of a secret investigation by the Inquisitor to determine his Force sensitivity and to investigate his links to Dev Morgan.
