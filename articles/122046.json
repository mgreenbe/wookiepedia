They were capable of holding starfighters, ground speeders, or if placed on water, aquatic vehicles. One was located in the Naboo airbase and another was located near the N-1 assembly site. The city of Ferentina featured a hangar that was on the water, allowing houseboats to dock. Others were placed throughout Naboo, including in the countryside near Theed and near the northern mountains. During the Trade Federation's invasion, another of the security hangars was found inside Camp Four. Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes of the Security Force used the hangars to change vehicles during the resistance movement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another hangar was near a Trade Federation Research Station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Security hangars appear in the 2000 video game Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo.
