It was modified from the E-Web heavy repeating blaster and unlike its predecessor, it did not require a power generator. While one person could operate it with two hands, a second crew member would reload the launcher between the shots, jamming live missiles into the launch tubes. They were often deployed by the Empire during the Rise of the Empire and early Galactic Civil War and were used in various Imperial locations, including the Death Star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
