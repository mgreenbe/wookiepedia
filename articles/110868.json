The aim of a raid war would never be to entirely eliminate the opposing steris, as a weaken steris might have proved a useful ally, but simply to alter their status within Adnerem society. Powerful steri with conflicting goals would commonly engage in raid-wars and smaller steri might band together in a raid-war against a more powerful steri who was abusing their power."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
