She was sent there after driving her father to his wit's end, however while at the school she focused on little but learning how to use a range of weapons. She also used her looks and charisma to manipulate men at the school, which she found as easy as manipulating non-military boys at home on the planet Sarconia. She left the school with an unimpressive record and went on to rob a Safidine Industries laboratory, resulting in a bounty being placed on her head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The school was first mentioned in the \"Bounties to Die For\" article in the sixth issue of Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Gamer magazine series. The magazines were supplements for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game and the school was included in an entry for Devidia Vennsiol which was written by S. Mitch Ritchie. The article states only that the bounties are posted by the Empire but does not give a specific era in which they are set."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
