The powerful twin thruster engines, albeit considered primitive by the time of the Clone Wars, sat on two articulated boom arms that extended from each side of the ship's primary hull. These boom arms would fold up while the craft was landing, using the engines as supports. Despite its size and large cargo complement, the vessel could be competently operated by a single pilot. For emergency situations, the freighter had one escape pod in the upper rear section which could be ejected from the craft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, it was used as a slave transport by the Zygerrian Slave Empire (giving it its nickname), who outfitted the storage bays for live cargo.
