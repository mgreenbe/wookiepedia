At the exposition, they hijack an AT-DP walker on patrol in an attempt to hack into the Imperial data network so that they can find where the Empire was holding Kanan. Since the Empire destroyed Lothal's Imperial Communications Center, the entire network was down. After being pursued by two more AT-DP walkers, the rebels headed to the town's western border to rendezvous with Hera, who would pick them up with the Phantom, the Ghost's auxiliary ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While retreating, Zeb exchanged fire with the pursuing walkers but almost fell out of their AT-DP walker. After Sabine got word that Hera Syndulla was on the way, she instructed everyone to get on top of their hijacked AT-DP. However, Chopper ignored that order and remained plugged to the walker's terminal in the hope of finding any information about Kanan. Shortly later, Hera showed in the Phantom and picked up Ezra, Sabine and Zeb just as one of the pursuing walkers caught up with them. When they realized that Chopper was still in the AT-DP walker, Zeb went back to retrieve him moments before the attacking walker blew it up."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After returning to the Ghost, Hera received word from Fulcrum that the transmission they sent out had been widely viewed by both civilians and the Imperial authorities. Concerned for the safety of the rebellion, Fulcrum told Hera to abandon their search for Kanan in order to avoid drawing attention to their rebel cell. When Hera shared what Fulcrum had told her, Ezra refused to abandon Kanan. Defying Hera's orders, Ezra decided to take matters into his own hands. While Chopper distracted Hera aboard the Ghost, Ezra, Sabine and Zeb stole the Phantom and headed out into Lothal's wilderness to find the Devaronian crime lord Vizago."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vizago was initially unwilling to help the crew of the Ghost because their insurgency had led to an increased Imperial presence on Lothal which disrupted his business activities. Despite Sabine's protests, Ezra managed to get Vizago to change his mind by revealing that he and Kanan were both Jedi. When Vizago laughed because he didn't believe him, Ezra used the Force to levitate a crate over his head. Impressed by Ezra's display of Force powers, Vizago revealed that the Empire was using courier droids to transfer sensitive information to their communication ship above Lothal since the communication tower's destruction had disrupted all long-range communications on Lothal. Vizago suggested that Kanan's whereabouts was stored within this data."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With their meeting over, Ezra left the ship and found Sabine and Zeb with Hera, who was furious with the three rebels for disobeying her orders. However, Ezra and his fellow rebels refused to abandon Kanan. Outnumbered, Hera reluctantly agreed to help them rescue Kanan and asked Ezra what he had found out from Vizago. Meanwhile, aboard Grand Moff Tarkin's Star Destroyer Sovereign, Kanan resisted a mental probe by one of Agent Kallus' interrogator droids. In an attempt to break the Jedi, the Grand Inquisitor then had Kanan electrocuted. When Kanan refused to divulge any information about Fulcrum and the rebel network, Grand Moff Tarkin ordered that the Jedi be transferred to the Mustafar system, a place that would produced the \"desired results.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using Vizago's information, the crew of the Ghost devised a plan to intercept one of the Empire's courier droids and replace him with Chopper. Once aboard the Imperial communications ship, Chopper would hack into their data network and find out where the Imperials were keeping Kanan. After capturing the courier droid and taking out its stormtrooper escort, Chopper boarded the waiting shuttle disguised as an Imperial droid. The shuttle soon took off and headed for the orbiting communications ship. Soon after boarding, Chopper arrived on the bridge and began hacking into the Imperial Network, but started to catch some unwanted attention from the Imperials."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As soon as Chopper downloaded what he was looking for, he signaled for the crew of the Ghost to attack the communications ship, giving him time to escape. He opened one of the airlocks and allowed himself to get sucked into the vacuum of space along with four stormtroopers who were behind him. Now in space, Chopper jetted away to the Ghost and flew through the bomb bay doors as the Spectres headed back down to Lothal. From the information that Chopper had retrieved, the crew of the Ghost discovered that the Imperials were sending Kanan to the Mustafar system. Hera told the others what Kanan had told her about the Mustafar system: it is where the Jedi go to die."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
