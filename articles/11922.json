During the Republic Era, the performing artist joined the Opposition, a political performance troupe of Pijali natives led by Halin Azucca. For some time, the group hosted theatrical performances on Pijal that showcased its opinions on local issues while also being informative to the public. During these exhibitions, Bajjo focused her eye-lenses to create abstract holograms. By around 40 BBY, the Opposition began to protest the Governance Treaty, believing that the motion would cede irrevocable power to the Czerka Corporation, which had been exploiting the resources of Pijal and its moon for centuries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after voicing its dissent to the treaty, the troupe was framed by the Pijali monarchy for several violent attacks on Czerka facilities, which forced the group into hiding on Pijal's moon.

Opposition members rescued them, and Azucca explained to the Jedi that their troupe had been framed for the recent attacks.
