Because Scipio lacked natural resources of any note, the Muuns colonized Muunilinst and founded the InterGalactic Banking Clan. Using the resources of Muunilinst to back the Galactic Credit Standard, the Banking Clan of Scipio became an important world for the Galactic Republic as it utilized the Credit as a galactic currency. The Clan built its massive vaults on the planet, where the Bank profits were safely held. Other outside agencies, power brokers, and representatives of various cartels made their home on Scipio, hoping to ensure their place in the galactic market."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Senator Rush Clovis represented the Banking Clan from 25 to 22 BBY until he was arrested by fellow senator Lott Dod on Cato Neimoidia. In 20 BBY, Rush Clovis became the head of the Banking Clan conglomerate, after the Council of Five was arrested for corruption and fraud. To prevent the Banking clan from becoming corrupted again, both the Galactic Republic and the Separatists agreed to send ambassadors to the planet, to secure both parties' agendas. Padm\u00e9 Amidala was sent to represent the Galactic Republic and Bec Lawise was sent on the behalf of the Confederacy. Clovis' appointment as the head of the InterGalactic Banking Clan did not last long as he was killed during the Separatist attack on the planet, sacrificing himself to save Padm\u00e9 Amidala. The clone trooper commander Thorn perished on this planet in the year 20 BBY during the attack and short occupation by the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Galactic Empire came to power at the end of the Clone Wars, Scipio was subjugated; though the Core Five were allowed to maintain their positions. Moff Boyse commanded the blockade of the planet from aboard his flagship the Exchequer, ensuring that the Core Five maintained their loyalty to His Imperial Majesty. Despite this, the Imperial control was secretly being thwarted by Muuns and others working on the world. Using secret tunnels below the main vault, some agents of rebellion used vaults hidden in Frigia Canyons to move untraceable credits around."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
