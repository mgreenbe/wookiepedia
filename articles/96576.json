The Zone was used by the Barabel species as a planetary court, to solve disputes that could not be resolved at a local level. Various methods of arbitration were used in the court, including one-on-one combat, hunting contests, small battles and debates in which the participators made personal attacks on one another. The Zone also contained some luxury accommodation and Jedi that visited Barab I were offered the use of the luxury facilities, in return for their assistance in resolving disputes between important individuals or Barabel clans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
