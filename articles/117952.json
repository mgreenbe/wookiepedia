She was present when Ahsoka Tano, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin Skywalker came to the planet, and viewing them as a threat to her clients, was the first to sneak up on them and point her rifle at the Jedi. After some deliberation, however, the Jedi convinced the bounty hunters and their clients that they were not in league with the pirates. However, they made it clear that they couldn't help the village farmers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Weequay pirates attacked on speeder bikes shortly afterward, and Kenobi was surprised to find that his prior acquaintance, Hondo Ohnaka, was the leader of the pirate gang.

Paramita was not only instrumental in helping the villagers learn to fight, but also assisted with the harvest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the second attack came, Paramita was positioned on top of a building, giving her a clear line of fire to act as a sniper.
