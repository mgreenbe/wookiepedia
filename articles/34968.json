Which means it is time to dig into the pet project of GOVERNOR WILHUFF TARKIN and ORSON KRENNIC: the massive battle station being built on GEONOSIS. Opportunity arises when the project is hindered by sabotage from unknown forces. THE EMPEROR calls on his dark enforcer to root out the source of treachery that threatens to destabilize the Empire's galactic ascent."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Tarkin and Vader"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Governor Wilhuff Tarkin travels with a contingent of Death troopers to the Imperial security complex at Citadel Tower on Scarif.

Tarkin heads to the Scarif vault which is being occupied by Darth Vader, who does not have authorization to be there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader does not care about Imperial protocol and says that he is interested in Project Stardust. Tarkin responds that he is not sanctioned to view the projects of the Tarkin Initiative.

When Tarkin orders him to stand down, Vader replies that he is not a beast."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tarkin responds that the Emperor begs to differ and tells Vader that he is his to do as he sees fit. Tarkin tells Vader that he can send his anger, hatred, and homocidal thoughts. He asks Vader to consider how the Emperor would respond if he were to Force choke him. Tarkin contacts the Emperor via holoprojector. The Emperor tells Lord Vader that he does not recall sending him to Scarif."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader apologizes and says that he only sought to study the ways in which the Galactic Empire will extend its rule over the galaxy. The Emperor says that perhaps it is time for Lord Vader to know and orders him to serve Tarkin. He explains that there have been incidents of sabotage and tasks Vader with uncovering the treachery that disrupted Project Stardust's timeline. He tasks Vader with rooting it out and destroying it.

Just then, several explosives collapse a rocky arch on top of Vader's shuttle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader and Krennic survived but the shuttle is buried under rubble and several Death troopers are injured. Vader blames saboteurs for the attack and requests a private meeting with Krennic. In Krennic's office, Krennic thinks that the rock incident was an assassination attempt by Tarkin, whom he fears is trying to take over the project. Krennic explains to Vader that Tarkin does not like Vader because the Sith Lord has the Emperor's ear. Krennic says that he is a builder and an architect while Tarkin is a politician."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader says that he is not here to entertain \"baseless\" accusations and asks Krennic about other instances of sabotage. Krennic recalls that an accident eight months ago killed two dozen Geonosians. Three months later, tests on the upgraded tractor beams went haywire, killing many Imperial stormtroopers. Imperial slicers determined that somebody had tempered with the code. Krennic adds that an O0-99 Imperial orbital load-lifter went rogue, killing at least one Geonosian before it was silenced by a TIE fighter. Krennic says that the recent assassination attempt shows they are both tangled in this. Vader vows to find the perpetrator and says that the truth will not escape him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While reflecting on memories of the First Battle of Geonosis at the Petranaki Arena, Lord Vader is visited by Loyalty officer Sid Uddra.

However, she believes that they are not behind the sabotage because they love the power that the Empire affords them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader thinks the two men are dangerous, Uddra disagrees. Using a shah-tezh analogy, she explains that Tarkin and Krennic are trying to control the project rather than to destroy it.

Krennic ultimately won, earning Erso's freedom and loyalty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Uddra doesn't think that Erso is the saboteur but he is bothered that Erso is a pacifist.

Vader recalls that the Geonosians are a servant species who are forbidden from breeding freely and asks why Erso has one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Krennic explains that Erso receives shipments of Geonosian technology and blue prints for him to study. Krennic describes the egg as a rogue infestation. He thinks that the Geonosians sent the egg to Erso in order to enlist his help.

Vader determines that the scientist was not complicit in their treachery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader informs Tarkin that Imperial slicers have confirmed that the rogue Geonosian hive installed corrupted technology into production, ensuring accidents. They also located detonite charges whose accelerant configurations matched those found on the rubble that nearly killed him and Krennic.
