Vurk considered causing a death reprehensible, if it were self-defense or outright murder, because it silenced a person's ability to voice a new opinion or thought. During the Clone Wars, the Stricture was not altered by any conflict on the Vurk homeworld of Sembla, but Vurk who travelled off-world had to think differently about the Stricture because of deaths done in order to free slaves or end battles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
