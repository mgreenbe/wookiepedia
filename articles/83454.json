About five years before the Battle of Yavin, the young orphan Ezra Bridger used it as a hideout. Bridger notably stored his collection of stolen Imperial helmets in the tower. He also kept a key to his old family home, which he later retrieved on Empire Day in 4 BBY.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tower had a turbolift leading to the top. A circular balcony encircled the top, and inside there were several empty rooms, one of which had Bridger's bunk and helmet collection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two years[source?] after it had been abandoned by Ezra, it was used by the rogue Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus to secretly contact the Rebels as Fulcrum. After learning that Grand Admiral Thrawn was aware of the planned rebel strike on Lothal, Kallus tried to use a transmitter to warn the Phoenix Cell. However, Thrawn jammed the signals and captured Kallus following a fight. Using the trajectories of Kallus' Fulcrum transmissions and General Jan Dodonna's Massassi Group, Thrawn was able to find the hidden rebel base in the Atollon system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, when the Spectres returned to Lothal in 1 BBY,[source?] Kanan Jarrus, Hera Syndulla and Chopper conducted a long-distance reconnaissance of Lothal City from the tower. They discovered preparations at the Imperial Armory Complex indicating that the Empire planned to mass-produce the newly-developed TIE/D Defender Elite. After Hera had been captured by the Empire, the tower's convenient view of the capital was used for recon in preparation for her rescue, with Sabine Wren's sighting of loth-bats proving particularly useful."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the liberation of Lothal, the tower was eventually restored, and Wren lived there to watch over Lothal as a promise to her missing friend Ezra. Sometime after the Battle of Endor, Wren watched Ahsoka Tano's ship and her X-wing escort approach Lothal City from the tower's balcony, and later land at that balcony."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
