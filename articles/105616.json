The pirates, being paid as profiteers by the burgeoning Confederacy of Independent Systems, had attracted Jedi attention by raiding grain and spice convoys."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In their traditionally non-violent way, at least six Knights (including Fisto, Belsed-Qan Idan, Dovish Hokken, Yrada Soludisan, and Aruden Kej) had intended to begin peaceful negotiations; however, that plan was abandoned once the pirates opened fire and a skirmish broke out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Assisted by the armed Republic cruiser Monitor III, the Jedi's six Delta-7 starfighters engaged the enemy fleet: three warpod pinnaces, two Longprow attack cruisers, and five Z-95 Headhunters. Its shields damaged by the pirates' power gem, Monitor III sustained heavy damage right away, resulting in the demise of Hokken, Soludisan, and four Republic Judiciaries.

Suspected of being lost in the gravity well of nearby Vuchelle, none of the Jedi gave a second thought to the Headhunter; they were busy rounding up the escape pods. However, it is likely that the fighter did not burn up on reentry: most likely, this sole pilot was none other than Raskar, the only known survivor of the Pirates of Iridium."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After lying low for a while, Raskar\u2014in possession of the last surviving power gem\u2014would later become the enemy, then ally of none other than Han Solo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
