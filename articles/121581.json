The Jedi Order was determined to investigate the origins of these vessels and were also seeking the whereabouts of the Jedi Knight Vergere, who had gone missing while on a mission to the planet a year before. Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker were dispatched to investigate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the same time, a task force led by Raith Sienar and Blood Carver Ke Daiv were also dispatched to the planet at the compulsory behest of Wilhuff Tarkin, then a political leader of Eriadu and commander of the Republic Outland Regions Security Force. Tarkin sought, in his siezure of the mysterious \"living starship\"-producing world, political and economic advantages via recognition by the galaxy's rising powers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan arrived at the planet, they succeeded in getting an organic starship crafted, which they named Jabitha. They also discovered that Vergere had been taken by a mysterious alien species from the Unknown Regions known as the Far Outsiders\u2014actually the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Raith Sienar's squadron arrived and dispatched Ke Daiv to secure a highly coveted Sekotan starship. Unfortunately, Daiv was rejected by the seed-partners, the necessary sentient basis for the starship's construction. Soon after the news of this rejection had been received, Tarkin's forces converged upon Sienar's, as both the Security Force commander and the famous ship designer, mistrusting one another's motives, had double-crossed the other, which ultimately triggered detection of their presence by Sekot herself. Together they felt compelled, then, to unleash their forces on the living world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tarkin's fleet included two Trade Federation cargo haulers and ten light cruisers which served as escorts for the Galactic Republic's Dreadnaught-class heavy cruisers. Swarms of Vulture droids and sky-mines were unleashed on the peaceful world and its settlers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In response, the living world dispatched Zonama Sekotan fighters, though they were outnumbered. During the battle, Anakin and Jabitha Hal\u2014the Sekotan Magister's daughter\u2014were captured by Tarkin's forces, which intercepted the Jabitha."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Obi-Wan and Anakin managed to escape in their seedship, though it was wounded by enemy fire. In the end, Zonama Sekot left the sector of battle and, using its massive hyperdrive system, escaped into the Unknown Regions. The attacking forces were left severely crippled."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obi-Wan and Anakin flew the Jabitha to the planet Seline, where the living ship died from her wounds. In fact, all Sekotan ships throughout the galaxy, as a result of losing contact with Zonama Sekot, also died."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi and Skywalker's next mission was to the planet Kodai, in which they sought to recover the ancient Sith holocron of King Adas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
