The mask hid the signs of aging and would also store the memories of the wearer before he or she died, allowing the information to be retained after death and possibly passed on. The Dark Jedi Kueller wore one of these masks, colored white with black accents with tiny jewels embedded in the corners of both eye slits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the Scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars author Abel Pe\u00f1a wrote a passage for the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide where it was stated that Darth Nihilus' mask may have been a Hendanyn death mask.
