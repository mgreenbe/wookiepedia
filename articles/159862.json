At the meeting, the general questioned General Crix Madine on how the Alliance could get a team of commandos onto the moon to disable the Death Star's shield generator. He then suggested that false information be planted to suggest the Alliance had a new principal base which could act as a decoy for the Empire; however, Princess Leia Organa dismissed the idea and instead proposed that she lead a false recruiting mission to the Corva sector, where she would draw the Empire's attention as a moving target. Organa's plan was ultimately approved and carried out successfully, aiding in the Alliance's eventual victory at the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Veertag was first created for the Star Wars Legends comic book Star Wars 65, which was released by Marvel Comics in 1982.
