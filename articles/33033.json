Imperial sentry droids were used as guards and even combat training units. Many of the droids were stationed aboard Imperial vessels such as Class four container transports and Imperial Star Destroyers. The Spectres rebel cell, Hondo Ohnaka, and Azmorigan encountered four of the droids while looting an Imperial container transport. Later, Grand Admiral Thrawn used two of these droids as combat training units during his hand-to-hand exercises."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial sentry droids were sentry droids that could also be used for combat training."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Should one of the activated sentry droids fall under attack, the remaining deactivated droids would power on. The droids were somewhat humanoid and resembling the chassis of a Separatist B2-series super battle droid.

When the Spectres and the pirates Hondo Ohnaka and Azmorigan boarded the ship, they accidentally reactivated one of the sentry droids. This sentry droid knocked out Azmorigan and the rebel Garazeb Orrelios and threw them into the ship's brig. Later, Azmorigan managed to shoot the droid and destroy it. However, this activated the other sentry droids who attacked the rebels and pirates.
