During the war he commanded the Venator-class Star Destroyer Endurance while it made a training tour near the planet Vanqor. The young bounty hunter Boba Fett was able to infiltrate the ship and sabotage it, causing the Endurance to crash onto Vanqor's surface. Kilian refused to abandon his ship but survived the crash and was taken captive by Fett and his bounty hunter comrades along with Clone Commander CT-411 \"Ponds\" and a clone naval officer.
