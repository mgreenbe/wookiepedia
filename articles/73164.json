Kabe then heard a man and an alien talking about a imperial cruiser loaded with a valuable item aboard. Kabe eventually captured the item and gave it to the man which he gave her credits. Kabe then bought Blue milk from Wuher with those credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, Kabe was living with Muftak in the maintenance tunnels under Chalmun's, paying rent to Ackmena with proceeds obtained by petty theft and scams. She obtained the Kloo horn of Lirin D'avi from a drunken Muftak, who got it from Myo, who won it from D'avi's son Lirin Car'n, and pawned it to repay the debt Myo owed her and Muftak. When confronted by an angry Myo, she implicated Muftak. After several interrelated debts, including D'avi's plan to sell the horn to pay off Greedo, came together, Kabe found herself likely to be killed by Myo for stealing the horn if Muftak's bet with bounty hunter Djas Puhr (that Solo survive the day) didn't pan out. While waiting, she ordered a drink from Wuher at Chalmun's and shared it with Muftak. A few minutes later, she witnessed Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker fight with Dr. Cornelius Evazan and Ponda Baba. Shortly thereafter, Solo shot Greedo, resolving the situation to all the survivors' satisfaction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kabe used her annoying high pitched squeaks as an effective way to get the attention of Chalmun's Cantina bartender, Wuher."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kabe was a female Chadra-Fan, a species that averaged out at a height of 1 meter.
