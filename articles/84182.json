She was a member of the training group Gold Squadron under Captain Sormic, along with Lara Notsil and Lowan. Although not as good a pilot as Notsil, Lussatte was competent enough to come up with a plan that gave her an estimated one-in-four to one-in-two chance of survival against more experienced TIE/LN starfighter pilots, according to her commanding officer, as he reviewed the performance of Notsil that had gotten them both vaped in an exercise."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
