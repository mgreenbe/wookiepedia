Ajunta Pall was one of the Dark Jedi leading the campaign against the Jedi; Pall himself personally slew more than a dozen Jedi before the battle's end. The Dark Jedi were defeated after an orbital bombardment wave by the Jedi.

Using their training in the Force, the fallen Jedi amazed the Sith and elevated themselves to god-like status on Korriban and Ziost, becoming the rulers of the Sith people. As years passed, and interbreeding occurred between the Fallen Jedi and the Sith, the term \"Sith\" came to mean not only the original inhabitants of Ziost and Korriban, but also their fallen Jedi masters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
