Both groups put forward their own claimants to the title of Mand'alor\u2014the traditional ruler of the Mandalorian people\u2014in opposition to the Mand'alor chosen by the traditional warrior clans, with Death Watch following their own Secret Mandalore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable \"Anti-Mandalores\""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Satine Kryze"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The daughter of the Duke of Clan Kryze, Satine Kryze hailed from the planet Kalevala. During the Great Clan Wars, as the Death Watch attempted to overthrow the New Mandalorian regime in a bloody civil war, Kryze's father sent her away to Coruscant\u2014capital world of the Galactic Republic\u2014in order to gain an education in diplomacy and statecraft, and be free of the violence that would eventually claim the clan leader's life. When Kryze returned to the Mandalore system, she did so under the protection of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi; for months, Kryze was under constant threat from the Death Watch and its allies, but as time went on, Kryze was able to use the skills she had learned and her own charisma to rally war-weary chieftains to the New Mandalorian cause and bring about peace. Following the end of the Great Clan Wars, Kryze was appointed Mand'alor by the New Mandalorian people, in opposition to Jango Fett, who held claim to the title among the warrior clans, and Death Watch's Secret Mandalore, Tor Vizsla. As Mand'alor of the New Mandalorians, Kryze set about rebuilding the damage incurred to Mandalore during the Great Clan Wars, leading New Mandalorian society and its capital city Sundari to prosperity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Kryze strove to ensure Mandalore would remain neutral in the conflict, though the peace she had made came under siege by the re-emergence of the Death Watch. Though Kryze was able to overcome their initial schemes and attempts on her life to solidify Mandalore's neutrality, as the Clone Wars went on, her rule was marred with severe food shortages, a rise in corruption, and mass poisonings throughout New Mandalorian territory as a result of toxin-laced tea imported by Moogan smugglers. In 20 BBY, Death Watch allied with the criminal contingent known as the Shadow Collective to bring down the New Mandalorians: public opinion swayed against Kryze as offworld gangsters from Black Sun to the Hutt Cartel mercilessly gunned down civilians and caused panic, only for the Death Watch to arrive and act as saviors of the people, defeating and arresting their secret allies in a show of apparent heroism. With the support of her people gone, Kryze was deposed and imprisoned, replaced by Pre Vizsla, the Death Watch's latest Secret Mandalore. Weeks later, when her old friend Obi-Wan Kenobi came to Mandalore in order to rescue Kryze from prison, she was murdered before the Jedi Master's eyes by the Sith Lord Darth Maul, who had been in collusion with Vizsla during his coup and sought to pain Kenobi with his one-time lover's death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
