The vessel was stationed in the Poln system, in the Candoras sector, where it was the single Imperial ship posted to defend the planet Poln Minor, and by the time of the Galactic Civil War, the vessel was old and not fully functional. In 0 ABY, fifty Caldorf VII interceptor missiles carried by the Sarissa were removed, purportedly to be sent to the Spillwater Fleet base, to be checked for malfunctions. In fact, the order to remove the missiles had secretly been issued by Senior Captain Thrawn, as part of a ploy to allow the weapons to fall into the hands of the alien warlord Nuso Esva. About a week later, a force of Imperial ships from Teptixii arrived in the Poln system near Poln Minor and the Sarissa joined with the flotilla. Shortly afterward, Esva's Eastern Fleet attacked the system, and during the engagement, the Sarissa left its orbit to join the battle, in support of the Star Destroyer Admonitor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
