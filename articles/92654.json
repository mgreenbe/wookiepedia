Using sophisticated machinery, an edge was honed down to mono-molecular thickness and then toughened through laser-forging techniques to keep it sharp. The resulting edge, while not as powerful as a Monomolecular blade, was nevertheless exceedingly sharp, and capable of impressive cutting power."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
