It was the homeworld of the Vurk, including Jedi Master Coleman Trebor. Sembla had four moons, which kept it tidally and tectonically active, and its terrain was made up of shallow seas and volcanic islands. The planet was located far from any major trade routes and as such, was rarely traveled to. However, the Galactic Empire established a research base on the world and also pressed native Vurk as cheap labor in strip-mining operations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sembla was first created for \"Who's Who in the Jedi Order\", a Star Wars Legends article written by Greg Keyes and David West Reynolds and published in Star Wars Insider 62 in 2002.
