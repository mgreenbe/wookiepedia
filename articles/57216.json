Many were fitted with repulsorlift platform, meaning that they could easily be transported across the battlefield quickly, laying down barrages and relocating before counter-battery fire could be called down. The market leader could shoot grenades at a rate of one every 1.2 seconds at a range of over one kilometer. A sound dampener was often added to give the weapon a degree of stealth, while it boasted a sophisticated targeting computer in order to compensate dark or foggy conditions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The grenade mortar could also be loaded onto a two-person repulsorlift platform, increasing the ammo capacity to five hundred grenades and the top speed to 250 kilometers per hour. To reach these speeds the platform was powered by an X-7a repulsorlift engine and four thrust vectors. The main disadvantage of this platform though was its weakness, a simple blaster shot could do considerable damage and the pilot and gunner were left dangerously open. The grenade launcher could, however, be exchanged with an E-Web heavy repeating blaster if the situation called for it. Four or more platforms normally worked together to lay down light ordnance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
