Consisting of at least a dozen squads, the plan was devised by one of the squad leaders, Carver. Following a lengthy effort to take out an Imperial AT-ST, First Sergeant Hazram Namir and his squad watched the flashes of the battle erupt from afar and predicted the fort would be defeated soon enough.
