Coruscant Security Force patrols often clashed with members of the Migrant Merchants' Guild in an attempt to keep the peace, and had, at the zenith of its power, begun applying its influence less towards shaking down local businesses and more towards interfering in planetary politics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Guild was decimated by the death of Abiss Sol'oras and many of its members as well as the Coruscant Security crackdown following the Migrant Merchants' Guild armed insurrection."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
