To do so T1-N1 was equipped with various illegal modifications, including a blaster integrated into his chassis. When Lorso's personal assistance droid B-4D4-GE3 was reprogrammed to steal incriminating evidence on Lorso from the mainframe to present to the Telosian government, T1-N1 quickly became suspicious. To prevent T1-N1 from exposing him, B-4D4 revealed to him that he had broken his behavioral inhibitors years ago by knowingly allowing his owner Lorso to harm sentient life, and that Opo Chano regularly gave him memory wipes to prevent him from realizing this fact and going berserk. After this revelation, T1-N1 excitedly broke out of the mainframe and began firing indiscriminately on all Czerka employees that stood between him and his escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, he and B-4D4 would both escape the corporation and sneak aboard a shuttle bound for Nar Shaddaa, the only transport they could find where they could disguise themselves as cargo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While many utility droids were infamous for developing personality quirks, T1-N1 was both aggressive and unstable.
