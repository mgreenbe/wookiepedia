One soldier, Hazram Namir, disliked the droid for his ability to think, but was advised many times to trust him. In 3 ABY, the Thunderstrike was involved in a battle with a reconnaissance squadron in the Kontahr sector. Over three weeks later, after departing the planet Coyerti, the corvette and its escort, the Braha'tok-class gunship Apailana's Promise were pursued by Imperial forces through the Metatessu sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "M2-M5 discovered a hypermatter particle leak from a radiation refractor which, despite being microscopic, left a trail for the Empire to track. The droid suspected that the leak had arose from the battle in the Kontahr sector and been discovered by the Empire at Coyerti. M2-M5 further overheard chatter from the Thunderstrike's bridge which talked of three Imperial battle groups abandoning rebel engagements to hunt Twilight Company. When Namir, by this point a First Sergeant, talked with M2-M5, the droid asked Namir of the chatter he had heard. After the pair then exchanged over M2-M5's use of time, the droid used its sensors to show the presence of the leak to the first sergeant, explaining his suspicions about how it arose and first came to be tracked. Namir told him to send a full report to Captain Micha Evon about the problem."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Sacrifice"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the infiltration of the Thunderstrike in the Elochar sector, Twilight Company took refuge at an abandoned podracing track on the planet Ankhural. M2-M5 became the company's acting chief of engineering, and led the repair teams in fixing the damaged corvette. The droid himself made repairs to the Thunderstrike from the outside, wrapped in transparent duraplast to protect his joints from dust. He gave the repair crews mocking remarks among his instructions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Twilight Company soon began a new mission, attacking numerous Imperial installations along the Rimma Trade Route. At the night of the company's departure from the ocean moon Obumubo, Namir visited M2-M5, delivering a report to the droid. Around two weeks later, Twilight Company captured the Inyusu Tor mineral processing facility on the manufacturing planet Sullust. However, when the Thunderstrike attempted to retrieve the ground troops, the corvette was ambushed by a squadron of TIE fighters, which shot the vessel down. M2-M5 attempted to protect some of the company's personnel, being destroyed when the Thunderstrike crashed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Twilight squads went to the Thunderstrike to rescue the surviving crew, M2-M5's parts were found scattered in the corvettes medical bay. With the droid gone, the engineer Vifra replaced him as the chief of engineering.

He had a sardonic impression on the first sergeant, who didn't trust machines who could think but still considered the droid as the best mechanic in Twilight Company. M2-M5 referred to the Thunderstrike as his own, and as head of engineering, the droid blasted the repair teams with snide comments as he gave them instructions on Ankhural. He was also more tolerable than most of the repair crew to receiving reports at abnormal hours. When the Thunderstrike crashed on Sullust, M2-M5 tried to protect Twilight personnel, being destroyed in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "M2-M5's left arm was equipped with an assortment of metal picks and other tools, which could extend and retract in and out of the droid's wrist. M2-M5's hands were fitted with sensors that notably allowed the droid to detect hypermatter particle leaks. The sensors light on the droid's instruments went red from green to indicate such leaks. When operating outside the Thunderstrike on Ankhural, M2-M5 donned transparent duraplast to protect the his joints from dust."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "M2-M5 appeared in the 2015 novel, Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
