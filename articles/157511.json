Around the same time that the escort carrier Kathol Protector\u2014a starship serving in the military forces of the Imperial warlord Moff Kentor Sarne\u2014attacked Domaz, the capital city of the planet Kolatill, this vessel was attacked. The assault crippled the vessel, leaving it adrift between planets. The derelict was discovered by a starfighter patrol from the New Republic CR90 corvette FarStar, which was in-system responding to a distress signal from Kolatill. The corvette's crew deployed a rescue team to investigate the wreck and see if any survivors were sealed in airtight sections."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The starship was mentioned in the roleplaying adventure \"Omens,\" part of The DarkStryder Campaign, published by West End Games in 1995.
