These devices were used by the Inquisitors of the Galactic Empire. The First Order used a similar chair, one was located aboard the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer, was used by the dark warrior Kylo Ren on his captives, and it contained a number of devices that caused pain across a prisoner's body. A similar chair was located aboard Starkiller Base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kylo Ren used the chair on the Finalizer on the then-captive Poe Dameron, in order to interrogate him regarding the whereabouts of the map piece leading to Luke Skywalker's location. He later used the chair on Rey after bringing her to Starkiller Base in an attempt to interrogate her via the Force to locate Skywalker's location from her mind via her memories due to her seeing the map. However, this backfired on Ren when Rey ended up probing Ren in turn and learned his fear of his not being as strong as his grandfather and idol, the infamous Imperial enforcer Darth Vader. She then attempted to use a Mind trick on the stormtrooper tasked with guarding her, ultimately succeeding on the third try in not only having him leave the door open, but also loosening the restraints, allowing her an easy escape. Ren, upon discovering this, then proceeded to destroy the chair in a rage-induced tantrum, with two Stormtroopers clearing the area upon hearing the commotion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early rebellion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire, the Inquisitorius' Grand Inquisitor, used it to interrogate Spectres' leader and former Jedi Padawan, Kanan Jarrus.
