The adventure suggests that players could rent repulsorcarts and use them to transport a stunned courier that they need to capture, although players are free to use any method to try and subdue and move their target. A distraction for the heroes is later described involving a struggling elderly Chadra-Fan whom they can aid, although they are free to ignore her entirely."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
