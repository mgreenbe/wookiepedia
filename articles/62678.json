Shortly after the Battle of Naboo, Toodo was tasked by his employer, the Hutt casino-owner Beeda, with eliminating some individuals who had meddled with the Hutt's affairs. To that end, Toodo traveled to the port town Akmalla on a planet near to Hutt Space and deceived the individuals into gaining possession of the freighter Radiant Splendor. Toodo's targets then departed aboard their new starship and the Duros pursued them in the Hot Streak, planning to remotely deactivate the cage of a Corellian sand panther that was being carried aboard the Splendor, so that it could kill the individuals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
