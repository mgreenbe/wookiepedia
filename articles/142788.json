Some were presented as in-universe annotations by characters in the episode (as though accessed from a historical archive of events during the Clone Wars), while others feature real-world references, or references to information the character would have no knowledge of. Therefore, it is doubtful that all the annotations should be considered canonical. Decoded began on May 1, 2009, and continued to run every Friday at 9 p.m. ET/PT, the regular time slot for the series. Decoded continued until October 2, 2009, the premiere of Season Two.
