As the planet's supplies had been recently attacked by pirates, Amidala sought to ensure that Rodia remained allied with the Galactic Republic. Yet, Onaconda Farr, Rodia's representative in the Galactic Senate, had allied himself with Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Upon her arrival in the Senatorial Palace on Rodia, Amidala was taken captive, to be given to Gunray as part of the arrangement. After Amidala's protocol droid, C-3PO, and Representative Jar Jar Binks were attacked by battle droids in the palace hangar, Binks accidentally crushed Amidala's yacht with a magnetic hoist. Binks and C-3PO resolved to rescue Amidala from the palace's detention tower; however, when Binks found a Jedi robe in the yacht and put it on, the Confederate forces mistook him for a Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Gunray arrived to collect Amidala, the viceroy revealed that he intended to execute her, and Farr began to mistrust the viceroy. Amidala broke out of her cell, while Binks, unaware of her escape, attempted to rescue her. C-3PO went to contact any Republic clone troopers within range for support, and Amidala engaged the Confederate droids. Binks slipped underwater, but a homing torpedo aimed at the Gungan exploded, and he was presumed dead. After contacting a nearby Republic convoy, C-3PO was arrested. As Confederate droidekas prepared to execute Amidala and C-3PO, however, Binks reappeared, and a Kwazel Maw that had befriended and saved the Gungan attacked the droids. Gunray fled, but he was apprehended by Amidala and Farr and taken into custody.

Senator Onaconda Farr, Rodia's representative in the Galactic Senate, returned to his homeworld with the Senate's Rodian delegation. A Senatorial vote for a relief effort to Rodia was postponed, and Farr contacted his longtime friend, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, but was unable to speak with her, as she was preoccupied with other business. The Rodians on the planet starved, and Farr began to lose hope."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To help his people, the Rodian senator entered into an alliance with Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Gunray held a grudge against Amidala from the Trade Federation's defeat on her homeworld of Naboo in 32 BBY, and in exchange for her capture as a prisoner of war, Farr was promised relief supplies. Farr himself was confident that he could use his status to prevent harm from befalling Amidala while she was in Confederate captivity. Battle droids were dispatched to Rodia to aid in Amidala's capture. Amidala learned of the pirate attack on Rodia, and to ensure that the planet remained loyal to the Republic, she traveled to Rodia, accompanied by her protocol droid, C-3PO, and Representative Jar Jar Binks.

Silood, Farr's aide, took Amidala to the Rodian senator. Farr confronted Amidala on the Republic's lack of support for Rodia, and then revealed his alliance with Gunray, regretfully stating that he had already done what was necessary for his people's survival. With that, a squad of Confederate droids appeared and surrounded Amidala. Farr opened a hololink, allowing communications between Amidala and Gunray to proceed. Amidala attempted to contact C-3PO and Binks via comlink, but the battle droids seized her device and crushed it before escorting Amidala away. The senator was imprisoned and shackled inside a cell of the palace's detention tower until the Neimoidian viceroy arrived for his \"prize.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back in the hangar, B1 battle droids arrived and confronted C-3PO and Binks. While trying to re-board Amidala's yacht, the Gungan Representative accidentally closed the ship's door. As Binks ran for cover from the droids' laser fire, his foot snagged on a cable, activating a large magnetic hoist. The Gungan was able to stop the magnet from crushing C-3PO, but he then accidentally activated the hoist's magnetization, and the protocol droid was attached to the hoist. Binks was able to maneuver the magnet so that it swung and smashed the droids, but a crab droid appeared and attacked the Gungan. As Binks evaded the droid, he was bucked onto the droid's body by one of its legs, and the crab droid tried to throw the Gungan off. The droid strayed too close to the edge of the hangar, however, and a helpless C-3PO watched as both droid and Gungan fell off the edge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Binks was able to climb up the edge of the hangar, and deactivating the hoist's magnetization, the Gungan released C-3PO from his suspension.

Binks deduced that if battle droids had attacked them, Amidala had to be in trouble.

Farr and Silood led the viceroy and a battle droid patrol to the detention tower; overhearing that Amidala was being held in the tower, Binks planned to rescue the senator. However, while Binks conferred with C-3PO, the droids spotted the robe-clad Gungan and mistook Binks for a Jedi. The battle droids attacked the duo, and while C-3PO surrendered, Binks fled and tripped. Losing his robe, he fell through a grate into a body of water below. While the battle droids continued their search for the \"Jedi,\" C-3PO was taken to the dismantling center, and the Rodians escorted Gunray to the detention center. Binks, however, discovered that he had landed on a Kwazel Maw, and was able to escape the creature and reclaim the Jedi robe.

Unaware of Amidala's escape, the Gungan climbed vines on the side of the tower to get to the detention cells. As Farr and Silood led Gunray to the tower, the viceroy revealed that the Rodians' request for supplies would be \"taken into consideration\" once Amidala had been executed, and Farr realized his mistake in joining the Confederacy.

Amidala appeared, and while she engaged the droids, Binks slipped out of his robe and back underwater. A B2-HA series super battle droid dropped several thermal detonators into the water, and the Gungan quickly swam away from the explosives. As the detonators went off, C-3PO tricked several battle droids guarding a communications room, telling them that the Jedi had been spotted in the south port. The unsuspecting battle droids vacated their post, and the protocol droid entered the communications room. Although C-3PO was able to send a message to a nearby clone trooper deployment, the battle droids discovered C-3PO's treachery.

As Binks swam away from the torpedo, the Kwazel Maw he had encountered earlier suddenly appeared. However, as the Gungan fled from the Kwazel Maw, he found himself caught between the creature and the torpedo. Binks was able to befriend the Kwazel Maw, and the creature took the Gungan into its mouth shortly before the torpedo went off. As Amidala fled from the battle droids, the homing torpedo exploded, and she believed Binks to have been killed.

The battle droids were unable to penetrate the creature's thick hide, and the Kwazel Maw eliminated the droids. Gunray fled back to the palace's hangar with several battle droids, seeking to escape Rodia. However, Amidala was able to obtain one of the battle droids' blasters, and after eliminating the viceroy's droid guards, she cornered Gunray.

Farr thanked both Binks and Amidala for their assistance, and Rodia remained allied to the Republic. Gunray's actions on Rodia made him an open enemy of the Republic, and it was decided that he would stand trial for his war crimes on the galactic capital of Coruscant so that the Republic could rally support for the war. Senior Jedi General Luminara Unduli arrived on Rodia to escort Gunray in a Consular-class cruiser to her flagship, the Tranquility, which was assigned to be his escort ship to Coruscant. General Skywalker was meanwhile battling enemy forces on another planet. However, Skywalker learned that Amidala had been involved in Gunray's capture and was potentially in danger from the Confederacy. Because he was needed on the planet to command the Republic forces, Skywalker was unable to leave for Rodia, but he instead sent his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, to protect his secret wife and aid in transporting Gunray to Coruscant. Once the Jedi were aboard the Tranquility with Gunray, the Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress undertook a mission to free the viceroy, for it was believed that the Neimoidian would not last long under Jedi interrogation and would soon reveal Confederate secrets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lapiz Cutter, which had been pushed into a swamp on Rodia, was eventually rescued for Gunray's continued use.

Dissatisfied with Farr's \"moral right\" to lead the Rodians in the Senate and believing him to be weak, Purs developed a grudge against him and eventually poisoned him, resulting in his death.
