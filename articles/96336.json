When the regions of Ontotho united to form a government in order to enter into the Galactic Republic, Neralli and the Fylari refused to join, seeing no benefit of doing so. When Dylanto Daa of the Daa Corporation wished to excavate a temple that had been discovered in the Fylar region, the Fylari refused. The Jedi Eno Cordova and Cere Junda were sent to negotiate with the Fylari by Daa, but came under attack. The Fylari rescued Junda, and Neralli spoke with the Padawan, believing that the Daa Corporation had organized the attacks in order to get the government to see the Fylari as hostile."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
