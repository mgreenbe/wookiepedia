However, after speaking with her host, Goran Beviin, the true nature of the song was explained to Solo, though she preferred her own interpretation to the much simpler truth."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Chant"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Mando'a"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Naasad'guur mhi,"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Naasad'guur mhi,"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Naasad'guur mhi,"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mhi n'ulu."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mhi Mando'ade,"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kandosii'ade,"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teh Manda'yaim,"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mando'ade."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Basic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "No one likes us,"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "No one likes us,"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "No one likes us,"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "We don't care."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "We are Mandos,"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The elite boys,"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mando boys,"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From Mandalore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This drinking chant was first introduced to Star Wars canon in the opening epigraph of the tenth chapter of the Republic Commando novel, Republic Commando: True Colors.
