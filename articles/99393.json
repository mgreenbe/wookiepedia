Following the sense of suffering and pain within the Citadel, Vader eventually led the pair to what appeared to be the Citadel's heart.

As Vader was drawn towards the chamber, Ochi attempted to persuade Vader to come back with him to broker peace with Sidious. Vader ignored him, as Ochi followed him into the chamber, they discovered its contents: the peak of a subterranean mountain of kyber crystal.

When Vader asked his master his will, the Emperor told him to decide that for himself. Vader then called Ochi over and the Emperor allowed him to leave with the Sith Lord. Traveling to a remote outpost somewhere in the Outer Rim, they met with a Hutt named Bokku. Ochi asked Bokku for the whereabouts of Han Solo, to which Bokku reported that Jabba had lost Solo and would recover him. However, Ochi then told the Hutt that he would recover Solo himself in exchange for power. When Bokku asked Ochi if he served the Emperor, Ochi replied that they both served Vader now."}, {"tag": "h5", "text": "Ambush at Zee-Nine City Seven"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader was then attacked by a group of Gamorrean guards, which the Sith Lord slew with ease. Bokku quickly apologized for not recognizing Vader and reiterated that he didn't know where Solo was. From this, Ochi determined that Jabba had likely hired someone to find Solo and asked Bokku for their identity. Bokku expressed fear at the idea of betraying Jabba until Ochi pried into Bokku's willingness to take over the Grand Hutt Council himself. Bokku then revealed that he had been tracking the hunters who had taken Jabba's bounty and that one crew of droids had gone in a different direction from the others. Bokku told Vader the droids were deep in the heart of Hutt Space and that it would be better to go in Bokku's barge so as not to scare them away. On their way to the droids' location, Bokku inquired as to his compensation for his assistance, to which Vader assured him that he would be rewarded. He also asked Ochi if Vader could be trusted, to which Ochi replied that there was no safe haven anywhere and that the only way to survive was to find the biggest monster to stand behind. Under the piloting of Bokku's nav droid Gak-Sixtoo, they arrived at Zee-Nine City Seven while Vader and Ochi boarded their Lambda shuttle. But as they approached the city, their ship's engines were shut down, causing them to crash. After escaping the wreckage, Vader and Ochi were confronted by the Droid Crush Pirates, who expressed shock at Ochi's service to Vader.

Vader informed the droid that he had information he required and commanded him to lay down his weapons, to which IG-88 replied that Vader would only access his information by downloading it from his severed head. Vader went to attack IG-88, but the droid then took out a device and used it to slice into Vader's armor, taking control of the Sith Lord. As IG-88 forced Vader to hold his own saber to his head, Vader demanded to know who had given the droid the code to breach his armor. IG-88 responded that the terms of his employment prevented him from sharing that information. While the droid was distracted, Vader used the Force to take the device from him, allowing him to use it against his attacker. Vader then forced IG-88 to hold his own blaster to his head and pull the trigger, incapacitating him. Vader then continued his fight against the pirates until Bokku's barge fired upon him. Vader blocked the blasts with his lightsaber and redirected the energy at the pirates, knocking them back along with Ochi. As the pirates retreated, Ochi ordered the droid captain to reveal Solo's location. However, the droid captain simply laughed and said he would kill Ochi next time, to which Ochi said he couldn't wait. Vader then took IG-88's hand and used it to access a terminal he had been using earlier. Upon activating the terminal, Vader and Ochi discovered various dead ends that the droid had been chasing, as well as the symbol of crime syndicate Crimson Dawn. After acquiring IG-88's information, Vader returned to Bokku's barge and confronted him over his betrayal. When Vader asked the Hutt what he had learned, Bokku conceded that the Sith could not be defeated, which Ochi noted was a good answer."}, {"tag": "h5", "text": "Auction for Han Solo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After discovering that Sly Moore had hired the droid, Vader and Ochi returned to Coruscant to find her, her court and IG-88 in Administrative Temple Garden 313A. As Vader struck down IG-88 once again, Moore and her court fled into the Imperial Palace. As they attempted to escape into the streets, Vader used the Force to close the door in front of them. However, Moore then took out another remote and used it to freeze Vader in his own armor, allowing her and her court to open fire on the Sith Lord. But this did not last as Vader overcame the Umbaran's control and struck down her entire court. Moore tried once more to take control of Vader, but Ochi revealed that Vader had fixed that vulnerability in his armor. Vader then knocked the remote out of Moore's hand and told her that she could not bend his will. Moore responded that she only wanted to see if Vader was still plagued by fear, to which Vader said that the only fear in that place was hers. Moore conceded that he could kill her effortlessly, but also pointed out that doing so would do nothing to save him from Luke Skywalker. When Vader asked the Umbaran what she knew of Skywalker, she revealed that the key to finding him, his friend Han Solo was currently being sold by Crimson Dawn. She also pointed out that if she secured Solo for Vader, then the Emperor would not learn of his plans. When Ochi asked Moore why Vader should trust her, the Umbaran answered that she would be delighted to reunite Vader with the only person who could kill him, to which Vader agreed and Ochi laughed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after, Ochi and Moore left for Jekara along with a few Imperial officers to attend the Auction for Han Solo, which was led by Crimson Dawn's leader, Lady Qi'ra. Once the bidding began within the Vermillion, Moore attempted to bid for the smuggler, but soon found herself in conflict with Jabba, Bokku and the rest of the attending Hutts. While the Umbaran was able to use the Force to weaken the minds of the other bidders, she found that the Hutts were too strong-willed for her to manipulate. After losing the bid, Moore took Ochi aside and asked why Bokku was bidding against her. Ochi explained to her that Vader had only sent her there to humiliate her in the Emperor's eyes.
