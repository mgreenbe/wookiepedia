A student of the Temple's academy, Corobb was eventually taken as a Padawan after passing his last academy tests by the master illusionist Yarael Poof. After years of one-on-one study with Jedi Master Poof and crafting a blue-bladed lightsaber, Corobb passed the Trials of Knighthood and was made a Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time the Separatist Crisis had erupted between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Jedi Corobb was a Master himself and took the Human Drake Lo'gaan as his Padawan during the Clone Wars. Taking up the mantle of General in the Grand Army of the Republic, Corobb trained Lo'gaan on the battlefield. In the final year of war, Corobb was stationed on Coruscant when General Grievous, leader of the Separatist fleet, emerged from hyperspace in the skies of Galactic City. Along with Jedi Roth-Del Masona, Foul Moudama, and B'ink Utrila, Corobb was assigned to reinforce Masters Shaak Ti and Stass Allie in locating and protecting the Supreme Chancellor. As the Republic war machine fought to protect the capital planet, Corobb and his team were rushing Chancellor Palpatine into a bunker deep in the crust of Coruscant. As Master Shaak Ti fought to defend the doors to the bunker, Grievous slipped past unnoticed and engaged the four Jedi protecting Palpatine in a lightsaber duel. Grievous toyed with the Jedi for a time before decapitating Masona first. Corobb, who accidentally kicked Masona's head across the room during the fight, lost his focus and became distracted long enough for Grievous to kill him with a stab to the heart before finishing the remaining two defenders."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Corobb's Padawan was captured by Darth Vader, the Dark Lord after surviving the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire; the Dark Lord told Lo'gaan that it was Shaak Ti and Mace Windu who killed the Ithorian.

Known as a swordsman of legendary degree, Corobb was a highly skilled practitioner of Form 5, Djem So, often utilizing the reverse-grip.
