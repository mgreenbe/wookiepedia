The gates were placed in selective spots on the outer parts of the city to keep unwanted intruders from entering the city from unguarded posts. The gates required a password to be entered that Royal Security Force soldiers had to memorize, although, some occasionally forgot. Once the password was read, the gate would go through a series of movements that packed the gate away to the sides. One such gate separated the Gardens of Theed and the inner city, which was not breached by the Trade Federation droids during the invasion, leaving the battle droids to find other means into the city. As a result, the droids opted to crash tanks or troop transports through walls, even leveling buildings to go around the gates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
