The NightWhispers were often used for missions which required stealth in order to gain access to the enemy. As a veteran unit, NightWhisper commandos were more skilled than most Storm Commando units and had access to heavy supporting firepower. During a search for a crashed Rebel operative on NCW-781, the NightWhispers were supported by a Strike-class medium cruiser, TIE/sa bombers, CompForce assault troops, and a HAVr A9 Floating Fortress; in addition they were able to call in the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Rampage to interdict a fleeing Alliance Special Forces rescue team."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
