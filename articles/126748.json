Using stolen information on the Republic superweapon initiative, Angral dispatched his apprentices to seize control of several Republic superweapon programs. Angral's apprentice, Lord Sadic, was sent to the moon Nar Shaddaa, where the Republic had been developing the Power Guard Enhancement System\u2014a program of cybernetic enhancements and adrenal stimulants that produced supersoldiers. After capturing the Power Guard recruitment center, Sadic learned of the main Power Guard Cybernetics Lab's location in Nar Shaddaa's Red Light Sector, and his forces quickly took control of the facility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, when Sadic learned of a young Jedi Knight's arrival at the recruitment center and that the Knight was searching for the cybernetics lab, the Sith ordered his forces to take the project data and equipment to his lab in the prison district of Shadow Town.

With the help of the Republic Strategic Information Service, the Republic's intelligence agency, the Jedi Knight and a companion tracked down the lab by damaging power conduits throughout the Red Light Sector in order to determine which building had a separate power source."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The skirmish"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Entering the lab, the Knight and a companion dispatched the guards and the two scientists within the facility.

Anxious to avenge his men's deaths, Graul activated the three Mark I Power Guards that were still in the lab, and Sadic ended the communication as battle was joined. Though the Power Guards were equipped with advanced armor and weapons, Graul and the Power Guards were unable to defeat the Knight and the Jedi's companion, who killed the officer and dispatched the droid-like supersoldiers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the fighting ended, the Knight searched Graul's body and discovered an encrypted datapad, though the rest of the facility yielded no clues as to Sadic's location.
