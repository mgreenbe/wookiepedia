The bean grew plentifully on the Outer Rim world, and was harvested and exported to the Core Worlds as a luxury foodstuff; this cultivation was particularly encouraged following the Imperial annexation of the Cassander sector shortly before the Battle of Yavin. The Garqi caf beans produced gourmet-quality caf, a bitter, caffeinated beverage brewed with hot water and ground beans. According to the Jedi Knight Corran Horn, who spent some time on the planet in 6 ABY, the Garqians never mastered the art of brewing caf beans into decent caf, despite hosting numerous tapcafes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Author Michael Stackpole created caf beans for his novel The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin, published by Del Rey in 2000; however, he had previously mentioned the drink caf in several of his other novels.
