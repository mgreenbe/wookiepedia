When many of their weapons were found in the hands of the Rebel Alliance, ISB agents were sent to investigate the company. Soon after, both Kashnir Arms factories were shut down and their major production equipment was loaded into freighters and lifted off planet. Some time after this, it was revealed that the company had been largely owned by influential Alliance supporters through a front corporation. It was later discovered, when the KX-80 repeating blaster rifle came into production, that Kashnir Arms had once again started operating, this time under Alliance direction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
