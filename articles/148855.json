It made the ARG formally part of the Rebel Alliance; consequently, an Outer Rim Communications Center was established on Generis, with a starfighter complement for protection. In addition, the Alliance also sent several dozen Alliance Special Forces officers to train up the Atrivis resistance. The Treaty led to an increased flow of new weapons and equipment to the Atrivis sector, in return for becoming a prime supplier of foodstuffs to the wider Rebellion. Within six months, the ARG had transformed into the Atrivis Sector Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
