Over the next decades, the ship fell out of Solo's hands and was stolen by a succession of criminals and thieves, ending up in the ownership of the trader Unkar Plutt on Jakku, a remote world in the Western Reaches.

Its basic shape was defined by two convex saucers welded together, a pair of front-facing mandibles and an outrigger-style, side-mounted cockpit with transparisteel viewports. Apart from the shape of its chassis, the Falcon retained very little of its off-the-dock instrumentation. Because its successive owners either upgraded or downgraded every system according to their personal specifications, the freighter ended up becoming a unique ship. These customizations, however, came at the price of reliability, and the Falcon was known to suffer frequent breakdowns in the heat of battle. After the circular military-grade sensor dish was lost during the Battle of Endor, the dish was replaced with the base rectangular model which was originally supplied with the ship. During the Battle of Crait the Falcon again lost its rectenna, and it was replaced with a military-grade rectenna similar to that of the one lost during the Battle of Endor.

Although the regular SSP05 was a Class 1 hyperdrive, the one that equipped the Falcon had been jury-rigged \"Vandangante style\" into a Class 0.5 drive\u2014twice as fast as most warships of the Galactic Empire. According to Ralsius Paldora, the Millennium Falcon's hyperdrive failed 1.22 times more than the one on the YT-2400 light freighter. In addition to its renowned hyperdrive, which supposedly made the Falcon the \"fastest ship in the galaxy,\" the ship was equipped with a backup hyperdrive. It was much slower than the primary engine and often took several weeks or months to reach the nearest star system."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Armament, hull, and shields"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The weaponry of the Millennium Falcon was normally suited for a much larger warship.

As such, Calrissian modified the two cargo mandibles at the front into an auxiliary ship launch, thus turning the plain freighter into a unique starship. However, Calrissian was injured during a raid on Kessel, leaving the smuggler Han Solo and Wookiee Chewbacca in command of the ship. During the escape from Kessel, Calrissian uploaded L3 to the Falcon as the ship's navigational system, assisting the crew in making the Kessel Run in under 13 parsecs. During the Kessel run the ship was majorly damaged by TIE fighters, with one blasting a hole in the front of the Falcon. After destroying the fighters Han slid the Falcon over an asteroid which destroyed two of the Falcon's landing gears.
