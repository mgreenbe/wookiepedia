Part of the Cold War-era Senate, Barc represented the interests of his constituents by serving on Coruscant, having offices in the Senate Building. After careful analysis of the Imperial military, Senator Barc began to believe that the use of slavery could be the key to beating the Sith and returning the Republic to dominance. Purchasing an entire shipment of Rylothian slave collars, Barc intended to use the collars in the Republic Military to bolster the Republic's numbers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Barc's shipment arrived on Coruscant members of the Migrant Merchants' Guild hijacked the shipment and they were dispersed among the Guild's members in the Old Galactic Market. Displeased by the hijacking, Senator Barc ordered the Coruscant Security Force to locate the shipment and return it to his office. When Captain Denal-zon's men were bogged down on the Galactic Market concourse, a representative of the Senator named Heerimus tipped of another individual to track down the shipment and return it. While the independent individual did collect the slave collars, Captain Denal-zon caught up to them and was able to convince the individual to bring the illegal chips to him for destruction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Doli-bur Barc appears in the Star Wars: The Old Republic Coruscant quest called \"The Senator's Stolen Goods\".
