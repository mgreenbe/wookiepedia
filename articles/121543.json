The first point of the operation was for Antilles to enter the system and scout for any weakness in the enemy fleet. Then he was to send the most tactically suitable entry points to the other two fleets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, just before Antilles' fleet went in, the Yuuzhan Vong released their latest creation, the mabugat kan, which brought down several HoloNet relay stations. Since the entire operation depended on HoloNet transmissions to coordinate their attack, Antilles was unable to call in the other fleets for help. His fleet was trapped in a system full of hostiles, and the formation took heavy losses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many of his ships were destroyed in the battle, most notably the Interdictor Cruiser Memory of Ithor commanded by General Pash Cracken.

Only an order by Antilles to reduce the Mon Mothma's shields saved the fleet.
