Chairman Port accused the people of Vorzyd V, which emerged to be a competitive planet. He told his problem to the Jedi Council and Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi were sent there to solve the problem. They finally discovered that was not Vorzyd V's fault, but the Freelies'. These actions got Vorzyd IV and Vorzyd V close to war, but finally Port met with Felana, leader of Vorzyd V, to close down the misunderstanding. He was injured in an explosion caused by the Freelies, but was not mortally wounded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
