The dessert was a fusion of Gungan and Naboo cuisines created during the cultural mingling of the two peoples that occurred in the wake of the Invasion of Naboo. Plasma cloud recipes required carefully infusing the egg whites of the Pikobi, a flightless avian native to Naboo, with plasma mined from the planet. When properly prepared, the resulting dish was considered light and refreshing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
