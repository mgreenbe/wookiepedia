After the Battle of Geonosis, the 416th Star Corps was placed under command of Jedi General K'Kruhk. Early in the war, it participated in the Battle of Teyr, which was a terribly costly battle. Many clones died, despite K'Kruhk's best efforts, and the Whiphid considered calling off the attack to save the lives of the others."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The troops under his command, however, persuaded him otherwise. They could still achieve the objectives and their lives were unimportant in the greater scheme of things. In essence, they were born to die for the Republic. Eventually the battle was won and some troopers, like CRC-09/571, survived it to fight another day."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
