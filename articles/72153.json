Prior to the plot to assassinate Galactic Republic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala in 22 BBY, Jubben was killed by ASN-121, a custom assassin droid owned by the bounty hunter Zam Wesell. Jubben was one of many senators murdered in the years prior to the Clone Wars. After ASN-121 was shot by Wesell during the plot to kill Amidala, several fragments of the droid were uncovered in one of the alleyways of the undercity on the planet Coruscant. When sliced, the droid's status logs revealed Wesell's involvement in Jubben's death, as well as in several previously unsolved assassinations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Senator Jubben was first mentioned in The New Essential Guide to Droids, a 2006 reference book by Daniel Wallace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
