In this case, it was Vek's incompetence that led Revan to the Overseer. Vek either unknowingly escorted Revan to his employer, dying alongside Ithorak, or he accepted a bribe to let Revan confront Ithorak alone. If the latter occurred, then Revan killed Ithorak by either reprogramming his assault droid to attack its former master, planting a frag mine on the assault droid and reprogramming it to approach its master, or confronting Ithorak face-to-face."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
