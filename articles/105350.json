During the Clone Wars he tried to remain neutral, but the Mandalorian Death Watch group made a base on Carlac and began bullying and kidnapping villagers from Pieter's town, greatly angering him. In an attempt to save his people, Pieter confronted Pre Vizsla, the leader of the Death Watch. Vizsla attempted to kill Pieter for his insolence, but the Chieftain's granddaughter Tryla sacrificed herself to save her grandfather.
