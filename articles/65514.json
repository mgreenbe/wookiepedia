In the former instance, it was an award for Imperial-aligned players should they undergo the Assassination option for the Corellian Corvette mission. The appearances differed slightly: In the Badges menu for the game, the Imperial Medal of Honor was represented as a slight \"I\" with the Imperial insignia inside and a white spike. In the card, the medal was represented by a silver medallion with a purple-and-black collar ribbon and what resembled a TIE Advanced on the medal. It should be noted that the overall design of the medal in the latter source resembled that of the Medal of the Emperor's Fist."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
