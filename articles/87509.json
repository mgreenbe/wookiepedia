It started when Plagueis was a stowaway on board the ship. When the crew of the ship talked with him he said that he wished to keep his business secret and wanted them to take him out of their way to Muunilinst quietly. After the crew talked it over they decided to come out of hyperspace and comm authorities. Plagueis killed Ellin Lah with his lightsaber and then moved on to the rest of the crew. Later, Plagueis ordered the ship to be destroyed at the Deep Space Demolition and Removal, a Black Sun station, to cover the incident."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and reference"}]}
