He could either appear as a brown haired, brown eyed Human male, or as a brown haired, brown eyed Human female. Because the quest dialogue identified Garrud as male, this article assumes that the Human male depiction is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity. Furthermore, examining the NPC revealed his name to be Egan Garud, without two \"Rs\" in the surname. This article assumes \"Garrud\" to be the correct spelling, as it was consistently used in the quest dialogue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
