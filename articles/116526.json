Her parents and grandmother, Ta'a Chume, sent it to her as a gift in 24 ABY when she was training at the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4. She chose her Jedi friends Jaina Solo and Lowbacca to be the ship's pilot and co-pilot. Although Rock Dragon followed the common Hapan theme of dragon-related names, Tenel Ka actually named it after an animal from Dathomir. Visually, it was a rather plain ship as to not draw unwanted attention to Tenel Ka, being the heir to the Hapes Consortium."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rock Dragon served as Tenel Ka's personal ship, but was captained by Jaina. It took Jaina, Lowbacca, Tenel Ka, and Jacen on their missions, most notably against the Diversity Alliance. It was attacked by Ailyn Vel, who had assumed the identity of her father, in the remains of Alderaan. Zekk showed up in his ship, Lightning Rod, and chased Vel deeper into the asteroid field."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
