It consisted of a breath mask connected via small tube to a belt unit. The unit held a half-liter of water and was designed to accept small tablets, that it used to form the mask's inhalant. Though scent masks were designed to create complex pheromone entertainments for Orfites, many intoxicant tablets have been produced that had made them popular across the Elrood sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Scent tablets"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
