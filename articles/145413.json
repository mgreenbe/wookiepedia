They had squirming tentacles and shark-like heads covered in eyes. At some point prior to the Battle of Takodana, a group of droids stranded on Taul were attacked by tar monsters. After ripping 2MED2 apart and destroying CO-34, the monsters snatched C-3PO's left arm, attempting to drag him away too. However, O-MR1 held onto his fellow droid, and thus the monsters were only able to rip C-3PO's left arm off."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
