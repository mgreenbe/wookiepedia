Costing one million credits, it was used to rapidly explore and chart entire planets and star systems. With a centralized computer for quick analysis, the crew of the survey module could explore and analyze a planet within a standard 24-hour day. This included determining possible colony sites, mineral and agricultural resources, and astrogation routes to nearby trade routes. The survey module was crewed by 2,000 scouts, 1,500 technicians, and 5,000 droids. Equipment included over a hundred airspeeders and 500 explorer droids for observation, as well as five Skipray blastboats and six TIE/sa bombers for defense."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
