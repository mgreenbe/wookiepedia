Forming a symbiotic relationship with the crustacean-like Crast species, the Priapulins created a society based on peace and mutual respect. Orbited by a single moon, the planet experienced two tidal cycles each day, with each tidal hour equal to ten standard hours. Suffering from tectonic activity, the planet's landmasses were constantly moving and changing shape causing violent shifts in global temperatures as more volcanoes emerged. As a result it was estimated that the planet underwent an ice age every 10,000 years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located in an area of space dominated by the Galactic Republic since the government's inception, Pria's role in the Republic has been lost to history. Members of the Priapulin and Crast species were seen on Coruscant serving as pilots during the Republic's final decades, and the area of space the planet was located in was patrolled by the 4th Sector Army of the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, a conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
