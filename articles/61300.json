During the Invasion of Naboo, the two Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi were escorted to the High Board Room to explain their presence in Otoh Gunga. Nass refused to aid the Jedi in their plight to rescue Queen Amidala from the Trade Federation, though Jinn used a Jedi mind trick to secure a transport to Theed. He also engineered the release of Jar Jar Binks, who was being held under arrest in the Board Room, awaiting a severe punishment for breaking his banishment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The High Tower Board Room first appeared in 1999 with the release of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
