Command of the ship was given to Mid Commander Mitth'raw'nuruodo shortly after a politically charged situation in which Thrawn brought the Ascendancy into a conflict at the planet Solitair between the Lioaoi and the Garwians. Syndic Mitth'urf'ianico was very surprised by this turn of events. He believed that either Supreme General Ba'kif or Supreme Admiral Ja'fosk was behind it, but he also thought that someone in the Mitth family was also helping Thrawn, most likely the Patriarch himself."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Vagaari pirate operations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship participated in the Vagaari pirate operations, after which Thrawn was relieved of command. Ufsa'mak'ro was given command of the ship, which pleased the Ufsa family, as the Springhawk had built itself quite a reputation under Thrawn. Some months later, after the Attack on Csilla, Thrawn was given command again and Samakro was made first officer. The ship was sent to attack the Paataatus homeworld with Picket Force Six.

After three days of observation, the Vigilant rendezvoused with them.
