Because of this dual role, many of the inhabitants considered the king to be \"impure\", and as such they murdered him along with his wife in 33 BBY, nearly extinguishing the royal line. These radical reformists replaced the aristocrats with the Revolutionary Purist Council and elected their own leader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Princess Foolookoola, daughter of the murdered monarchs, was the last heir to the throne.
