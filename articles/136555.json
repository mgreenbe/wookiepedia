Blackstripe was enslaved by the Galactic Empire. In 5 ABY, Blackstripe was hunted by a modified assassin probe remotely controlled by Grand Moff Lozen Tolruck, who enjoyed hunting and killing Wookiees for amusement. Tolruck used the assassin probe to fire two toxo-darts into Blackstripe's chest. When the poison failed to slow down the Wookiee, who continued climbing a wroshyr tree, Tolruck used his control visor to remotely launch the assassin probe into Blackstripe and explode. The explosion destroyed both the droid and killed Blackstripe. Dissatisfied with the hunt, he crushed his control visor in disgust."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
