This particular vessel was customized for the Hutt Darga Jiramma Mionne. The interior of the ship was once very nice, but like the inside of Darga's palace, it has been used as a den of iniquity for far too long. Much of the interior is in severe disrepair, and some parts of the ship can only be classified as \u201cdisgusting.\u201d However, Darga knew better than to trust his enemies to fail to recognize his ship, and thus he had aftermarket modifications made to the yacht to add extra defensive weapons that are normally manned by his crew."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
