Once lined with statues of famous Jedi Masters, the road was reconstructed circa 1000 BBY without them. Beginning at a large public landing platform, the road terminated at the main entry staircase that led deep into the Temple proper. Falling into disuse during the Galactic Civil War, the road was once again rebuilt during the reign of the Galactic Alliance, beginning in the newly constructed Fellowship Plaza."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Constructed sometime after the establishment of the Jedi Temple in 4000 BBY, the Processional Way was established by the Galactic Republic as the main road and access point to the Order's headquarters on Coruscant. Crowned by four statues: two Warrior Masters and two Sage Masters. This road would exist for the next thousand years, serving the Order through a long era of peace and growth. It wasn't until the Clone Wars erupted across the galaxy that Coruscant was threatened once more. By the time the Jedi High Council discovered that the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious was in control of both sides of the conflict, it was too late. Sidious' apprentice, Darth Vader, led a legion of clone troopers down the Processional Way and stormed the Temple, leaving it a burnt out ruin of its former self. With the Temple in the hands of the Sith and the newly established Galactic Empire, a landing platform was constructed at the foot of the entry stairs which were otherwise blocked off by debris."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although destroyed by the Yuuzhan Vong sometime after the Galactic Civil War, the Jedi Temple was reconstructed by the Galactic Alliance in appreciation of the rebuilt Jedi Order's efforts in the Yuuzhan Vong War. Leading from the newly installed Fellowship Plaza, the road once more led up to the Temple, now a glimmering transparisteel and stone pyramid. It was here that a maddened Jysella Horn would be captured by Galactic Alliance Security in 43 ABY, after succumbing to a strange and dangerous illness. As this plague grew worse within the ranks of the Order's Knights, Chief of State Natasi Daala ordered the Temple be seized by Mandalorian warriors as to prevent the spread of the psychotic Jedi. A standoff lasted outside on the Processional for several days, eventually resulting in withdrawal of the Mandalorians due to lack of public support."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A century later, when the resurgent Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire overthrew the galactic government and the Order, the Coruscant Temple was converted into a Temple of the Sith. New buildings covered the roadway and the Temple Court, necessitating the construction of a skybridge spanning the chasm between nearby buildings and the Sith Pyramid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
