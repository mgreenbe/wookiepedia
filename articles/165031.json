After spending much of his career racing in illegal and highly dangerous competitions, he realized that a dead racer couldn't do any good. During the height of the New Order, he retired and spent much of his time promoting the sport. He petitioned for the improvement of safety and quality of swoop tracks, hoping to extend the career of racers and attract a broader audience."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
