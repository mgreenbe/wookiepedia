A few months after the Battle of Endor the Galactic Empire imposed a strict blockade across the Anoat sector known as the Iron Blockade, making it difficult for the Trade Spine League to ship goods in and out of the sector. In the midst of this conflict, Mother of Pearl picked up a shipment of valuable ore from the mining planet of Burnin Konn and attempted to run the Imperial blockade. This attempt proved ultimately unsuccessful and the Mother of Pearl was shot down, crash landing in territory controlled by a gang led by the crime lord Brother Claw."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Burnin Konn gangster Happy Dapp, an associate of the league, heard about the crash and sent a young smuggler that owed Dapp a debt to retrieve the ore from the Mother of Pearl's wreckage. The smuggler fought through several of Brother Claw's thugs and located the wreckage. Upon arriving at the crash the smuggler's sister, Riley, asked her sibling via comm if the cargo would be valuable enough to steal for themselves and purchase passage offworld. However, the smuggler did not believe so, and instead returned it to Dapp."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mother of Pearl's first and only appearance was in the video game Star Wars: Uprising, released on mobile platforms in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
