An optical cup fed avionics data directly into the pilot's eye, and small wingtip-mounted maneuvering jets helped steer the contraption into the tractor fields that provided it with lift and power. Anakin Skywalker was involved in a race with racing wings in 29 BBY. They were later used as the basis for the design of Imperial Intelligence parawings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
