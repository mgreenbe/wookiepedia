Fixer also informed him that the Imperials were aware of him and searching him out. Luke, Han Solo, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C-3PO eventually managed to evade Imperial stormtroopers, but ended up stranded in the Dune Sea of Tatooine. They then hitched a ride with a Jawa in a Sandcrawler after striking a deal, and discovered further plans by the House of Tagge \u2014 more specifically, the House of Tagge intended to create a long-range freezing weapon. However, they weren't able to discover its purpose at that time. They eventually returned to Mos Eisley and departed from Tatooine.
