The command battle droid and subordinates were guarding a group of Naboo Security Force pilots in the hangar. 2163 confronted Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn when Jinn tried to escape the planet with Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala to inform the Galactic Senate about the invasion. Jinn attempted to convince the droid to let them pass and allow them to go to Coruscant, which briefly confused the battle droid. When 2163 ordered their arrest, Jinn destroyed him with a sweep of his lightsaber. Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, then proceeded to destroy the command droid's subordinates, to allow the Jedi to escape on the Queen's starship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The OOM command battle droid 2163 had a set of black sensors along with tan plating.
