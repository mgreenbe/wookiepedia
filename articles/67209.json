The deal with the Trade Federation allowed a great period of economic prosperity to settle on the Mid Rim world but the Naboo quickly begun to grow dissatisfied with the result: while they sold their plasma to the Trade Federation for fixed prices, the latter could sell the plasma at inflated prices on the open market, reaping much larger profits than the Naboo. As a result, a great deal of resentment against the Trade Federation developed on Naboo, specifically amongst the Royals who had opposed Tapalo's election to the throne, led by Senator Vidar Kim.

The move was opposed by Naboo Senator Palpatine, who later split with Veruna and convinced the young Padm\u00e9 Amidala, the popular Governor of Theed, to run against the king in the following election.

The reason for this was two-fold; it would serve to weaken the growing Federation, and would recoup funds for the ailing Republic.

Senator Palpatine was there in the office at the time, and told the queen that he could contact the Trade Federation delegates and demand the termination of the blockade.

Terrified at the prospect of facing Jedi, and Dofine having realized beforehand that the Jedi had most likely been sent to force a settlement regarding the dispute, Gunray contacted Sidious and presented the situation, also sending TC-14 to distract them due to Dofine being unwilling to face them. Jinn also noticed that there was an unusual amount of fear among the Neimoidians, especially for what was apparently as minor as a trade dispute. Sidious, realizing Valorum's role in bringing the Jedi to the ship, ordered Gunray to kill the Jedi at once and begin landing his troops on Naboo for an invasion, and when Gunray questioned the invasion's legality, Sidious replied that he would make it legal. Sidious also told Gunray to make sure that any future contacts to him exclude Dofine from participation after the latter implied they should call off the plan due to fear of the Jedi.

TC-14 exited and asked to be excused as she passed by them. The OOM droid leader, OWO-1, then ordered the corporal to go in while they provided cover. Before they could enter, however, Jinn and Kenobi revealed their survival by igniting their lightsabers. The droids attempted to blast them. Jinn and Kenobi, though, proved more than a match for the droids. The commotion did not go unnoticed by Gunray. After learning from Tey How that they had lost communications with the security droid unit, Gunray ordered the bridge sealed off, although his admission to Haako that he'd never dealt with a Jedi before caused Haako to doubt they'd survive the altercation. As a backup plan, they dispatched droidekas, which were more formidable due to their shield generators. Jinn attempted to use his lightsaber to force his way into the bridge, causing Gunray to order them to close the blast doors, believing that would hold them. However, Jinn proceeded to nearly cut through the blast doors to the bridge, much to Gunray and Haako's horror before the latter demanded to know what was taking the droidekas so long. At that moment, the droidekas arrived, ultimately chasing away the Jedi, with one of their blaster fire also detonating the weakened door.

Haako, as the transmission ended, admitted that Amidala was right about her accusations and implied that they should back out, though Gunray sternly reminded him that it was too late to do so.
