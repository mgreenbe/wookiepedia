Early during the conflict, Rebel forces attacked the outpost and overwhelmed the Imperial troops stationed there. After the attack, the corpses of the Imperial defenders were abandoned to decomposition. By the time of the Battle of Yavin, the explorer Tinrilo x'Rilsam, discovered the outpost while exploring Naboo. The adventurer noticed a large amount of skeletons but his exploration was stopped by the arrival of Rebel troopers who were still patrolling the area, forcing him to flee quickly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial outpost was a location in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
