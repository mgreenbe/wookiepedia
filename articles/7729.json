During her captivity, she was brutally treated and abused by the slavemaster. Circa 1 ABY, Anyza finally managed to escape the bunker with a group of slaves led by Kyran Silene. The escaped slaves did not reach Tyrena and established a camp in the wilderness. Nevertheless, Anyza remained deeply traumatized by the mistreatment and abuse commited by the slavemaster. A spacer recruited by Kyran Silene's wife later arrived at the camp. The spacer planed to infiltrate the bunker to find evidence of the slaver operations for the Corellian Security Force. The spacer also met Anyza Ekull. The woman refused to explain what the slavemaster did to her and begged the spacer to kill the slavemaster. Once in the bunker, the spacer fought and eventually killed the slavemaster. Anyza Ekull was very grateful to the spacer and confessed that she might start recovering now."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anyza Ekull was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
