Some types of ale, like the Mandalorian ale kri'gee, had a bitter taste. Ale was made in a process called brewing. It was produced in breweries, dedicated buildings for the making of ale, for which the planet Clendor was famous. It could also be brewed at home, for personal consumption. An \"ale house\" was a tavern where ale was sold. Ale could be stored in special containers called kegs, and was sometimes served in \"pints\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
