The reasoning behind its construction was simple; in the event they were ever under attack and needed to mount a defense, they would have a safe location to do so. It was apparently built after the first First Battle of Geonosis, and was used during the second later battle. It was a fall-back position in case Command Bunker 1 was overrun by enemy troops."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: Battlefront II there is a hangar in the same location that Command bunker 2 is located in Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron It is possible that the hangar was destroyed during the Battle of Geonosis, and in the years following the battle the Geonosians built Command bunker 2 in its place."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
