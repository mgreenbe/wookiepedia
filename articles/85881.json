They were led by Warlord Malkhan and were the leading faction at the peak of their power. They were briefly threatened by another faction in 6 BBY when they took a quarry and prepared for further advancement and less than two years later, Malkhan died and the Malkhanis started killing each other when the lieutenants each claimed Malkhan's cache of off-world weapons. They were replaced by the Opaline Creed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
