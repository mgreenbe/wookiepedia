Prior to the Battle of Endor, the captain attempted to persuade the captive Imperial Special Forces Commander Iden Versio to join the Alliance, stating that whilst the Empire was done for, she didn't have to go with it. However, she refused and escaped custody shortly after. Versio, however, did indeed end up joining the Alliance after witnessing the Empire attack her own homeworld as part of Emperor Palpatine's posthumous revenge and, a year after her encounter with the captain, quoted his words in an attempt to convince her father to leave the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
