Shortly after Jedi Purge and the formation of the Galactic Empire, the 501st later became a unit of the Stormtrooper Corps. Since the First Battle of Geonosis, the 501st had gained a reputation for being an effective fighting force, often being victorious in battle even against overwhelming odds.

Engineers attached to the Legion were then tasked to repair both a medical droid and an ammunition droid to heal and rearm the other ground troops. The Legion later commandeered an All Terrain Tactical Enforcer to destroy the incoming OG-9 homing spider droids who were closing in on the crash site. After accomplishing this task, Clone Jet Troopers assigned to the 501st were ordered to retrieve a Sith holocron located on top of the crashed star ship and return it to their staging area. The unit was later ordered to capture and secure a small enemy outpost on the hill next to the crash site, where they established an over watch position to provide sniper cover to deal with infantry and heavy support to deal with Hail Fire Droids and Spider Walkers. Eventually the Jedi Master Mace Windu joined the 501st Legion and led them in a counter attack against the CIS forces, managing to capture a forward position that provided CIS a much needed advantage on the battlefield.

Some members of the legion would be covertly transferred to other units; however, they were tracked to ensure that they would be available in the future if they were ever needed for any special assignments, as Palpatine suspected they would be.

Among the 501st's earliest battles was the Battle of Christophsis, where they served under Skywalker, Captain Rex, and High Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi. Based out of Crystal City, the 501st troops managed to recapture Christophsis from the Confederacy, beating back Separatist General Whorm Loathsom's multiple assaults. However, Loathsom soon deployed a deflector shield to protect his battle droid troops, and the clone troopers were forced to pull back and defend the Republic's heavy cannons.

Ferried to Teth's surface in LAAT/i gunships, the Republic unit began a grueling campaign up the vertical face of a cliff to the B'omarr Monastery where Rotta was being held. Utilizing AT-TE walkers and grappling hooks, Torrent Company was able to defeat the Separatist battle droids holding the monastery, though half of the unit was lost on the way up. After Skywalker and Tano located and rescued Rotta from the depths of the castle, the Confederate forces\u2014under the command of Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress\u2014launched a counterattack on the Teth monastery.

A treaty was established between the Republic and Jabba the Hutt, but although the 501st was replenished with new troops, the loss of the original Torrent Company left scars on all involved. Soon after, Rex and troops of the 501st were redeployed with Skywalker and Tano aboard their recently-christened fleet of Venator-class Star Destroyers to protect Bothawui from the Confederate General Grievous, who was intent on capturing the planet.

Rex inducted rookie troopers ARC-5555 and CT-21-0408, respectively nicknamed \"Fives\" and \"Echo,\" into the 501st for their service in recapturing a Republic outpost from the Separatists and alerting the Republic to an impeding Confederate attack on Kamino. A few months later, Rex, Fives, Echo, and other elements of the 501st were serving with Skywalker and Kenobi on board the former's flagship, the Resolute, when they were assigned to stage a defense of Kamino, which was being targeted by Grievous, Ventress, and the Separatists.

Skywalker and Tano rescued Secura and Clone Commander CC-5052 from the damaged Star Destroyer, but their escape cruiser's hyperdrive was accidentally tripped by a Vulture droid attack. The group mistakenly jumped to hyperspace, leaving Admiral Wullf Yularen in command of the remaining troops. The 501st's Torrent Company later helped to retake the Bothan colony world Kothlis from General Grievous, serving there under Kenobi, Tano, Rex, and Coric. Upon arrival at Kothlis aboard the Republic Star Destroyer Indomitable, Torrent Company joined in the battle to regain control of Kothlis's spynet facility.

Upon arriving in orbit of the world, the task force was unable to make contact with the clones on the surface but ran preliminary scans and discovered the droid foundries in the planet's northern and southern hemispheres.

Afterward, Krell informed Skywalker that he was ordered to return to Coruscant by command of the Jedi High Council and at the request of Chancellor Palpatine.

Prior to the Umbara campaign, Krell built a reputation as a successful general whose unwavering focus on military objectives won many key victories in the Clone Wars.

After the Umbarans fell in retreat, Krell confronted Rex for disregarding his orders. Fives intervened by openly criticizing the general in front of the other troopers, but then stood down after being ordered to do so at the point of a lightsaber. In order to diffuse the situation, Rex asserted how his loyalty to the general conflicted with his concern for the clones. Krell was actually surprised by Rex, given the fact that most clones obeyed orders without question, and somewhat complimented the captain for his tenacity.

Fives and Jesse strongly disapproved of Krell's strategies because of his lack of concern for clone lives; Dogma was fiercely loyal to his general and took the opportunity to defend Krell's tactics against the others' doubts; Hardcase was unconcerned with his comrades' dilemma and only wanted more opportunities to kill enemy combatants. Although Captain Rex retained his own misgivings over Krell's tactics, he wanted to honor his code of loyalty by faithfully executing the general's will without question. As Fives became increasingly outspoken and critical, Rex reminded him that Krell was an effective leader, citing the Jedi Master's extensive record of key military victories.

Fives and Hardcase ultimately succeeded in their mission and, with their commandeered fighters, caused significant damage to the airbase before coming to the aid of Rex and his men.

From their staging ground, the 501st fought through a war torn bridge and managed to capture CIS's forward command post. After destroying two enemy heavy turrets, the Legion was joined by Jedi General Ki-Adi-Mundi, who assisted the elite clones in destroying the CIS barricades and capture a lookout point that would prove vital to their mission. The troopers of the 501st found it difficult to keep Mundi in the dark about their true objective, as the Jedi Master was already suspicious of Palpatine and kept a close eye on the 501st's activities. After fighting their way to the energy collector, the Legion managed to destroy the shield generators protecting the collector and destroyed it, secretly taking the power crystal with them out of sight of General Mundi. As Mundi and the Galactic marines continued their assault against the CIS, the 501st returned to their staging area across the bridge where an LAAT/i Gunship awaited to pick up the power crystal from its courier, immediately taking off once the hand off was complete.

Not long afterward, the 501st fought in the Battle of Coruscant in an effort to rescue the kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine from the Confederacy. Members of the legion, many flying starfighters in battle for the first time, were tasked with destroying a number of droid starfighters and capital ships in an effort to create a diversion.

What kept the Legion fighting strong was their Jedi Commander, Aayla Secura, who's iron will against the Separatist forces kept the 501st in high spirits. At some point during the battle, the Legion's forward unit was attacked by unknown creatures and communications from them ceased. A second unit of the 501st was sent in to give them fire support, although by the time they got there, the forward unit had already been massacred and their AT-TE was rendered inoperable. The second unit soon came under attack by a pack of wild Acklays, but were ultimately able to defeat them. Upon driving off the wild Acklays, Command ordered them to hold out against incoming CIS forces near the downed AT-TE until Master Secura arrived with reinforcements. Upon her arrival, Secura and the 501st were tasked with retrieving a power cell from a crashed LAAT/I Gunship to repair the AT-TE. Once the walker was fully operational, the 501st were ordered to destroy the CIS heavy turrets that were set up near their base camp, eventually driving the CIS out of the area.
