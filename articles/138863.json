Massive vehicles like AT-STs and elite shock troops like Imperial Death Troopers may be effective at sweeping across battlefields and capturing new territory, but they rarely stick around to hold this ground. A TX-225 GAVw Occupier Combat Assault Tank, however, is more than enough to quell any resistance to Imperial occupation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Heavily armed and capable of carrying either cargo or personnel, one of these tanks can be a versatile asset to stormtrooper detachments on occupation duty. With the TX-225 GAVw Occupier Combat Assault Tank Unit Expansion, your Imperial armies gain a single finely sculpted, menacing TX-225 miniature that can work in tandem with your ground troops to impose the Empire's will wherever it's assigned. In addition to this beautiful miniature, this expansion also contains all the unit cards, upgrade cards, and tokens that you'll need to add one to your armies and outfit it for battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
