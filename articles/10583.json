Possessing wings of over 4 meters in length, they lived in the planet's deserts where they stayed adrift on warm updrafts until, using their brilliant eye sight, they spotted prey. The vultures will then pursue their target as a flock, for days at a time if necessary, after which, at the height of day, they swoop down at the angle of the sun to attack. They use the sun in the hope that their prey, which could include sentients, would be blinded and unable to fight back effectively. Aurean vultures would use their beaks and talons to attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aurean vultures were mentioned in Suns of Fortune, a sourcebook released in 2014 for Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
