Her husband wrote a letter to her and attempted to have a guard named Wembly send it to her. In the letter he wished her and someone named Jollar well and expressed his wish to explain his criminal actions to them someday. The letter was recovered aboard Purge after its occupants were decimated by a plague so it is unlikely that it reached her before it was released to the public for academic purposes in relation to the history of Purge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
