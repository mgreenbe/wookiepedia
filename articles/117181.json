They were tracked by the forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and, in the ensuing battle, forced to flee to Ord Mantell. From there, they repelled a Separatist attack.

As Maul reminded Kast and Saxon of their help in liberating him from the Spire on Stygeon Prime, he turned towards them and informed them of him and Dooku's purpose in Sidious' grand plan.
