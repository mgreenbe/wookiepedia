Early on in the attack, Besalisk Gadren, from Namir's squad, charged through with his blaster cannon. An Imperial grenadier almost killed the Besalisk but, luckily for Gadren, the grenade did not detonate. Namir led Roach to cover the others and two of Zab's men supported Gadren at the center of the camp to keep the Imperials from grouping up. After an intense ten minutes of combat, the camp was taken. Although Zab requested that Twilight Company requisition the  speeder bikes that remained at the base, Namir stated that they would likely have homing beacons attached, and therefore would give away their location. Shortly after destroying the remaining equipment at the base, the squads retreated back into the jungle before TIE/sa bomber sorties located them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
