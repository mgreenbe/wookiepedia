In the time before they explored the stars, Corellians embarked on ocean voyages to satisfy that wanderlust, traversing the seas to discover new continents and catch vast quantities of fish. After the advent of space travel, Corellian royalty sponsored exploration and colonization efforts that helped expand galactic civilization by furthering the frontiers of the Old Republic in its youth. Corellian colonists settled on thousands of worlds, and its hyperspace scouts paved many of the galaxy's major hyperspace routes, making Corellia an important planet in the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet became known through the galaxy for the Corellian people's wanderlust and its massive shipyards. Eventually, the ancient Corellian royalty, which included Prince-Admiral Jonashe Solo, faded away and the throne stood vacant for many years. In the millennia leading up to the Imperial Era, Corellia's key role in the expansion of galactic civilization decreased and power shifted to younger, more vibrant planets. The once influential world gained a reputation as a polluted planet with extensive poverty and crime.
