When accessed, an individual consulted with a holographic representation of these Masters who went through their great knowledge to help those Jedi that came to them. There were at least three different Noetikons which consisted of the Noetikon of Science, Noetikon of Light and the Noetikon of Secrets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Safeguarded within the Coruscant Jedi Temple's Archives, the Noetikons were stored within a terminal within a chamber of the Archives. Whether accessed individually or collectively, the knowledge possessed within the device was unfathomable by a single mind. During the Sacking of Coruscant at the end of the Great Galactic War, the Temple was destroyed by the Sith Empire and the Order was forced to abandon the pile of rubble which had served as their home for centuries. As the Jedi left Coruscant, the Noetikons fell into the hands of Gand scavengers, members of the Black Sun and the Justicars who took the relics deep into the Coruscant underworld. During the Cold War, a Jedi Consular returned to Coruscant and sought out the Noetikons in order to cure Master Yuon Par from a strange sickness. Collecting the artifacts and returning them to the Temple, the Consular was able to learn the technique necessary to cure the illness from the collective wisdom of the Noetikons before a group of Sith destroyed the terminal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After witnessing the threat of the Children of the Emperor, the Barsen'thor sought knowledge on a potential army to combat the Sith Emperor. Through consultation with the collective three Noetikons, the combined Jedi Masters discerned legends from the ancient Rakata that spoke of an alien army imprisoned on a distant world. This led to the Consular journeying to a Rakatan monument on Hoth to find the coordinates to Belsavis that held the sleeping Esh-kha."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Noetikons were taken to Tython but after the Assault by the Sith Empire, they were returned to Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
