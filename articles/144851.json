But their dancing was cut short when an ever-growing stranglethorn began wreaking havoc and taking over the village. When Kneesaa realized she was to blame, she set off to gather the three ingredients Logray needed to tame the wild plant. Fearing for Kneesaa's safety, Wicket joined her in her journey."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first ingredient was Kete nectar. Kneesaa had an idea: the duo could climb up the Kete's palace with leaf-shoes soaked by some kind of mud that was around the palace. Once inside the Ketes' labyrinthine hive, the duo evaded the unfriendly Ketes and discovered their stockpile of nectar pearls. Next, they learned from a barber bird the proper way to retrieve a ganga root from the ground, and then had to flee with the last root so that the bird would not eat it. They needed to bore the root to extract its air inside and take it from the ground. And thirdly, Wicket spotted a Trome tree; however, the tree only had one branch left, and when the resident Tromes appeared, they pleaded with the Ewoks not to destroy their home. Knessaa then came up with a new plan, and Wicket instead carried the three Tromes on his shoulders back to the village."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kneesaa uses the shoes to climb a tall tree where the stranglethorn imprisoned Malani, Nippet and Wiley. The four got off together, using the same shoes. The other villagers followed a Kneesaa's plan: While the Tromes distracted the stranglethorn, Wicket snuck into Logray's hut and retrieved the potion that would tame the plant. Logray instructed Wicket to place one drop into each of the plants mouths, but seeing how many heads the plant had sprouted, Wicket instead gathered a group of acorns into his satchel and poured the potion over them. Then he, the Tromes, and the Ewoks fed them to the plant until it shriveled back to its original size."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the threat is gone, Logray concurs that Kneesaa learned her father's three lessons: the Hand Lesson (when climbing the Keet's palace), the Head Lesson (by discovering how to retrieve the ganga root) and the Heart Lesson (by opting to preserve the Trome tree). The villagers celebrated the victory, and Chief Chirpa is very proud of his daughter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This episode is the first that shows Chief Chirpa instructing his daughter, apprentice, and heiress Princess Kneesaa.
