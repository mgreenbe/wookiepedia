Members or even potential candidates could undertake pveric'ell, which consisted of hiding out until the crisis had passed. Those undertaking pveric'ell usually served under a crime lord of repute, one who's stature could ensure that the transgressor stayed alive. Drake Paulsen served pveric'ell under Jabba the Hutt for a year for his role in the death of Izzat. Izzat, a member of the Black Bha'lir, was responsible for the death of Paulsen's father, Kaine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
