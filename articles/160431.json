In 44 ABY, the rogue Jedi Knights Jysella and Valin Horn contacted the journalist Kandra Nilitz and her camera operator Beurth Ogh on the planet Coruscant and promised them an exclusive news story in return for transport off the world. Nilitz agreed to their request and provided them with Vernus, and the two Jedi and the two journalists left Coruscant aboard the vessel and entered hyperspace. The Horns then flew the shuttle to the planet Nam Chorios in the Meridian sector, to which the pair had been summoned by the dark side entity Abeloth, and on arrival in the Nam Chorios system, they docked the vessel with transit facility Koval Station in orbit of the world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
