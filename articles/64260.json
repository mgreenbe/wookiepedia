Equipped with a cloaking device that rendered it invisible, the prototype stealth ship was used during the Battle of Christophsis by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker. Originally tasked with sneaking past the Separatist blockade of the planet to deliver relief supplies to Senator Bail Organa on the surface, Skywalker instead used the ship to bring down Separatist Admiral Trench's command ship, the Invincible. Skywalker, Clone Commander \"Blackout,\" CT-1284 \"Spark,\" and the crew of the ship tried to attack Trench's ship, but beforehand, Admiral Trench found that the ship's magnetic signature could be tracked, so it was not completely undetectable. However, when he launched tracking torpedoes that followed the ship's magnetic signature, Skywalker flew close to the Invincible's bridge, causing the torpedoes to take out Trench's own ship. The cloaking technology's enormous expense and maintenance requirements discouraged the Galactic Republic Navy from commissioning additional stealth ships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Clone Wars, the design of Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's personal starship, the Carrion Spike, was based on this stealth ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The stealth ship had a modular hull and twenty eight cloak projectors.
