Walkers saw use in the city of Sobrik on the occupied planet Balmorra, as well as in Coronet City on Corellia during the Battle of Corellia. Two of the walker's multi-jointed legs were located on one side of the walker, and the body of the walker featured weaponry on both the front and back sides, both of which had viewports, so that its pilots could defend the vehicle from both directions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Ilum, these walkers were largely replaced by the two-legged Imperial Walkers by the time of the Revanite crisis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
