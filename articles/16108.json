Unknown to Ben, it had a tracking device which Mara used to find him whenever she was unable to sense him with the Force. It was because of Ben's possession of the vibroblade that Jade Skywalker learned that he was on Vulpter when the Corellian Prime Minister, Gejjen, was assassinated by a Galactic Alliance Guard assassin, Ben Skywalker himself. Mara later used the tracking device again while she was following Lumiya; however, Ben had left it in Lon Shevu's apartment, and was in fact following Mara."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
