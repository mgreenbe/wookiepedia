He owned a Corellian VCX-150 freighter called the Keepsake and following an attack on the Inyusu Tor mineral processing facility, the Imperial Security Bureau managed to affiliate the ship with the Sullustan resistance and sent at least a dozen stormtroopers to search it. The Chadra-Fan hid in a small space behind a conduit access panel and as stormtroopers searched around the ship, one of them, SP-156, split from them to investigate the panel. The other stormtroopers aimed their blasters at the conduit, and 156 hit the panel out of place with the butt of his rifle. He then took the metal sheet away, revealing the Chadra-Fan to the squad."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The squad leader, SP-113, asked him where Nien Nunb and the other Sullustan resistance members were, to which the Chadra-Fan told them they were in the city, wishing him good luck on finding them. 113 then asked about the contacts the Sullustan resistance had on Sullust and the Chadra-Fan laughed, saying that the stormtroopers had the people so scared that they refused to help in anyway. The Chadra-Fan further stated that the Sullustan resistance was indeed behind the attack on the factory, but worked alone. 113 told his stormtroopers to take him into custody and one of them suddenly discovered a detonator with him. It exploded, killing him and most of the squad.
