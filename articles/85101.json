In the aftermath of the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Madrighast, whose forces had been greatly weakened during Operation: Cinder, planned to regroup with the 108th in the Gordian Reach. He contacted Colonel Shakara Nuress of the Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing to offer her to join him and the 108th. Nuress declined, revealing that her forces were forming a base of operations and offering Madrighast a chance to resupply at that base. Madrighast soon lost contact with Nuress. Around 5 ABY, the colonel planned to rendezvous with Admiral Rae Sloane's forces and contacted the 204th's new commanding officer, Soran Keize, although Madrighast's message experienced interference and eventually cut out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, Madrighast served as a colonel in the Galactic Empire's military, commanding the starship Unyielding.

Madrighast then insisted that Nuress join his forces in meeting with the 108th. Nuress, though, expressed her suspicions that Madrighast's forces were not in shape for battle. She further revealed that she and her fighter wing were consolidating a base of operations at the planet Pandem Nai. Surprised, Madrighast wished Nuress good luck with her her base of operations. Nuress claimed her base of operations would be able to supply a portion of the Imperial Navy and offered Madrighast to stop by and restock.
