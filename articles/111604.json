The company acquired the license for Star Wars comics in the early 1990s, a few years after the end of the Marvel run and in the build-up to the prequels, relaunching the Star Wars line with such titles as Classic Star Wars (reprinting the original Star Wars newspaper strips), Star Wars: Dark Empire, Tales of the Jedi, and Star Wars: Dark Empire II.
