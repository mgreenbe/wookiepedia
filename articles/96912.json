The complex was a vast structure, mostly housed in a single long, flat building one story tall. This had been done to avoid any sense of offices on higher towers being \"more prestigious\" than others. Automated sidewalks were used to ferry people through the expansive complex. The building also featured broad transparent panels along the walls for a view of the outside. Contained within the complex was the senatorial conference building, used for a multitude of auxiliary functions, which was bombed by the Amaxine warriors twenty-four years after the formation of the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Senate complex as a whole was destroyed thirty years after the Battle of Endor, when the First Order used its Starkiller Base superweapon to destroy the Hosnian system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
