The planet, however, already had native inhabitants, the Dugs.  Although the Grans were technologically superior, the Dugs proved resourceful and ferocious. Eventually, the conflict escalated to the point that an intervention by the Republic was required. Due to the sway the Grans had with the galactic government, they were effectively awarded the planet. The Republic enabled the Gran Protectorate Act, which enabled the colonists to take over the eastern continent of Malastare and relocated most of the Dugs to the western continent. As a result of that injustice, many Dugs grew extremely xenophobic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
