She underwent treatment under Taru Durn, a Theran Listener, and her repressed memory of her last moments with her mother was discovered. Thei and her mother ate a meal of topato soup and later spent the night on a cave during their trip, but the cave ground wasn't able to support Sparkle's weight and it collapsed, plunging Sparkle into a hole full of drochs. Thei's mother went to investigate and fell into the hole as well. Thei witnessed their deaths before running away."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
