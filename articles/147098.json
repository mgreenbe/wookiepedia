It was not an actual crossbow, but a device with hinged arms, resembling the arms of a crossbow. The hinged arms would flail forward hurling the stubby arrow out through the front of the weapon. Unlike the crossbow, this weapon did not need to be reloaded after every shot, as it incorporated a magazine of approximately six projectiles, hidden within the mechanism. The Toka crossbow was not very powerful, but the speed and accuracy with which they could be wielded made them a formidable weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
