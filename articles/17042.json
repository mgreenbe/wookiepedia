The fifth planet in the system, it was named after Bimmiel, the Imperial scout who rediscovered it. As the planet neared the sun, its ice caps melted, triggering an increase in moisture and plant growth. The heat brought the native shwpi out of hibernation to multiply. Since the carnivorous slashrats could not adapt to the heat, they retreated to the polar regions of the planet. Then when the planet got farther from the sun, its ice caps refroze, and the shwpi came into the food chain of the slashrats, returning to the equatorial regions. The slashrats brought the number of shwpi back to a manageable number. A number of natives existed on the planet, using crude wooden spears and tools."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some time during the period of the Galactic Republic, Jedi were present on the world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial Period, the Galactic Empire quarantined the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25 BBY, members of the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong species landed on Bimmiel and began surveying the surrounding sectors for a future invasion of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25 ABY Dr. Anki Pace was sent to Bimmiel with a team including Jens, Vil, Trista Orlanis, and Denna. The team uncovered the ancient Jedi artifacts, suspecting Jedi involvement in the thefts of the artifacts that left their guardians with years of memories erased. While on Bimmiel, they also discovered the mummified corpse of Mongei Shai, a Yuuzhan Vong warrior. The team was captured by Yuuzhan Vong from a recently established spy and reconnaissance post on the planet. It was set up by scouts from Domain Shai on the orders of Zho Krazhmir.
