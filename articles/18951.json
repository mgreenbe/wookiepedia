Run by Crev Bombaasa, the Cartel had an uneasy alliance with Moff Kentor Sarne during his time as ruler of the Kathol sector. A loose collection of criminals from the Outer Rim Territories, the criminals banded together to fight off challenges and threats from larger organizations such as those run by the Hutts. The Cartel operated several legal shipping and mining companies, and maintained a network of contacts that included smugglers, shippers and Imperials. Following Moff Kentor Sarne's retreat from Kal'Shebbol, the Cartel took control of Pembric II, and installed a puppet government with pro-Imperial leanings to dissuade New Republic interest in the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
