The Campaign Guide, which covers much of and builds off the two Knights of the Old Republic games and the comic series, was co-written by Rodney Thompson, Sterling Hershey, Abel G. Pe\u00f1a, and Miller. The guide was first thought of by Miller in early 2007, when Miller learned from his colleague James Mishler that Wizards of the Coast was relaunching the Star Wars Roleplaying Guide, though he had no idea how to pursue the idea. Later that spring, one of Miller's friends at Celebration IV suggested the same idea and pointed out the Roleplaying Game's head designer, Rodney Thompson. Miller became sidetracked before he could speak with him, but a LucasFilm representative introduced Miller to Thompson after Miller's panel: Thompson wanted Miller to help create an already-scheduled campaign guide for the Knights of the Old Republic series. Miller was originally only tasked with continuity oversight, but as Miller had some background in roleplaying games, Thompson asked Miller to write some of the sections. Miller's wife Meredith helped him develop many of the stats and information needed for the game, and Miller ended up writing the guide's chapters on Mandalorians and the Republic; he used the guide as an opportunity to advance some of the stories that he had not yet had an opportunity to do so with in the comics, such as Haydel Goravvus. However, when it came to the subject of Squint and Malak\u2014whom the comics' creative team had always intended to eventually link together\u2014Miller suggested that they stay away from Malak's previous identity and early days. This resulted in a later problem: Alek's \"surname\" of Squinquargesimus, which was assigned by Republic immigration but not used by Alek, made its way into the Campaign Guide despite the fact that Miller had not yet explained in the comics that it wasn't really the character's last name. Another error resulted when a late-minute addition to the guide included a segment on the planet Bespin, the discovery of which Miller intended to use in Knights of the Old Republic 36. Miller had been unaware of the addition while working on issue #36, but he discovered the segment on Bespin shortly before issue #36 was completed. As a result, the \"Bespin\" that appeared in issue #36 was recolored and given a different diameter to differentiate it from Bespin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
