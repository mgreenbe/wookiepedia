It was larger and slightly more powerful version of the standard slugthrower pistol. Its increased power created more recoil, which made it more difficult to fire several shots in rapid succession accurately. Its larger size and loud firing could be used for intimidation if one encountered a group of unfriendly natives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Coreesh Mountains located on the distant planet Veroleem, a Master Cult Adept of the Cult of Veroleem was equipped with this weapon while he was overseeing the \"processing\" of a group of prisoners that would force them into becoming new cult members. He was intercepted by a rescue party that rescued the prisoners at the Temple of Veroleem."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
