Because light-siders figured out ways to use Sith amulets for benevolent purposes, Sith sorcerers created ensnarement talismans with enough of the dark side's corrosive power to bring unsuspecting Jedi Knights under its influence. The Jedi Order outlawed use of Sith amulets for any means as a result, to prevent anyone from falling into darkness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
