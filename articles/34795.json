The formula also resulted in the partial resurrection of those who had already died, but turned them into cannibalistic monstrosities. Scabrous commanded hordes of these creatures during his lifetime. It was rumored that Darth Scabrous granted secret training sessions to Sith Acolyte Rance Lussk, during which he taught Lussk techniques in mind control."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Scabrous planned on using the orchid's caretaker, Hestizo Trace, in a sacrificial ritual in which he would cut out her heart and eat it, allowing the high midi-chlorian count in it to stabilize the formula and truly render himself immortal.
