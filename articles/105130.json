A CR90 corvette commanded by Sato was also present for the mission. Although Syndulla's co-pilot and gunner Kanan Jarrus felt discontented with working alongside a formal military unit such as Phoenix Squadron, the other members of the Ghost crew were accepting of the help. Encountering Imperial Gozanti-class cruisers in space, Phoenix Squadron and the Ghost battled the Imperial TIE/ln space superiority starfighter defenders. Phoenix One, alongside a pilot flying under the callsign Phoenix Two, made short work of several TIE fighters docked on the cruisers at the request of Captain Syndulla.

The crew escaped back to the Phoenix fleet, but were followed by Vader in his personal TIE Advanced x1 starfighter. Phoenix One led the other Phoenix pilots into battle against the solitary attacker, but were no match for Vader's superior piloting skills.
