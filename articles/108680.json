Together, the pair were dispatched to the planet Tovarskl where they were assigned to defend the Republic from the Separatist Droid Army. Encountering the leader of the Separatist army, General Grievous, Master Puroth engaged the Kaleesh cyborg in a lightsaber duel; because she could match Grievous while wielding four lightsabers at once, she proved to be one of the General's most challenging opponents. However, Grievous eventually dismembered and killed Puroth.
