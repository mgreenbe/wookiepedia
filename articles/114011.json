Sex was an activity that could result in procreation. Individuals from different genetically compatible species could potentially conceive a hybrid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sexual reproduction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many species in the galaxy produced new offspring through sexual reproduction, the mating of parent organisms with compatible genetic material. Other methods of combining sperm with an ovum could also produce a new life form. In most mammals, the offspring would then gestate in the mother's womb until birth. Some species were capable of producing hybrid offspring with other species, such as Human-Zabrak or Borneck-Etti pairings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In terms of evolutionary habits, species that could only reproduce a few offspring at a time tended to devote more resources to the nurturing and protection of said offspring than in comparison to those who could produce many offspring. In the latter type, it was common for many offspring to die soon after birth, but enough individuals typically survived to maintain the population. Various species and organisms reproduced at various seasons continuously throughout their lives. These intervals could usually be mapped into cycles known as reproduction cycles. In contrast, other organisms could only reproduce once in their lifetime, often dying shortly after reproduction either due to the actions of their mate or due to genetic influence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Asexual reproduction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Asexual forms of reproduction involved individual organisms producing new organisms through non-sexual methods. For instance, mynocks utilized fission. The Ergesh had a ritual where two individuals each produced a seed containing their own genetic code, then planted them together in a swamp called the Shoolbloorp, the \"Land of Beginnings.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some species that were hermaphroditic, such as most gastropods and plant-based species, were capable of self-fertilization. Hutts could reproduce by themselves or mate with another Hutt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Human female Shmi Skywalker did not engage in any reproductive activities, yet somehow became pregnant with her son, Anakin. Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn theorized that it was the result of the Force using the midi-chlorians found in all living beings to conceive a prophesied Chosen One. When Darth Sidious met Anakin Skywalker and felt his strength in the Force, he suspected it to be the result of his Sith master, Darth Plagueis, working with Sidious to tip the balance of the Force towards the dark side."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cloning"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cloning referred to the process of reproducing a near symmetrical duplicate of a being through artificial means. By obtaining the genetic code of an individual, numerous copies of said individual could be created. Various species, such as the Khommites, Columi and Verpines relied on cloning as their chief means of reproduction. The Kaminoans used the art of the cloning as a production resource, notably selling clones of the bounty hunter Jango Fett to create an army."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Non-reproductive sexual activities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many sentient beings engaged in sexual intercourse for reasons other than reproduction, such as for recreational purposes or as a means to express their romantic love and care for one another. It occurred between beings of differing genders or of the same gender, often feeling attraction towards one specific gender or to multiple genders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Zeltrons, a pink-skinned species from the planet Zeltros, were known for having many transient sexual relationships on a casual basis. Although their promiscuity often confused and embarrassed other species, including Humans, the Zeltrons were not ashamed of that cultural trait. On the contrary, they regarded monogamy as an eccentric practice. The non-Zeltrons often met their overt sexual advances with great disconcertion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some beings exchanged sexual relations for payment. Their work could be confined within brothels, which were often associated with other venues like bars and gambling dens. Other workers, however, would converse with potential customers outdoors. The Zeltron cafarel were known for fulfilling any carnal desire a being might have."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones established that the Jedi Order members couldn't marry or have children, Star Wars creator George Lucas explained that despite their monastic regime, the Jedi were permitted to have sexual intercourse as long they didn't form attachments."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
