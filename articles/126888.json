During the battle, Etain instinctively tried to stop one of the Jedi from killing a clone trooper by shielding him from a lightsaber strike with her own body. Kal, along with Omega Squad, witnessed the scene and was angered by her death, so he turned on the Jedi and helped to kill a number of them. Clone commando Niner was also seriously hurt in the battle and all of the Jedi were either killed or forced to flee."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
