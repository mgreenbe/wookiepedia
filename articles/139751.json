In order to stem this advantage of General Grievous, the Galactic Republic dispatched Jedi Masters Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi along with a clone trooper task force to destroy the deep space center. The Republic strike team managed to board the station, but were ambushed by battle droids. Gorgol the Handy had sealed himself inside a security bunker. The Republic frontal assault of the security bunker using All Terrain Recon Transport was repulsed with the defense turrets. In order to lure Gorgol out, Republic forces simulated a retreat, leaving behind a sole sniper. After receiving confirmation of Republic's departure from his battle droid scouts, Gorgol left his bunker, only to be confronted by the two Jedi Masters. When he prepared to activate defense turrets once again, a sniper shot destroyed his remote detonator, allowing the Jedi to take the Geonosian into custody and secure the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
