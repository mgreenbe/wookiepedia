In 3951 BBY, the Jedi Exile Meetra Surik tried to enter the tomb, but was unable to get inside, as the entrance was blocked by a rockfall.

The tomb was guarded by several ancient droids. Many Sith acolytes went there to complete several tasks assigned by their overseers. Overseer Harkun sent a promising acolyte there to retrieve an ancient map for Lord Zash. However, first the acolyte had to release, by gathering ancient rods, the ancient servant of Tulak Hord, an infamous Dashade called Khem Val, who was also imprisoned in the tomb. When the acolyte released him, after killing countless other rival acolytes, the Dashade attacked the acolyte, enraged, after hearing that his master, Tulak Hord, had died hundreds of years earlier. However, he was defeated and so promised to serve the young Sith. They then retrieved the map, but first had to defeat an ancient guardian beast, a Terentatek Mauler. Later on, a promising warrior was sent by Lord Baras to the tomb to retrieve an ancient lightsaber. There, using the help of a Twi'lek prisoner, he opened a secret chamber inside the tomb, terminated Naga Sadow's ancient droid guardians, and retrieved the lightsaber from his \"grave\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A glitch can occur when in the terentatek room.
