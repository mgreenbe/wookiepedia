The clear plastex dome showed off a newly-updated Intellex V computer system, which contained detailed statistics on thousands of military starships. R3-A2 could hold up to 5 hyperspace jumps in active memory, and could also coordinate piloting coordinates and approach angles during combat. His eye was a round kind unlike most R3 units. However, he can be used in the back of X-wing starfighters, plotting coordinates, and talking with the pilot. R3-A2 can also speak almost as many languages as C-3PO."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
