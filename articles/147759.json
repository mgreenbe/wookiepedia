She met him when he chose her as his opponent in a one-on-one sky race he had been unwillingly signed up for, and she came down to Team Fireball's repair shop to wish Xiono good luck. During the race, she and Xiono proved to be very close, if not superior, in skill, and the deciding factor was ultimately the quality of their ships, as the engines of the ramshackle Fireball gave out when Xiono pushed them too hard, causing them to crash and giving Doza the victory.

On the way there, they witnessed Pyre and Doza talking in the corridor, with Pyre giving Doza a datapad. Xiono attempted to head for Doza's office, but Torra pulled him away, telling him he was going the wrong direction. In her quarters, Torra and Xiono played Flight Simulator Squadron for a bit, before Xiono and BB-8 were forced to hide when 4D-M1N entered.

He had snuck in to copy the datapad's contents onto a memory stick. Torra later tracked down Xiono and BB-8 in the hallway, telling Xiono she knew how to get him out of the tower, if he explained to her what he was doing in Doza's office.

After they exited, Torra asked Kaz if he was a spy. Kaz tried to laugh it off but she revealed to him that her father had discovered Xiono had been a New Republic pilot. His claim that he had quit the job to become a racer failed to convince her, and the two parted ways.
