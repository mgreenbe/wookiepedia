However, during the conflict it was taken over by the Thaereian military and Elis' Gan was made the facility's commandant. A military force called Task Force Pest was established to arrest Force-sensitive individuals on Cularin, and under the command of Lieutenant Dalin they took their prisoners to the security facility, where Force-blocking drugs were tested on them.
