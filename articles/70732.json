After failing to capture Horn because of the intervention of Skywalker, Jesmin Tainer, still undercover, was paired up with Quarren mercenary Dhidal Nyz to capture Seff Hellin, a rogue Jedi suffering from the same disease as Horn. However, they lost their target to Darkmeld, a secret organization formed by Jedi Knight Jaina Solo to counter Chief of State Natasi Daala's attempts to undermine the Jedi Order.

Tainer piloted Nyz's cargo hauler to the prison, and Nyz captured Hellin in an electric-pulse net. However, members of Darkmeld\u2014a secret group formed by Jedi Knight Jaina Solo to counter Daala's attempts to undermine the Jedi Order\u2014intervened, and captured Hellin themselves. In the ensuing speeder chase, a security speeder\u2014stolen and piloted by the bounty hunter and Darkmeld affiliate Tahiri Veila\u2014maneuvered underneath Nyz's and Tainer's cargo hauler. Veila's partner, Imperial Remnant Head of State Jagged Fel, ravaged the bottom of the hauler with his beskar crushgaunts. The hauler began to malfunction, and Tainer and Nyz fell behind and were forced to give up the bounty.
