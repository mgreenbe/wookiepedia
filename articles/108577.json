The gravitational field of the mines caused starships to be ripped out of hyperspace, as well as to prevent ships in the immediate vicinity from jumping to hyperspace without first moving away from the mines. In this way, the mines functioned very much like an interdiction field, and were effective at waylaying most ships, providing that the mines weren't destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These interdictor mines were created by the Hapan people during the early stages of the Yuuzhan Vong War.
