During that time, Chambo composed the piece known as Dissolution by Self-Intention, which included a prelude. During the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Zabrak surgeon Zan Yant considered Dissolution by Self-Intention Chambo's masterwork and played the prelude to it on his quetarra, a type of musical instrument. Yant played the piece, crediting Chambo, in front of a crowd in the cantina built in the Republic medical base known as Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 7, which he worked in on the planet Drongar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Borra Chambo was first mentioned in MedStar I: Battle Surgeons, a novel written by Michael Reaves and Steve Perry and released in 2004.
