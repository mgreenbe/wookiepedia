He commandeered one of the turbolasers on the planet and used it to shoot at an escaping yacht, which had many important Imperials aboard, as the planet rioted and overthrew the satrapy.

For that mission, he was accompanied by Corporals Kason, Stromm, Gahee'abee, Polnichk, and Durs; all of whom donned parawings.

Jom toppled a wooden overhang over the stormtroopers, trapping them underneath. Jom then grabbed one of the stormtrooper's blasters and shot them dead. Jom's arrival coincided with the outbreak of the Rebellion on Akiva, which had been instigated by a small band of rebels led by the starfighter pilot Norra Wexley, who had returned to Akiva to fetch her son Temmin.

The boy ordered Jom to raise his hands but Barell countered that one of them was broken. Unwilling to kill a youth, Jom attempted to convince the boy to desert his post. However, the boy, fearing retribution from his Imperial superiors, attempted to shoot Jom with his blaster. The New Republic soldier charged at the boy and slammed the young officer back onto the console. He then shoved the weeping youth inside a footlocker trunk.

The rebellion on Myrra coincided with the arrival of a New Republic fleet which wiped out most of the Imperial fleet above Akiva.

The former Vice-Admiral had died while in transit and Emari deduced that he had been poisoned with Kytrogorgia. After a period of rest and relaxation, Jom met with Norra and her crew aboard the Halo. When Temmin talked about his X-wing practice, Jom chastised the boy and reminded him that it was called training.

Aram managed to flee the house but was captured by Norra before he could escape offworld. After Sinjir interrogated him, Jom chatted with Emari while Norra and Han Solo traveled to the town of Kai Pompos to gather supplies for their trip to the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk.

Jom accepted Jas' arguments and decided to stick around longer to see what kind of damage they could inflict on the Imperial war machine. Jom and companions then left the Black Forest on Emari's gunship Halo and flew to a wroshyr tree.
