As his career continued, Yage became a member of the Council of Moffs, representing the interests of the Navy. He married fellow Moff Nyna Calixte at one point in his life.

With the Sith's backing, the Moff Council invoked the Treaty of Anaxes and declared war on the Alliance, which culminated in a decisive Imperial victory above the Core World of Caamas that saw the Alliance surrender to Grand Admiral Morlish Veed. Yage was tasked by the Sith with leading an Imperial attack on the Jedi Academy on Ossus, where his stormtroopers wiped out nearly every Jedi present. For his part in the victory, Yage was named the \"Hero of Ossus\" and made a Moff. He returned to Coruscant, the new capital of the Empire, where he witnessed Darth Krayt usurp control of the Empire, killing a decoy of Roan Fel. Krayt forced the Moff Council into subservience, and Yage and the others complied. During the hunt for Jedi-turned-bounty hunter Cade Skywalker in 137 ABY, Yage and the other Moffs plotted to use Skywalker to assassinate Emperor Krayt. However, Skywalker had already been captured by the Sith, and was being held within their temple on Coruscant.

Yage assumed command of the First Sith Imperial Strikeforce, leading it from the Star Destroyer War Hammer. Emperor Fel escaped, but his daughter, Marasiah, was captured. Yage brought her to Coruscant as a prisoner before being assigned to lead the Strikeforce against those suspected of harboring Mon Calamari refugees on the Da Soochan moon of Napdu. Yage later participated in the Sith-Imperial assault on the Jedi Order's Hidden Temple, and it was during this battle that he and his daughter led many Sith-Imperials in defecting to the Empire-in-exile.

He married Nyna Calixte, the eventual Director of Imperial Intelligence, and the relationship resulted in a daughter, Gunn, whom Rulf raised as the son he always wanted. After serving in Skull Squadron, Yage was assigned to the Star Destroyer Ephin Sarreti, part of the Imperial Second Outer Rim Fleet. While aboard, he was responsible for coordinating the fleet's starfighter tactics. Yage was eventually promoted to the rank of admiral, but around the same time, Calixte left him for High Moff Morlish Veed, also a member of the Navy. In an effort to overcome the growing amount of bitterness in his life, Yage embedded himself in his duties.

A year later, the Moffs, without the knowledge of Emperor Fel, allied with Dark Lord Darth Krayt's Sith Order\u2014the very group of Sith who had sabotaged the Ossus Project. The Sith\u2013Imperial War reached its final stage by 130 ABY, when above the Core World Caamas, Grand Admiral Veed's forces brought about a decisive Imperial victory when he forced the Alliance commanders into surrendering. Coruscant fell to the Empire around the same time. The members of the Alliance governing Triumvirate became nothing more than puppets to ensure the peaceful transition from Galactic Alliance to Galactic Empire; Emperor Fel then made them viceroys over what was left of Alliance Space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The final act of the war, however, had yet to come. Yage, now a Grand Admiral, led an attack on the Jedi Academy on Ossus alongside Sith Lord Darth Nihl.

For his part in the massacre, Yage\u2014who was praised as the \"Hero of Ossus\"\u2014was appointed Moff and given a seat on the Moff Council, where he represented the interests of the Imperial Navy. The Council met on conquered Coruscant at a point following the massacre, and while Moff Veed was concluding his report to the Council and Emperor Fel on the events on Ossus, Darth Krayt and three of his minions\u2014Wyyrlok, Maladi, and Nihl\u2014entered Fel's throne room and proceeded to seize control of the Empire. The Dark Lord slayed the four Imperial Knight bodyguards present before assassinating the man who sat on the throne.

He had become aware of the healing power that Jedi-turned-bounty hunter Cade Skywalker possessed through Moff Konrad Rus's contacts on Bastion, where Skywalker had returned Imperial heir Princess Marasiah Fel after she had been injured during an encounter with the Sith on Vendaxa. The Dark Lord of the Sith hoped to capture the former Jedi and convert him to the dark side of the Force with the hope that his abilities could be used to increase the Emperor's own longevity. Skywalker soon arrived on Coruscant in his Helot-class transport, the Mynock, and there he was pursued by Skull Squadron under the command of Moff Yage's daughter, Gunn \"Gunner\" Yage.

The Moff began berating his daughter\u2014he had issued an order, and had no desire to listen to their excuses for failing. Gunn proposed that, should her father be dissatisfied with her handling of the squadron, he could dismiss her whenever he wished.

At a meeting of the Moff Council the following day, Darth Maladi informed the Moffs that the search for Skywalker had been called off, but she refused to divulge any information despite Moff Calixte's assumption that Skywalker had been captured. As the discussions continued after Maladi cut her transmission, Yage, speaking to the Chiss Moff Fehlaaur, accused the Chiss Ascendancy of harboring the deposed Emperor Fel and his forces. Fehlaaur and Yage bickered over the reported sighting of the Mynock in the Coruscant Undercity until Moff Geist of the Imperial Army intervened, announcing that Skywalker's whereabouts were no longer relevant now that the search for the former Jedi had ended. Geist realized that the Council commanded less power than they had had under Fel, and Yage responded that their current predicament had been the result of Calixte's machinations with the Sith to bring them in on the Empire's side during the Sith-Imperial War. Calixte tried to defend her actions by reporting that the war\u2014which the Council had wanted in the first place\u2014had been going poorly for the Empire. Fehlaaur and Geist offered further opinions on the matter, but Morlish Veed put a halt to the debate and called for unity before revealing his intentions to capture Skywalker for the Council's own purposes against Krayt's Order.

Calixte had come to question her daughter on Skull Squadron's chase of the Mynock, but the meeting quickly dissolved into arguing and name-calling. Rulf calmly ate his soup as Calixte and Gunn's debate continued, interjecting only when necessary\u2014at one point, he reminded his daughter that Calixte was still a superior officer and deserved some respect.

As Gunn locked on to the Mynock, Moff Yage was ordered by an Imperial admiral via hologram to call off the squadron, in compliance with a standing order that no Imperial vessels were to violate the Temple's airspace. Yage reluctantly complied, ordering his aide Captain Skolitz to recall the Skulls.

Veed revealed this information to his comrades at a meeting of the Moff Council.

While the War Hammer was in deep in hyperspace, en route to its destination, Yage briefed a squad of Sith pilots in preparation for the upcoming assault. Yage informed them that Fel had been located and was to be captured alive. The Moff tasked a number of Sith pilots with flying their Fury-class starfighters into battle as the first wave, leading Predator fighters in crippling all of Fel's ships and trapping the Emperor-in-exile on Agamar. Yage instructed them that, with the exceptions of Fel and his daughter, no one was to be left alive. After telling them that their success was compulsory, he dismissed them.

When Gunn entered the hangar, she noticed that Skull Squadron's Predator fighters had been replaced by a new design. Moff Yage promptly introduced Rauder and explained that the Predators had been replaced on Rauder's command. Gunn and the Sith engaged in a brief argument over the decision, but Gunn backed down when Rauder threatened to execute anyone who questioned her orders. The Sith departed, leaving Moff Yage to question his daughter as to why she was making his life more difficult. Gunn proceeded to ask for her father's consul on her dilemma, careful to not reveal names or too many details. She told him that while she wanted to act on her uncertain information and damage the person involved, doing so could easily damage others. The Moff correctly deduced that his daughter was referring to Corde and suggested that she use her training as a fighter pilot to aid her in solving the problem. He noted that killing shots were efficient if planned properly, but could never be taken back\u2014something he had learned the hard way on Ossus.

The War Hammer destroyed the Dauntless, but it was unable to stop Fel from escaping to hyperspace in his shuttle. Princess Marasiah Fel, however, was captured by the Sith Imperial forces.

The two were approached by the Inquisitor Darth Havok, who demanded that the Moff hand Fel over to him for transport to Korriban per Darth Wyyrlok's orders.

Yage vented his dislike for the Sith and their policies, specifically how they manipulated all of the Empire's servants into becoming minions of the Sith. Veed warned him of treason, but Yage quickly shot back, telling the Regent that they would just as quickly dispose of him if they saw the need. Turning to Calixte, Yage said that he would tell Gunn that Calixte had asked after her, noting that Gunn had only ever received such \"civil lies\" from them. Their conversation over, Yage left to ready the Strikeforce for immediate departure for the Da Soochan moon Napdu.

The Moff was stunned by Azard's orders, believing it all to be overkill, but Yage complied nevertheless. When the bombers completed their mission, Yage ordered the War Hammer's turbolasers to open fire on the moon while Skull Squadron intercepted and destroyed any and all craft escaping the carnage.

In his transmission, Veed revealed the details of his encounter with Calixte, and the Grand Moff inquired if Yage had been aware of his former wife's true loyalties. Yage merely responded that Veed, having been Calixte's lover, had been unaware of her duplicity as well. Unsatisfied with Yage's response, Veed threatened the Moff with severe consequences if he could prove that Yage had had knowledge of Calixte's activities.

In the initial phases of the battle, Yage's forces unleashed an orbital bombardment on Taivas, but magnetic interference from the planet disrupted the Imperials' targeting computers, resulting in casualties from friendly-fire and no damage to the Hidden Temple. Resorting to a ground assault led by Moff Geist, the Sith-Imperials engaged the Jedi defenders of the Hidden Temple.
