The uni-wheel drive and chassis of the WA-7 waitress droid served as the basis for the model, which was equipped with soft glowing eyes, a soothing voice and many padded limbs to aid in caring for their infant charges.

The two droids were altered and stripped of much of their comforting design in order to pervert them for Sidious's needs. They cared for Force-sensitive infants kidnapped by the bounty hunter Cad Bane for Sidious, but were ultimately destroyed when Jedi rescued the children."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The RO-series childcare and nanny droid was a model of nanny droid that used a smooth and almost silent uni-wheel drive system that was gyro-stabilized to perfection and allowed the unit to turn on a credit chip. In order to comfort the infants they cared for, the droids were given soothing voices and softly glowing eyes that gave off comforting illumination in a light spectrum visible to their charge's species. Each of their many fine-motion manipulator limbs were covered in soft hypoallergenic padding material that was gently heated or cooled and designed specifically for the needs of the species the infant in their care belonged to. This material also coated the chest of the droid's chassis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each droid was equipped with a scanning diagnostic suite that monitored the health of the infants in their care, including a bioscanner that monitored vital signs In emergency situations, they were capable of carrying out minor procedures and used a built in comlink to immediately contact the appropriate emergency services and the infant's parents. Each RO-series droid was individually programmed with data on the species they would be dealing with, but also had access to Utilitech's sizeable databases, which granted them a wealth of data including a first aid database. The databases and the droid's core programming could be updated using a port on the unit's upper chest that could be connected via data cable to any common public or private networks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The RO-series childcare and nanny droid was a joint production by the companies GoCorp and Utilitech. Although primarily a repulsorcraft manufacturer, GoCorp was happy to provide smooth and reliable drive systems for Utilitech's service droids, and so accordingly the uni-wheel drive and chassis from Utilitech's successful WA-7 waitress droid was given a tweak and served as the basis for the RO-series. The series proved a lasting success for the two companies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith Lord Darth Sidious altered the RO-series nanny droid RO-Z67 and her \"sister\" unit to serve in a secret facility on the planet Mustafar, where he hoped to raise kidnapped Force-sensitive infants to serve him. He perverted all of the care and kindness in the RO-series's design, stripping away everything that was considerate and gentle and leaving the two droids looking more like nightmarish surgical droids than childcare units. Alterations made by the Sith's technicians included the addition of medical canisters that held basic medicines and nutrients to be given to the children and the expansion of the droids' medical database and surgical programming."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith even had the two droids' programmed duty of care altered so that they became cruel surgeons that could be ordered to carry out unnecessary and vicious operations on their subjects, and could even watch or participate in events or procedures that would lead to the death of one of the children in their care. Armed with knives, needles and other sharp instruments, the two units could even serve as combat droids if absolutely necessary."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the bounty hunter Cad Bane captured the infants Wee Dunn and Zinn Toa on orders from Sidious and delivered them into the care of RO-Z67 and her sister at the Mustafar facility. The pair cared for the infants until the Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano rescued the children, destroying the facility and droids in the process. Despite this setback, Sidious had further nanny droids altered and built new facilities on Mustafar where Force-sensitive infants where raised to become members of the Inquisitorius."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The RO-series childcare and nanny droid first appeared in \"Children of the Force,\" the third episode of Star Wars: The Clone Wars Season Two, which aired on October 9, 2009 The droid model was first named in the 2016 magazine Star Wars: Build Your Own R2-D2 33, which was published by De Agostini."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
