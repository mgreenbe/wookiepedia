The Alliance sent Green Group and Feral Group to liberate the city from the Imperial forces. A-wings from Green Group, which included the squadron's new acting commander, Lieutenant L'ulo L'ampar as Green Leader, screened the air of TIE fighters to clear a path for Feral Group's Y-wing bombers. Just as Green Group were clearing the last of the TIEs, Shara Bey's A-wing was hit by a pursuing TIE fighter, although not fatal, her ship started leaking coolant. L'ampar managed to destroy the TIE fighter before it could do any further damage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the approach was clear, Feral Group made their bombing run.
