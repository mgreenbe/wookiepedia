The cruiser and its Jedi passengers subsequently raced to provide assistance to the Trymant system. While in hyperspace, the droid informed Yoda that officials on the Starlight Beacon space station had alerted the Star Hopper that it was the only ship of the Jedi Order or Galactic Republic within range of Trymant. Padawan Farzala Tarabal suggested that they should wait for backup, but Yoda was determined to continue, seeing the Star Hopper and its Padawans as the only hope for the system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Star Hopper prepared to exit hyperspace, PZ1-3, at the cruiser's controls, provided a countdown to their arrival in the Trymant system. While the droid counted down, Yoda instructed the Padawans to report on what they had found about the situation. Upon their arrival above the planet Trymant IV, the Padawans exited the cruiser and descended toward the planet on rescue speeders to assist its inhabitants. The Jedi were ultimately able to hold off the Nihil until a Republic rescue fleet could arrive, driving away the raiders and saving the planet's population.

The Jedi had been sent to learn more about the Nihil; to do so, they wished to find other members of Trymant's Elders of the Path who could provide information on what the Nihil had wanted with Elder Tromak, who had been taken by the pirates during their earlier attack. However, upon the starship's arrival in the system, the droid was shocked to note to the Jedi that Trymant IV had been severely ecologically devastated by the Emergence, turning from a lush arboreal planet to a desert."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "PZ1-3 had masculine programming, and was outfitted with gray plating and blue sensors.
