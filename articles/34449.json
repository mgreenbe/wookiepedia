In the ship's mission recordings, the Corellia Star's captain revealed that the Empire was processing oridium ore at a facility in the Belt of Arah to fuel some new weapon that the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader intended to use to destroy the Alliance.

Soon after, Reggs again attended a briefing held by Ackbar. Intelligence reports indicated a high level of Imperial Navy activity near the planet Imdaar, in the Dantus sector of the Outer Rim Territories, and that the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Terror was en route to deploy a full wing of the new TIE Phantoms. Rookie One had volunteered to infiltrate the Terror and steal one of the new fighters to be studied in the hopes of finding a countermeasure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reggs and Krane were assigned to escort Rookie One on his way to Imdaar in a three-ship flight group of Y-wings.
