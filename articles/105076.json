The earliest possible reference to Phlogs was a boast by slavemaster Zephyrus that he had discovered a species capable of lifting a cargo skiff in one hand, and intended to ship specimens in the slave caravel Sickly Tremor. One theory held that this ship crashed on Endor, resulting in the primitive population that lived in the moon's Desert of Simoom and in the mountains. It was theorized the Gorax came from the same homeworld and arrived on the same ship. The Gorax and Phlogs fought whenever they encountered each other. Ewok legend told that the Phlogs cut down the trees of Simoom's only forest, forcing the Ewoks to migrate to the other side of the moon. Phlogs could be found on numerous planets by the Clone Wars, at least some of them coming there as slaves captured in the Moddell sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Normally peaceful, Phlogs had short tempers and became dangerous when disturbed\u2014such as when they felt their young were threatened. For example, some attacked the Sanyassan Marauders after that group arrived on Endor, but General Yavid's battle strategies kept them at bay."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Phlogs rarely entered the forests, likely due to their tremendous size, but on a few occasions, a family of Phlogs interacted with the Ewoks of Bright Tree Village. In one instance, the Phlogs tried to chop down trees sacred to the Ewoks to build a new castle. Wicket Wystri Warrick, Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka, and other Ewoks drove them away."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
