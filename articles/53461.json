A \"palace and fortress\" in Marchion's eyes, the vessel was formerly owned by his father, Asgar Ro. Unlike the other vessels utilized by the Nihil, the Gaze Electric was crewed by droids and hired personnel rather than by Nihil themselves, as Marchion was unable to trust the members of the group. The Gaze Electric was home to the medical pod of Mari San Tekka, a hyperspace prospector who Marchion used to generate the Paths that the Nihil utilized in their operations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
