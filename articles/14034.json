Myles\u2013Fett's aide-de-camp\u2013decided to provide Fett with air support using his jetpack but a Jedi used Force Jump to reach him and cut him in half. This pushed Fett over the edge and resulted in him killing five Jedi with his bare hands. At the same time, Komari Vosa aggressively cut down scores of Mandalorians. Fett then confronted the Jedi who killed Myles. After Fett had thrown himself at the unknown Jedi they had a brief fight, which ended in the Jedi's death.

Two different dates (44 BBY and 41 BBY) were also given for the battle in the Star Wars Annual 2008. In addition, the databank article on Antidar Williams, written by a fan for a What's The Story? contest, places the battle several years after the 44 BBY Stark Hyperspace War. The Essential Atlas again places it at 44 BBY. Galaxy at War dates the end of the war (and therefore this battle) to 34 BBY, the first resource to corroborate the original dating.
