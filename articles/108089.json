The first of these soldiers were CT-9904's Elite Squad, led by CT-9904, previously known as Crosshair, a former member of Clone Force 99. The project was part of Vice Admiral Rampart's vision for the Empire, and he received support from Wilhuff Tarkin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plans for the initiative were contained with similar top-secret projects covered by the Tarkin Initiative at the Citadel Tower on Scarif, along with those of the Death Star and Stellar Sphere. When he learned of a rebel incursion at Scarif, Tarkin thought it would be a special pity to see War-Mantle be setback, though he also noted it would hardly be a major blow to the galactic timetable, particularly with the Death Star now online. At one point, rebel technician Tenzigo Weems found a mention of it in an intercepted data packet that was pulled from the Balmorra relay and reported it to Davits Draven."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "War-Mantle was first mentioned in the 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and its adaptations, but would not be seen on screen until the third episode of the 2021 Disney+ series Star Wars: The Bad Batch, where it was revealed to focus on the Empire's recruitment of conscripted soldiers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
