She was sent by Queen Mother Tenel Ka to serve as Jacen Solo's command liaison and advisor onboard the Anakin Solo when he went to arrest Ducha AlGray. Later, Jacen would Force choke her when she questioned his orders. She was released from the choke after Jacen thought he made his point. Espara escorted Allana back to Hapes after the defeat of Hapan Heritage Council. After the brief duel between Leia Organa Solo and Tahiri Veila on Hapes, she escorted Tahiri back to her StealthX and had her cloaking unit removed to ensure she didn't sneak back to Hapes on the orders of the Queen Mother, after making those suggestions personally."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
