At some point before the end of the Manderon Period, an outside species chose the star and its system to implement Project Iokath. Every orbital body in the system, down to the last asteroid, was demolished and salvaged for core elements to create a massive self-sustaining ecosphere that completely engulfed the star, utilizing 100% of its energy output. The massive habitat was named Iokath and since once completed it allowed no light from the star outside, the entire system became undetectable to the rest of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
