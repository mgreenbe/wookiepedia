The Alliance leadership suspected that there was an installation in that area, and three Rogue Squadron members led by Wedge Antilles were sent to investigate. After fighting past Imperial ships to reach the planetoid the Rebels received a transmission from Neth begging for someone to hear her. She identified herself to Antilles as the leader of the prisoners and asked Antilles and his wingmen to destroy the guard towers protecting the prison building. She then transmitted targeting information to the Rebels' Y-wings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the Rogues destroyed the prison's defenses, Neth and the others commandeered an armored hovertrain and headed to a landing platform as the fighter pilots held off the Imperial forces.
