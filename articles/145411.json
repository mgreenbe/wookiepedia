They found themselves unable to leave the planet due to a LaserWeb Defense Station left around the planet by the Separatists when they abandoned the world. The locals stranded on Iego thought the LaserWeb was the deity known as Drol. Skywalker and Kenobi were forced to destroy the laser grid in order to return to Naboo to deliver the Reeksa root. They succeeded in destroying most of the LaserWeb, enough to allow themselves to leave the planet, along with anyone else that wished to leave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, after the Senate hostage crisis, Skywalker and Kenobi were called back to Iego by Jaybo Hood to investigate a suspected return of Separatist forces in the section of the debris field around Iego known as the Thicket. When the Jedi ordered two manned V-19 Torrent starfighters into the Thicket to search for any sign of Separatist activity, one of the fighters was destroyed by an unmanned probe reprogrammed by the IG-86 sentinel droid HELIOS-3D. The second fighter was destroyed by the reactivated LaserWeb Defense Station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
