It was made up of about 3,000 people, who were mainly former officers in the Imperial Navy, who had grown tired of the constant political posturing within the Empire. It was lead by Admiral Natasi Daala and her second-in-command Yelnor. They had a fleet of ships and they flew from world-to-world, in search of somewhere to live where they could stay loyal to the New Order and not become part of the New Republic. Eventually, they made a deal with K'iin to live on the planet Pedducis Chorios. However, the planet was infected with the Death Seed plague and the colonists had to defend themselves when the New Republic entered the system to deal with it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
