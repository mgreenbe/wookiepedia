When detonated, the N-4 emitted a sharp blast of broad-spectrum sound, causing intense pain to those near the epicenter. While the sound only lasted for a few seconds, nearby targets experienced lingering effects for long periods of time afterwards, which resulted in some covering their ears or running from the grenade unless they were wearing a helmet equipped with appropriate reactive hearing protection. The N-4 was also favorited by burglars, who utilized them to discourage pursuits if chased, while bounty hunters used them to disable security forces around well-protected targets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
