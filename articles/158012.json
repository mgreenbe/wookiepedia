After Alliance picket ships detected Imperial system patrol craft nearby, Admiral Ackbar redeployed Rebel starfighter sentry lines away from the bulk of the Fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two hours after this redeployment, an Imperial Star Destroyer launched an unconfirmed number of probe droids into the Endor system. The Star Destroyer then jumped to hyperspace before it could be engaged by Alliance forces. This ship was identified as the Unrepentant by various individuals within the Alliance: tentatively so by historian Voren Na'al and Major Bren Derlin, and with more certainty by Major Breslin Drake of Alliance Intelligence. For Admiral Ackbar, the appearance of a Star Destroyer confirmed that Imperial forces were still in the area. Alliance starfighters swept the area for the deployed probe droids and were believed to have destroyed them all, though several of the fighters were damaged by the droid's weaponry. Major Drake determined that the Unrepentant's probe droids were unsuccessful in ascertaining the deployment of the Rebel fleet, as only a small minority of them were able to transmit any data back to the Imperial battle group regrouping in the Annaj system, and the data that they were able to transmit was contradictory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
