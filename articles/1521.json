It was easily portable, allowing to move it from one starship to another. In 4 BBY, the rebel cell of Kanan Jarrus and Hera Syndulla managed to steal six 49-v99 Deflectors from the Empire. The rebels traded three of those deflectors to Lando Calrissian, a smuggler who agreed to help them get passage off the planet of Lothal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
