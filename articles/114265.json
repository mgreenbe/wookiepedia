After having been presented with the supposedly-captured Geonosian schematics of the \"Ultimate Weapon\", the group, headed by Professor Sahali, set out to build the mobile battle station before the Separatists could. To this end, it secretly recruited the top minds of the Republic, such as Doctor Gubacher and Lieutenant Commander Orson Krennic, who would recruit other top scientists, such as Reeva Demesne and Galen Erso, into the program but keep them in the dark of the true purpose of their research."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the end of the war and the reformation of the Republic into the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, the group was reformed into the Imperial Project Celestial Power, under the Imperial Military Department of Advanced Weapons Research, which Krennic would eventually rise to command."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
