Built and programmed by swoop riders and enthusiasts for his characteristic volume and energy, the droid operated as the live commentator of the All Worlds Ultimate Swoop Rally in the aftermath of the Dantooine Incursion[source?] that took place during the Third Galactic War.[source?] To advertise the rally, B4-N9 hijacked a Galaxywide NewsNets newscast from Dantooine, leading to the Commander of the Eternal Alliance to investigate the event. The Commander arrived at the Swoop Rally on Dantooine to find the retired swoop racer Zella, who, when asked of the intense droid who interrupted the news, referred to the droid as Beefour and spoke of his role in the rally. Zella further encouraged the Commander to discover the thrill of swoop racing by becoming acquainted with swoop leaders, who in turn convinced the Alliance leader to participate in the swoop event with B4-N9 providing commentary."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "B4-N9's commentary included remarks such as \"Keep that boost going!,\" \"Brilliant maneuvers!,\" and \"Now that's gonna leave a mark!\" B4-N9's commentary was also composed of exclamations such as \"Are!
