Two years into the conflict, Jiro and his crew were boarded by the renegade Sith Lord Maul and his brother Savage Opress, who demanded they give them their allegiance. Jiro decided to betray Ohnaka and serve the new masters and fought against his former comrades until Jedi arrived to help Ohnaka's side. Jiro and some of the other pirates who served Maul were accepted back by Ohnaka, and the now united Ohnaka Gang, with the help of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, drove Maul and Opress from Florrum, with Jiro hitting Maul's cybernetic legs as the two Sith retreated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
