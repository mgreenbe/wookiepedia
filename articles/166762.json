Native to the planet Yinchorr, the Yinchorri were divided into two castes: the Intelligentsia, who governed through the Council of Elders of each city-state, and a highly aggressive warrior caste. They were also known to value family ties. They had strong willpower that allowed them to resist attempts by slavers to enslave them. They also had the skill to develop specialized technology. However, they were poor strategists. Yinchorri culture was best characterized by the expression, \"might makes right\"; they considered anything they were able to take and hold by force to be rightfully theirs\u2014anything they disliked was to be destroyed. They were commonly found as pirates, mercenaries or in other violent jobs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Galactic Republic, the Yinchorri joined the galactic community but, being a potential threat, they were not provided with starships.

Afterward, an embargo was placed on their homeworld. That was Sidious' plan.

The galactic government answered their uprising by destroying the reptilians' civilization. Although the New Republic later helped the surviving Yinchorri retake control of their planet, the species refused to join another galactic government.

The Yinchorri body was covered by thick skin, which was dark green or brown in color."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Adult Yinchorri could attain a height between 2.4 to 2.7 meters. They had greater endurance than Humans, allowing them to withstand pain, and they were more resistant to heat because of their cold blood.

The first ill effects of age appeared at 41 years of age, with seniority being reached at 60, which was 20 years before the end of their life expectancy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The species was divided into two breeds: The Intelligentsia, who performed governing tasks, and the warrior caste, who were known to use violence in response to threats. No matter the breed, all the Yinchorri had a natural resistance to the mind-controlling uses of the Force, due to an adaptation of their Midi-chlorians\u2014microscopic, symbiotic life forms that resided inside the cells of all living things\u2014which caused the symbionts to generate Force-devoid bubbles around their hosts. The Sith Lord Darth Plagueis believed that the Yinchorri had evolved their Force resistance as a response to a past threat to their survival, and he suspected that the species were naturally strong in the Force.

Those things that they disliked or had no need for were destroyed. Due to a lack of neural pathways in the Yinchorri forebrain, members of the species had an instinctive disposition towards violence that rendered them unruly and unpredictable. Yinchorri only became fiercer and more obstinate when confronted by opponents; should such rivals prove a threat to Yinchorri or their loved ones, the reptilians' demeanor could explode into physical violence\u2014although direct threats were not always necessary to inflame a Yinchorri's temper to the point of physical confrontation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yinchorri lived in city-states on the planet Yinchorr. Each community had its own military and its own rulers. Most city-states were ruled by a Council of Elders headed by a single leader. Thus, the Yinchorri had no planet-wide ruler. The Council was highly respected by the Yinchorri. Each city-state also had smaller communities around it providing the city-state with resources such as minerals and farmed food; the number of those settlements was used to measure the polity's influence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yinchorri were inept strategists and easily tricked by manipulative individuals who preyed on their na\u00efvet\u00e9. As such, they were led by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and his minions not only to rise up against the Galactic Republic, but also to make tactical moves that damned their own war effort. During the years of the Galactic Civil War, agents of the Galactic Empire made good use of the Yinchorri gullibility by betraying them after tricking a Yinchorri commander and his pilot. Those Yinchorri brought Leia Organa to Yinchorr, following Imperial orders, and then were promptly killed by the Empire before the Yinchorri could understand the reasons behind the Empire's reversal."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Social structure"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To the Yinchorri, social structure was a natural part of their existence, as each Yinchorri was always part of several communities: First the childhood family, then the city-state where they grew up, then the work environment, and finally the new family they formed with a mate. Yinchorri particularly valued the institution of marriage, and the species mated for life. In some cases, a widow or widower suffered so much that she or he might die of sorrow only days after the mate's death. Marriages were frequently arranged by the parents of the couple to increase the power of the family; polygyny, the form of polygamy in which a male had several wives, was not unheard of. Neither was marriage among a Yinchorri and a non-Yinchorri alien. Yinchorri were known to distrust aliens as they were not born among their clans, but this taboo could be broken through inter-species marriage. For example, in 33 BBY, the daughters of several Yinchorri Elders married the same Devaronian for political reasons. From that point on, the Yinchorri Elders considered that Devaronian and his family to be a part of their own families."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Technology"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yinchorri developed technology adapted to their own needs and environment. An example was the Yinchorri flutter-pack, a backpack with four insect-like wings whose fluttering allowed the user to fly for one hour. The device was capable of carrying a cargo of 200 kilograms; its flight ceiling was 1,000 meters. The user, commonly a Yinchorri, utilized a gauntlet to control speed and direction, with a hand-held weapon in the free hand. Those devices were often worn in conjunction with protective goggles.

Their thick skin evolved as a means of protection against the arid environment of their homeworld. Yinchorr had little in the way of natural resources. It was, however, rich in predators, including the rolk-mangir. The Yinchorri eventually organized themselves into rival city-states. In the most ancient epochs of Yinchorr's history, Tol-Kachorn was the strongest of these, with almost one hundred small communities providing it with resources and five lesser city-states serving as its satellites. Several other polities tried to challenge the supremacy of Tol-Kachorn, confrontations that sparked wars of conquest that always ended in the defeat of the contender\u2014and the reign of chaos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the years following the end of the New Sith Wars, the Yinchorri species was mentioned in the Jedi training manual The Jedi Path, in an entry on Force-resistant aliens that was written by the Jedi Master and biologist Bowspritz."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 500 BBY, Yinchorr was charted by the Galactic Republic. Alien scouts decided that the Yinchorri were too underdeveloped to be useful to the Republic, and the planet was deemed too deficient in resources to be useful for a settlement. On the scouts' advisement, the Republic disregarded the world and the Republic refused to admit Yinchorr as a member, despite the desire of the Yinchorri to become part of the pan-galactic democracy. In 67 BBY, the Yinchorri Council of Elders sent a delegation led by Qayhuk, the Council's secretary, to a meeting of some of the galaxy's most influential beings on the moon Sojourn, to request that the Muun power broker Hego Damask lobby the Republic on their behalf. Damask, the public persona of Darth Plagueis, had heard rumors of the alleged Force resistance of the Yinchorri and he attempted to perform a mind trick on Qayhuk. Impressed by the secretary's immunity to Force-based influence, Damask agreed that his company, Damask Holdings, would exert pressure on the Republic to give the Yinchorri a seat in the Galactic Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 58 BBY, the Yinchorri joined the galactic community, but most planetary representatives assumed that the species would go unnoticed in the grand scheme of galaxy-wide politics. The Yinchorri officially became members of the Republic the following year as a result of Damask Holdings' influence, and they were eventually given representation in the Galactic Senate. On attaining their seat in the Senate, the Yinchorri Council of Elders provided Damask with a convicted Yinchorri murderer as a gift, and he experimented on the criminal to learn more about the innate resistance of the Yinchorri to Force-based suggestion. After two years of study, Plagueis discovered a way by which he could bypass the convict's Force immunity and compel the murderer to become placid. The Muun developed plans to assemble an army of Yinchorri to wage war against the Jedi Order, so he traveled to the planet Kamino to discuss with the Kaminoan cloners the possibility of creating a force of obedient, cloned Yinchorri soldiers. However, the Kaminoan scientist Ko Sai expressed doubts that compliance could be bred into the Yinchorri without compromising their violent tendencies. Despite her concerns, Plagueis decided to press ahead with the development of the army and provided the Kaminoans with the Yinchorri convict. After repeated attempts, all efforts to successfully clone the Yinchorri failed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yinchorri were introduced to interstellar travel through means that, according to rumor, involved stolen technology. The species began to work offworld in violent occupations, making good use of their natural drive. They soon adapted to the galaxy and developed a love for the latest military technology, including starships. Even then, few Yinchorri felt the need to settle in other, less inhospitable systems. Those who did so had to take with them all of their relatives and their relatives' families, which usually meant the relocation of an entire town or city-state. The Yinchorri colonized three other planets in the Yinchorri system: Yitheeth, which had only seven percent of the surface covered in land and was otherwise a shallow sea; Yibikkoror, characterized by its dense atmosphere; and Uhanayih, a rock with no life except for the settlers. The word Uhanayih was related to myths and legends about living in the \"spiritual world.\" The galaxy however, understanding that the Yinchorri were aggressive, restricted the sale of starships to the species. The Human Jedi Master Tharence Wo researched the Yinchorri and wrote detailed reports for the use of future Jedi.

However, Sidious was also threatened by Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum and the Jedi Order, and after realizing the futility of forging the Yinchorri into a controllable fighting force, he decided to manipulate the Yinchorri so that they became an apparent hazard to the Galactic Republic.

Grahrk was sent to Yinchorr with advanced combat technology with which he defeated the Yinchorri guards. Having impressed the Yinchorri, he was granted an audience with five important Yinchorri leaders, including Jorek, Kardek and Sothek. Grahrk convinced the Yinchorri that they could increase their prominence in the galaxy by stealing several ships from the nearby shadowport Golden Nyss Shipyards, with Grahrk's help, as the Yinchorri were unable to pilot a starship at that point.
