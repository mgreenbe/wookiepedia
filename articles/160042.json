Velrugha eventually gave up taking the planet and left the Riileb alone to search for other weaker or more compliant species to conquer. After Velrugha's attempted invasions, the Riileb remained independent of the Hutts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Velrugha was first mentioned in 1997 in the thirteenth issue of the Star Wars Adventure Journal, a series of supplements to Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game from West End Games.
