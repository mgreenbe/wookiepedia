The outpost evolved into a thriving spaceport for smugglers, rogue traders, and adventurers traveling between the galactic frontier and uncharted space.

Netal paid Ohnaka for the Falcon and delivered it to Beixander 9, where Reeloo posed as Netal's contact to accept delivery of the ship before returning it to the outpost. Ohnaka notified Chewbacca, a Wookiee and the ship's former co-pilot, that the Falcon was safe from Netal's employers.

The announcement stated that these lands would be fourteen acres in size, making them the largest single land expansions in company history.

On the back depicted part of a nine-panel map depicting the various locales of the outpost as well as some details about the specific locations. Eight of the cards also had a phrase in Aurebesh describing the location which, thanks to a Twitter user named Nick Tierce, was revealed to say in full \"At the edge of the galaxy so far away, black was the spire that called me to stay, a beacon for drifters forgotten and lost, the spire summoned those broken and tossed, come stay here forever or just pass on through, the spirit of the black spire will forever change you\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
