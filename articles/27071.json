Not all of the shots that ILM rendered for the movie made it into the final cut, leading to discrepancies between promotional pieces and the final cut of the movie. Lucasfilm Story Group member Pablo Hidalgo stated in a Star Wars Resistance Bucket's List article on StarWars.com that the fleet was made up of 14,000 starships. In an Industrial Light & Magic video showcasing the visual effects of the film, it was stated that the shot when the fleet appeared at Exegol was made up of over 16,000 ships. This article assumes that the statement from Hidalgo is the canon number for the amount of ships in the fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
