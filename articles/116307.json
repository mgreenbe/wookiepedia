Fel talked of an alliance with Gar Stazi, the leader of the Galactic Alliance Remnant, as well as the fugitive members of the New Jedi Order. However, during the final battle above Coruscant, Fel gave into the dark side when he attempted to use a Sith bioweapon to kill all life on the planet, forcing Antares Draco to kill him. In the wake of the allies' subsequent victory over the Sith, Fel was later mourned during a solemn ceremony on the reclaimed Coruscant.

During his youth, the heir of the resurrected Galactic Empire was trained as an Imperial Knight under his father's rule alongside fellow apprentice Treis Sinde. The two developed a close friendship, and Fel was known to rely greatly on Sinde's advice and wisdom. After his training ended and his father's death, Fel became Emperor and started to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather by continuing the Victory Without War program. A capable politician and a skilled military leader, Fel didn't underestimate the ambitions of the Moff Council and continuously played them against each other to maintain his base of power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point during his reign, Fel married a Hapan woman named Elliah and he fathered a daughter, Marasiah. However, Elliah was at some point killed by Eshkar Niin, one of Fel's Imperial Knights and the only knight to turn his back on his vows. Antares Draco, who had studied under both Niin and Fel, had attempted to stop his former master, and struck him down when he failed. Niin, however, had actually faked defeat and fled to join the One Sith.

At first, the project was going smoothly. But it was soon sabotaged by the new Sith Order. Not knowing this, many people cast the blame on the Vong, believing them to be renewing their crusade against the galaxy. The Alliance, at the Jedi's urging, defended the Vong, which caused many Alliance worlds to stop supporting it. Fel met with Jedi Master Kol Skywalker and promised to stay the Empire's hand while Skywalker tried to prove that the project was sabotaged. But the Moff Council, seeing the opportunity to re-establish Imperial control over the galaxy, invoked the Treaty of Anaxes and declared war on a weakened Galactic Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Roan Fel, unable to ignore the Moff Council's power to declare war, reluctantly went to war with the support of the new Sith Order. Unlike Darth Krayt and some on the Moff Council, the Emperor did not view the war as the means to achieve a grand ideological agenda. Rather, he saw it as an unfortunate political necessity, the best course of action for the Empire in a troubled galaxy. Though allied with the Sith, Fel had no desire to see the Jedi exterminated. He even forbade his Imperial Knights from fighting in the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three years later, the war was over. The Alliance fell with the defeat at Caamas and the conquest of Coruscant. It was only as the war was winding down that he realized that the Empire had been manipulated into the war by the new Sith Order and their ally on the Moff Council, Nyna Calixte. When the war ended, Fel asked the Jedi to surrender, and some of them did, but the majority of the Order refused. Fel ordered that the Jedi be allowed to return to Ossus, and called for a diplomatic mission once they had done so. But Moff Rulf Yage and Darth Nihl undermined his orders and attacked the Temple. The Massacre at Ossus, as it came to be known, wiped out half of the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fel seemed to have realized at some point that Darth Krayt and Grand Admiral Morlish Veed were plotting betrayal and, sometime after the war ended, made plans to arrest Veed. It was after this that Calixte approached Fel and told him about Krayt's intention to assassinate him at an upcoming meeting and advised him to escape. Fel realized that Calixte was telling the truth because if he died, Calixte would be useless to the Sith and would also die. So he arranged for a double to appear at the meeting instead of him. All while this was happening, he and Antares made their way through the sewers, slashing through droids before escaping.

However, Antares Draco searched for the Princess, finding her in Vendaxa, where the Sith staged an attack in which Princess Fel nearly died, though she was healed by Cade Skywalker. Afterward, Princess Fel was taken to Bastion, where she persuaded her father to allow Skywalker to leave. Emperor Fel also reprimanded Draco and Ganner Krieg for disobeying his orders. However, Emperor Fel, ever the astute politician, announced that he would retroactively approve the rescue mission to prevent his authority from being undermined.

Realizing he needed more help, he decided to form a desperate alliance with the Galactic Alliance Remnant, the Empire's oldest rivals for the past century and a half. He sent Captain Mingo Bovark to negotiate an alliance with Admiral Gar Stazi on The Wheel. Meanwhile, Moff Nyna Calixte (who was using her Morrigan Corde persona as a disguise), was trying to keep the Sith from capturing her son, Cade Skywalker. During this, she found out about the meeting on the Wheel. With the help of a Sith agent named Jor Tolin, Calixte was able to override the guns on Bovark's shuttle and have them fire on Stazi's shuttle, making it appear to be a trap set by Fel. The sabotage worked, and both Stazi and Bovark left the station. Fel's forces continued to stand alone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By this time, the Sith knew that Fel had retaken Bastion.

When he contacted Fel again, Fel once again told him to return to Bastion. Sinde asked when a transport would arrive to get him, and Fel said there wouldn't be one since he couldn't spare one. Sinde then smugly told Fel that without outside help, getting off Dac would be impossible.

His theory, having seen that the Sith were not as united as they believed, was that with Krayt dead the other Sith would turn on each other just as they always had throughout history, and everything they had done would be undone.

Fel was intrigued by the notion of turning his enemies into monsters under his control, and ordered Draco to bring him Morne or the Talisman after Krayt had been assassinated. This caused both Ganner Krieg and Azlyn Rae's confidence in Fel to be shaken, with Krieg reminding Draco that Imperial Knights owe their allegiance to the Emperor only as long as he serves the light side of the Force, and should he fall to the dark side it was the Imperial Knights' duty to turn him back to the light or remove him from power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Krayt took the bait, and this resulted in a duel that saw Krayt killed by his most trusted advisor and the Imperial Knights failing to secure the talisman before it was destroyed by Cade Skywalker himself.\nDraco and Krieg reported back to Fel.

While Krieg argued the Talisman was too evil to use, Fel claimed nothing was too evil to be used against the Sith, especially against the armies who serve them. Then, he sent Krieg to retrieve Azlyn Rae, who had been taken to Kiffex by Skywalker and his crew, and Sigel Dare to retrieve Treis Sinde and ordered Draco to find out if Krayt was really dead.

One Sith ship refused to surrender, and Admiral Edouard Fenel, the commander of Fel's Bastion Second Fleet, ordered the ship be destroyed.

Fel revealed that he feared that the past seven years of fighting the Sith had corrupted him. He wondered if the use of the dark side to free the galaxy from tyranny was acceptable. Sinde told him that it wasn't as Fel would just turn into another Darth Krayt. He also reminded his old friend that all the Imperial Knights, including his daughter, had sworn to kill him if he turned to the dark side.

Maladi made Fel an offer: in exchange for Cade's head, she would create a Sith toxin for him known as Omega Red which could kill any species on a planet.
