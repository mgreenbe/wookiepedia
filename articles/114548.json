Many in the Republic and Jedi Order believed him to be dead. His apprentice Anakin Skywalker, who had doubts about his master's death, was assigned temporarily under tutelage of Ki-Adi-Mundi, until the Jedi Council would make a decision about his fate as a Jedi padawan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The future events proved however that Anakin had been right all the time. After Separatists victory on Jabiim, Kenobi and his loyal comrade-in-arms clone trooper Alpha-17 had been captured by Dark Acolyte and Confederate commander Asajj Ventress, who had subjected both of them to torture. The prisoners had managed to escape, but hot pursuit by Separatists forces, including Vulture starfighters, had damaged their stolen starship and made the escapees crashed on the Separatist-controlled planet Riflor. Some bounty hunters, very eager to earn credits, had killed Confederate soldiers to take full credit for capturing Obi-Wan and Alpha-17."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Battle of Varonat, in which the Jedi destroyed pirate forces, Anakin sensed that his old master was still alive, but he was in serious trouble.

Though the fugitives were doing their best they were outnumbered and Rigo decided it was much safer to kill them than gain a bounty by capturing them.
