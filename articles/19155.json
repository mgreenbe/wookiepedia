She used a hoversled to load cargo boxes while Antilles conversed with Garsa and the protocol droid C-3PO. His counterpart, the astromech droid R2-D2, attempted to alert Bonipa to the actions of the Prowler 1000 seeker droid PTZ-1K as it tried to access the ship's communication grid to send a message to the Empire. She ignored the astro-droid and the crew returned to the ship to leave the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R2 continued to cause trouble aboard the ship, and Bonipa backed up Antilles alongside Caibol in confronting the droids in the cargo hold. Antilles ordered them to have the droids' memories wiped, and the pair led the two troublesome units away. However, R2 released an oil slick, causing Bonipa and Caibol to skid and C-3PO to land on the pair, giving R2 the chance to flee. Bonipa realized the droid had a plan, and followed R2 back to the cargo hold to fill Antilles in. The four were able to catch PTZ-1K as the unit attempted to send a transmission to the Empire, stalled by C-3PO's ingenuity, and Bonipa helped Caibol grab the spy droid at blaster-point. The crew decided to have the seeker droid's memory wiped, putting an end to the incident."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a crew member of the Tantive IV, Bonipa wore a blue jacket with a fur collar, a gray undershirt, beige pants with a holster strapped to her thigh, and dark boots.
