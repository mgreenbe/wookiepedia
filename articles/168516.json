They were genetically created by the DarkStryder to serve as scouts. The race eventually escaped and formed their own society. The Zizimaak despised their creator, the DarkStryder, and developed a friendly alliance with the Charr Ontee and the Yapi though they fed on them and the Segmi. Unlike the other genetically made servants of the Kathol or DarkStryder, the Zizimaak had no connection with the mystical Ta-Ree life energy that existed on the homeworld of the Kathol. They aided the FarStar crew and helped fight against Imperial Moff Kentor Sarne."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
