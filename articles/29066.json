The Predictor collected data and used it to predict and calculate the future. It would instantly perform an infinite number of simultaneous calculations, identifying all the variables and quantum possibilities in any situation, and used this information to automatically adjust the outcome to get the most optimal and favorable result possible. It was hoped to be the solution that allowed a cloaked starship to fire its weapons accurately. Admiral Gilad Pellaeon later attempted to use the Predictor in a different role, to analyze the tactics of an unknown enemy and discern their identity; though it was concluded there was still little true accuracy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
