It was served at the eatery known as Dex's Diner in the CoCo Town district of the planet Coruscant as a dessert for 2.7 credits. The Besalisk chef and owner of the establishment, Dexter Jettster, used an antigrav whisk in the process of making the cakes, which he claimed tasted heavenly. The use of the antigrav whisk gave them a fluffy texture, although the process required patience. The cake was served at Dex's at some point prior to the eatery's destruction during the first two years of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Iego angel food cake was first mentioned in the 2009 StarWars.com Hyperspace-exclusive article \"Dining at Dex's,\" which was written by Gregory Walker as an in-universe menu for Dex's Diner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
