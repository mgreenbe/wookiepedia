Millennia before the Corellian Crisis, this den was destroyed when its outer wall suddenly collapsed. Within minutes, it was filled with silt and mud that buried the Selonians occupiers alive. Legends would speak of valuable artifacts and relics buried within the den which led to the Sacorrian Triad attempting to excavate the site in order to recover the valuables for themselves. The Triad would be thwarted by a group of freelance explorers that managed to hold the Sacorrians long enough for the den to be declared a sanctuary."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
