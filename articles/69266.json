Binks later helped his people colonize the nearby Naboo moon Ohma-D'un. During his career as Junior Representative, he acted as Amidala's proxy and proposed giving Supreme Chancellor Palpatine emergency powers in order to deal with the Separatist Crisis.

Due to his clumsiness and ineptitude, however, Binks was never able to become what his father had wanted him to be. Once, while on an expedition to hunt a whale in the southernmost seas of Naboo, George ordered his son to hold the wheel steady; Binks, however, let go. This caused their ship to crash into the whale which resulted in the ship sinking to the bottom of the ocean."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A month later, George Binks, his wife, and Jar Jar were all stranded on a desert island.

Binks was about to jump into the water when George's wife reprimanded him and stopped George from allowing him to do so. Unable to take it anymore George lamented over what could have been; he called his son an imbecile and attempted to commit suicide by shooting himself with his blaster pistol but only grazed his head, resulting in it not being lethal.

That is when he was discovered by local lawbreaker Roos Tarpals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tarpals was the leader of a small band of young thieves. Binks was given the job of distracting security patrols while Tarpals and his gang pulled off various scams. Unlike the other thieves, Tarpals treated Binks like a valued team member and a friend. This friendship ended when Tarpals enlisted in the Gungan Grand Army. The band soon scattered and Binks again began searching for his place in life. Fortunately, Boss Rugor Nass, ruler of Otoh Gunga, arranged new employment for Binks, partly out of respect for his parents, and partly on the request of now-Captain Tarpals.

He was both disappointed and relieved when Boss Nass revoked the life debt on a technicality."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Boss Nass threw a lavish party at his mansion and gave Binks a job in the kitchen. However, Binks destroyed the gasser oven. The explosion cracked the bubble wall and flooded the party. Binks tried to save Boss Nass's luxury heyblibber, but ended up crashing it instead. Boss Nass was outraged, and decided that he had had enough. In the Gungan High Council Chamber of Judgment, Nass, along with his peers, invoked the Nocombackie Law, banishing Binks and preventing him from ever returning to Otoh Gunga upon pain of death. Binks tried to hide in Otoh Gunga but Captain Tarpals found him in Chef Brass Marshoo's restaurant scrounging for scraps. Tarpals apprehended him and prepared to take him to the surface, however, he was ambushed by Marshoo and several thugs. Tarpals was knocked out in the scuffle, but Binks saved him. The hapless Gungan pleaded with Tarpals for clemency, but was ignored.

Jinn tackled Binks to the ground and held him there to prevent them both from getting crushed by a Multi-Troop Transport that was passing by. As a result of this life-saving act, Binks, despite being an outcast, adhered to the Gungan principle of a life debt and insisted on following Jinn, much to the Jedi's annoyance. Both Jinn and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, needed to contact Queen Amidala in Theed, but had no way of reaching her. Binks suggested that they go to Otoh Gunga, his old home, but quickly regretted mentioning it.

Following that, Nass sentenced Binks to death, but Jinn quickly interceded, citing that Binks's life belonged to him, due to the Gungan life debt system. Nass had Binks freed and sent along with the Jedi to Theed.

Jinn convinced the Queen to go to Coruscant, to plead her case to the Senate, a choice that would result in Binks leaving the planet for the very first time.

They came across Watto's Shop, which had the parts they needed. However, they had no way of purchasing them, due to the Republic Credit's lack of use in backwater planets like Tatooine. At Watto's Shop, they encountered a young boy, Anakin Skywalker. After leaving the shop, Binks crossed paths with Sebulba, a thug who threatened to beat Binks to a pulp after an incident where Binks inadvertently ruined his meal by spitting out a Gorg that he attempted to eat before learning from Gragra that the Gorg cost seven wupiupi. Only the timely intervention of Skywalker saved him. Skywalker was but a poor slave, nonetheless, he offered the group shelter and hospitality when they were caught in a sandstorm.

Whether or not his efforts were of any help was irrelevant (having once gotten his hand stuck in one of the compressors of the engines of Skywalker's podracer, as well as inadvertently causing his tongue to go numb from making contact with the energy binders while getting up to retrieve a wrench he dropped); Skywalker appreciated the assistance. On the day of the Boonta Eve Classic Race, Binks continued to assist, and observed the race from a special platform reserved for the racer's family and friends. Binks was thrilled when Skywalker won, mostly at the prospect of being able to leave the inhospitable Tatooine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If Binks was taken aback by Tatooine, nothing could prepare him for Coruscant.

He stayed at Senator Palpatine's apartments in the 500 Republica, eagerly awaiting the chance to return home. The chance came when Amidala was refused aid in the Senate, and decided to take matters into her own hands.

He knew of the Gungan Sacred Place however, and took the Queen there. Upon meeting Nass, she made an alliance with him, unifying the Gungan and the Naboo people after years of bitter hatred and isolation. He was also shocked when Padm\u00e9, the supposed handmaiden to Queen Amidala, had revealed herself to in fact actually be Queen Amidala herself. Nass was most pleased with the new alliance, and attributed it all to Binks, much to the latter's embarrassment. As a \"reward,\" Nass appointed Binks as joint commander of the Gungan Grand Army, giving him the rank of Bombad General\u2013a decision that made him faint with shock. Shortly after the promotion, Amidala revealed her plan: The Gungan Grand Army would draw OOM-9's army out of Theed, leaving the capital relatively unprotected. She and her task-force, along with the Jedi, would first liberate the Theed Hangar, allowing pilots to take their starfighters and attack the Droid Control Ship, hopefully deactivating all of the droids in the Federation droid army.

During the chaos, Binks accidentally sent a cascading wave of energy balls into a pack of B1-Series battle droids and Armored Assault Tanks, which slowed the Federation advance for a while and allowed some Gungans to escape. However, Binks and his old friend, Tarpals, were rounded up and captured.

Having resigned from the Gungan Grand Army, he resided at the Naboo Royal Palace. During his stay in Theed, Binks had long discussions with the queen, who told him of the reasons why she had entered the political arena. Those intense conversations sparkled a newfound and naive enthusiasm for politics in the Gungan's mind, and he decided to follow that path too. Having learned the nuances and language of politics, Binks became a Rep on the Otoh Gunga High Council led by Boss Nass. In order to achieve that, the Gungan had not hesitated to play on his former position in the Grand Army, proving himself shrewder than many of his detractors thought.

One day, a group of heavily armed assassins tied with the Confederacy of Independent Systems infiltrated the embassy, which the Chancellor was to visit, disguised as cooks. By a happy concurrence of circumstances, Binks managed to foil the assassins while Typho was incapacitated. In order to thank Binks for his role in stopping the assassination attempt, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine appointed him as the new Associate Planetary Representative for Naboo in the Galactic Senate, to the Gungan's intense delight. As such, he would represent Naboo in the congress in the absence of Amidala, who had finished her terms as queen and succeeded Horace Vancil as head of the Naboo Senatorial Delegation.

During the opening ceremony of the Endangered Shreebird Aviary, the Gungan accidentally deactivated the force-field dome that contained the rare creatures, repeating his legendary goof at the Gungan Municipal Zoo years earlier. While attending an important fundraising gala in the Jrade Plaza, Binks provoked another disaster while trying to mimick the table manners of his colleague Orn Free Taa of Ryloth. Having tucked the tablecloth into his ceremonial robes, Binks dived while trying to catch a handful canap\u00e9s spilled by a passing waiter. By doing so, the Gungan pulled the tablecloth violently, destroying a priceless ice sculpture of the famous artist Kime Enanrum in the process. The priceless artifact was so completely destroyed that it seemed to be snowing in Jrade Plaza for a few hours. Only a few weeks later, Representative Binks caused a level-five security alert at a fundraiser for the Refugee Relief Movement when he inexplicably vanished from sight. It turned out the Gungan had accidentally locked himself in the building's cloakroom. Despite his legendary disasters, Binks was often invited at galas and other social events, in part because his presence guaranteed good media coverage. Some journalists, however, were genuinely fond of him. Even the usually ferocious and critical Dyslogia Twang admittedly appreciated Binks' gentle sincerity, and he even praised the Gungan's fashion acumen.

In Amidala's absence, however, Binks was easily manipulated by more experienced politicians, and as they preyed on his innocence, they convinced him that the creation of an army for the Republic was a course of action that Amidala would have taken. In fact, the creation of an army was exactly what Amidala had been fighting against. Feeling that it was his duty to act in her stead, he suggested that the Senate give Supreme Chancellor Palpatine the emergency powers required to create a Grand Army of the Republic.

Organa and Binks stressed their humanitarian intentions in the matter, but Dod pointed out that by agreeing to deliver supplies to Ryloth, it would be aiding Republic troops, and with Toydaria having declared strict neutrality in this war, it would destroy their neutrality. After thorough consideration, Katuunko officially denies the Republic their rights to a base on Toydaria, but afterwards he secretly met Organa and Binks and tells them that the humanitarian factor had actually gained his favor. He agreed to load the supply ships they already had at the time with with a preliminary supply of provisions if Organa could keep the involvement of Toydaria secret. Organa protested, as the supplies would only aid the Twi'leks for a few days, but the king said this was the best he could supply.
