Firing large bore shells of caseless ammunition, the Hammer gained it's name not only from the extreme damage it inflicted on armored targets, but from the extreme recoil generated with each shot. Often, the weapons recoil was so powerful it forced most sentients to pause for several seconds to re-aim; because of this, the weapon was often left to much stronger sentients who could fire the weapon in quick succession. While not intentional, the weapons caseless ammunition had armor piercing qualities that made it devastating even to armored targets - something that was a necessity on Goroth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
