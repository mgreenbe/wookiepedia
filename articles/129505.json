The pyramid was concerned with upholding the Sith code among the Sith Order and the denizens of the Sith Empire. Sympathizers of the light side would be hunted down and rooted out, regardless of their Force-sensitivity. This included those who wished to proselytize alternate philosophy or theology that directly contested with or challenged the validity of the Sith. The Sphere was also responsible for spreading anti-Jedi sentiment and dictating the 'proper' way to practice the Sith code. During the Cold War with the Republic, Darth Aruk\u2014the Dark Councilor in charge of the Sphere\u2014worked to destroy the Revanites for spreading their teachings across the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Empire's defeat at the hands of the Eternal Empire, this sphere was combined along with the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and Sphere of Mysteries into the Sphere of Sith Doctrine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
