The disks bore a stylized image of the star Ardos on one side and the sigil of the kajidic that issued the disk on the other. Ardos disks were given as rewards to highly favored servants and emissaries of Hutt Lords, as well as those who were victorious in the Granee Noopa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ardos disks identified the bearer as being under the protection of the disk's issuer, and for a Hutt to kill the possessor of an Ardos disk was nearly as taboo as the murder of another Hutt; most Hutts and their servants honored the relative immunity afforded those given such a rare boon. Conversely, the theft or forgery of an Ardos disk was seen as a heinous act among the Hutts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
