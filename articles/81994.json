One such rifle was kept secure in the Jedi Archives.

It can also be activated to self-destruct with enough force to break open a large hole in the Jedi Temple wall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning to the Jedi Temple after its fall during the Great Jedi Purge, Jocasta Nu used the Archives' rifle in conjunction with her lightsaber when she confronted Darth Vader in 19 BBY.
