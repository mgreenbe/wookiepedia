It was based around Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, focusing on elements relating to the middle act of the movie, specifically the planet of Coruscant. Many of the cards are bordered purple, the color assigned to the planet of Coruscant. This set introduced senators and Supreme Chancellor Valorum to the card game. Senator Palpatine makes his appearance not as a playable character, but as a battle card. This avoided the \"uniqueness rule\" about Palpatine and Darth Sidious being on the table at the same time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This expansion contained 140 cards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Card types"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Card list"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External Links"}]}
