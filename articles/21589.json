When it was performed in the more widely spoken language of Galactic Basic Standard, Buy'ce gal, buy'ce tal was often given an approximate translation rather than a direct one, with the lyrics edited to be less explicit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "First appearing in Star Wars canon in the opening of the twenty-first chapter of Republic Commando: Triple Zero by Karen Traviss, the song was identified only as a nameless popular Mandalorian drinking chant.
