In 20 BBY, Krix partook in a series of hunts that were to serve as the first of guild boss Garnac's son, Dar. Krix witnessed Dar's initiation ceremony, but the young hunter was killed the following day by Ahsoka Tano, one of the Trandoshans' prisoners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few days into the hunt, Tano and two other survivors destroyed the guild's freighter. The hunter Smug went to investigate, and Krix eventually flew a hover pod to the downed ship to pick up Smug. However, Smug's request for a pickup was a trap orchestrated by Tano's group, and Krix was soon incapacitated by the recently freed Wookiee captive Chewbacca, who, along with Tano's companions, stole the hover pod.

Accompanied by Garnac; Garnac's son, Dar; the hunter Lo-Taren; and Lagon, the ship's pilot, Krix and the other Trandoshans had captured a slew of prisoners by the time they reached Felucia. These captured beings included the Snivvian Katt Mol, the Terrelian Jango Jumper Lika, the Selkath Morgo, and the Sakiyan Vadoo. Krix and Lagon landed the ship in a Felucian jungle, and Lo-Taren disembarked alone to find potential prey.

The Trandoshans left Felucia for Wasskah shortly after, and, under Garnac's orders, Lagon piloted the ship to Wasskah's Island Four, where the prey was released.

Little did Krix know, the Jedi had used a Force mind trick on Smug, as they wished to steal the hover pod in order to directly attack Garnac's fortress. Krix found Smug waiting, but upon landing, Krix was attacked by Tano and thrown from the pod. The Trandoshan was about to go on the offensive but was confronted by Chewbacca and knocked out with a single punch."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chewbacca and the Jedi took the hover pod to Garnac's fortress and, with the help of Wookiee reinforcements who had also arrived on the moon, killed the remaining guild members, leaving Krix, Smug, and the hunter Ramy as the only Trandoshan survivors.

Krix's stockier frame was part of a deliberate effort to create more physically diverse body types for the Trandoshans compared to the iconic Bossk, who had appeared earlier in the series. According to series head Dave Filoni, Krix's name was chosen because it sounded lizard-like. Krix's conceptual artwork depicted the character with yellow eyes, whereas his final design changed his eyes to orange."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
