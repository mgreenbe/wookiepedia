IntOrg retained a good reputation among the agents of the other bureaus for their commitment to the security of Imperial Intelligence and since they did not abuse their authority or conduct political witch-hunts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Internal Organization Bureau was divided into two branches, the Internal Security Branch and the Internal Counter-intelligence Bureau."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Internal Security Branch (IntSec)"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Internal Security was responsible for the physical security of personnel, material and facilities in Imperial Intelligence. Considered an unambitious job, IntSec agents found themselves subject to jokes by other Imperial personnel. But, as the Galactic Civil War intensified, IntSec received an upgrade in personnel and procedures in response to bolder Rebel attacks. IntSec personnel were the only officers authorized to carry weapons in Intelligence facilities. They also operated plainclothes agents outside facilities to spot and stop potential trouble."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Internal Counterintelligence Branch (IntCon)"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Internal Counterintelligence Bureau, or IntCon, was responsible for rooting out enemy agents or spy rings in Imperial Intelligence itself. Agents of IntCon were granted tremendous freedom to access any data through Sector Plexus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "IntCon resembled a miniature Imperial Intelligence, with its own sections for Analysis, Operations, and Intelligence. The boundaries were often blurred, as IntCon was known for its informal atmosphere and loose structure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Information inside IntCon was heavily secured against unauthorized access by other bureaus, but no restrictions against other agents of IntCon. This was a means for IntCon to monitor itself: every decision, action or piece of data generated by a member of IntCon was available for any other agent to examine. This lack of secrecy, and often privacy, made it nearly impossible for an enemy agent to operate within IntCon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
