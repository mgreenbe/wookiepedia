They lived in hives consisting of hundreds of guards, along with a single, even-larger queen. Kiltik rested during the day, coming out of their nests en masse at night to feed. Entire sections of Cathar were reduced to barren desert by them, and Cathar warriors would periodically engage in ritualistic blood hunts to cleanse their nests. Sylvar once wiped out an entire nest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They may have gone extinct in 3963 BBY, when Cathar was devastated by the Mandalorians in the Battle of Cathar, although this was never proven, and entire hives might have existed underground."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
