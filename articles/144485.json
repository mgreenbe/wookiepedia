The construction crew responsible sent the compilation to the incubent planetary governor Vaxvissh Kal Ness, who, since Leia Organa was one of the few surviving high ranking Alliance members, then sent it to the New Republic. Falling into the hands of Major Heck Ensio, the artifact was again given away to Master Archivist Mordianius, who would sent it to Commander Korr Sella of the Resistance, so that she may give it to General Leia Organa, leader of the Resistance.
