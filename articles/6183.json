Their space stations had ports for their uniquely shaped starships, and the stations were also equipped with a mechanism for dispensing hyperspace capable pods. The pods could be launched great distances across the galaxy, and allowed for precise reconnaissance or sabotage of a target. Padawan Reath Silas believed that this was likely a major factor in the success of the Amaxine warriors. One such space station was located around an unknown star that, by the time of the High Republic, was close to dying, though the station itself was intact. However, its pod system was sabotaged by Reath Silas to prevent the Drengir and the Nihil access to it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Origins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to an old story told by Leia Organa's adoptive mother Breha Organa, the Amaxine warriors were purportedly a warrior people whose entire culture was based in warfare. Instead of currency, they traded weapons for goods and services. According to legend, the Amaxines refused to make peace with the Old Republic. Unable to defeat such a powerful foe, they departed the known galaxy for another one to search for another war to fight. However, at some point in this ancient past, the Amaxine warriors encountered the Drengir. They built a relay point for their hyperspace pods to land on an unknown world occupied by the sentient race and intended to make war on them. However, the Drengir fought back and were able to defeat and then devour them. By the time of the New Republic, the Amaxine warriors were believed to be extinct."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the High Republic Era, an Amaxine station located in a star system centred by a dying star was used by the Byne Guild as a waypoint for its indentured pilots.
