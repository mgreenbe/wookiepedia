Padm\u00e9 stayed there with Anakin Skywalker before the start of the Clone Wars when her life was being threatened by a bounty hunter, who was hired by Nute Gunray to kill her. According to Padm\u00e9, when she was in Level Three, she and her fellow classmates frequently swam to the island during school retreat, where an elderly jeweler crafted beautiful vases and necklaces out of glass. This was where Padm\u00e9 had made plans to raise her child, although she died in childbirth, giving birth to Luke and Leia Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 1 ABY, some spacers visited the location."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the player visits Amidala's private beach, they are awarded with an Explorer badge for the area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
