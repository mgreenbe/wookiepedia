Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo of the Chiss, in his investigations into the Nikardun conquests, traveled aboard a Garwian Unity diplomatic mission to Primea to look into General Yiv's attempts at subjugating the planet. Yiv intended to orchestrate Thrawn's death as the Garwians left Primea, but Thrawn, along with the caregiver Mitth'ali'astov, remained on the planet when the Garwian vessel departed, and the Chiss Ascendancy sent Admiral Ar'alani's Vigilant to collect them, accompanied by Syndic Irizi'stal'mustro, who was wary of Thrawn's inquisition into Nikardun activities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vigilant arrived three days after the Garwian diplomat's departure, and was confronted by several Vak fighters. One of the starfighters had been commandeered by Thrawn, who used modulated laserfire to make contact with the Vigilant, sending a schematic of the Vak fighters in case Ar'alani needed to disable them without harming the occupants. However, before the Chiss could take action, four cruisers of the Lioaoin Regime, being sent in place of Nikardun forces by General Yiv, emerged from hyperspace and opened fire on the Vigilant. Thrawn attacked one of the cruisers in his Vak fighter, and the Lioaoin responded too late, unsure whether to open fire on a Vak ship. The Vigilant brought Thrawn's fighter aboard, jumping to hyperspace. Following the Lioaoin attack on the Vigilant, the Chiss Ascendancy responded with an attack at the Lioaoin heartworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
