Long before the Galactic Civil War, Mataou was ruled by Hutts, including the Gnuda Kajidic. In their heyday, the Hutts of Mataou established vast settlements in the classical architectural Hutt style."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, by the time of the Galactic Empire's reign, the planet had been abandoned by its Hutt masters. It was primarily inhabited by farmers of a serpentine creature known as ro hypa. Additionally, some of the former Hutt-ruled habitations had been restored by criminal groups, who used them as headquarters. The only real value Mataou held for the Empire was to act as a primary entry point for starships leaving the Corellian Trade Spine to enter the Ison Trade Corridor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the assistance of an individual known as the Smuggler, the Trade Spine League reactivated the Hutt's old sensor system to probe weaknesses in the Iron Blockade, successfully encountering a way to bypass the Imperials. Later on, the Empire sought to maintain control over Mataou as a force of insurgents known as the Uprising managed to establish a strong foothold there. This resulted in the Battle of Mataou."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
