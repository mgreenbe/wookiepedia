Each clan was ruled by a much respected clan leader, who in turn was subordinate to a clan lord who maintained stability over multiple augmentative clans. The strongest clan lords were granted the title of spice lords."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clans in the Southern Deserts were largely nomadic, while those of the Northern Frontier lived in the shelters of the mining operations in the mountains. The clans of the Equatorial Belt were typically the most wealthy due to the rich abundance of spice in that area.
