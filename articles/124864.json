They wore military uniforms and had holstered sidearms. About thirty years after the Battle of Endor two shore police, one a male short-horned Devaronian and a human female, arrested the New Republic starfighter pilot Poe Dameron on Mirrin Prime after he took part in an unauthorized skirmish with First Order forces in OR-Kappa-2722. These officers were accompanied by Major Caluan Ematt who brought Dameron and BB-8 to meet General Leia Organa; who arranged for Poe and the rest of Rapier Squadron to join the Resistance, a private military group that fought the First Order independently of the New Republic military."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
