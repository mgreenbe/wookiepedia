Serenno was named after its ruling family, House Serenno. During the Clone Wars, it was aligned with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the leader of which was the Serenno-born Count Dooku."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Serenno was a terrestrial planet located in the D'Astan sector's Serenno system, in the Northern Dependencies of the Outer Rim Territories, in grid square P-5 on the Standard Galactic Grid. The planet sat a prime point along a maze of key hyperspace lanes, close to the planet Toprawa and the Corporate Sector that lay to the northeast, at the very start of the Hydian Way super-hyperroute. To the east sat the vast Gordian Reach and, within it, the Yavin system, while Mandalorian space lay south. A direct route down the Hydian Way to Brentaal IV would mean a short jump across to the planet Coruscant and the galactic seat of power. It was also situated along the Celanon Spur."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Serenno orbited a singular star and was orbited by two moons, including the moon of Mantero. Its surface was covered in lush rainforests and mountain ranges, as well as savannas, which gave way to rivers that spilled into oceans. Serenno silver was a type of metal that shared its name with the world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to the legends of the noble houses of the planet, Serenno was once a planet under the control of the Sith Empire. The eight great houses were mobilized by the Serenno family and, according to their histories, expelled the Sith forces without Jedi assistance. As a result the planet was subsequently renamed after the Serenno Family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 232 BBY during the High Republic Era, the planet was represented in the Galactic Republic by Senator Izzet Noor, who was also the spokesperson for the majority of Outer Rim locations that had been brought under the Republic's control."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 102 BBY,[source?] Serenno was ruled by Count Gora. Shortly after the birth of his second son Dooku Gora realized that the boy was Force-sensitive; due to his hatred of them Gora quickly contacted the Jedi Order and then left the boy alone in the forest outside of his palace to die or be found by the Jedi seekers. Gora subsequently refused to speak of Dooku. As a result of this his other two children; Ramil and Jenza, as well as the wider Serennian public were initially unaware of Dooku's existence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gora's rule was unpopular for many Serennians due to him often laying off workers and replacing them with Droids. This unrest even led to a protest in 82 BBY[source?] at the Funeral of Countess Anya, during which Gora almost ordered his Security Droids to fire on the protestors until Dooku intervened. This intervention unwittingly revealing Dooku's identity as Gora's son to the Serennian public."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After becoming Count, a title he took on after the invasion of Serenno, Dooku founded the Confederacy of Independent Systems, an alliance of solar systems who wanted to secede from the Republic, he moved his headquarters to a cliff-side castle on Serenno. The hostility between the Republic and the Confederacy turned into a pan-galactic conflict known as the Clone Wars, and Serenno became a stronghold of the Confederacy. Protected by a cordon of Confederate warships, the planet was kept insulated from the worst of the Clone Wars battles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, the Sith Master of Dooku, Darth Sidious, contacted Dooku in his palace via hologram and ordered the count to get rid of his pupil, a Dathomirian named Asajj Ventress. As Ventress had grown too powerful, Sidious feared that she would pose a threat to his own plans. However, Ventress survived Dooku's attempt to kill her. After returning to her people on Dathomir, she came back to Serenno with her fellow Nightsisters Karis and Naa'leth to raid Dooku's palace and exact revenge on him. Nevertheless, the Nightsisters were no match for the count, who used the Force and hurled the intruders out of the palace. After the skirmish, Dooku received a transmission from the Nightsister Mother Talzin, who offered to replace Ventress with Savage Opress, a Dathomirian Nightbrother. Upon completion of the deal, Opress was delivered to Dooku on Serenno, and the count started to train him on that planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, Dooku summoned eleven of the galaxy's best bounty hunters, which included Cad Bane and Rako Hardeen, secretly Obi-Wan Kenobi in disguise, to his home planet. He wanted to recruit the best suited candidate to take part in Moralo Eval's plot to abduct the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. In order to do so, Dooku then put the bounty hunters in Eval's Box, a cubical structure hosted on Serenno."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Towards the end of the Clone Wars, Dooku imprisoned the Jedi assassin Master Quinlan Vos at his palace on Serenno. There, the Sith Lord subjected the Jedi to prolonged periods of torture. In order to push him to the dark side, Dooku revealed that his fellow assassin Ventress had murdered Vos' late Master Tholme. Enraged, Vos embraced the dark side and became Dooku's latest apprentice. When Ventress arrived with Boba Fett's syndicate to rescue Vos, he spurned their rescue and sided with Dooku."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the 2018 reference book Star Wars Encyclopedia of Starfighters and Other Vehicles, Serenno was mispelled as \"Serreno\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
