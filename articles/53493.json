The Confederacy of Independent Systems had taken control of the strategically-valuable world, which was vital for its position in the Corellian Run hyperlane. After the Republic breached through the blockade around the planet, Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker led elements of the Thirteenth Army and the 501st into battle against the Confederacy forces in the capital city Chaleydonia, better known as the Crystal City. Although the beginning of the Battle of Christophsis was ridden with failure for the 501st, the clone soldiers of the 501st prepared their offensive against droid forces led by Confederacy General Whorm Loathsom."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the initial stages of the Battle of Christophsis concluded, the Confederacy launched a counterattack on the 501st's forces, whose only remaining hope was a battery of AV-7 Antivehicle Cannons. Although the 501st had lost all of its armor in the early days of the battle, the clone infantry prepared a defense against the overwhelming Confederacy forces. Ged, among his comrades in Torrent Company, was on the front line of this offensive. Although he managed to survive the counterattack before the droids retreated, Ged was injured on the shoulder by jagged shrapnel that had penetrated the gap between his backplate and shoulder armor, and reported back to the forward aid station for treatment."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Counterattack"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after having his arm tended to by clone Sergeant Coric, the Confederacy attacked a second time.

The clone forces took position above the main droid force and rappelled down into the fray, led by Skywalker.

As they were pushed back, Skywalker and his new padawan, Ahsoka Tano, desperately attempted to shut down the energy shield to allow the Republic's cannons to fire upon the droids.

Ged was assigned to the mission along with the men of Torrent Company, disregarding his wounds. His unit sustained heavy casualties as they were forced to scale the sheer walls of the monastery, but Ged was able to survive the ascent.

Ged was one of the forty-two combat-ready soldiers left in the company as the clones prepared to defend the monastery, buying time for the Jedi to escape with the Hutt. Preparing for an overwhelming assault, Ged readied a tripwire in front of the door, while the rest of the unit laid ordinance in the alcoves of the monastery walls and even in their backpacks.
