Two additional laser cannons completed their offensive systems, while the Quadanium solar panels on either side were cut out to resemble those on a TIE/IN interceptor, with a central cutout to provide the pilot with vastly-improved peripheral vision."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A trio of Gand ruetsavii flew these starfighters alongside the ex-members of Rogue Squadron and a squadron of Chir'daki during the Bacta War, specifically to keep an eye on Ooryl Qrygg, who was being observed for his worthiness to undergo janwuine-jika. Throughout the conflict, these craft proved very useful despite their ungainly appearance; they downed their share of TIEs and aided Wedge Antilles' forces on a number of ground-attack missions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
