A few years after the Treaty of Coruscant, Gregor's daughter was revealed to be force-sensitive and was elected by Jedi Master Nomen Karr to serve as his apprentice of the Jedi Order. His daughter was very valuable to the Jedi Order due to her unique ability to recognize the true nature of every person. However, Gregor and his wife hoped that their daughter would be married to the House Organa, so they could be free from being mere servants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Cold War, Sith Lord Darth Baras, whose espionage network was threatened by Jaesa, sent his apprentice to eliminate Jaesa's parents in order to lure Jaesa out of hiding.

In the light side option, he/she would convince the parents to join the Empire and spare them, and letting Volryder leave; that way, if the Sith Warrior would tell Darth Baras of his/her sending the parents to him, the option of torture or letting them bask in Imperial luxury would tip Jaesa off-balance.
