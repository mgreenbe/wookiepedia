Darth Vader and his troops cleaned out the base, and Colonel Veers directed them to his hidden research base, Camp Culroon where they produced the prototype All Terrain Armored Transport unit, Blizzard 1. Vader's strike force then brought Blizzard 1 back to Fondor II for its final outfitting. The AT-AT and other assembled military units then assaulted the Rebel base at Zaloriis City, destroying its ability to make war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Fondor II base shares its name with the planet Fondor, home to the Fondor Shipyards, a primary production facility of Imperial Navy warships.
