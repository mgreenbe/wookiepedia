Designed by the scientist Chancey Yarrow, working for the Nihil Tempest Runner Lourna Dee, the Gravity's Heart was intended to disrupt hyperspace for the pirates' purposes. Situated in the middle of a radiation cloud, the Gravity's Heart was wheel-shaped, constructed out of more than a dozen starships with shipping containers making up the spokes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having developed the idea during her time at the Academy of Carida, Yarrow was recruited to build the weapon by Dee and the Graf family. However, the Gravity's Heart was never meant to be used by its creators; once the weapon's abilities appeared convincing enough to Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro, he agreed to allow Dee to utilize Mari San Tekka, a captive hyperspace prospector who possessed a unique ability to find Paths in hyperspace. With San Tekka, Yarrow was able to design a more successful version of the gravity-well projector. The Gravity's Heart was destroyed by a combined Jedi and Republic Defense Coalition force, but Yarrow escaped to secretly work with the Graf family."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
