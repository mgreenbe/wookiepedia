TC-series droids closely resembled the 3PO-series protocol droids. Most TC series protocol droids were made to serve aboard space stations. They were usually given a silver or red coat of paint. These droids were variants on the 3PO-series protocol droid, with an improved TranLang III communications module. The TC series also somewhat lacked the eccentric behavior the 3PO units were known to develop. Due to his hodgepodge reconstruction, the famous protocol droid C-3PO had more mechanical similarities to the TC-series than to his own model."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
