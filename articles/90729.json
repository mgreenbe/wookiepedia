During the last years of the Old Republic, the corporation held the title to the Mestra system's asteroid field which was their main source of raw material. When the Minos Cluster began to fall into economic depression, during Palpatine's rise to the presidency, MMC sold most of it shares to regional investors. After this the company began to enforce more seedy practices such as employee abuse and tighter security measures. The need for the tighter security established the new division in the corporation, a division that provided police, emergency services, and armed forces to the Mestra system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
