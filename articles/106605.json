Police probes would monitor the streets of Galactic City to detect crime and identify suspects and would then request assistance from nearby GU-series Guardian police droids and police officers. A police probe was present after Davu Golec of the Republic Ministry of Intelligence was killed by an assassin. Seeing Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore at the scene holding a blaster, the probe identified her as a suspect in the killing. After informing other security forces of the situation, the probe initiated a police chase, though the Duchess eventually escaped the area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Police probes were painted in a blue-gray paint scheme to identify them as part of the Coruscant Security Force. They had an overall ellipsoid body of two bowl-shaped halves joined together with a recessed trench in the middle. On top were lights housed in truncated, conical projections, one of which was blue and the other red. On the front were two red photoreceptors that projected from conical housings and connected to sensors as did a camera. The droids had a siren, an antenna, were able to make transmissions, and were also able to speak basic in a masculine voice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the planet Coruscant during a secret meeting between Davu Golec of the Republic Ministry of Intelligence and Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore, an assassin of the Mandalorian terrorist group Death Watch killed Golec with a blaster.

The Duchess fled the scene, and the probe, after informing nearby security forces of the situation, followed after her with GU-series Guardian police droids and Coruscant Guard shock troopers joining the chase.
