A student at the Temple's academy, Rana went on to graduate and was selected as a Padawan apprentice by a Jedi Master. After years of one-on-one travel and study, Rana was ready to face the Trials of Knighthood; which she passed, ascending to the rank of Jedi Knight. As a Knight, Rana pursued the path of the Jedi Guardian as part of her independent study focus. Specializing as a ace pilot, Rana joined the Starfighter Corps and became a noted member amongst its ranks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 41 BBY, Rana was still flying out of the Coruscant Temple on missions for the Jedi High Council. At one point, Rana carried fellow Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi as passengers, leaving them on the isolated world of Ragoon VI where they hoped to deal with the growing distance they felt between one another out in the wilderness. Two decades later, Rana was still an active member of the Starfighter Corps, piloting one of the Order's new Delta-7 Aethersprite interceptors. Stationed at the Temple during the Separatist Crisis, Rana answered Master of the Order Mace Windu's rallying cry and followed him to the planet Geonosis as part of a massive rescue team to save Jedi Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala from execution by the Separatist Council of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. While many of her comrades stormed the Petranaki arena on the ground, Rana joined the battle in orbit under the leadership of Jedi Councilor Adi Gallia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
