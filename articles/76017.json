She organized several stormtroopers, under the command of Lieutenant Oln Pressig, one of Imperial Remnant Head of State Jagged Fel's Security Chiefs, to attack Fel in his quarters of the Galactic Empire Embassy Complex on Coruscant. Fel managed to defend himself against the attacking stormtroopers and fired several times into the ceiling, setting off an alarm and accidentally shooting his deputy minister of trade in the foot. The attempt having failed, Moff Drikl Lecersen managed to trace it back to Treen. Treen then formed an alliance with Lecerson in a conspiracy to unite the Imperial Remnant with the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances before ousting Chief of State Natasi Daala and taking her place."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This kidnapping attempt first appeared in Aaron Allston's Fate of the Jedi: Backlash, the fourth novel of the Fate of the Jedi series.
