Led by the Five Masters, and seemingly made up of children, all members dressed in flowing, colored cloak and moved about with the help of glow poles. Choosing to erect a base on Cularin, the Five Masters negotiated for the property and construction of the Academy with Barnab Chistor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The history of the organization was clouded in mystery, though the real story was rather embarrassing for members.

While Meelo managed to rescue her friend, the Jawa Keth-Keth attempted to cover their escape by screaming \"Free Kashyyyk\". Although a ruse, the Wookiee Liberation Front received a lot of press in the local holonewscasts, and eventually became a legitimate organization that funneled credits and supplies to help the Wookiees of Kashyyyk in their attempt to oust the Separatist forces that were trying to take control of their homeworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
