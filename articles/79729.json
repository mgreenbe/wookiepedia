These Lancer Battalions were used occasionally against the Separatist's IG lancer combat droids and unwieldy columns of battle droids. They were particularly remembered for their part in the Battle of Muunilinst, which took place four months into the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using Aratech 105-K lancer bikes, these specialized speeder-mounted clone troopers engaged their enemy in physical combat, spearing the lancer droids with their Verpine power-lances. The Lancer Battalions were usually deployed in order to distract the enemy from advancing turbolaser batteries, which were used to batter down fortified targets. Presumably they were organized as standard battalions of 576 clone troopers and officers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
