This ship was used as the headquarters for a band of pirates under name Blood Nest until their defeat in 7 ABY by Wraith Squadron. It was then used by the New Republic in the Battle of Ession to deliver three starfighter squadrons and the Page's commandos. The commandos activated its self-destruct and left the ship in an escape pod, while Rogue, Blue, and Green Squadrons were released from the ship's hangar when the self-destruct charges broke apart its hull."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
