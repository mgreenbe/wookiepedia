A device within the hilt vibrated these small blades at a tremendous rate, allowing them to become far more deadly and efficient. The vibration of such weapons was so fast that even a slight touch could produce a large gash, while a slash could sever a limb. A non-vibration blade of comparable size was nowhere near as deadly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Typical vibro-shiv weapons included knives and daggers, the most common; vibroknucklers, which were basically like knuckledusters except with a blade; and vibro-scalpels and -lancets, which were more commonly used on operating tables."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
