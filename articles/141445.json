Much like the one that was part of the capital of the Galactic Republic, Coruscant, it extended to nearly every city on Telos. In the aftermath of the Bombing of Telos IV that was carried out by the traitorous Admiral Saul Karath in the opening stages of the Jedi Civil War, the irrigation system was abandoned, leaving its hub, nestled into the snow-covered mountains at the northern latitudes of the planet, empty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time after the Conclave on Katarr, the Jedi Master Atris rediscovered the irrigation system. After moving a large collection of Sith holocrons that she had gathered over the years as well as many Jedi artifacts that had been removed from the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine prior to its destruction, Atris used the abandoned facility in an attempt to rebuild the Jedi Order. As part of her plans, she brought the Handmaiden Sisters, including Brianna, to Telos, intending to use them as \"watchers\" for the Order that she planned to rebuild. Due to the irrigation system's secluded location and the echoes within the Force that had been generated by the scourging of Telos, this proved an ideal hiding place from the Sith assassins led by Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3951 BBY the Jedi Exile visited the irrigation system's hub, now the Telosian Jedi Academy, to finally collect her famed starship, the Ebon Hawk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
