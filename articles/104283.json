This focused beam was produced by a double-nested set of precision galven coils; essentially double focused, the resulting beam was narrower than a normal bolt, but rivaled that of a heavy blaster pistol or even a blaster rifle in terms of penetrating power. This double-series focusing came at a cost, however; the accuracy and narrowness of the bolt made it more difficult to aim, requiring practice at precision targeting to consistently hit ones target. As a result of the over focusing, the MB-450 had a negligible stun setting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Made to order by Luxan Personal Armaments, Ltd., each Penetrator was hand-crafted and often customized to the whims of a buyer for additional cost, though they were rarely personalized.
