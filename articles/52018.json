Students attending the Jedi academy on Coruscant were expected to study from this book prior to training in flight simulators."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The manual was extremely heavy and technical, several times the size of a normal textbook studied by students at the academy. When Roan Novachez studied there, the manual assigned to him and his fellow classmates was the 9th edition. He quickly became bored with the manual and felt that it wasn't worth his time, as it couldn't give the feeling of actually flying. He soon learned, however, that the information in the manual was actually important."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
