Its core was home to large reserves of Malastarian fuel, a toxic fuel found only on Malastare. It was the homeworld of the Dug species, though it was represented in the Galactic Senate by the Gran species, who had colonised Malastare. Ainlee Teem, the senator of Malastare, was nominated in the election for Supreme Chancellor during the Invasion of Naboo. During the Clone Wars, Malastare was the location of a battle between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems over the planet's fuel reserves. The battle awoke a creature known as the Zillo Beast, which the Republic successfully neutralized, leading the Dug Council to sign a treaty with the Republic allowing them access to their fuel reserves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Malastare was located within the system of the same name, which occupied the Dustig sector of the Mid Rim.

The creatures were driven to near extinction when it was discovered by the Dugs that Malastarian fuel was toxic to them. However, it was prophesied that one would eventually return, and bring an end to Dug civilization. In order to prepare their descendants, a manuscript detailing the Zillo Beasts was passed down through future generations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the High Republic Era, Malastare had formed a joint task force with the world of Sullust, keeping order in their small sector of the Mid Rim against pirates and other similar threats.

Supreme Chancellor Palpatine authorized the use of an experimental electro-proton bomb, despite the concerns of Doge Nakha Urus, the leader of the Dug Council. The device succeeded in deactivating the Droid Army, while leaving the Republic's clone troopers unharmed.

However, they found that the bomb had awoken the last surviving Zillo Beast, and barely escaped with their lives. Doge Urus demanded Republic assistance in eliminating the creature, threatening to cancel the treaty if they didn't. Windu declined due to the fact it was innocent and the last of its kind. The Supreme Chancellor and Doctor Sionver Boll expressed interest in examining the lightsaber-resistant plates of the Zillo Beast, believing that they could be used to improve armor for the clone army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Discovering unprotected gaps between its plates, the Republic utilized RX-200 Falchion-class assault tanks to sedate the creature, leading the Dugs to believe it to be dead.

It notably housed an important communications station. Malastare was intended to be a target of the Rebel Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry during Operation Ringbreaker, but the attack never happened as the operation was called off following the siege of Inyusu Tor. Although it was successfully targeted by Blade Squadron shortly after the Battle of Endor, the Imperial presence would remain even after the destruction of the Imperial Future Council on Akiva, and Grand General Kenner Loring would choose to entrench himself on the planet, in opposition to Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax's de facto control of the fragmented Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Government"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The internal affairs of Malastare were controlled by the Dug Council, who ruled from the Imperial palace.
