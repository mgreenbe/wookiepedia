Its primary form of new content are Cartel Packs, which are lootcrate-style packs of cosmetic items pulled from the Pack's available items; these include new weapons, mounts, companion customizations, emotes, gear based on other Legends characters, and decorations for their Strongholds. Cartel Packs are grouped together in Shipments, of which there have been 10 so far to date, and are largely released around the time of the game's major updates. Prior to Shipment 8, each shipment consisted of 5 Cartel Packs, with the first two being released simultaneously."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two additional sets of packs, the Nightlife and Dark vs Light packs, have also been released, and the game runs a weekly sale on rotating items.
