As such, it had a decidedly different tactical role, namely that of a warship instead of an Interdictor. More compact and more heavily armed, it served as a line frigate. The CC-9600 had enough cargo and passenger space to transport one full regiment of troops. It also was very fast for its size, both in sublight speeds and in hyperspace, making for a formidable warship in its class. Streamlined for atmospheric operation, it had retractable maneuvering fins that improved stabilization while landing and deploying troops."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
