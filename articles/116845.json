The operation was retroactively sanctioned by the New Republic, and the Rogues went on to fight for their government in such conflicts as the reborn Emperor Palpatine's assault on Calamari, the Orinda campaign, and a battle at Yaga Minor that brought the long Galactic Civil War to an end.

The Rogues were the symbol of the New Republic's starfighter superiority and its most effective tool against enemy aggression; their successes gave them an almost mythical presence in battle and could sometimes prompt an enemy to surrender without any shots being fired. As long as Rogue Squadron endured, the citizens of the New Republic had hope that there was someone in space protecting them.

When the crashed ship was found half-submerged in a lake, Rogue Flight fought off TIE bombers, as well as XR-85 tank droids, an AT-ST, and AT-PT walkers that were disgorged from an Imperial Sentinel-class landing craft. A Rebel shuttle was able to rescue the Nonnah's crew, and the Rogues defended it from one more interceptor squadron before leaving the planet.

Further resistance came from Imperial amphibions, AT-STs, and one AT-AT, but Skywalker tripped the latter with his speeder's harpoon and tow cable while Rebel defense batteries helped hold off the rest. When Rebel shuttles rescued both Rieekan and Madine, the Alliance forces departed Corellia.

On that mission, they disabled the TIE interceptor of Lieutenant Kasan Moor, commander of the 128th TIE Interceptor Squadron. Moor took the opportunity to defect to the Alliance, and her inside knowledge proved vital as she flew with the Rogues in the Battle of the Jade Moon, a raid on Balmorra, and an assault on Kile II.

There, its pilot learned of a droid army led by the criminal Olag Greck that had commandeered the Imperial Star Destroyer Decimator.
