Utilizing the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Knight Hammer as her flagship, and using various capital ships, vehicles, and starfighters, Daala carried on guerrilla warfare against the New Republic. Daala lost a majority of the fleet at the climactic Assault on Yavin 4, where she planned on wiping out Jedi Master Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order. Daala's failure made her leave Imperial service. Admiral Gilad Pellaeon would eventually take command of the United Warlord Fleets and would regroup with scattered Imperial factions within the Mid Rim to reestablish the Imperial Military under the Imperial Remnant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Endor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, the Galactic Empire lost the Battle of Endor.

Palpatine unleashed new powerful weapons, from the World Devastators, Eclipse-class dreadnoughts, Sovereign-class Star Destroyers, and the Galaxy Gun. Palpatine was defeated above Onderon, and the Eclipse II set course and rammed the Galaxy Gun stationed above Byss.

They were shot down by the defense force stationed at Kessel. It was later revealed that Kessel was overrun by slaves, pirates, and smugglers. They had come together to serve Moruth Doole, Administrator of the planet's spice mines. Solo and Chewie escaped, with help from young Kyp Durron. They fled the planet, and into the Maw. Unknown to them, the Maw housed a top-secret Imperial research facility. Solo was captured by Admiral Natasi Daala, commander of the forces and the base. Daala was Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and when Daala found out of his death at Yavin 4, she decided to avenge Tarkin and the fallen Empire. Her campaign was short lived, with the Sun Crusher being stolen by Kyp Durron, and later, Daala lost more and more of her fleet.

Daala eventually met and talked with Admiral Blitzer Harrsk, a major warlord. Little did both know, Admiral Treuten Teradoc, a rival warlord, would attack Harrsk's fortress by using Crimson Command, led by Vice Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, the fleet comprising hundreds of Victory-class Star Destroyers. Harrsk, greatly angered by the attack and the loss of his flagship Shockwave, retaliated by attacking Teradoc back. He forced Daala to take command of the Firestorm, and if she didn't, he would have his troops execute her for treason. Daala complied, with not much say in the matter. They arrived, finding Teradoc's fortress based within an asteroid field. They briefly encountered space mines planted by Teradoc, but resumed the attack. Teradoc watched the battle from his command bunker, and the fight ended when Daala disabled the Whirlwind, Harrsk's ship. She threatened them by blowing up the Firestorm if they didn't listen. The fight ended, and Daala called out thirteen of the most powerful warlords at Tsoss Beacon, an Imperial listening post. They met there to discuss the future of the Empire, and Daala planned on reuniting the various factions. Little did this help, as the Imperial warlords fought for hours, as they all held rivalry with each other. Daala, having heard enough, and realizing they wouldn't agree on anything, prepared her second plan by releasing a nerve gas which filled the room, and wore a gas mask alongside Pellaeon. The two watched as the warlords died, and Daala resumed command of their remaining forces for a final fight against the New Republic. The deaths of all thirteen Imperial warlords ended the Imperial Civil War."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Beginning conquest"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Daala first headed to Kampe, which Admiral Sander Delvardus used as his base of operations. Daala presented Delvardus's corpse on a frame to his second in command, Colonel Ivan Cronus. Daala gave Cronus a choice, join or die. Cronus decided to join Daala's new faction, and presented her a gift, the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Night Hammer, which Delvardus planned on using. Daala took the Night Hammer as her personal flagship, renaming it Knight Hammer. Daala gave a large bulk of Crimson Command to Cronus, and Cronus attacked Khomm. He later struck at Chardaan Shipyards, and later at Porus Vida, scoring major victories."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Major failure"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within these major victories, Daala and Pellaeon both agreed that it was time to wipe out Jedi Master Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order. As such, seventeen Imperial-class Star Destroyers were dispatched to Yavin 4, led by Pellaeon. Pellaeon and his fleet arrived above the planet and launched a large ground force to attack the Jedi. The Jedi were overrun and retreated to the temple, where they all used their Force powers and wiped out Pellaeon's fleet in orbit. With Pellaeon taken care of, Daala would arrive with her fleet alongside Cronus's fleet. But New Republic reinforcements under the command of Admiral Ackbar came into the system and attacked Daala.
