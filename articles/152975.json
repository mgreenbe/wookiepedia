Alongside Padawan Bastila Shan, they discovered the location of the Star Forge, an ancient Rakatan factory and space station and the secret of the Sith's overwhelming infrastructure. Bastila had been captured by Malak and seduced by the dark side during their mission. Upon arriving in the system where the Star Forge was located, Revan contacted the Republic, but a disruptor field based on the planet of Lehon incapacitated their ship, the Ebon Hawk. The crew of the Hawk destroyed the shield and confronted Shan, who fled to the station from the surface."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Battle of Rakata Prime"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the disruptor field now destroyed, a massive Republic assault fleet, under the command of Admiral Forn Dodonna and Jedi Master Vandar Tokare, jumped into the system. The fallen Bastila Shan, on the station, began using her renowned battle meditation against the Republic fleet. Now losing the battle and unable to attack, Tokare ordered several Jedi, including the Revan and the Human female, to board the station and defeat Bastila. Upon boarding, most of the Jedi went forward into the station. The human female and three other Jedi stayed behind in the hangar, waiting to assist Revan and the Ebon Hawk's crew with the infiltration. Although they had hoped for the element of surprise, shortly after Revan's arrival a group of Sith ambushed the Jedi. Although the Jedi told Revan to go ahead, the trap had already sprung, and Revan was forced into the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After defeating the Sith, Revan and his companions ran into the Star Forge to find Shan, while the four Jedi waited at the hangar to defend the ship against any further assaults.
