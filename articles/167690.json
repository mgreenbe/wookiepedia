In 3 ABY, the separatists secretly allied themselves with the Alliance and captured most of the Imperial forces on Zaloriis. The planet was later visited by the second-in-command of the Empire, Darth Vader, who was searching for the Alliance and had come to Zaloriis to meet with Transe Decar, one of Zaloriis's Ministers and a separatist leader. With several soldiers, Decar ambushed Vader and announced Zaloriis's rebellion, but was killed by him. Vader then questioned one of the soldiers where the Imperial forces were, and then killed all of them. The Empire then freed their captured stormtroopers and destroyed the Separatist headquarters at the planet's capital, Zaloriis City, ending their rebellion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zaloriis Separatists were first mentioned in the strategy guide for the 2001 PC video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, and later appeared in the game and its 2002 expansion.
