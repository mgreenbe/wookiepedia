With help from debris, their entry had the appearance of falling meteors, allowing them to enter undetected. While Record Time was destroyed, tricking the Yuuzhan Vong into thinking the threat was eliminated, the pilots Lando Calrissian and YVH 1-1A escaped via a two-seat B-wing/E starfighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Members of the infiltration team wore Vonduun crab armor, with some members wearing a synthetic version, and Ooglith masquers for disguise. Shortly after landing on Coruscant, the team encountered a Yuuzhan Vong patrol consisting of seven warriors. The disguises succeeded in their purpose, although the deception ended when Luke drew his lightsaber as a fight broke out between the two groups. After at least twenty more Yuuzhan Vong came out from hearing the shouts, the walkway was blown up by Kell Tainer via a bomb while infiltration team retreated. Only three Vong survived, which were dispatched by the team."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after, the team encountered a group of survivors.

Among the carnage were machines and a suspended animation unit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After cleaning up the complex, the infiltration team made it their current residence, with it also showing promise for a resistance cell location.

Amplified by the Nexus, the Jedi used the Force to hurl debris at the Coralskippers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After catching up to Irek, Luke and Mara distracted him while Tahiri surprised him from behind.
