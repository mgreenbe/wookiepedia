Recognizing how dangerous the Thigs were, Jodo suggested that they split up and try to corral the brothers into a dimly lit bistro known as the Red Shadow. The plan worked, and they succeeded in hemming the sibling smugglers into a crossfire. As luck would have it though, a Hutt named Mageye had been passing through the district and inadvertently disrupted the fire-fight. During the schism, Mageye fell from his palanquin and rolled on top of Zardra. She was forced to destroy Mageye by shoving a gauge six thermal detonator into his mouth. In the midst of battle, the Thig Brothers managed to get away."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
