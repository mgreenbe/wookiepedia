Torva began training in the ways of the Force in hopes of becoming a Jedi Knight, wielding a lightsaber pike with a blue crystal at its core. Alongside Gerant, Torva traveled to a planet with a Force nexus within a mountain peak. Entering the cave alone, Torva used her lightsaber for light, defending herself against feral men that leaped to attack her. Finding an amphitheater at the heart of the mountain, Torva recognized her sister standing alongside a man, a woman, and a child chained to posts at the center of the room. Vowing to save her sister, Torva engaged Morana in a brief duel, knocking aside Morana's vibrosword with her lightsaber. When Morana disengaged and attempted to execute the captives, Torva speared her sister through with her lightsaber pike. As the apparition of Morana faded away to nothing, Torva exited the cave, having successfully moved closer to becoming a Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
