This brought down the protective shield over the Death Star II, allowing Alliance snubfighters to penetrate its interior and destroy its power generator. The 7-PrG had a twist plunger that was used to set a timer that could delay the explosion for twenty minutes. The 7-PrG also had an activation plunger that started the countdown. These two mechanisms conjunctively assured there were no unintended detonations. The power of a 7-PrG was comparable to that of a thermal detonator; however, its blast was focused mainly in a single direction, toward the magnetic plate at the bottom. It also released EMP pulses, disabling droids and any other electronic devices within a twenty-meter radius."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of its power and complexity, the 7-PrG Proton Grenade was very rarely found out of military hands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The weapon was used by the Rebel Alliance to destroy the Endor shield generator bunker in 4 ABY during the climactic Battle of Endor.
