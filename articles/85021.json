Its heads-up display identified limited data including range and zoom. Some models were fitted with optics equipped with a recording system, allowing users to select pictures to be saved, though macrobinoculars lacked the processors built into electrobinoculars to rework and improve the picture. The MB450 macrobinoculars could also be used at night. Unlike other magnifying devices like monoculars and telescopes, macrobinoulars produced three-dimensional images."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Macrobinoculars were common among farmers, hunters, and less advanced militaries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gungans used Farseein binoculars with a handgrip, oil magnifier lenses, and dials to adjust focus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke Skywalker owned a pair of macrobinoculars on Tatooine, and used them to scan the perimeter of the Lars homestead for dangers.
