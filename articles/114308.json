The symbol of the Republic was a common sight in society, used for both civilian and military purposes. With the outbreak of the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the crest came to be featured more prominently than before, appearing on brand new war machines, flags, and banners. Eventually, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine turned the Republic into the First Galactic Empire, and the Republic crest was modified into the Imperial crest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The symbol dated back to the Bendu monks study of numerology, in which the number nine\u2014symbolized by eight spokes joined to one disk\u2014signified the benevolent presence of the Force in a united galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
