They were hunted by the Gungan company Binks & Son Whaling Company for hundreds of years before Jar Jar Binks was born. On a whaling trip when Jar Jar was hunting with his father, George R. Binks, they came across a whale and harpooned it before Jar Jar's poor steering caused their ship to crash into it. It is unknown if George continued the company after this, but Jar Jar would never hunt again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
