The extragalactic alien Anor outlined his species' plans for the galaxy, and specifically for Birgis; they would terraform the planet and take its population as slaves. Promised safety for the Mandalore sector if he complied, Fett planned to use the upcoming assault as cover for ferrying intelligence on the Yuuzhan Vong to the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One week after the opening battle of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Birgis was serving as a fallback point for displaced New Republic fleet elements that had escaped the Yuuzhan Vong advance and regrouped onsite.

Though Fett and his troops carried out the attack as ordered, they were able to recruit a pilot to get pertinent information and Yuuzhan Vong materials gathered by the Mandalorians to New Republic High Command.
