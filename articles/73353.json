In 2 BBY, the ranges were controlled by Dixon Dadeferron and his family. Dixon and his two sons, Trevim and Torm, were independent landowners under the Corporate Sector Authority. After some sort of dispute over land-use rights and stock prices, Dixon and his eldest son, Trevim, spoke out against the Authority and failed to yield to its pressure. Shortly after, they were abducted and taken to the Authority prison facility at Stars' End, leaving the younger son, Torm, in complete control of the ranges."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
