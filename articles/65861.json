They were designed as a stealthy means of deploying two squads of troopers, mainly Imperial special forces such as Storm commandos, while unwary observers would mistake them for meteors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two variants were made of the drop pod. The first was an empty decoy pod usually launched in great numbers as a means of confusing observers. The second was a supply pod, which sacrificed its troop compartment for the ability to carry a metric ton of supplies. These were also fit with a self-destruct charge designed to go off if tampered with by unauthorized personnel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
