In 1998, he designed the Wraith Squadron unit patch, which was introduced into continuity by Aaron Allston in his third novel, X-Wing: Solo Command. The original design was to include lettering that read \"Wraith Squadron\" and \"New Republic Special Forces\", with additional red stars in the outer blue ring. Allston removed those elements because they were too complex and the words were not written in the in-universe font of Aurebesh."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars bibliography"}]}
