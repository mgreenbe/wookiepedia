One example of these living servants of the Yuuzhan Vong empire were the divination biots used by the Priest caste and their seers who used these creatures as a means of determining the future under the dictates of their religion."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Qreph Brother Biots"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Qreph brothers, Marvid and Craitheus, at some point learned the technique to manufacture their own biots. Unlike the Yuuzhan Vong's biots, the brothers' biots had biological flesh and organs grown around inorganic vanalloy skeletons. They manufactured at least three generations of biots from their hidden base on the surface of a mysterious monolith in the Chiloon Rift. From this base they were experimenting in the creation of Force-sensitive biots by attempting to make copies of Ohali Soroc and Leia Organa Solo. However, these biots were mostly unsuccessful and it was theorized that their unnatural creation contributed to their inability to successfully tap into the Force without severe mental handicaps or physical deformities. The Nargons were also a product of the Qreph's biot research, as was Lando Calrissian's operations chief of Sarnus Refinery, Dena Yus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The term \"biot\" was originally coined by Arthur C. Clarke in his 1972 novel Rendezvous with Rama, as a portmanteau meaning \"biological robot.\" The biots reappeared in the sequels two decades later, Rama II, The Garden of Rama, and Rama Revealed, as well as the Rama computer game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
