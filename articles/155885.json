Thus, when Boba Fett entered the premises and murdered a patron, the bartender yelled at Fett to leave the place. Fett paid a considerable sum of money as compensation and announced to the crowd that he was looking for another target and was willing to pay handsomely for any information that could lead him to her. What he did not know was that she was actually in that very cantina, hiding in the shadows. When he had left, she sneaked out into the streets, but was followed by a group of spacers who ended up helping her complete the mission she was on."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While as of yet unnamed, this cantina is significant to the plot of Rebel Escape, as it is the location in which the entire scenario begins."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
