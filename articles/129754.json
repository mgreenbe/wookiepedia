A number of Voss Mystics had the ability to enter the world, and a datacron left on the planet Voss by the Infinite Empire allowed those who used it to also access the Spirit World. Typically, as used by the Voss Mystics, it could be entered when meditating in front of a dedicated meditation tablet. One such tablet was located in the Lake of the Unseen in the Nightmare Lands on Voss, and many more were placed by the Mystics throughout their Shrine of Healing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
