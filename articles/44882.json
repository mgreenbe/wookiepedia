Epsilon 5 participated in an attack on the Ottegan-populated world of Arthon, where the starfighter was one of two that escorted Kylo Ren's command shuttle. During the battle, a missile from an Ottegan siege engine that was directed at Ren's shuttle struck Epsilon 5 after the command shuttle evaded the shot. The Epsilon 5 trooper called out through a comm channel from his TIE fighter as it crashed, annoying Kylo Ren as it marked the eighth recorded First Order casualty of the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
