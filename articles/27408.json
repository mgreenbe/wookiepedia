The container was used to store cargo during transit in both realspace and hyperspace. The Class-J container was the largest available container in the Xizor cargo container line and was designed to store assembled items. The immense size of the container prohibited many smaller freighters from carrying the container; instead, larger freighters were required to transport them. Additionally, both cargo freighters and cargo tankers could include them in their linked payloads."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The size of the Class-J container also provided ample space to function as a space station, and a laser cannon could be mounted on the exterior."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
