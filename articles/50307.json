It was powered by a core made of recainium, a dangerous and illegal substance. A prototype of the device was created by Klerin Chekkat during the High Republic Era, though her mother, Mantessa, took the credit for it. The elder Chekkat took the prototype to the Republic Fair on the planet Valo, hoping to sell the device to Galactic Republic senator Tia Toon, who had been pushing for the Jedi Order to not be the sole protectors of the Republic. Chekkat believed that Toon would want the device for its abilities to disarm Jedi; however, Toon's position did not mean he opposed the Jedi, and the senator turned down the offer. The device's recainium core also spread radiation into the surrounding area, and Toon had Chekkat disable the device. When the Nihil marauders attacked the fair, Klerin Chekkat claimed to the Republic that the raiders had taken the plans for the device, subsequently attempting to sell the Nihil a smaller, tolium-powered version."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
