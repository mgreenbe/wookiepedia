These devices often served as backups in case of navigation computer failure, and could be used in both hyperspace and realspace. Powerful twin bonds, like those of Jaina and Jacen Solo, could sent ionic discharges that reoriented core-relative compasses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
