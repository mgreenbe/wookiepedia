Sometime following the Battle of Yavin, she operated out of the Meatlump Hideout in Coronet City. Around 1 ABY, Balia Alloo noticed that many of her fellow Meatlumps had suddenly become angry. She offered the job of cheering up her comrades to a spacer who infiltrated the hideout. The spacer accepted the task of motivating the Meatlumps, many of which desired physical contact or recognition for their accomplishments. To that end, the spacer searched the hideout for at least a dozen angry Meatlumps, offering hugs, smiles, applause, and other signs of encouragement."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Balia Alloo appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
