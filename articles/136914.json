In the novel, Anakin Skywalker's fear of death and fear of losing his wife, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, is personified as a version of this dragon which whispers to him continuously that \"all things die,\" precipitated when Skywalker witnessed the death of a star with Obi-Wan Kenobi. The whispering is hastened by Skywalker's visions of Amidala's death, leading him to create the persona of the Sith Lord Vader to quash the dragon, but as the voice whispers to him again, he fears the dragon has left a venomous fang behind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
