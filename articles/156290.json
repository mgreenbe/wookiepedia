After Ramil orchestrated the takeover of Serenno by Abyssin mercenaries, numerous Serennians fought back, assisted by the Jedi Master Dooku, brother of Ramil. The Count sent the security droids to end the supposed insurrection. Dooku surrendered to the droid commander so that he would be brought aboard the airship Windrunner to face Ramil, who intended to have the droid commander execute their sister, Lady Jenza, with Dooku's lightsaber. Aboard the Windrunner, Dooku used animal kinship to control the ancient Tirra'Taka, attacking the droid army. In the chaos, Jenza knocked the droid commander back, while the Serennian refugees used Abyssin weapons to shoot the droids down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
