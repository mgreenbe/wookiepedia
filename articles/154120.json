He resided in their base on Florrum. This Nikto was present in 22 BBY when the gang captured Count Dooku, attracting the attention of the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. The Nikto drank from a cup till he toppled from his chair, nearly knocking over Piit, a Weequay pirate. He was one of the few members of the gang who was not a Weequay; other known pirates who were not Weequay are an Ishi Tib and several other Nikto, as well as Bith and Jawas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
