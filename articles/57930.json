As a result of the planet Mustafar's turbulent atmosphere of frequent electromagnetic interference and storms, the Techno Union Klegger Corp Mining Facility's air-traffic control antenna incorporated a high-intensity guide beam to help incoming ships. The mining complex's reliance on guidance and tractor beams was coupled with specialized, energy-shielded landing platforms to ensure a safe landing on Mustafar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
