Desh was a close friend of the Jedi Master Quinlan Vos and the two Jedi worked together on multiple missions. Shortly after the Separatist attack on Mahranee, Desh received instructions from the Jedi High Council to fetch Vos back to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant for a new assignment. Desh tracked Vos down to Otor's Hub where the undercover Jedi Master was infiltrating the Koorivar merchant Sheb Valaad's black market operation, which specialized in selling merchandise that had been taken from murdered individuals. Desh stumbled on Vos, who was disguised as the Kiffar \"Tal Khar\", in the middle of a meeting with Shed. Desh's arrival inadvertently exposed Vos' cover, who was forced to end his undercover mission early. Joining forces, the two Jedi used their Force powers and lightsaber skills to knock out Sheb and his henchmen, who were promptly arrested by other Jedi reinforcements."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While traveling back to the Jedi Temple, Desh briefed his friend Vos about the Separatist genocide against the Mahran species. Later, the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi briefed Vos about the Jedi Council's secret plan to assassinate Count Dooku in order to bring a speedy end to the Clone Wars. Following Vos' briefing at the Jedi Council chambers, Desh met up with Vos within the Temple's dining hall. He listened as Vos outlined his new assignment and expressed his unease about working with Asajj Ventress, a Nightsister and Dooku's former Sith apprentice. Their conversation was interrupted by Kenobi who told Desh to excuse them while he discussed the mission with Master Vos. Desh complied with Master Kenobi's wishes and moved to a different table."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Desh's absence, Vos managed to make contact with Ventress who agreed to assist with his mission but insisted that Vos had to be instructed in the ways of the dark side. Despite their preparations, Vos and Ventress were no match for Dooku's mastery of the dark side. Dooku captured Vos but Ventress was able to flee. After a prolonged period of torture and deprivation, Dooku managed to drive Vos to embrace the dark side fully by revealing Ventress' complicity in his late Master Tholme's murder. As a result, Vos became Dooku's newest Sith apprentice and spurned a rescue attempt by Ventress, who subsequently informed the Jedi that Vos had joined Dooku. As Dooku's apprentice, Vos adopted the persona \"Admiral Enigma\" and helped the Separatists score several victories.

The Mahran managed to find the Nightsister in Coruscant's Level 1313 and informed her that Kenobi had invited her to the Jedi Temple to discuss Vos' rescue mission. When Ventress expressed her suspicions that Desh was leading her into a trap, Desh pleaded with her to trust him. Together with Ventress, Kenobi, and the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Desh entered the Council chambers.

After the Jedi Council received a hologram from Admiral Wullf Yularen about Dooku and Admiral Enigma's latest movements, Kenobi ushered Desh, Skywalker, and Ventress back into the chambers. Desh was present when the Jedi offered to pardon Ventress for her crimes if she agreed to help them rescue Vos. This rescue mission was a success and Vos was reunited with his Jedi comrades.

While Vos had managed to prove his loyalty to the Jedi Council by performing several small assignments, Desh was concerned that his close friend had been avoiding him. Desh raised his concerns about Vos with Master Kenobi before they were about to embark on a mission to raid a Separatist supply storage base. Vos had been assigned to the mission after the Council had deemed him safe. Kenobi suggested that Vos was avoiding his close friends because he had realized the damage that attachment could cause due to his recent partnership with Ventress."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Desh and Anakin Skywalker waited outside while Kenobi, Vos, and the other Jedi Council members discussed the mission. For the mission, Desh and his fellow Jedi Vos, Kenobi, and Skywalker flew Eta-2 Actis-class interceptors to scout the asteroid base. After shooting down several Vulture droids, Desh and his Jedi colleagues landed in the asteroid base and found it well-stocked with ample supplies of food, medicine, weapons, and ship-repair materials.

Two days later, Master Yoda ascertained that Vos had indeed fallen to the dark side during a private conversation with the Jedi Master but was unsure whether he had joined Dooku.

Bereft of his lightsaber, Desh resolved to sacrifice his own life to kill Vos. Desh released the stinger in his right wrist and attempted to stab Vos with it. However, Vos anticipated his attack and used the Force to hurl Desh against Bayon; killing the other Knight. Since Desh had released his stinger, the Mahran's body was deluged with his own venom.

Following the Second battle of Christophsis, Vos returned to the light side with the help of Ventress, who died protecting him from Dooku.
