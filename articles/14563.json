The battle was fought between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance sometime between the years 2 and 1 BBY. The battle was used as the first field test for the Empire's Nemesis-class gunship. The gunship used its Hellcaster cannon and concussion missiles during the battle, and the noise created by its jets proved beneficial to the Empire. The loud sound had a major effect on the Rebel's morale, causing many of them to flee in terror. The gunship fulfilled the mission with only minor damage, and at some point after the battle, Inspector-General Moff Rebu gave a report about the gunship's mission to the Imperial Department of Military Research. He was impressed by the gunship's performance, stating that it had exceeded all expectations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle fought on Polomie was first mentioned in \"The Nemesis Gunship\" entry in the in-game databank of the PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 versions of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, a LucasArts video game released in 2010."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
