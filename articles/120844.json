A pureblood schinga shikou was roughly eight meters long, with smooth scales along the length of its body and dozens of large white fangs. It held its head upright as it slithered. Some were domesticated by the native Swokes Swokes, for whom schinga shikou breeding was a profitable business. Due to careful breeding, there were dozens of varieties of schinga. Red, gold, and white specimens were especially prized."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
