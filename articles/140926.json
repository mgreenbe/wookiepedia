There existed many types of tea. One was made from the florets of the Cassius tree. Another, known as Tarine tea, was served on planets as diverse as Lothal and Christophsis. Gatalenta was a planet famous for its tea. One tea was the Deychin tea. While some varieties of tea were consumed hot, others were served cold, such as Moogan tea or its corporate-branded version, Ardees Beverage, which came in bottles or as a fizzy canned tea. Teahouses were establishments dedicated to the serving of tea."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point during the Clone Wars, smugglers led by a Moogan named Tee Va came to Sundari, the capital city of Mandalore, where they distributed Ardees beverage tea diluted with slabin, a hazardous chemical.
