The city featured several market stalls and was home to a variety of species, and also had starship landing areas. In 19 BBY, the city was visited by the Frangawl Cult, who travelled through the city with a captive Queen Julia of Bardotta to the site of a rail speeder which transported them to the Temple of Malmourral, a temple under their control. In pursuit were Jedi Master Mace Windu and Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks, who followed the Frangawl cultists through the city."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
