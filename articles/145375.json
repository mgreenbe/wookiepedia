Like the Theta-class shuttle, the H-2 executive star shuttle had a tri-wing configuration. Its two larger wings were made from embersteel. Prior to the Battle of Endor, a H-2 star shuttle was among the ships confiscated from rebel sympathizers that the Galactic Empire auctioned at the Mygeeto Auction House. During the Mission to obtain Embersteel wings, the Freemakers attempted to buy the shuttle. After Graballa the Hutt's minions Baash and Raam accidentally purchased the shuttle, the Freemakers managed to steal the shuttle from Graballa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
