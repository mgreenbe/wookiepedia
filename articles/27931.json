The song was used on the soundtrack for the game Star Wars: Republic Commando and the song later appeared on the accompanying Commando EP. It was the first use of a licensed song in a Star Wars soundtrack by LucasArts; the song appears both in the end credits of the game and as a music video bonus feature in the game's Extras section."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The band has described the use of the song in the game as a \"fluke\": \"We got asked to provide music for the game during the Meltdown writing period and by complete fluke had just demoed the Clones track!\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lyrics of the song address a member of an endless series of clones, berating him for having once shown potential to rise about social conformity but in the end reverting to the expectations of his creators. The original music video shows the band performing in an empty warehouse, and ends with lead singer Tim Wheeler confronting a clone of himself. The revised music video released with Republic Commando intersperses the original video with gameplay footage of Delta Squad ruthlessly dispatching their foes, and ends with Boss brutally kicking in the head of a defeated super battle droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Lyrics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Now you're a clone\nWith heart of stone\nSynthetic soul\nBrainwashed and cold\nYou're just a drone\nGot no control\nForced in a mold\nProcessed and sold\nHey\nYou know I find it frightening\nHow you change, it's as fast as lightning\nYou fell from grace\nLeaving no trace\nYou've been replaced\nYour name erased\nHey\nIt's your self-destruction\nYou never listened to my instruction\nShame\nShame, shame, shame\nShame\nThat everyone's the same\nI thought you stood alone,\nWere different from the clones.\nYou were a flash of light\nA meteorite\nUnique in time\nNow out of sight\nFor I have seen\nWhat could've been\nA vivid dream\nA prophecy\nHey\nNow there's no use waiting\nEverything is disintegrating\nShame\nThat everyone's the same\nI thought you stood alone\nWere different from the clones\nI thought you were the truth\nException to the rule\nBut the truth is cruel\nClones\nClones, clones, clones\nClones\nClones, clones, clones\nYeah\nHey\nNow there's no use waiting\nEverything is disintegrating\nShame\nThat everyone's the same\nI thought you stood alone\nWere different from the clones\nI thought you were the truth\nException to the rule\nBut the truth is cruel"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
