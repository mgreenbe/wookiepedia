With a well-muscled body comparable in size to large predators like the gundark or nexu, they had a long, thick tail. Their faces had two eyes, a flat nose, pointed ears, and a single wide mouth filled with sharp pointed teeth. The jaw also had a distinctly triangular-shaped pair of mandibles with their narrowest point jutting toward the creature's anterior. Gohai had a narrow waist, digitigrade limbs and the robust torso came to a peak between the shoulder blades."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bounty Hunters Guild Handbook recommended that if they charged at a being, the target should drop to the ground.
