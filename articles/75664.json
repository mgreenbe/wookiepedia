The couple had a family of seven sons and a daughter, and ran Ambar's Big Game, Tackle, and Gear Shop. On the evening of the Ambars sixtieth wedding anniversary, Drexler went out to check the ice pools and traps and never returned. Searches for Ambar found nothing, but Keturah refused to give up on her husband. For ten years, Keturah hiked to the top of the Orane Mountain to watch for signs of Ambar. Because of her vigil, the top of the Orane Mountain becameknown as Keturah's Point. Keturah's routine left her nearly blind and crippled due to overexposure to Neftali's freezing temperatures. She spent her time in the back of the family-run shop, knitting and entering children with stories of her husbands hunting expeditions and how the animals got their names."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
