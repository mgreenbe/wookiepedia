An Alliance team infiltrated the Havoc, planting detonite near the vessel's deflector shield generators. Once the explosives were triggered, the Star Destroyer's aft shields failed. The light freighter Vindicator, refitted as a torpedo bomber with quad proton torpedo launchers, used the opportunity to launch a salvo of proton torpedoes into the Havoc's ion drive. The resulting explosions tore through the Star Destroyer, leaving it a hulk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
