Based aboard the Jedi training cruiser Crucible, Huyang began his service to the Order in its early days. His instruction would commence once a class of younglings had passed The Gathering on Ilum and collected their lightsaber crystals. Although criticized for being a droid despite his central role in Jedi training, he carried out his tasks with distinction, educating each new generation of Jedi and providing them with the needed components from his vast cache of supplies. He also maintained an archive of each and every lightsaber, and its owner, within his memory bank. By the time of the Clone Wars, thousands of generations of Jedi had passed through Huyang's tutelage and completed their lightsabers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 20 BBY, Huyang's instruction of one particular class of Initiates\u2014Petro, Ganodi, Byph, Katooni, Zatt, and Gungi\u2014took an unexpected turn when a gang of pirates attacked and boarded the Crucible. Although Huyang and his students repelled the brigands from the Crucible, the Initiates' chaperone, Padawan Ahsoka Tano, was captured. Huyang himself was almost completely dismembered in combat, though he received repairs thanks to Ganodi, Zatt, and the astromech droid R2-D2. While mounting an attempt to rescue Tano on the planet Florrum, Huyang and the younglings were drawn into an all-out invasion launched by General Grievous and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, though with the aid of Captain Hondo Ohnaka and his pirates, they evaded Grievous and safely returned to the Republic fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Teacher of Jedi Initiates"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An architect droid, Huyang\u2014also Professor Huyang or Master Huyang, as he came to be known\u2014began his service to the Jedi Order within its nascent days. The Order was founded around 25,783 BBY, from the ancient society known as the Je'daii Order. Huyang served aboard the Jedi training vessel the Crucible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the sole being assigned to the Crucible, Huyang maintained his own database of lightsaber designs and their designers, spanning the entire tenure of his considerable teaching career. It was aboard the Crucible that Huyang taught countless Jedi the means of constructing their own lightsabers in the last thousand years of their order. Sometime during this period, he assisted then-Initiate Yoda in the construction of his first lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Training gone astray"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, a group of Initiates consisting of Byph, Ganodi, Gungi, Katooni, Petro, and Zatt\u2014having recently completed their Gathering trial\u2014arrived on the Crucible to be instructed by Huyang in the construction of their lightsabers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some of the Initiates, Ganodi in particular, were skeptical of the droid due to his extreme age, but were quickly won over by his wisdom and anecdotes from the annals of Jedi history.

To safeguard the Initiates' unique crystals, Huyang gathered and stored them inside his chest. Unbeknownst to him at the time, however, Petro had surreptitiously palmed his crystal and handed Huyang a droid component."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Huyang, Padawan Tano, and the group of Initiates chose to hide in the ship's ventilation system when the pirates boarded the Crucible and began searching for their prize. In executing a plan of Tano's devising, Huyang and the younglings were found and caught by a group of pirates, but Petro put his crystal into his poorly crafted lightsaber and tricked the largest pirate into activating it, causing it to explode, knocking the pirates unconscious and damaging Huyang in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Huyang and the younglings were confronted by Ohnaka and more pirates before Tano arrived and subdued the pirates with a Force Push. As Tano began to hold Ohnaka off, Huyang began to lead the Initiates to safety, but ending up having his head shot off by one of the pirates. The droid professor then engaged the pirate in unarmed combat and managed to defeat him, despite having both his arms blasted off as well. The Initiates then collected his body parts and took shelter in the Crucible's hold. Unfortunately for Tano, the plan to liberate the ship did not go exactly as planned, and she was captured by the pirates even as she drove them from the ship."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Misadventures on Florrum"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Still significantly damaged from his battle with Hondo Ohnaka, Huyang was able to offer little in the way of assistance when the group of Initiates decided to pursue the pirates back to their base on Florrum in order to rescue Padawan Tano. With the Crucible landed on the planet surface to effect repairs, Huyang remained aboard with Initiate Ganodi and fellow droid R2-D2, while the remaining Initiates set out to rescue Tano."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the others gone, Ganodi began to repair Huyang, beginning with re-attaching his head to his body.
