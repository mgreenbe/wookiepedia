Given its ability to destroy planets, it was a weapon of terror that only the providential intervention of the Rebel Alliance could destroy in extremis. Both its heir, the second Death Star, wiped out on Endor, and Starkiller Base, built by the First Order on what had long been the planet Ilum, were based on the same doctrine of fear through the power of the weapons. To which more powerful, these stations had an unparalleled destructive capacity, but their eventual destruction was a severe blow to the regimes that had built them. However, in all cases they were imposing works of military and technological design."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
