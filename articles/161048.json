Calimondra had seven children, and each one claimed to be the true heir to her holdings, so in order to determine which one would become her benificiary, she instigated a contest\u2014the Charge Matrica\u2014in 1066 BBY, challenging her children to expand her territories. However, the siblings declared war on each other and fought amongst themselves. Eventually, only Calimondra's son Chagras was left, and he became the heir to Calimondra's empire. Chagras established his own state, the Chagras Hegemony, but Calimondra retained control of most of her holdings.
