Shell One bordered Hollowtown and was connected by small airlocks through which turbovators were allowed to pass. There was a small air pressure differential of eight percent between the two areas. Shell One and the outer layers were spared the devastation that Hollowtown experienced when the Glowpoint flared during the First Corellian Insurrection."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
