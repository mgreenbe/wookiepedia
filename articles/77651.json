She hailed from Sith space and was of low birth, but was inducted into the Sith Order due to her Force-sensitivity. Around 3643 BBY, she and five other Sith Acolytes were summoned to the Sith Academy on Korriban to participate in trials and evaluations and to ultimately become the apprentice of the Sith Lord Zash. Kory's trials were supervised by the vindictive Overseer Harkun, who first tasked the acolytes with journeying into the tomb of the ancient Dark Lord of the Sith Ajunta Pall, where they would find the hermit Sith Lord Spindrall and be judged by him. Kory completed the task and survived Spindrall's tests, but was judged by the elder Sith to be unworthy of training in the dark side of the Force. As such, Harkun executed Kory upon her return to him, ending the young acolyte's short career."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kory was a Human female alive during the turbulent period of galactic peace between the reconstituted Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic as established by the Treaty of Coruscant. She hailed from the worlds of the Sith imperium but was born into a low social class. As an Imperial citizen of low birth, Kory was relegated to the status of slave, but she was eventually found to be Force-sensitive and so was inducted into the Sith Order, per Imperial law. The young woman began her training as a lowly acolyte, but around 3643 BBY, she was summoned to the Sith holy world of Korriban to become a student at the legendary Sith Academy on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The young Sith was summoned to the world to participate in a series of trials designed to find an apprentice for the Sith Lord known as Zash. Kory and five other former slaves\u2014Balek, Wydr, Gerr, Niloc, and a sixth acolyte\u2014were all chosen because of their humble backgrounds; Zash had prophesied that her apprentice would be of low birth, and so commanded the academy's Overseer Harkun to supervise the trials of the six acolytes and weed out the weak and unfit. Harkun, a harsh and bigoted trainer, gathered the hopefuls at the Korriban Arrival Port overlooking the Valley of the Dark Lords. There, he explained that Zash's first trial for them would be to enter the tomb of the ancient Dark Lord of the Sith Ajunta Pall. Within, they were to locate and be judged by the hermit Sith Lord Spindrall, whose opinion Zash held in high regard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the initiates were given their first task, Harkun singled out the sixth acolyte, who had arrived late, for harassment. Before leaving to find Spindrall, Kory offered her peer some reassuring words of encouragement. She then proceeded into the Valley of the Dark Lords and from there, into the Tomb of Ajunta Pall. Kory succeeded in finding Spindrall within the crypt's Sacrificial Chamber, where she was challenged by the elder Sith and ultimately judged as weak and unworthy. The acolyte left the tomb in order to meet up once more with her fellow students and Overseer Harkun, this time within the academy itself. Harkun had received word from Spindrall regarding his judgments of the students, and decided to make an example of Kory. To that end, the overseer called Kory forward during the meeting and announced that Spindrall had declared her to be unfit. Harkun followed up by shooting Kory with a blast of Force lightning, executing the young woman before her gathered peers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kory was a red-haired human with blue-green eyes and fair skin. She was youthful at the time of her Sith training and had a large and uneven scar on the right side of her face."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike many Sith at the academy on Korriban, Kory was neither vindictive nor competitive. She readily offered encouragement and reassurance to her fellow acolyte when the student was being harassed by Harkun, despite the fact that the rest of the acolytes ran ahead to complete their first trial. Kory also failed to impress Spindrall, who evaluated his visitors on their ability to comprehend and adhere to the Code of the Sith, which was based on passion and power. Her inability to embody the tenets of the code gave Harkun an excuse to murder her and use her death as an example for her peers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kory first appeared in the BioWare/LucasArts online roleplaying game, Star Wars: The Old Republic, released in 2011.
