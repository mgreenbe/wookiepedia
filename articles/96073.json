Following the Emperor's death, Executor Sedriss\u2014a member of the Dark Side Elite, the select cadre of Palpatine's Dark Jedi\u2014assumed command of the Imperial forces, hoping that one day Palpatine's spirit would inhabit another clone and the Emperor would return to rule the Empire once more."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nefta, however, thought that the Emperor's return could occur many years later, and without a leader, the Empire could collapse beforehand. Nefta and fellow darksider Sa-Di wanted to take the throne themselves and decided to ensure that Palpatine would not come back to stand in their way. The two first spread rumors of the Emperor's permanent demise, and later, when Sedriss departed to discipline the recently rebelled planet of Balmorra, made their final move. Nefta and Sa-Di, armed with a lightsaber and an axe respectively, assaulted the secret storage of clones and destroyed all cloning tanks one by one. Just as they finished their mission, Sedriss returned from Balmorra and witnessed the results of their work. The Executor immediately decided to kill the two for their treachery and attacked Nefta with his lightsaber. Nefta blocked the first blow with his own weapon but was then quickly slain by Sedriss, who later executed Sa-Di as well. Unbeknownst to all three, Palpatine had in fact already taken a new clone body and was watching the entire scene from the shadows in a corridor.
