The Grand Admiral, having been busy patrolling space near the planet Gargon, seized the world when he received the news of the defeat at Endor.

Over the course of his career, he became a highly-regarded strategist. In 2 BBY, during a New Year's Fete Week celebration on Coruscant, he was one of twelve naval officers elevated to the rank of Grand Admiral by Emperor Palpatine. In 4 ABY, while fellow Grand Admiral Miltin Takel traveled to the second Death Star to witness what was supposed to be the destruction of the Rebel Alliance, Grunger was assisting Takel's second-in-command in patrolling the Mandalore sector\u2014specifically space near the spice-producing planet Gargon\u2014due to reports of \"albino-skinned marauders.\" When word reached Grunger of the Imperial defeat at Endor and the Emperor's death, the Grand Admiral had his ship open fire on the vessel of Takel's lieutenant, disabling it. Grunger seized Gargon and quickly set himself up as one of the first Imperial warlords.

By 5 ABY, Grunger was in possession of thirty Imperial-class and Victory-class Star Destroyers, one hundred Carrack-class cruisers, and sixty Strike-class cruisers, among other craft. Grunger led this fleet from the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Aggressor, his flagship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having been ousted from his homeworld of Gargon, Grand Admiral Takel eventually allied himself with the Central Committee of Grand Moffs, hoping that they would be able to deal with Grunger. Meanwhile, a member of the Imperial Royal Guard, having been to Gargon, brought news of Grunger's claim to the throne to the Central Committee on Kessel. During an assembly in Kessendra Stadium in which Grand Moff Bertroff Hissa announced the mutant Slavelord Trioculus to be Palpatine's son and heir, the Royal Guard questioned the validity of Trioculus' claim over Grunger's, noting that the Grand Admiral had amassed a sizable force of Star Destroyers. The slavelord declared that he would deal with Grunger in time. In a committee meeting that followed, Trioculus demanded that the glove of Darth Vader be found, which would entitle him to the dark blessing of Supreme Prophet of the Dark Side Kadann\u2014something he needed in order to secure the vacant throne. Takel feared that Grunger would retrieve the glove first and therefore make good on his claim to the throne, but Takel was quickly executed by Hissa for questioning Trioculus' plans. Hissa later brought news to Trioculus that Grunger, doubting the mutant's claim of being Palpatine's son, would only be willing to support Trioculus after he received the dark blessing from Kadann, who was in truth an imposter posing as the true Supreme Prophet. At that point, Grunger promised to turn over command of his fleet to Trioculus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Trioculus did receive the dark blessing from the false Supreme Prophet, his reign as Emperor was short-lived; he died not long after taking the title. Grunger, meanwhile, had avoided any permanent ties with the Central Committee and retained control of his armada. In 5 ABY, following the New Republic's execution of Grand Admiral Osvald Teshik a year earlier, Grunger prepared to strike at Imperial Center. To do so, Grunger moved his armada into the Corellian sector. However, Grand Admiral Danetta Pitta had bribed the Corellian leader into relinquishing control of the sector, and Pitta quickly assumed command. When Grunger's fleet, led by the Aggressor, emerged from hyperspace in the Corellian system near the planet Tralus, Pitta took control of a Torpedo Sphere and began to annihilate his rival's forces. Faced with defeat and the loss of his pride, Grunger had his command ship ram the Torpedo Sphere.
