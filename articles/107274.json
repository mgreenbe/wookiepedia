Made of metal, the power prybar consisted of several flat prybars that were connected with fulcrums and hydraulic pistons. A small pressure computer calculated the force an individual applied to the power prybar, then provided extra leverage to complete the task. The power prybar was powered by a long-lasting internal energy cell. The tool was capable of prying gaps to about ten centimeters. Useful for prying open crates, the power prybar could also be used as a makeshift melee weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
