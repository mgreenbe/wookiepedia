The underground factories were cut off from the surface and maintained by flightless Geonosian worker drones who tinkered around the clock to reach maximum efficiency. Many drones were maimed or killed as a result of this mad desire to produce. Speed and reliability were the only concerns."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Sleeping quarters"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In between shifts, the workers rested in storage alcoves located in warm corridors.

In the original shooting script, Anakin and Padm\u00e9 crept into the Geonosian spire, and simply encountered Count Dooku. In this version, the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO never left the Naboo starship. The addition of the droid factory not only provided a new action set piece, but also gave a visual clue as to the size of the growing droid army. Elements of Anakin, Padm\u00e9 and the droids were shot during additional photography in 2001, mostly against bluescreen with very minimal sets. The Animatics Department filled in the bluescreen areas with very detailed temporary versions of the droid factory, previsualizing the environment that Industrial Light & Magic would generate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ben Snow, one the film's Visual Effects Supervisors, took reference footage of a Northern California automobile factory and foundry, to get visual starting points for the motion of automated machinery and the extreme heat and steam atmospheric effects his crew would recreate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though much of the environment was computer-generated, certain machines and the surrounding walls of the droid factory were realized as detailed and dramatically lit miniatures."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
