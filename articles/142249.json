In actuality, Wilhuff Tarkin did not love her; soon after their marriage, he instead began an affair with a young cadet on Carida, Natasi Daala."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the Governor's misgivings for his wife, the couple had one son named Garoche, who served as an admiral in the Imperial Navy. In 19 BBY, Garoche secretly defected to the Atoan system and aided in its insurgency against the Galactic Empire. The official reports read that he had gone missing and was later killed by Atoan natives. However, the real murderer was secretly Emperor Palpatine's right hand man, Darth Vader, who along with his master believed that Garoche's death would turn Governor Tarkin into a powerful, hate-driven ally that would show the Empire's enemies no mercy. Their plan succeeded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Governor Tarkin's homeworld of Eriadu in the post-Clone Wars era, the Tarkin family had earned a reputation as a force to be reckoned with. When members of the Nebula Front kidnapped Lady Tarkin's niece Shella Motti, the Tarkins hired agents to find the missing girl; Motti, however, hired their own agents to prevent her from having to go home to her family. In 5 BBY, when Lady Tarkin's brother-in-law Gideon Tarkin was killed during the Erhynradd Mutiny, his daughter Rivoche was invited to come live at the Tarkin estate; however, the teenage Rivoche frequently acted out in resentment, so Governor Tarkin had her sent to an exclusive preparatory academy on Cl\u00e6r."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 1 BBY, Thalassa Tarkin and her spouse lived in an apartment on Coruscant.

Tarkin ran the business as an Imperial labor colony and used slaves to mine the explosive, heat-sensitive moss to develop ammunition for the Empire, to which she remained fanatically devoted, particularly for their dedication to destroying the Rebellion. Just prior to the Thirteenth Imperial Diplomatic Conclave, which Lady Tarkin was hosting, Princess Leia Organa became stranded on Phelarion. Mistaking her for a slave girl, Tarkin chose Organa, whom she called \"Lerna,\" as a servant to work at the conclave. After notifying an Imperial freighter to postpone its megonite pickup due to an explosion at the mine, Tarkin discovered that a large amount of megonite was not being accounted for and began to suspect thievery. Tarkin was then contacted by Darth Vader about the delay in landing, and he accused her of selling the megonite to the Rebel Alliance. Incensed, Tarkin set out to find whomever was stealing her megonite."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tarkin returned to her private chambers after hearing a loud noise; there she found her servant Nardo dead from an explosion in her megonite display case. She nevertheless proceeded to her banquet hall to host the Imperial Diplomatic Conclave, for guests such as Shea Hublin, Chancellor Qua of the Zenox Star Cluster, the Most High Proctor of Thebeon 8, and Darth Vader himself. Tarkin had an embarrassing moment when she offered a drink to Vader, who reminded her that he neither ate nor drank. Vader grew impatient with Tarkin and again accused her of selling to the Rebels. His stormtroopers then discovered the crashed Rebel glider Organa had used for landing. When Tarkin spotted her servant girl Lerna and two other slaves fleeing the scene, Vader recognized the girl as Princess Leia Organa. While Tarkin doubted the Rebels' chances of escaping the planet, Vader vowed to hold Tarkin personally responsible if Organa escaped.

She took pride in her devotion to the Empire, and was highly offended when Darth Vader accused her of selling war mat\u00e9riel to the Rebellion. Tarkin was also paranoid, fearing that Rebels were everywhere, trying to kill her.

Thirty years after her debut, she was given the first name of \"Thalassa\" by Nathan O'Keefe in his 2009 short story \"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Praji.\" Thalassa means \"Sea\" in Greek and was the name of a primordial sea goddess in Greek myth, as well as a moon of Neptune. O'Keefe chose the name due to it sounding \"cool and Star-Warsy,\" rather than for any thematic significance of its existing meanings. Despite being the wife of a prominent Star Wars character, Lady Tarkin has only been mentioned in a few sources since her first appearance. Also, no source has indicated whether or not she was aware of her husband's affair with Natasi Daala."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
