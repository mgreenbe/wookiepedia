It stipulated that any works of art found in or near Emperor Palpatine's Mount Tantiss storehouse on Wayland, could be reclaimed by the cultures from which they were taken. It was created to solve a dispute between archaeologist Garv Debble, who wished to preserve the artifacts, and the Noghri who had been transported to Wayland and sought to destroy all indication of Palpatine's presence there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The agreement led to an influx of collectors, curators and treasure hunters to New Nystao, driving the creation of hotels, restaurants and other infrastructure to support the offworlders.
