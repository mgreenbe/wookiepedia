The entry also mentioned the Mandalorians, the warrior culture native to Mandalore and the only beings with the knowledge of how to properly craft beskar iron. Because the Mandalorian metalsmiths refused to sell their beskar\u2013working skills, and because any attempt to copy the Mandalorians' beskar iron outside of Mandalore ended in failure, Manaitis stated that the only way to get beskar iron was to seize Mandalore itself, a task Manaitis considered nearly impossible given the Mandalorians' mastery of warfare."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Strategic Resources of the Galaxy was first mentioned in Karen Traviss's 2009 novel Imperial Commando: 501st when the reference literature's entry on beskar iron was quoted at the start of the novel's sixth chapter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
