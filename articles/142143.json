At the meeting, the flotilla's Regent Administrator Eglyn Valmor argued that they should remain in the Alderaan system, while the former teacher Icar Orliss and the diplomat Janis Pol claimed they should resettle on a new world.

While in the Alderaan system aboard the flotilla, it made him sad to see the asteroids that made up the remains of his homeworld drifting into the perimeter shield that protected the flotilla's ships and breaking up even further on impact. He initially tried to tune out the argument over the flotilla's future while at the meeting, but became involved in order to sternly defend Organa's name, as she had done so much to aid the flotilla."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teven Gale first appeared in the novel Aftermath: Life Debt, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released released on July 12, 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
