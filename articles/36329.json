The shuttle subsequently evacuated them again following an assault on the meeting by the Sith Empire. Fel's Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer the Dauntless managed to hold off the First Sith Imperial Strikeforce long enough for the shuttle to jump to hyperspace. The Dauntless was then destroyed by the enemy flagship War Hammer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
