Knowing that the Empire could use the crystal for sinister means, Kanan Jarrus sent Bridger into the Academy on this mission, where he has been for weeks.

To increase the tension, Commandant Aresko electrified several of the platforms; causing Cadet Giles to fall to the ground. Despite some opposition from a hostile cadet named Nazhros Oleg, Ezra along with Jai and Leonis managed to win the competition.

In Kallus' absence, Ezra enters his office and takes the decoder from Kallus' network terminal. Before he could leave the room with the stolen decoder, Ezra was stopped by Leonis.
