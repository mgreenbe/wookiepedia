The Tulgah witch, Morag, kidnapped the child of a family of Phlogs, Nahkee, and pinned the theft on the Ewoks by planting false evidence. The simple Phlogs including Zut, Dobah, and Hoom, decided to enact revenge on the Ewoks for the theft, making their way to the Ewok village. After transporting the Phlog child to the Dulok Swamp, Morag arrived at the village to watch the Phlogs destroy it. Although equipped with catapults in an effort to ward off the assault, the Ewoks were unable to bring down any of the Phlogs, and it seemed that the Phlogs would soon tear down the tree structure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Ewok children, Latara, Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka, Wicket Wystri Warrick, and Teebo were able to infiltrate the Dulok Swamp and rescue the Phlogs' child. Upon returning the child to its parents, the Phlogs broke off their attack, content that they had gotten their child back. The Duloks, who had been tasked with protecting the child during the attack, arrived at the village to recapture Nahkee. The Phlogs, now aware of the deception quickly turned their wrath on the Duloks, chasing them all the way back to their swamp. Morag, furious over the turn of events, attacked the Dulok leader, King Gorneesh and Shaman Umwak, punishing them for their failure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ewoks\u2014\"Rampage of the Phlogs\""}]}
