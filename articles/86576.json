Over one year into the war, the Republic-owned droids R2-D2 and C-3PO were captured and taken to the ship to be watched in a gladiatorial arena for the pirates' amusement. However, the Separatist General Grievous arrived, and ordered his battle droids to use the ship as target practice. When the ship was shot, the droids and most, if not all, of the pirates were sucked out into space. The rest were killed in a massive explosion that occurred soon after. Following this a number of the droids were captured and incinerated by the Separatists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
