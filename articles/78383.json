They were slightly larger than an average human and most of them stood at about two meters tall. None of them had hair, probably because they mostly lived underground.

Their major cities were extravagant and lined with gems and jewels from the depths of their world.\nThey were mostly a peaceful people, but because they had a government run by rival families, many brief wars were common. They had a deep love of knowledge and constantly made voyages to other worlds secretly to gain more."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Kai Ro' Dane War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Approximately 8,211 BBY, a Kuaran named Vero Kai Ro' Dane came to power by inheriting his father's vast wealth.
