They carried three crew, six passengers, 3,000 metric tons (1,000 cubic meters) of cargo, and 4 months' consumables. They had a class 4 hyperdrive, a class 9 backup, a navigation computer, and the ability to achieve 400 kmh in atmosphere. They were equipped with automated mining equipment, a sensor array designed to detect precious metals, shields, a forward turbolaser, and a heavy mining laser. Though the laser was intended for strip mining, it could easily penetrate a small ship's hull."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the text describes the vehicle as having several small \"cutting blasters\" or \"underbelly lasers,\" the stats only describe a single \"heavy mining laser.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
