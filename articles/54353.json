A Separatist Trident-class assault ship soon arrived and began spinning; creating a vortex that confused the battlefront and scattered soldiers on both sides. Ackbar grabbed on to Skywalker, swam him to the gunship, and threw him up to it. Skywalker severed one of its legs with his lightsaber, causing the craft to spin out of control and crash.

Ackbar and Tills rejoiced when they saw the prince alive, but were confounded when Lee-Char explained his daring plan to reunify the citizens of Mon Cala against the Separatist invaders. Ackbar was shocked that the prince would ally himself with the people who had killed his father, but Lee-Char told Ackbar that he knew for fact that Tamson had done so. Tano added that she had seen similar occurrences of Dooku manipulating a planet's people to start a civil war, so the prince said that he would find and show Ri the truth. Ackbar agreed to the prince's noble plan and said he would marshal the Mon Calamari troops for battle.

Ackbar's first appearance, however, was in Archie Goodwin's comic strip Revenge of the Jedi, published in the Los Angeles Times Syndicate from November 1982 to January 1983. During pre-production of the film, George Lucas allowed the Return of the Jedi's director, Richard Marquand to pick from a selected 50 drawings for the look of aliens to play as Ackbar. Marquand went with a drawing by Nilo Rodis-Jamero which he called, \"Calamari man\". The drawing had no backstory or personality to it. In Return of the Jedi, Ackbar was played by puppeteer Tim Rose and voiced by voice actor Erik Bauersfeld who also voiced Bib Fortuna in the film. In the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series, Ackbar was voiced by Artt Butler. Both Rose and Bauersfeld reprised Ackbar in the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, the first installment of the sequel trilogy, being Bauersfeld's final film role before his death in 2016. In the 2017 sequel Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, Rose portrayed the character once more, while voice actor Tom Kane voiced Ackbar. Kane had portrayed Ackbar in previous Star Wars media, such as LEGO Star Wars: Droid Tales."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gran, Ree-Yees was originally set to play the role of Admiral Ackbar, but when reviewing the sculpts of the creature, the filmmakers decided to go with the Mon Calamari admiral instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Return of the Jedi, Admiral Ackbar was realized as a combination slip-on mask and half-body puppet. All close-up shots involving dialogue used an extraordinarily detailed puppet controlled by Rose, who puppeteered Salacious B. Crumb too. From Jim Henson, Rose was loaned to Lucasfilm Ltd. during Episode VI's production and was assigned to puppeteer Crumb and Sy Snootles. Rose asked visual effects supervisor Phil Tippett, however, if he could also perform Ackbar. Rose was familiar with the controls and had already designed much of the puppet by that point, but the only thing that he knew about Ackbar was that he was a background character who was to appear later after the appearance of both Snootles and Crumb at Jabba's Palace, wearing Ackbar's mask during scenes that didn't require a puppet too. Bauersfeld was cast to voice both Ackbar and Bib Fortuna by Ben Burtt and George Lucas after they asked him to do some voices for them while producing a radio drama with Randy Thom, yet he didn't actually meet any of the cast members\u2014though he received a nice letter from Rose. An easy job, Bauersfeld recorded both Ackbar's and Fortuna's voices in such an hour with Burtt. Due to uncertainty inherent in giving key expository dialog to Ackbar as he was a fishfaced puppet, some backup scenes were shot featuring Crix Madine filling Ackbar's role during the Battle of Endor, but Ackbar's shots ultimately remained."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the character's surname was created by George Lucas during the production of Jedi after seeing the mask in the creature shop, Ackbar's first name wasn't coined until the release of the Star Wars Legends reference book The Essential Guide to Warfare, written by both Jason Fry and Paul R. Urquhart and released on April 3, 2012, which established Ackbar's first name as \"Gial.\" The name was upheld in canon with the release of the reference book Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, published on September 4, 2015."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During development of the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, the final installment of the prequel trilogy, Lucas was so impressed with the animatronic capabilities of the Mon Calamari Meena Tills that he briefly considered replacing Ackbar's footage from Episode VI with Tills's mask, as Lucas always felt that the result of Ackber's puppetry technology was a compromise in spite of achieving the latest technology available in 1983. Nevertheless, the original footage was ultimately left unaltered. Ackbar was present in the original script for the 2016 Star Wars Anthology film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, appearing to lead the rebel fleet during the Battle of Scarif in the film's climax, but after J.J. Abrams featured Ackbar in Episode VII, the part of Admiral Raddus was created to replace Ackbar as the crew believed that Ackbar shouldn't appear in two films released together so closely."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "It's a trap!"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Admiral Ackbar's line \"It's a trap!\" in Return of the Jedi has developed into an Internet meme, viral and popular at websites like 4chan, LUELinks.net, SomethingAwful, and You're the Man Now Dog.
