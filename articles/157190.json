Sometime prior to the completion of the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon in 34 ABY, a shuttle containing both Kylo Ren, the apprentice of Supreme Leader Snoke, and General Armitage Hux was sabotaged, crashing onto a planet. After escaping the planet with Ren, Hux identified the technician as being responsible and punished him. As Brooks was the technician's superior, Hux subsequently executed the admiral, who claimed that Hux simply wanted an excuse to exact revenge for the way Brooks had treated him as a child."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The radar technician was first mentioned in the comic Age of Resistance - General Hux 1, written by Tom Taylor and published by Marvel Comics on August 28, 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
