The virus was targeted to infect droids. When the droids encountered a Smiler in trouble, the virus took control of their systems and forced the droids to rescue the Smiler, no matter what the cost. The virus helped Zorneth keep the secret of savorium herb, but it also was planned to help him infect the galaxy with savorium. Zorneth had planned to take control of the savorium-addicted galaxy, until his untimely death prevented it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
