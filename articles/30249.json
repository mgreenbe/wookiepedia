Some notable Peace & Security personnel included the detectives Erno, Shreen, and Mursey and the security officer Spob Rydel. During the Coronet City revolution, the Acolytes of the Beyond attacked a Peace and Security station in order to steal an ancient Sith lightsaber from the archives below. The undercover Acolyte Kiza killed Shreen, Mursey, and Rydel with a blaster while her comrade Remi cut off Erno's blaster hand with the stolen lightsaber.
