A member of the Imperial Military of the Sith Empire like his wife, the man raised his daughter Vesh in wealth and privilege on the Empire's capital planet of Dromund Kaas. However, Vesh had a volatile temper and took pleasure in destroying her surroundings and tormenting her parents; when she discovered she was Force-sensitive, Vesh experimented on her parents' bodyguards. Following the eighth fatality, sometime after 3681 BBY, Thana's parents tried to suppress her power. Vesh lashed out, killing her parents and causing an entire block of Kaas City to burn to the ground."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thana Vesh's father was first mentioned in Thana's Codex entry in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
