He had a Padawan learner, the human Imri Cantaros. He also worked with the young Jedi Knight Vernestra Rwoh at Port Haileap. He used the nickname \"Vern\" to refer to her, although she privately disliked it. At his request, Rwoh brought young inventor Avon Starros, who had been sent there from Coruscant, to accompany a party traveling to the space station Starlight Beacon. Starros was the same age as Honesty Weft, the son of the Dalnan Ambassador Weft, who was also part of the delegation. Sunvale hoped that the two would become friends and soften the Dalnans' view of the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sunvale died during the attack on the Steady Wing, after ensuring that Rwoh, Honesty, Avon, and Cantaros could escape the doomed starship.
