He was present when Savage Opress assaulted his human colleague Sassi, and attempted to intervene but was thrown back when Savage tossed her at him. Later, he was distressed enough to threaten the Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano with a frying pan when they rushed in and examined his colleague, but was admonished by a police droid. Loubo apologized, helping Sassi to her feet and offering the two Jedi a free meal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
