She was part of the task force that liberated Kal'Shebbol in 8 ABY. Following the Battle of Kal'Shebbol, she was transferred to the FarStar as squadron commander.

She insisted that her pilots paid close attention in briefings, hung on her every word, and obeyed her orders without question. If anyone dared to question her, or disagree with her, they sat out the next mission. Despite this, she had supreme trust in her pilots and their abilities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gorjaye was considered the scourge of the docking bay on the FarStar, forever barking orders at technicians and chewing people out.
