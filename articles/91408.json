Upon boarding the craft, Death Watch discovered the unconscious bodies of the Sith Lord Darth Maul and his apprentice Savage Opress; at the word of the group's leader, Pre Vizsla, the two Zabraks were brought aboard one of Death Watch's Kom'rk-class fighters\u2014Vizsla's personal vessel, Gauntlet\u2014and taken back to the Death Watch's encampment on the swamp-covered moon, Zanbar. There, Death Watch attended to the Sith's injuries before Vizsla invited Darth Maul to talk, during which the two found they had a mutual enemy in the form of the Jedi Order, with Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi equally despised by both men. Upon that shared animosity, Maul and Vizsla founded an alliance in pursuit of mutual benefit: the Sith would aid Death Watch in deposing Duchess Satine Kryze of the New Mandalorians, while Death Watch would assist the Sith in their plans to punish Kenobi for his actions against Maul a decade prior."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Together, Death Watch and the Sith set out to assemble an army of followers, beginning their search at a fortress on Mustafar belonging to the leaders of a branch of the Black Sun crime syndicate. Negotiations with the syndicate branch's Falleen leaders were quick to sour, leading Savage Opress to kill them while Maul recruited the organization's Captain of the Guard, Ziton Moj, who authorized an alliance in the fallen leaders' stead. Back on Zanbar, with freshly gained supplies and a battalion of Black Sun foot soldiers in tow, Pre Vizsla and Maul were approached by Lom Pyke, leader of a Coruscanti spice-dealing Pyke Syndicate. Having caught word of Maul's intentions to raise a force of criminals, the Pykes moved to willingly join the growing assembly, and were readily welcomed by Death Watch and the Sith. With their newest allies, Death Watch set out for Nal Hutta with a small attack force was comprised of three Kom'rk-class starfighters loaded with squads of Death Watch foot soldiers and three Sarisa-class gunships headed toward Nal Hutta and landed at the Hutt Council Chamber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Nal Hutta, Maul attempted to appeal to the Hutt Grand Council, through Jabba Desilijic Tiure, Gorga Desilijic Aarrpo, Arok and Oruba. Jabba stated that he would ally with him if he was presented with credits, but Maul said he had none. Oruba asked if they had anything to trade, and Maul stated it was their lives for Hutt Space and all they possessed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jabba then summoned his bounty hunters to face the three, and he had one of his bounty hunters, Sugi, hurl a knife at Maul's head. Before it could reach its target, Opress halted it and the knife went hurling back to the feet of the anooba, Marrok. Jabba then had his bounty hunters eliminate the two Sith Lords and Vizsla. The two Sith deflected shots as some Nikto and Twi'lek guards ran to the Hutts' aid from a side door. Savage cut one down, and threw two more at the bounty hunters. Vizla shot the last two Nikto guards, then used a flamethrower to help cover their retreat. By the time the flames had fanned, the Sith and Vizsla had a head start on their escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after the retreat, they made their way to a landing platform where Bo-Katan and the rest of the Death Watch lay in wait for them. After making known their presence by firing rockets into the Hutt guards' lines, they chased the surviving ones back into the palace, while the leaders followed, much slower, behind. After all of the Death Watch members were away chasing after the Nikto guards, Sugi leapt from the ceiling and managed to knock down Maul. Before he could move in, she kicked Vizsla away. Maul used his lightsaber to slash at Sugi, only for her to roll away from each strike. He was soon attacked by the anooba, Marrok, and was forced to the ground. He managed to ward it off him, and then flew Sugi across the room. Opress briefly skirmished with Embo, showing a display of unarmed combat. Eventually, Opress punched Embo's hat, which sent him hurling across the room."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vizsla, meanwhile, recovered from Sugi's kick and pulled out used his darksaber at the sight of retreating Nikto guards. With the darksaber, he cut a swath through them all. Their attempts at escape failed, and they all perished. Smoke pellets then disorientated the three, as the bounty hunters fled. Maul stated simply to leave them as bounty hunters like them had no affiliations with anyone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Almost all the Nikto guards were killed. Though the mission ended as a failure, Oruba was captured by Bo-Katan and her soldiers. Oruba stated he knew not of where his allies were hiding. Maul then ordered for Opress to kill him as the elder Hutt proved useless to them, but Oruba stated that his allies were holed up in Jabba's palace on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine. Still, Maul had Opress kill Oruba. They then set course for Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
