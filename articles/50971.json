The Jedi Order had a trick, primarily used to catch smugglers, of cross-referencing locations someone was known to have visited with where they had refuelled so they could deduce where else the target may have gone. In 21 BBY, Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano used this on the Xanadu Blood, a starfighter owned by bounty hunter Cad Bane, to deduce the location of several Force-sensitive children he had been hired to kidnap, and found that he had taken the children to the planet Mustafar. This allowed them to set out on a rescue mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A fuel computer first appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 2 episode \"Children of the Force\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
