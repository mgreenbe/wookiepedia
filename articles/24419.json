He sent his troops against House Thul on multiple fronts as a diversionary tactic, a ruse which Jorad Sindarus Thul fell for. While House Thul's forces were spread thin, Killesa led a sizeable force through the siege tunnel that connected the lands of House Thul and House Killesa, a remnant from a more peaceful time. With information gathered on the battlefield, an Imperial allied individual took a set of thermite charges to collapse the tunnel before it was too late."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When confronted, Killesa was furious at the Empire's involvement, which he saw as House Thul's weakness, as well as treason.
