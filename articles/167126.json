They wore tribal masks and depended on the native kirruk, residing in the nitrogen-rich valleys near the Eocho Mountains. Farming was their main source of food, though hunting with concussion bows became increasingly useful. The Ysanna possessed a level of sensitivity in the Force, able to influence the projectiles of their concussion bows and feeling a duty to protect Ossus's Jedi ruins. The shamans of the Ysanna were known as storm shepherds, and learned to predict the planet's lightning storms. The race spoke the Ysannan language."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to the legendary Qel-Droma Epics, the Ysanna were once the human Jedi survivors of the Cron Supernovae, which devastated Ossus.
