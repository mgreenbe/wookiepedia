Sloane and Vidian took Truncheon on their tour of the Moonglow Polychemical facility, where it was blown up by the dissident Skelly in revenge after Vidian inflicted severe injuries on him after he attempted to warn Vidian of the dangers thorilide mining was posing to the structure of Gorse's moon Cynda.
