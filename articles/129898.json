It was the headquarters of Premier Provisions, a front company for the Alliance to Restore the Republic. A group of rebel agents heading to Sprawl 34 during the Galactic Civil War were routed to Sprawl 41 instead, as Sprawl 34 had become infected with the Mynock virus. Everyone on board Sprawl 34 was asphyxiated when the Mynock virus caused the computer systems to malfunction. Eventually the virus caused the repulsorlifts to fail, and the entire platform fell into the depths of the planet to be crushed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
