The clones came into conflict with a group of Yalbec while trying to put down the insurrection, and the clone known as Wrecker chopped off the stinger of a Yalbec queen while she was still alive. This triggered several Yalbec males to try and mate with the clones, which the clone Hunter mistook for an attempt to eat them. Fighting the Yalbec delayed the clones in traveling to the planet Anaxes for their next mission. Once they reached the world, Hunter and Wrecker recounted their fight against the Yalbec to the clones CC-2224, CT-5597, CT-6116 and CT-7567, and during the story another Force 99 clone known as Tech corrected Hunter saying that the male Yalbecs were attempting to mate with them instead of trying to eat them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yalbec were first mentioned in \"The Bad Batch\", an episode of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series.
