The band played the song \"Jedi Rocks\" for the Hutt and his court, which Jabba demanded be played again. During the second performance, however, Jabba interrupted the band by dropping his slave dancer Oola into the rancor pit below his throne room, where she was devoured. The band then witnessed Leia Organa enter the palace disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh and claim the bounty on the Wookiee Chewbacca. When Organa later freed the smuggler Han Solo from carbonite, several members of the band were present with Jabba in hiding. The band then traveled on board Jabba's sail barge to the Great Pit of Carkoon, surviving the explosion and breaking up afterward."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Max Rebo Band's name is never spoken in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, the scene they first appear in is titled \"the Max Rebo Band\" in the scene selection menu of the DVD releases."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
