Sometime between 39 and 36 BBY, OOL-2 was deployed to the moon Alaris Prime, which the Trade Federation was trying to colonize illegally. OOL-2 found on Alaris Prime a power core that had been damaged by the moon's gundarks and later completely destroyed by Wookiees from the planet Kashyyyk who were making a legal colonization effort. OOL-2 reported the loss of the power core to the Trade Federation's leader, Nute Gunray, who ordered him to find the gundarks he believed were responsible and kill them. The gundarks were later eradicated from Alaris Prime by the droid army, but the Trade Federation ultimately lost the world to the Wookiees."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "OOL-2 was a B1-Series battle droid that served in the Trade Federation Droid Army. Between 39 BBY and 36 BBY, OOL-2 was sent to Alaris Prime, a moon recently rediscovered by Wookiees from the planet Kashyyyk. The Trade Federation wanted to colonize the moon, but consent to do so had been given to the Wookiees who had found it by the Galactic Senate.

The Trade Federation noticed the damage to the power core and sent OOL-2 to find it. OOL-2 found its ruins and reported its destruction to the Trade Federation's leader, Nute Gunray, mistakenly telling him that gundarks had destroyed the power core. Gunray ordered OOL-2 to find the gundarks that he believed were responsible, kill them, and then sell their pelts to the Trade Federation's Trandoshan allies. The Trade Federation later attacked the gundark nest and eliminated the creatures from Alaris Prime but were eventually driven off the world by the Wookiees."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "OOL-2 stood at 1.91 meters tall, possessed masculine programming, and wielded an E-5 blaster rifle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "OOL-2 first appeared in the 2001 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, voiced by Michael Gough.
