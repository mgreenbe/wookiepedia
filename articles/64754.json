The terrain of Ikkrukk was mostly rocky and mountainous. Grail City was a heavily shielded city built into the side of a mountain on Ikkrukk, which was also defended by orbital and ground-based cannons and hunter-killer droids, most of which were temporarily disabled by sympathizers of the First Order. The planet had its own government, which was led by Prime Minister Grist during the First Order/Resistance War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial Era, the warlord Burnium Ro operated out of a stronghold on Ikkrukk. His use of rhetoric and imagery associated with the Nihil marauders of old, reputed as agents of chaos, led Imperial Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin to send his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Lieutenant Commander Ellian Zahra, on a mission to eliminate Ro due to the threat he posed to Imperial order.

After the Ikkrukkians refused to submit to the First Order, the Maxima-A class heavy cruiser Fortitude attacked Grail City. Several First Order sympathizers disabled the city's defense grid, and killed the engineers who could reactivate them. In Grail City, Prime Minister Grist sent out a distress signal, hoping to receive help from the Resistance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Black Squadron of the Resistance, who had been sent on a mission to find additional allies, had previously failed to convince King Siroc of Pastoria into helping them. They moved onto Ikkrukk, a planet that General Leia Organa had listed as a potential ally. However, when the squadron arrived, they picked up Grist's distress call, and headed for Grail City as they contacted her, informing her that they would help Ikkrukk. Jessika Pava recognized the defense systems as FreiTek Planetary Defense, telling Grist that she could bring it online if she was let through the shield that surrounded the city. The Fortitude detected the incoming fighters, deploying many of its TIE fighters. Pava and Suralinda Javos narrowly made it through a hole the Ikkrukkians had briefly opened in the shield, and met with Grist and her team. During their attempt to reactivate the defense grid, Javos was shot and severely injured by the First Order sympathizers. Despite this, she and Pava managed to fight their way past several of the sympathizers, meeting back up with Grist at the controls for the defense grid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the skies of Ikkrukk, Temmin Wexley and Kar\u00e9 Kun were close to being defeated by the Fortitude and its forces, but Black Leader Poe Dameron, who had received Pava's transmissions of the events and persuaded General Organa to allow him to help, arrived in a starfighter loaned from Grakkus the Hutt. With Dameron's help, Black Squadron bombed the Fortitude with its own TIE fighters, damaging it. At the same time, Grail City's shield was disabled, and the Fortitude prepared to bombard it. However, the shield had been lowered by Pava, Grist and Javos, who had brought Ikkrukk's surface cannons back online. Before the cruiser could fire on the city, it was shot by the reactivated cannons, causing its destruction. After the battle had ended, Grist met with Black Squadron, telling them that Ikkrukk would help the Resistance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ikkrukk first appeared in Poe Dameron 30, a comic written by Charles Soule, illustrated by Angel Unzueta, and published on August 15, 2018."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
