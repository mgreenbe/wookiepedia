Initially, Chief of State Cal Omas believed that the High Council could efficiently govern the galaxy during wartime, and the advisory council did not exist for some time. Sometime before the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, Cal Omas and the Galactic Alliance Senate recreated the Advisory Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The advisory council was designed to be an inner circle of elite senators, intending to keep the Chief of State involved in the affairs of the Senate while conducting the war against the Yuuzhan Vong. Though Omas relied more upon the advice of the High Council during the war, the Advisory Council proved instrumental in reestablishing order throughout the galaxy. The Advisory Council replaced the High Council after the Swarm War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Members"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
