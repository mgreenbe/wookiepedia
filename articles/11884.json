The data holocron was encased in phrik, one of the strongest substances in the galaxy. When the first Death Star destroyed Alderaan, the data holocron was able to survive the superlaser's blast. Shortly after the Evacuation of Yavin, both the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire discovered that the holocron was floating somewhere in the Graveyard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alliance sent a small fleet, under the command of General Han Solo, to the Alderaan system to retrieve the holocron. In turn, the Imperials deployed a fleet of their own and also hired the bounty hunter Boba Fett to find the data holocron. After a small battle, the Alliance recovered the holocron and departed the Graveyard. Admiral Ackbar used the holocron to find Boz Pity, a world on the Outer Rim that would make an ideal base for the Alliance. The Rebels set up a base there until the Empire discovered their location and attacked it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
