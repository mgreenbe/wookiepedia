He, along with fellow pilots Kazuda Xiono and Mia Gabon, were sent on a mission to rendezvous with Commander Poe Dameron of the Resistance in order to deliver intelligence. However, the three pilots were ambushed by Major Elrik Vonreg of the First Order, and he and Gabon were concerned that the mission would fail. Xiono ordered him and Gabon to flee into hyperspace while he covered them, reasoning that the mission could be completed just as well by one pilot, and promising to be right behind them. After the mission, Xiono disappeared and Sion believed he didn't make it. In actuality, he joined the Resistance and became a spy on the supertanker fuel depot Colossus."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Joining the Resistance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sion himself later joined the Resistance during the First Order/Resistance War, flying a T-70 X-wing starfighter and joined Jade Squadron under Commander Venisa Doza."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the blockade of Dantooine, the squadron had been decimated.
