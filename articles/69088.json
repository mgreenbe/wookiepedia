When Vizsla appeared on the battlefield in a large battle transport, Montross ignored Jaster's call for an airlift and jetpacked away, leaving Jaster under a barrage of blaster fire. Montross tried to take control of the Mandalorians and claim the title of Mandalor, saying Jango had been killed trying to save Jaster.
