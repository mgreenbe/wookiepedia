Denid, his betrothed Loren, and his friend Jedidiah crash-landed on this world years ago, a crash that claimed Loren's life. It is now imperative that he returns to Velmor to take the rite of succession or else his younger brother, an Imperial sympathizer, will gain control of the planet.

Zelor also desires the two would-be leaders dead, but for his own personal gain since he would rule the planet if no one of royal blood could take the throne. In the ensuing battle Denid and Leia are wounded by Anod, but Anod himself is killed by Traal. Zelor intends to kill Luke thinking the brash scoundrel would be no match for him with his energy sword, but he doesn't realize that Luke is a skilled swordsman who easily defeats Zelor. But during the duel, Traal has a clear shot at them both but is interrupted by Jedidiah who bravely sacrifices himself to prevent Luke from being captured."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With all of the conspirators either killed or captured, Denid is free to become King of Velmor and pledges to be sympathetic to the Rebellion.
