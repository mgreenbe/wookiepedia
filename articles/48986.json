The Star Destroyer was assigned to patrol the Suolriep sector and frequently handled slaving duties.

However, upon arrival they found the slaver ship not responding any calls and another, unknown ship. Previously to the arrival of the Imperials, a lone Wookiee, Chewbacca had ambushed the slavers and freed the other Wookiees. Nyklas, not taking any chances, ordered Solo and his squadron to disarm and board the slaver ship. After the fight was over, Chewbacca's ship, which had played dead throughout the battle, managed to escaped with half of the Wookiee youths. Chewbacca, wounded from the fight, had remained on the slaver ship, where his unconscious body was found by Lieutenant Solo. Nyklas, furious about the loss of slaves, ordered Solo to kill the Wookiee, an order that Solo refused."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For his behaviour, Solo was reprimanded, but stayed under Nyklas' command and Chewbacca fell into Imperial slavery. On duty rotation to oversee the construction of the Imperial Hall of Heroes on Coruscant, Nyklas constantly whipped Chewbacca and the other Wookiees, until he pushed Solo too far. The young Lieutenant stunned Nyklas, who was about to kill Chewbacca, and escaped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 BBY, the Flanchard was one of the ten Imperial Star Destroyers involved in the Battle of Turkana."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Flanchard first appeared in the second issue of the Chewbacca miniseries, published in 2000, which retold the first encounter between Han Solo and Chewbacca.
