As an Imperial model, the unit had a brusque personality and no means of locomotion. Built in the shape of a cube and deep blue in color, this computer interface unit was capable of processing data that was scanned through a glowing red photoreceptor and interpreted through a vocoder. The probe was equipped with a set of computer probes for interfacing with a variety of networks. The B2-X processors and software had the capability of slicing through some of the most hardened security systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From 2 BBY to 0 BBY, a converted B2-X computer interface unit named Blue Max traveled with Han Solo and Chewbacca on their adventures in the Corporate Sector and Tion Hegemony."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
