Besides a table-service restaurant, it would have included entertainment in the form of alien singers and dancers. The concept included a Twi'lek proprieter and performer who may have also had ties to the underworld. That portion of her back story was given to Oga Garra instead. Various pieces of concept art were created and later released to media outlets, but the venue was ultimately canceled.
