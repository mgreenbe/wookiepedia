The medal was named after a winged predator from the planet Davnar II and was only given to pilots who had performed beyond the call of duty, displaying both skill and bravery in combat. For continued acts of heroism, recipients could earn upgraded classes of the award. Recipients of the Kalidor Crescent and its variations were among the most famed members of the Alliance Military, including Wedge Antilles, Keyan Farlander, Nien Nunb, and Jek Tono Porkins."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kalidor Crescent comprised a large, weighty medallion suspended from a wide ribbon. The intricately engraved medallion was made of gold-plated alloy in the shape of an inverted crescent with a smooth gemstone held at the bottom by the points of the crescent. The design was intended to resemble a kalidor in inverted flight, with its curving wings surrounding the gemstone. The color of the gemstone varied depending on which branch of the Alliance Military the recipient served in, with a green gem used for the Alliance Fleet and Alliance Starfighter Corps and a blue gem used for the Alliance Army. Amber gems were used in the Kalidor Crescent by the time of the New Republic. Engraved on the reverse side of the medallion in Aurebesh were the words \"For Conspicuous Gallantry.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Above the medallion was a royal blue ribbon with a red stripe along both edges which was a single piece for around ten centimeters before splitting in two with each piece ending in half of an alloy clasp. Attached to the ribbon above the medallion was a large likeness of a kalidor made of the same material as the medallion itself. The kalidor was depicted looking to right with its wings spread wide. The medal also came with a longer ceremonial silk ribbon, which was used to place the medal around the recipient's neck. However, the medal was not generally worn for everyday duties and many recipients stored the award in a metal case when not wearing it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For each subsequent award of the Kalidor Crescent to a previous recipient, individuals were given a small embellishment for their existing medal.

The medal was named after the famed kalidor, a winged predator from the planet Davnar II, to commemorate its grace and power. The bird's precise aerial maneuvers represented the standards expected of Rebel starfighter pilots. Although it was originally intended for members of the Alliance Starfighter Corps, the medal's use evolved over time and it came to be awarded to those who served the Alliance in other disciplines, including members of the Alliance Army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Awarded for \"conspicuous and intrepid gallantry at the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty,\" the Kalidor Crescent was the highest honor awarded by the Rebel Alliance, rated above the Corellian Cross and Illudium Star. Nominations for the medal had to be submitted by either one of the recipient's superior officers or a senator or other civilian representative of the Alliance Civil Government. Such was the importance of the award that it only presented by the Alliance's Chief of State, Mon Mothma, or the Supreme Commander of the Alliance Military."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result of the high standards required for nomination, the Kalidor Crescent was usually awarded posthumously. Living recipients of the award were regarded with great respect and achieved a degree of celebrity status among their peers. Living recipients who were still in active service could be awarded the Kalidor Crescent again for further acts of gallantry and heroism. Prior to the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY there were a total of five such further decorations: the Bronze Cluster, the Silver Talons, the Silver Scimitar, the Golden Wings, and the Diamond Eyes. Following the Alliance's victory against the Death Star I at the Battle of Yavin, the Rebels created the Kenobi Medallion as a further enhancement to the Kalidor Crescent. The Kenobi Medallion was only initially awarded posthumously to those who had sacrificed their lives in the fight against the Galactic Empire and was first presented to the casualties among Yavin Base's pilots. The Kenobi Medallion was later presented to surviving personnel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Medal of Alderaan was later commissioned by Mon Mothma to honor specific heroes of the Alliance and held a level of prestige similar to that of the Kalidor Crescent.

By the time he was seventeen, Antilles had become a capable pilot and often worked with the smuggler Booster Terrik. He was aboard Terrik's Pulsar Skate when the pirate freighter Buzzzer attempted to flee a CorSec patrol without disengaging from his parents' refueling platform first. Antilles's parents were killed when the station caught fire. Antilles eventually joined the Rebel Alliance, serving as a pilot in Red Squadron. Based out of Yavin Base, Antilles was one of the few survivors of the Battle of Yavin, getting half a dozen kills during the battle before damage to his X-wing forced him to withdraw."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Yavin, Antilles jointly founded Rogue Squadron with Luke Skywalker, and Commander Antilles took command of the squadron after the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY. At the Battle of Endor, Antilles saw combat against a second Death Star.

Azzameen joined the Alliance as a starfighter pilot, serving aboard the Mon Calamari Star Cruisers Defiance and Liberty, and participating in several battles, including the defeat of the TIE Experimental Project. He later worked with Luke Skywalker, Dash Rendar, and the Bothan Spynet to capture the plans to the Death Star II. When the Alliance attacked the battlestation at the Battle of Endor, Azzameen was assigned to the crew of the Millennium Falcon under General Lando Calrissian. The Falcon played a critical part in the battle, entering the Death Star's superstructure and destroying its reactor core. Azzameen received the Kalidor Crescent at some time during his first year in the Alliance."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Keyan Farlander"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Keyan Farlander was a native of the Outer Rim world of Agamar. After his parents were killed in an Imperial attack, Farlander attended a recruitment rally by Alliance Chief of State Mon Mothma and joined the Alliance Starfighter Corps shortly after the Battle of Turkana.

When the ship was disabled while attempting to escape, Farr found herself as the senior officer out of the 108 surviving passengers and took charge of the situation. Farr decided to use the ship's three escape pods to carry eighteen survivors back to Hoth in the hopes that they could survive until the Alliance came looking for them. Choosing not to go herself, Farr remained aboard the Bright Hope to help the remaining survivors destroy all sensitive data before the Imperials could board and seize it. However, when the bounty hunters Zuckuss and 4-LOM boarded the Bright Hope, Farr was able to convince them to carry the remaining ninety survivors safely to the Rebel underground on Darlyn Boda. Her bravery and initiative under duress led General Carlist Rieekan to award her the Kalidor Crescent, along with a promotion to commander. Her determination to save as many Echo Base personnel as possible was further demonstrated by her request to lead a Special Forces team back to the ice-world in an attempt to recover her comrades from the escape pods."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rey\u00e9 Hollis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rey\u00e9 Hollis was raised on Naboo and became a sergeant in the Alliance Army during the Galactic Civil War.

During the Battle of Hoth, Hollis further distinguished himself by rescuing a squad of Rebel troopers who had been cut off from their comrades, saving two medics from an advancing All Terrain Scout Transport, and was wounded while covering his company's retreat.

After the rise of the Galactic Empire, Kadorto joined the fledgling Rebel Alliance as a pilot, surviving many missions and narrowly escaping death several times in the then-unreliable Rebel starfighters. Kadorto was awarded the Kalidor Crescent for his role in the rescue of Mon Calamari slaves as they waited to be transferred to the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Warrior above Mon Calamari. The Rebels had planned to complete the operation before the Warrior arrived, but its early arrival jeopardized the mission as the Star Destroyer launched TIE/sa bombers to destroy the freighters carrying the slaves and keep them from joining the Rebels. Kadorto responded quickly, singlehandedly eliminating waves of TIEs until Rebel forces could rescue the slaves."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Nien Nunb"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A native of Sullust, Nien Nunb worked as a cargo pilot for SoroSuub Corporation until the company's Imperial allegiances prompted him to quit his job.

With the help of his old friend and prominent member of the Alliance, Sian Tevv, Nunb was accepted into the Alliance Fleet and gained a reputation as one of the Rebellion's most trusted pilots. When the Alliance attacked the Death Star II over Endor, Nunb was selected to copilot the Millennium Falcon with Lando Calrissian. The two took the ship into the unfinished battlestation's superstructure and destroyed its reactor core. Nunb's actions at Endor earned him the Kalidor Crescent. Nunb continued to serve the Alliance after Endor before eventually leaving piloting to take a position as Chief Administrator of the Kessel spice mines, after Calrissian bought the facility.

The displaced people of Bestine were offered a home by the fledgling Rebel Alliance, but most rejected the offer, not wanting to leave their home system. Porkins, however, saw that the Rebellion offered him the chance to strike back at the Empire and hoped to one day return and liberate his homeworld.

Tainer trained as a demolitions expert and served with Page's Commandos under Judder Page before transferring to New Republic Starfighter Command to train as a pilot. Two crash-landings during training, both of which he blamed on mechanical failure, threatened to prevent him becoming a pilot, but he was given an opportunity to revive his career when Wedge Antilles recruited him into Wraith Squadron. Tainer was dismayed to find he would be serving with Wes Janson, whom he still blamed for his father's death. During his time with Wraith Squadron, Tainer was able to overcome the shame he felt about his father, and to accept that Janson was not to blame for what happened."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Wraith Squadron fought a group of pirates operating out of the Blood Nest in the M2398 system, Jesmin Ackbar's X-wing was damaged by enemy fire, leaving her inertial compensator damaged and preventing her from both keeping control of the ship and ejecting to safety.
