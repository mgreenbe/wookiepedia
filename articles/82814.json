One such wand belonged to Logray of Bright Tree Village. It was made of a single piece of wood, approximately the size of an Ewok's arm, adorned with three feathers and a bright white marble. With the artifact, a mere apprentice was able to make a flute dance on the wind and play a tune. The wand also allowed its user to conjure puffs of prism powder that zoomed in the air like miniature comets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Logray's ceremonial wand belonged to Logray, an old Ewok who served as the head shaman of Bright Tree Village during the Galactic Civil War, a galactic conflict fought between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance. Around 3.5 ABY, the young Teebo\u2014Logray's new apprentice\u2014once borrowed the wand without his teacher's permission. He wished to practice magic in the forest, in hopes of impressing his friends Latara, Kneesaa, and Wicket. As Teebo was not a properly trained magician, his spells went wrong quickly. The conjuring of small comets went out of control, causing Latara's flute to fall on the ground and break. Logray's magic wand was also broken in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following this event, Teebo and his friends were lured into the den of Morag, the Tulgah witch. Logray came to the rescue of the young Ewoks and gained the upper hand over Morag, with the help of Teebo. When the battle was over, the old shaman first blamed Teebo for abusing magic, ruining his ceremonial wand and putting the life of his friends in danger. But Logray also recognized his apprentice had relied on himself to get out of trouble as he had been taught, which prompted Logray to forgive Teebo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Logray's wand was created in 1985 for \"Sunstar vs. Shadowstone,\" the ninth episode of the Ewoks animated television series.
