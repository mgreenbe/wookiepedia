This ozone restricted ultraviolet light's ability to pass freely to the surface of a planet. Some planets, such as Af'El, lacked a layer of ozone in their atmosphere. On Af'El, the native Defel adapted to this by developing the ability to see in the ultraviolet spectrum of light."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The contact of a blaster bolt against a lightsaber resulted in the smell of ozone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
