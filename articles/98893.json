It was a type of shutter shield, using overlapping energy fields to combine for greater defense or open up to allow friendly weapons fire and ships to pass through. While more versatile it relied on a decentralized power supply to spread the power load and could not be used to project a defensive shield around an orbiting object. The generator required a crew of eighteen to operate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
