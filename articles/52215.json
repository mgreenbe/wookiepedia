Of course, it's a working vacation. Hoole wants to study the B'omarr monks who live in tunnels beneath the palace. If Jabba isn't enough to give Zak and Tash nightmares, the monks should do it.

This is explained when a brain spider spells out \"IM TASH\" in sand, suggesting that the murderer's brain was placed in Tash's body and that Tash's brain was placed in a spider."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
