A skilled student, he was nevertheless a bully and troublemaker. He was rarely seen outside the company of fellow Padawan Cyrus, and together the two took pleasure in bullying their fellow students at Jedi academy, though they particularly took to bullying Roan. They were sometimes joined in their bullying by a female student named Jo-Ahn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Roan's second year, Cronah befriended Novachez briefly with Cyrus. Cronah then was under Roan's command as Blue Three during the final exam for starfighter pilot training. Along with Cyrus, he ditched Roan during the exam, causing them both to get a C+ for the exam. The two both posted disparaging comments on Holobook, leading Yoda to shut down student access to it for a time. Along with Cyrus, he tortured the class pet Voorpee, stuffing the voorpak in his locker, resulting in the two being placed on academic probation for the next semester and being denied access to Holobook even after it was restored to the other students."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Roan's third year, he got mad that Cyrus had changed and jealous of Roan and thus drifted away from both. He teamed with Ronald Rinzler to secretly prank Roan for the whole year.
