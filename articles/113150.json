In 23 ABY, Jedi trainees Tenel Ka, Lowbacca, and Jacen and Jaina Solo sought refuge in Reef Fortress, which was located on the island, because a bomb had gone off in Fountain Palace, the royal residence of the Queen Mother of Hapes, where they had previously been staying. While there, the youths escaped carnivorous seaweed and killed Bartokk assassins, thereby thwarting Ambassador Yfra's plot to kill the Hapan matriarch, Ta'a Chume, and overthrow the Hapan monarchy. In 25 ABY, a duel was held between Prince Isolder and Archon Beed Thane on Reef Fortress Island. Isolder won the duel, and, as a result, the Hapes Consortium joined the New Republic in the war against the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong invaders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reef Fortress Island was a small island in an ocean on the planet Hapes. It was near Dragon's Teeth, a group of sharp rocks jutting out of the ocean. It was surrounded by reefs and was only accessible by boat. Wild dewberries grew on the island, and it had a small cove that was good for swimming. The island got its name from Reef Fortress, a private shoreside retreat of the Royal Family of Hapes that served as a stronghold in times of emergency, which was located on the island. Near the fortress was a generator station that provided it with power and a deflector shield."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tenel Ka, the Hapan princess, spent some time with her parents on Reef Fortress Island as a young girl. Later, in 23 ABY, Tenel Ka, along with her friends and fellow Jedi trainees Lowbacca, Jacen Solo, and Jaina Solo, sought refuge on the island after a bomb went off in the Hapan matriarch's royal residence, Fountain Palace, where they had been staying. The matriarch's personal ambassador, Yfra, and some Hapan Honor Guards accompanied the youths to the island to watch over and protect them. During their stay there, Tenel Ka, Lowbacca, Jacen, and Jaina spent some time swimming in a small cove that Tenel Ka knew of from her earlier vacations on the island. At the suggestion of Yfra, the friends took a trip out on the ocean in a wavespeeder that she, unbeknownst to them, had programmed to go into an area of dangerous carnivorous seaweed. Yfra hoped to use the seaweed to kill the youths as part of her plot to overthrow the Hapan Royal Family. The young Jedi were able to escape from the seaweed using their lightsabers and knives, and Jaina and Lowbacca manually drove the wavespeeder back to the island."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Ta'a Chume, who was the Hapan matriarch and Tenel Ka's grandmother, arrived at the island in her own royal wavespeeder. That night, Bartokk assassins arrived at the island in an assault craft and invaded Reef Fortress after destroying the deflector shield generator and cutting off power to the fortress. The assassins, who were sent by Yfra to kill the matriarch, trapped Ta'a Chume in her bedchamber. Jacen, Jaina, Lowbacca, and Tenel Ka saved the matriarch by helping her climb out the window of her bedchamber. They then found a small wavespeeder and fled the island, with the assassins following in their assault craft. Jaina and Lowbacca, who were piloting the wavespeeder, decided to drive into Dragon's Teeth in the hope that the assassins would crash on the rocks. After this failed, they steered the wavespeeder into some carnivorous seaweed, which killed the assassins who were following them. Ta'a Chume then drove the wavespeeder to Fountain Palace and arrested Yfra before she could promote herself as the monarch."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25 ABY, Isolder, the Prince of Hapes, and Beed Thane, the Archon of the Inner Rim planet Vergill, which was a member of the Hapes Consortium, participated in an honor duel at Reef Fortress on Reef Fortress Island. Isolder initiated the duel by slapping Thane across the face for insulting New Republic Ambassador Leia Organa Solo and Tenel Ka, who was Isolder's daughter. Isolder won the duel during a sudden death round that the referee had called. As a result of the duel, the Hapes Consortium decided to enter the war against the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong invaders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reef Fortress Island first appeared in Young Jedi Knights: Lightsabers, a young reader's novel by Kevin J.
