But, in Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines, mention is made neither of Teppler nor the Prime Minister position, and he is still listed as being \"Head of State\". However, he is also called \"President\" and referred to as the head of the full Corellian government. Presumably this was the result of editing errors as well as due to Bloodlines having been finished before Betrayal. These errors were retconned near the beginning of Legacy of the Force: Tempest when it was stated that Thrackan had declared himself President of Five Worlds in addition to his position as Head of State of Corellia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
