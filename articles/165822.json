Following the Battle of Yavin, he was a decider of the technology-hating Meatlumps and operated out of the Meatlump Hideout in Coronet City. Around 1 ABY, Ximo Tacx tasked a spacer to rescue a Meatlump trapped in the lower maintenance areas of Coronet's underground tunnels. The spacer descended into the lower maintenance areas and fought a way through hostile S-1 and S-2 security droids. The spacer eventually found the missing Meatlump, trapped by a band of ruffians from the rival Ragtag gang. The spacer killed the Ragtags and successfully brought the Meatlump back to Ximo Tacx."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ximo Tacx appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
