This included life forms, energy emissions, tectonic instability, and other natural and artificial phenomena. Most sensor packs were bulky and handheld, and some were large enough to be handled by two people. Smaller sensor packs were limited to detecting only a single phenomenon, such as a communications signal or life form. Neuro-Saav Technologies manufactured the 8932/D Sensor Pack during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
