He appeared again in Jedi Knight's expansion pack, Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith. Mysteries of the Sith introduced \"multiplayer personalities,\" a form of character creation that put different character models under different professions, with each one having its own set of starting weapons for a match. In the game, Santiago was categorized as a soldier. He also shared the same head model and texture with the multiplayer character Admiral, and his body texture was a slightly modified version of Rugar's. Due to his multiplayer only appearances, Santiago's place in canon is uncertain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
