During the ensuing battle, Skywalker lost several of the BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bombers under his command, but Shadow Squadron was still able to hit the Malevolence and damage its hyperdrive, forcing Grievous to flee and securing the safety of the medical station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
