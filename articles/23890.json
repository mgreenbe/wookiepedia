This ship was based off of the design of the stealth ship used during the Clone Wars. It was captured by the disaffected former Republic Intelligence agent Berch Teller and his rebel cell. Berch used the Carrion Spike in a campaign against Imperial space stations, in which its abilities were unparalleled. Later the ship was abandoned by the rebels at Carida after they discovered their inside source within the Empire, Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit, was planning a betrayal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Darth Vader exposed Rancit's treason, the Carrion Spike was recovered and presumably repaired. By 3 BBY, the ship had been restored and was back in Tarkin's possession. At some point after the Battle of Jakku, the Carrion Spike was discovered in the abandoned Rothana Imperial Shipyards by Terex, who became the leader of the Ranc gang and later an agent of the First Order's Security Bureau. The starship served as Terex's personal transport during his campaign against the Resistance starfighter pilot Poe Dameron and his Black Squadron. The Carrion Spike was destroyed by the First Order after Terex embarked on an unsanctioned campaign to destroy the Resistance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Carrion Spike was designed specifically for and in collaboration with Moff Wilhuff Tarkin by Sienar Fleet Systems and several others. It was triangular-shaped, just under 150 meters in length and heavily armed with turbolasers, ion cannons and proton tubes. The Carrion Spike was based on a prototype Republic IPV-2C Stealth Corvette that had been deployed during the Battle of Christophsis. The Carrion Spike was highly maneuverable in combat and capable of outmaneuvering Imperial warships and starfighters. The ship's weak point was the spine where the main fuselage connected with the aft flare. Only concentrated laser fire while lowering the deflector shields would weaken the structure."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Complement and crew requirements"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Carrion Spike had at least eighteen crew members but could also be crewed by a captain and communications officer. The ship's facilities included a command cabin, an austere main cabin containing a round conference table and six chairs, a vehicle pool for landspeeders that was equipped with a repair bay, and several toilets and showers. The Spike's command cabin led into an afterdeck and the ship's conference cabin. A turbolift connected the conference cabin to the engine room. The engine room could also be accessed by an emergency stairwell in the main cabin. The engine room led to a narrow cofferdam which led to the Carrion Spike's cargo hold. The ship also had an airlock and an outer hatch that could be fully sealed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Engines"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Its Class One hyperdrive made the ship the fastest one in the Imperial Navy, while its state of the art navicomputer allowed the corvette to travel from the Outer Rim to Coruscant without reverting to realspace to retrieve routing data from relay stations or hyperspace beacons. By contrast, less advanced ships had to exit hyperspace to check navigation data while traveling from one system to another. In addition, the Carrion Spike was equipped with powerful ion turbine sublight arrays. The ship's engine room contained a fuel bay that stored the ship's paralight tracker, a HoloNet transceiver that parsed commands from the ship's navigation computer; effectively doubling as a homing beacon."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Stealth, armaments, and other systems"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Carrion Spike's ion turbine, sublight arrays and countermeasures suite were also state of the art. Based on a prototype stealth corvette introduced during the Clone Wars at the Battle of Christophsis, the Carrion Spike was equipped with a cloaking device powered by stygium crystals that was able to render the ship invisible to almost all scanners and the naked eye. The Sith Lord Darth Vader was able to track the ship at some point, but only because he could sense his meditation chamber which was on the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Carrion Spike was equipped with an advanced deflector shield and several laser cannons. By 34 ABY, these cannons could be by battle computers. The Resistance technician Oddy Muva was able to lock the crew out of the ship's control systems on one occasion and use it to destroy Terex's \"Uglies.\" The ship was also equipped with several escape pods. The Carrion Spike's bridge could seat three crew."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Terex's modifications"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The First Order agent Terex installed a luxurious suite aboard the Carrion Spike. He housed several alien slaves, who each served a purpose. The suite house a hologram unit which Terex used to communicate with Captain Phasma. Terex also had a special chamber storing a collection of Imperial helmets and blasters as well as his Ranc gang armor, which was a modified stormtrooper armor set. Terex also could use Authorization Code TK-603 to disable the ship's communications, engines, and weapons systems. The only way to regain control of these systems was to replace the central computer systems, a huge undertaking that could only be done in deep dock. The ship also had an internal communications system which allowed the bridge crew to contact Terex's personal chamber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Wilhuff Tarkin"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Carrion Spike served as the personal transport of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin during the Imperial Era. Following an investigation on Geonosis, Darth Vader met the-then Moff Tarkin on the Carrion Spike above the planet. There he reported his findings to Tarkin and questioned his new project, with Tarkin deducing that he wanted to be the sole technological marvel in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY, Tarkin traveled aboard the Carrion Spike to Coruscant after being summoned for a meeting with Emperor Palpatine. While traveling through hyperspace, Tarkin convened an impromptu inspection of the Imperial officers and enlisted ratings aboard the ship. After discovering that Ensign Baz had been secretly consuming spice in the vehicle pool, Tarkin had him relieved of duty and confined to the crew berth for the remainder of the voyage. He also instructed Commander Cassel to perform a flash inspection of all barrackers and personal lockers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Tarkin met with the Emperor and Darth Vader at the Imperial Palace, the Carrion Spike was berthed at an Imperial Palace landing field. After the Emperor assigned Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader to investigate a communications cache on Murkhana, Tarkin dispatched most of the crew with the exception of the ship's captain and communications officer back to Sentinel Base; Tarkin's posting. Darth Vader brought a contingent of stormtroopers and one of his meditation spheres aboard the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Murkhana, the Carrion Spike landed at a former Corporate Alliance landing field. While Tarkin and Vader visiting the communications cache, the stormtroopers under Sergeant Crest and the crew guarded the ship. The former Republic Intelligence agent\u2013turned\u2013insurgent leader Berch Teller and his rebel cell used their communications equipment to lure the stormtroopers away from the ship. The insurgents then boarded the Carrion Spike and killed the crew before fleeing into hyperspace.

Teller's crew included the Gotal pilot Salikk, the Koorivar operations officer Cala, the Mon Calamari engineer Dr. Artoz, the journalist Anora Fair, and the Zygerrian film director Hask Taff. The shipjackers were either survivors and witnesses of the Antar Atrocity, a mass murder which had been instigated by Tarkin following the Clone Wars. They were secretly supported by Tarkin's rival Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit, who supplied them with weapons, communications equipment, and intelligence on Imperial targets. Rancit wanted to use the rebel insurgency to gain favor with the Emperor and elevate himself to Moff."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tarkin and Vader pursued the Carrion Spike in Faazah's stolen ship Parsec Predator. With the Empire on their tail, Teller brought the Spike to Galidraan III, where the Empire had a space station. Using the ship's stealth systems, the insurgents caught the Imperial defenders by surprise and inflicted heavy casualties on the station's V-wing and ARC-170 starfighters. The Spike also disabled the Parsec Predator but not before the latter inflicted damage on the ship's spine. Before fleeing into hyperspace, the insurgents also destroyed the station's hyperspace buoy and jettisoned Lord Vader's meditation chamber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The insurgents then attacked TaggeCo's mining facilities on Lucazec. Anora and Hask produced holovids of the attack that were streamed on HoloNet. With the Carrion Spike running low on fuel, Teller's dissidents traveled to Phindar in the Mandalore sector; one of the few places that could support the corvette's unique fuel requirements. Rancit had warned the insurgents that the Empire was waiting for them at Gromas in the Perkell sector. Despite Teller impersonating an Imperial officer, the Phindar administrator managed to alert Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader to the ship's presence. Following a brief dogfight, the insurgents destroyed the orbital tanker by detonating a concealed explosive device before fleeing into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Carrion Spike sustained significant damage to its hull and exterior lights as a result of the Phindar dogfight. Part of the ship's rectenna array had also been ripped way by a tractor beam. Most of the electronic appliances in the galley and medical bay were destroyed. Parts of the ship were inaccessible due to air lock damage and radiation leaks. While the ship's weapons and stealth systems, sensor suite, hyperdrive, and navicomputer still functioned, the shield generators were only functioning at 50 percent capacity. After examining the ship's engine room, Artoz discovered that the Imperials had been tracking the Carrion Spike using the ship's paralight tracker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To put the Empire off their scent, Teller transmitted hyperspace coordinates claiming that the Carrion Spike was traveling to the Obroa-skai system. Teller also got the Lantillies information broker and fellow insurgent Knotts to send the YT-1000 freighter Reticent as a decoy. Later, the insurgents used the Carrion Spike to attack the Imperial facility in the Nouane system. However, Vice-Admiral Rancit had dispatched reinforcements to bolster Imperial facilities across the galaxy. The Spike was repulsed by lasers and barely managed to escape into hyperspace. As a result, the ship sustained considerable damage to its systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Realizing that Rancit had double-crossed them, Teller's insurgents abandoned the Carrion Spike and transferred to Teller's modified Providence-class Dreadnought. They then set the Carrion Spike on autopilot to Carida under the pretext of attacking the Imperial Academy there. To cover his collusion with the insurgents, Rancit attempted to destroy the Carrion Spike with the Secutor-class Star Destroyer Conquest's laser cannons. However, Lord Vader exposed Rancit's treason and stopped him from destroyed the Carrion Spike. After Vader had executed Rancit, Tarkin repossessed his damaged corvette. Tarkin then defeated Teller's insurgents as they were ambushing an Imperial convoy near the Gulf of Tatooine.

Terex, along with the former stormtrooper Corlac, had joined a criminal organization called the Ranc gang. Terex was determined to restore the Old Empire and recognized the Carrion Spike as Tarkin's former flagship. He set about repairing the ship's engines, life support, cloaking device, surveillance, and weapons. Using the ship's surveillance systems, he was able to eavesdrop on a conversation between Corlac, Bett, and Wenda.
