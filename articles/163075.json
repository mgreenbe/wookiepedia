Along with fellow Watcher Seven and Watcher Nine, she was a new-generation Watcher - the latest achievement of the eugenics program that made their skills superior even to that of Watcher Two and Watcher Five. However, this later proved a liability when the Star Cabal targeted Imperial Intelligence. In the holorecording of Cabal meeting that Cipher Nine retrieved from Belsavis was hidden a signal fine-tuned to affect eugenically-bred Watchers, which put every Watcher present in the Intelligence Headquarters - including Watcher Six and the current Keeper in deep coma, dealing the first of a series of serious blows to the organization."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
