They moved to Wetyin's Colony around 10 BBY, bringing freighters loaded with grain seed and nerf embryos, and were later virtually abandoned due to the shifting budgets of the Galactic Empire's ministries. The colonists continued searching for a new homeworld. One scout, Lile Gorsek, investigated Betshish as a possible location; however, the discovery of a native sentient species on the planet voided his claim. A second location mooted by Gorsek was Yavin 4, shortly after the Battle of Yavin. At some point between 4 and 6 ABY, the space around Wetyin's Colony was incorporated into the empire of Zsinj, and it remained within the territory until Zsinj's death in 8 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
