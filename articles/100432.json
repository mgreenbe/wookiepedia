The tambic gas in the atmosphere caused a violet snow to fall, even in warmer regions; because of its low freezing point, this precipitation then turned to a fog which filled the valleys and city streets.

Forming local governments, these people kept their world isolated from the greater galaxy for some time, before ultimately electing to form a united planetary government and join the Galactic Republic. While the Ontothon's presented a united front and hoped to open trade opportunities by striking an agreement with the Daa Corporation, the Fylari people reject this contract based on the incursion on the land surrounding the ruins of the ancient Zeffo Temple. Before hostilities could erupt, the locals asked for the Republic to intervene. While Republic officials were dispatched, a crisis in the Bunka system waylaid them, causing the Jedi High Council to offer to mediate a peaceful resolution to the dispute over land rights."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dispatching Jedi Master Eno Cordova and his Padawan Cere Junda to oversee the process, the High Council hoped that Cordova's interest in ancient cultures would prove useful on the mission. As the Jedi arrived in Ontotho City Spaceport to meet with Dylanto Daa of Daa Corporation, the delegation traveled to the Fylar region where the independent nation agreed to receive the mediators. As the Jedi traveled in an armored convoy through the Fylar Forest, they were besieged by armed combatants, separating Junda from her Master, whom she presumed dead in the attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Junda awoke in a cell within the Fylari nation, where the Fylari leader Neralli explained that her people had rescued Junda from the wreckage of the ruined convoy and hoped to understand who had attacked the delegates.
