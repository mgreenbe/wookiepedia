Circa 1 ABY, Daramus needed a new place to conduct his research but was short of funding. He finally found an abandoned bunker near the city of Kor Vella but the building was overrun by fiendish durnis. The scientist luckily met a spacer who visited the bunker while investigating an assassination attempt on Deel Draav, the mayor of Kor Vella. Daramus proposed to pay the spacer to rid the place of the creatures and the spacer accepted. The scientist was eventually able to start setting up his equipment and turn the bunker into a laboratory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lejo Daramus appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
