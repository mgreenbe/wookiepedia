The game faces two Jedi Knights off against each other in a special arena. Each opponent tries to block laser blasts from a training remote with their lightsaber, and redirect them back towards the other, thereby knocking out their shield. The first Jedi to receive three hits loses. According to the rules, the winner gains the rank of Jedi Master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Early materials from Parker Brothers list a version of the game for Intellivision intended for release in June 1983, but the game was never produced."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Publisher's summary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Are you the JEDI MASTER?

The two characters, protected by shields face each other in a small arena, with a training remote (called \"seeker\" in the manual and promotional material) in the middle. The remote fires laser bolts at the players, who should avoid their shield from being hit, which would eventually result in damage, by deflecting the bolt. Also, they control, together with the angle of their lightsaber, the angle of shots that the remote takes in their rival's direction, which they should angle trying to damage their shield. As a hole is carved into one's shield, bolts may pass through it, and hit them. Once they are hit three times, they lose the game."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An important part of the game is that every once in a while the remote goes \"wild\", rapidly shooting bolts in random directions, independently of the commands the players give it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Marketing"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The game was marketed with a flyer titled \"Scott Grayson, Doctor by day, Jedi Master by night\", which presented a photograph of a glasses-wearing man wielding a lightsaber and described how Dr. Scott Grayson, when back home in the evening, transformed into a mighty Jedi Master by the power of the game, ready to challenge everyone.
