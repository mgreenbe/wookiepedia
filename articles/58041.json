The guns worked by releasing an electromagnetic wave field which disabled the victim's thought processes. Once affected, the victim would follow any simple command given, even blatantly suicidal ones. In fact, the Gun of Command was used as a form of execution, where the condemned male (no females were executed on Hapes under any circumstances) would be shot with the weapon, then handed a blaster and ordered to take his own life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A rifle version developed by Royal Armaments Guild of Charubah turned up on Kabal around 0 ABY, in the possession of Cecil Noone, who had stolen the weapon and was trying to sell it to the Krish hunter Tyro Viveca.
