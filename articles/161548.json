Darth Malak was equipped with a vocoder attachment that served to replace his severed jaw, as was Darth Vader almost 4,000 years later. In Vader's case, the vocoder served to enhance what little speaking ability he had left after his vocal cords were scorched on Mustafar. Wat Tambor also used such a device, although he was shown to have to frequently adjust it using attachments on his metal suit as one would tune a radio."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A transliterator was a similar device.
