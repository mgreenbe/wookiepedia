During the High Republic Era, inventor Avon Starros' astromech droid J-6 was equipped with a force field umbrella, which she used to shield Avon and her new friend Honesty Weft from acid rain after they were stranded on the moon Wevo. Many umbrellas dotted the streets of Black Spire Outpost on Batuu, especially to protect off-worlders not used to too much heat. Specialized umbrellas also existed which could be used as floating parachutes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
