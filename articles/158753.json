The sword was extended in both blade and hilt length compared to other models of vibrosword, and as such were also heavier. The hilt allowed for the weapon to be wielded with two hands, giving the user greater control and resulting in many skilled swordsman favoring the weapon. The sword equalled a vibro-ax in terms of hitting power, and despite its weight and size was well balanced enough to parry with. The weapon cost 900 and during the war was rare enough that it was hard to find."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The VX Vibro-greatsword was first mentioned in Dangerous Covenants a sourcebook released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2014 for Star Wars: Edge of the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
