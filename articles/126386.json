It was spread around the inner rim of access hatches. Then, a detonator was placed on a section of the paste, lighthing it. It then burned all around the hatch, allowing pressure difference to blow it in. It was used by the Imperial freighter Darkhawk when boarding a freighter over the planet Batuu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
