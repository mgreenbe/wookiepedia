The B2-AA was built with a more advanced jetpack than their B1-A counterparts which allowed them to travel longer distances but required the use of an incredibly volatile fuel. This resulted in the droid often exploding upon being destroyed which effectively gave them a self-destruct function. Aside from the integrated jetpack, B2-AA's mostly shared all features of the B2s including a pair of wrist blasters, durasteel plating and an integrated comlink."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "B2-AAs were mainly used in space combat by the Separatist forces during the Clone Wars and specialized in boarding and capturing Republic vessels, often being used in place of Droch-class boarding ships. Released in waves from Separatist starships, they would take part in space combat with Republic fighters and then break through the target's shields and outer defenses before securing the interior of the ship and neutralising the crew. The droids were also occasionally used in combat on planet's surfaces where they would be used as advanced raiding parties before attacks from BX-series droid commandos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "B2-AA air assault battle droids were created as enemies for player characters to fight in the Wizards of the Coast Saga edition Roleplaying game supplement book Galaxy at War by authors Rodney Thompson, Gary Astleford, Eric Cagle and Daniel Wallace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
