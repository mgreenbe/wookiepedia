Though they were rare, at least one was held in a biofarm on Thannt. Doctor Cornelius Evazan, evading his many death sentences, infiltrated the biofarm and stole a pluripleq, wearing it on his face to disguise himself and using the name \"Lopset Yas.\" While Evazan was a prisoner aboard Accresker Jail, the pluripleq was detected when \"Lopset\" and Chelli Aphra were scanned by Dek-Nil, but the extra lifeform was put down to a technological error. When the shapeshifting abilities of the pluripleq were accidentally revealed to Aphra, Evazan pretended that he was a changeling himself. He later used the pluripleq to disguise himself as Princess Leia Organa while hiring Nokk and Winloss to hunt down Aphra and 0-0-0, but Nokk could tell that it was a disguise."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pluripleq first appeared\u2014as the face of \"Lopset Yas\"\u2014 in the 2018 canon comic Doctor Aphra 20, written by Simon Spurrier and illustrated by Kev Walker.
