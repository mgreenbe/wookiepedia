The destination was to be the ice planet of Hoth, with planned activities including skiing on Hoth's icy slopes, exploring various ice caverns as well as touring Echo Base, and Tauntaun riding. C-3PO, at the time working on preparations for the StarSpeeder 3000 Transport 22 when seeing this message, stated that he did not want to return to the planet while disparagingly referring to it as an \"iceberg,\" with R2-D2 arguing that it had gotten safer since the last time they've been there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
