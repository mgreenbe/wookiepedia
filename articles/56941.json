During the Clone Wars, he was hired by the Trade Federation to kidnap Chi Eekway Papanoida and Che Amanwe Papanoida, the daughters of Chairman Papanoida, but was forced by the chairman to lead him and his son Ion to them. He was occasionally hired by crime lord Jabba the Hutt for various mercenary jobs, including the capture of Han Solo, who killed the luckless Rodian."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally hailing from the swamp planet of Rodia, during his youth, Greedo relocated and lived on the desert planet of Tatooine. After the slave boy Anakin Skywalker won the famous Boonta Eve Classic, beating the renowned Dug racer Sebulba, Greedo jumped to the conclusion that he had cheated. Angered by the false accusation, Skywalker consequently found himself entangled in a fight with the young Rodian. The fellow young Rodian Wald warned Greedo that if he continued to pick on fights, he would eventually meet with a bad end."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Criminal career"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the Clone Wars, Greedo was employed to Jabba the Hutt as a bounty hunter. At some point in the war, he and another mercenary were hired by the Trade Federation to kidnap Chairman Papanoida's daughters, Che Amanwe and Chi Eekway, to use as leverage for Pantora to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In the ensuing struggle, Che struck Greedo with an idol, covering its base with the Rodian's green blood. After finding this blood sample while investigating his daughter's kidnapping, Chairman Papanoida and his son Ion tracked the bounty hunter to Jabba's Palace and presented the evidence to Jabba, who then forced Greedo to bring the Pantorans to the cantina in Mos Eisley where Che was being held. In the ensuing firefight, Greedo managed to slip away while the family gunned down the rest of Che's captors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Obi-Wan Kenobi's exile to Tatooine in the Imperial Era, Greedo was confronted by a blaster-armed Sullustan down the backalley of Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, while continuing his work for Jabba, Greedo captured Figrin D'an of Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes and delivered him to Jabba, after which D'an and his band entered into indentured servitude under Jabba, due to D'an being in heavy debt to him. During their time there, the group kept tabs on Greedo using their superior hearing abilities, seeing how he would bring in small-time criminals, help them to escape, then bring them back to re-collect the bounty. At one point, they discovered Greedo bringing in one unfortunate Jawa three times. Upon gaining enough money to free themselves, the band told Jabba of these events, which made him furious. This resulted in a grudge between Greedo and the band."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later Greedo was hired by Jabba to eliminate InterGalactic Banking Clan Vice Chairman Anolo on Mygeeto and acquire his Givin codebreaker. There, Greedo, Barada, and several of Jabba's thugs led an assault against the Vice Chairman and his guards. Greedo was able to kill Anolo and put the codebreaker into Anolo's Office. In the office, Greedo used Anolo's lightsaber to make his escape with the Givin. However, Greedo was unable to capture the Givin and it fell to its death. Greedo returned to Tatooine and went on his knees before Jabba at his palace. Greedo offered the lightsaber to Jabba, but the Hutt refused it and faced Greedo with the prospect of becoming the rancor Pateesa's food. However, Greedo was saved when the antiques collector Dok-Ondar offered to buy the lightsaber from Jabba."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Chalmun's Cantina"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Collecting debts"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While at the Mos Eisley Cantina, Greedo attempted to collect money owed to him by Bith musician Lirin Car'n, bringing Cornelius Evazan and Ponda Baba as backup. However, Car'n was unable to pay as he had been robbed the previous night. Greedo allowed Car'n to live, raising his interest rate and giving him until next week to pay up, believing Car'n to be a waste of his time."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Death"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Greedo hunted Han Solo for the bounty Jabba placed on his head after the smuggler dropped a large shipment of illicit cargo owned by the Hutt to avoid Imperial arrest. Greedo was humiliated briefly at the Mos Eisley cantina when he was tripped by a piece of the instrument used by Ickabel G'ont, a member of the Model Nodes. He decided to ignore the insult, seeing payback against Solo as sweeter than revenge on the Nodes. Upon entering the cantina, Greedo saw its bartender, Wuher, ordering the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 to leave the premises. While the Rodian steeled himself mentally for the encounter, he thought about how his former lover Uncelta fell for Solo only to have the smuggler break her heart."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While at the bar, Greedo saw Baba lose an arm to the lightsaber of Obi-Wan Kenobi due to assaulting Luke Skywalker, an event at which he merely laughed. However, this prevented Baba and Evazan from assisting Greedo, as had been previously planned, forcing the Rodian to improvise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Greedo challenged Solo at the Mos Eisley Cantina, where, threatening Solo with his gun, he demanded that he pay the money to Jabba or to Greedo himself; or hand over Solo's legendary starship, the Millennium Falcon. When Solo replied that he would rather die than give up his ship, Greedo said that was indeed the idea before announcing that it was something he had been looking forward to for a long time. As Greedo pulled his trigger and said that he would end with him, Solo shot Greedo dead from beneath the table with his readily prepared blaster. Greedo missed Solo completely and the last thing that Greedo ever saw was a flash of bright light with a memory of bitter injustice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a boy, Greedo was noted for his temper and tendency to pick fights with others, which his friend Wald warned would lead to trouble. In adulthood, Greedo was overconfident and slow on the uptake, and something of a poor shot with a blaster. He thought highly of himself as a \"big time\" bounty hunter due to his employment to Jabba the Hutt, even believing himself more prestigious than Boba Fett, though others saw him as unremarkable. He was a frequent customer of Chalmun's Cantina, considering it his base of operations and preferred venue for death deals. He was known for rotten luck, and that proved true for the majority of his life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Greedo first appeared in the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, the first installment of the Star Wars original trilogy. He was played by Paul Blake and voiced by Larry Ward. In the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode \"Sphere of Influence,\" Greedo was voiced by Tom Kenny."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Blake played Greedo in the shots that feature both Greedo and Han Solo in the same frame. For Greedo's close-ups, a new articulated head was built for pickups at the end of the shoot, and Maria De Aragon was enlisted to play the Rodian. During pickups, Greedo's costume vest changes significantly, as do his hands. In the original shoot, Greedo has long, suction-cup tipped fingers, and in pickups, he has swollen knuckles and shorter fingers. The Greedo mask and tunic are currently on display as part of the \"Out of this World: Extraordinary Costumes from Film and Television\" in the Science Fiction Museum & Hall of Fame in Seattle, Washington. On the other hand, while Ward did provide little bits of Greedo's voice, Blake also provided some of words as well, which were later scrambled electronically, but none of their voice work was done at Elstree Studios. According to Blake, however, Greedo was just referred as \"The Alien\" in the script."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Greedo's manner of death has been subject to a number of retcons over the years. The most famous involves the question of who shot first, for in the original release of the film, as well as the script, Greedo did not shoot at Han at all. In the 1997 re-release of the film, Greedo gets a badly-aimed shot at Solo before Solo kills him. George Lucas has said that this change is to enhance Solo's overall heroism, making him seem less of a killer and more of a \"cowboy\" to viewers. This was a controversial decision and in the 2004 version the two shots are almost simultaneous, with Greedo shooting first. In A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy, there is no mention of Greedo firing a shot and author Alexandra Bracken, when asked, stated that Solo fired before Greedo could get off a shot. The 2019 release of A New Hope on Disney+ depicted Greedo saying one last word before being shot by Han, an alteration inserted by Lucas before selling Lucasfilm Ltd. to The Walt Disney Company in 2012. However, Greedo's voice work wasn't reused footage from Blake."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1999, Greedo made a cameo appearance in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, in a deleted scene where he accuses Anakin Skywalker of cheating in the Boonta Eve Classic, leading Qui-Gon Jinn to separate them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the From a Certain Point of View short story \"The Luckless Rodian,\" Greedo is said to have never seen a lightsaber in person, only having heard stories of the weapon. The comic Galaxy's Edge 2 contradicts this, showing Greedo's theft of Ki-Adi-Mundi's lightsaber.
