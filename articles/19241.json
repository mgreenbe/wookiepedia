It was based around Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, specifically elements relating to the Boonta Eve Podrace. Almost every single card released in this set is bordered yellow. Also, new Light Side Podracer pilots were added into the mix. A new \"objective\" card was added in as well, the Boonta Eve Podrace. This featured Podracing, in which the players could compete using pods and pilots to win. Players could put \"Thrust\" cards on their podracers, using the destiny numbers from 1-6. Once they achieved a 6, then they put a \"lap\" token on the objective card, clear the \"thrust\" cards and start a new lap. First player to complete 3 laps, wins the game automatically (regardless of the planet in play, or where the players are at with their deck, see victory conditions on the main Young Jedi Collectible Card Game page)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This expansion contained 60 cards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Card types"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Card list"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External Links"}]}
