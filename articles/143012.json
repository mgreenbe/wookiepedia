Written by Abel G. Pe\u00f1a and Rich Handley, it was initially conceived by the two around 2003, and finally published \"after a decade of marinating.\" Part 1 was released on June 13, 2013, and Part 2 was released on July 5, 2013."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The articles detail the adventures of C-3PO and R2-D2 in the years between Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, as first told in Star Comics' 1986 Star Wars: Droids comic series, Nelvana's 1985\u20131986 Star Wars Droids animated series, and Dark Horse Comics' 1994\u20131997 Star Wars: Droids comics. Other reference works, such as C-3PO: Tales of the Golden Droid and The New Essential Guide to Characters, have also been drawn upon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pe\u00f1a and Handley introduced new Star Wars Legends material via the articles, such as previously unrevealed species, starship, and character names; specific chronology regarding the droids' transitions from one master to another has also been established. Some new material, such as the character of Sonko Fromm, originated in a children's book simply titled Droids that was published by Plaza Joven exclusively in Spain. Pe\u00f1a and Handley have also related some of the droids' adventures to other works of Star Wars literature, such as the 1992 young-readers' novel The Glove of Darth Vader. Pe\u00f1a and Handley also expanded on previously established events. For instance, the blog's first part specifically identified the Lok Revenants as the pirate group that attacked the Tantive IV in the Maramere system and thus forced the Alderaanean corvette to abandon the droids, when they had previously been unnamed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Part 1 definitively establishes the Star Comics as taking place chronologically prior to the animated series.\nPe\u00f1a and Handley originally had them reversed, but they changed their minds after Pe\u00f1a discussed the timeline with some members of the Jedi Council Forums. Some major last-minute reshuffling was required. Part 2, implied to be the final entry, also confirmed the canonicity of the MyComyc serials Sabotaged Droid and Troublesome Outing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
