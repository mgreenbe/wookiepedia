Four such platoons formed a company."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among the clone commandos of the Special Operations Brigade, however, the equivalent unit was a troop consisting of five four-man squads and just twenty men."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were also platoons of twenty-four troopers in the Army."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Galactic Empire"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Army"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Imperial Army, the basic structure of the standard platoon remained very close to what it had been in the GAR: four squads, each consisting of eight men plus a sergeant, with four platoons forming a company; but whereas under the Republic the platoon's commanding Lieutenant had been included within the 36-man detail, he was now supernumerary along with a Sergeant Major who served as platoon adjutant, for a total of thirty-eight personnel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A platoon was the smallest unit authorized to request fire support from friendly artillery, although typically these requests first had to go through the unit's parent battalion headquarters, which either allocated resources or passed the request higher up the chain of command. If there was time before a battle to plan a battalion commander might assign an artillery section under his control to a specific platoon, a process known as \"grafting\" which guaranteed the platoon immediate fire support upon request. Additionally a large number of platoons could be \"grafted\" to a single artillery or armor company, with the company commander allocating fire support requests as he saw fit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Army platoons could be augmented as per their Order of Battle (OB), however whereas larger units adhered to this doctrine more closely in practice there was more flexibility when augmenting platoons. Where possible the organizational chart was followed but it was quite common for commanders to swap men and equipment between different platoon types. Equipment was often over-ordered at the company level and reinforcements assigned to the wrong unit were \"adopted\" by their new unit. The result was that platoons were the least standardized unit in the Imperial Army, with some packing as much firepower as an entire company."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Line Platoon"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The line platoon was the standard light infantry formation of four line squads for a total of 38 troopers. Prior to combat, the lieutenant was suppose to assign his sergeant major to the squad that would come under the most pressure, and move between squads as the battle dictated. In practice this tended to result in a very short lifespan for the lieutenant, with those who survived falling into two general types. The first were the more pragmatic lieutenants who stayed with one squad during combat and commanded the platoon through their comlink and other less-sophisticated communication methods. The second were simply quite tough.

This could just be a single medium repeating blaster detail, or up to three medium repeating blaster or two heavy repeating blaster details.

In combat the lieutenant's vehicle operated from where he could best direct the platoon while the sergeant major's was assigned to the lead squad.

In addition these squads were often split in equal sub-units, containing troopers of all squads for greater flexibility, and could be cross-attached to other units.
