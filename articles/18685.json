In 7 ABY, he was ordered to rendezvous with the Night Caller and come aboard for an inspection and meeting with Captain Zurel Darillian. Though Nabyl did not know it, these orders caused Wraith Squadron's Mission to Storinal, which resulted in the crew of the Hawkbat contracting Bunkurd Sewer Disorder and being quarantined. Nabyl was unable to meet with \"Darillian\" in person and his crew effected the transfer of supplies in vacuum suits, with no one from either ship meeting face to face."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
