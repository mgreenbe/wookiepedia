The Junction had two levels of tracks, one above the other. Although most of the Junction was exposed to the air, some portions of the track ran through buildings, which contained dedicated tunnels for the trams to pass through."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A major thoroughfare was located between the tram stations of the Imperial war camp in Labor Valley, Blastfield Shipyards, Axial Park North, and the Incorporation Islands Tram Station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Junction was able to function even when divided between two opposing factions, with the thoroughfare subdivided for trams to change lines amongst their belonging faction's portion of the transport system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Long before the Galactic War, the city-wide tram rail network had become too complex for manual control, leading to the handover of the Junction's direction to dedicated droids. As a result of this high level of automation, some Corellians wondered if the tram network was truly safe, though the only recourse would be reducing the functionality of the entire system."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Utilization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Forces of the reconstituted Sith Empire used Coronet Junction to transport themselves throughout Coronet City, quickly establishing an Imperial occupation that took root in many of the city's districts. In 3640 BBY, an Imperial hero utilized the rocket trams for transportation in Coronet City. At the time, the Empire speculated that their plans for conquering Corellia would be at an end if not for the Junction's rocket trams."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Symbolising Corellia's economic and industrial power as well as its commitment to a relatively clean urban environment, the Junction was a low-cost and effective transportation, becoming one of Corellia's most popular services prior to the Galactic War. As such, corporations competed in adding their own resources to the rapid public transit system and securing advertisement space within its trams through viciously-earned contracts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the reconstituted Sith Empire's invasion of Corellia, Coronet Junction was taken by Imperial forces, who used it to transport themselves throughout Coronet City, spreading their presence. However, such reliance on the rocket tram system led to the anti-Empire Corellian Engineering Corporation's exploitation of the Imperials' plans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thus, Darth Charnus, whose master was the mastermind and leader of the Imperial invasion, recruited a well-known Empire-aligned individual to sabotage the Corellian resistance's counterstrikes. Tasked to bring down Corellian Engineering Corporation, the strike force sent by Darth Charnus eventually succeeded in securing Coronet Junction for the Sith, and went on to lead Imperial forces on the world with the use of the Junction's rocket trams."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this time, the Green Line rocket tram track in Axial Park was used by the Galactic Republic to move their troops. Thus, the Empire hired the Advozse demolitionist Kapp Zyman to destroy the tram line."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Coronet Junction first appeared in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Junction serves as the in-game transport system for the world of Corellia. Players could board rocket trams from stations placed throughout Coronet City, traveling through Coronet Junction to other stations. The price to travel through one station is 375 credits, and players may only take the rocket tram on the upper track. Additionally, players are limited to only a portion of the Coronet Junction's lines, and players could only travel to stations controlled by their own faction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: The Old Republic, all players could use Coronet Junction's rocket tram system regardless of their current progression in-game. This contradicts the mission \"Corporate Warfare,\" in which Darth Charnus says to the Imperial player: \"You're trapped here as long as the rocket trams are down,\" referring to the Empire's portion of the Junction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the concept art for Coronet Junction depicts one rocket tram on both the upper and lower tracks, with the two facing opposite directions, no rocket trams run on the lower track in the game itself, and rocket trams on the upper track go in whichever direction their destinations lie."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
