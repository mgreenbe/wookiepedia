In 19 BBY, Thrawn and a pilot named Che'ri were assigned a mission to retrieve something for the Chiss Ascendancy. They would encounter Jedi General Anakin Skywalker above the planet of Batuu. Later on, Thrawn would get what he came for, shield technology on Mokivj, and would help Skywalker defeat the Separatist-Duke Solha, who was mining for cortosis, a rare metal that resist lightsabers and would be used against the Jedi. Solha would be defeated, and the mine would detonate due to Skywalker blowing up the mines, resulting in catastrophic failure.
