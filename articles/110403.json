Covered in brown plating, they stood 1.1 meters tall, had two arms that each ended in a hand with three clawed digits, and moved around on two wheels located at the base of their bodies. RICs had the same body type as tour guide droids. A rickshaw droid known as RIC-920 worked in Mos Espa, a port city on the planet Tatooine, shortly before the First Battle of Geonosis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The RIC-series general labor droid first appeared in 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.
