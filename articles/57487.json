This is due to the fact that he modified his TIE interceptor by adding life support systems. Apart from the life support systems, his interceptor also featured longer wingtip laser cannon barrels which might be due to the fact that he upgraded them. The chin laser cannon hard points are missing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
