It was designed to act and move like an amphistaff. The training amphistaff shot dye instead of venom, and instead of hitting an opponent it would simply give them a shock. It was realistic enough that when Corran Horn walked in on Solo training against a droid wielding one and shot it, thinking that Solo was actually under attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
