A member of a prominent trading family, she became bored with her life and sought adventure and excitement. Even Marelle became a journalist, working for the Galactic Resorts holomagazine. Traveling the resort worlds of the galaxy, Marelle used her position to aid in her other career choice; a jewel thief. On assignment, she would use her cover to case targets and individuals.

Early in her career as a thief, an incident caused people to believe that the Tombat was male. Marelle did nothing to correct the mistake, and actively encouraged the misconception as it amused her. She found the ruse useful for evading capture and suspicion as authorities were always searching for a man. The Tombat became an infamous figure in the galaxy, known as a superb jewel thief who was invisible and could bypass any defense or security system and take whatever he wanted without a trace. Stories told of his prowess with woman, and his ability to captivate females. The Tombat always left behind a single quella stone in place of the items stolen as a signature. By the early part of the Galactic Civil War, arrest warrants were issued in 30 star systems for the Tombat. At some point, Tombat was rumored to have broken into Noval Garaint's base in the Kheedar system and discovered that the bounty hunter had rebuilt and reprogrammed the chassis of a half dozen F1 exploration droids to serve as bodyguard units."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Marelle was not concerned with any cause apart from her own, that changed in 0 BBY with the destruction of her homeworld by the Galactic Empire.
