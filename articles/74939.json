He handled most of the coordination for the agricultural area east of the Karrish mountain range, a good-sized region that was called the second most important on the planet. His role was a partially hereditary role that dated back to the days of the old Sultaries. Having dealt with Luke before, Cirali, on one occasion, let the couple stay at his retreat in a cave at the base of Karrish Prime. His retreat was formerly the Third Sultara's and was called the finest in the sector. Cirali had specially furnished the retreat with Mara's favorite things before their arrival, such as velanie flowers and kithra sonatas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kei Ras Cirali was created by author Timothy Zahn for the short story Judge's Call.
