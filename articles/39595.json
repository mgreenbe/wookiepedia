After Padm\u00e9 Amidala's term as queen of Naboo ended and she accepted the role of representing Naboo in the Galactic Senate, Typho recommended Dorra as a potential new handmaiden."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Separatist Crisis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dorm\u00e9 traveled with Amidala to Coruscant to vote in the Senate on the Military Creation Act, an act that called for the creation of an army for the Galactic Republic to combat the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Amidala got another handmaiden, Cord\u00e9, to be a decoy. However, Amidala's ship was attacked by the bounty hunter Zam Wesell, killing Cord\u00e9 and several others. Dorm\u00e9 went with Amidala when she went with the Loyalist Committee to discuss this attempt with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. During this meeting, Palpatine told Amidala she must hide on Naboo, despite her protests. Dorm\u00e9 was later present when Amidala was reunited with Anakin Skywalker, who promised to find whoever was trying to kill Amidala. After another attempt on Amidala's life, Dorm\u00e9 ran into Amidala's room and asked if she was all right. This made both the Jedi Council and Senate agree that Amidala was safer on Naboo. Later, Amidala was put on a transport along with Dorm\u00e9, Skywalker, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and Typho that took them to a spaceport in order for Skywalker and Amidala to travel as refugees back to Naboo. When Amidala said she had to leave and that Typho would protect Dorm\u00e9, Dorm\u00e9 assured Amidala that he'd be safe with her. Seeing a tear roll down Dorm\u00e9's cheek, Amidala assured Dorm\u00e9 she'd be fine. Dorm\u00e9 then said she wasn't worried about herself, but was worried that the killer would find out that Amidala had left Coruscant, with Amidala responding that her Jedi protector would have to prove how good he was."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Amidala gone, she helped in the Galactic Senate by settling Naboo's affairs.

When she told her she had other security, she said that Typho would be there but Dorm\u00e9 was not. She said that even though she had other handmaidens, she wanted her. Tano ended up accepting and saved her life after Cato Parasitti tried to kill her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dorm\u00e9 later accompanied Amidala on a mission to Clabron to planet Clabron. Initially, she was responsible for piloting Amidala's starship to their destination before the Senator insisted she take over, explaining that she desired to avoid any accountability for her handmaidens should their mission go awry. Dorm\u00e9 soon joined Mote\u00e9 in the cabin, where her counterpart inquired if she was aware of the relationship between Amidala and Skywalker. Dorm\u00e9 remarked that the Senator and Jedi Knight both lacked subtlety, suspecting it's why they got along so well before reminding Mote\u00e9 of their duty to keep Amidala's confidence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon their arrival, Amidala noted the landing platform was deserted. A shadowy figure hidden behind a door warned the three Naboo to leave, shortly before Mote\u00e9 was shot in the shoulder. Dorm\u00e9 provided cover fire so Amidala could move Mote\u00e9, but was annoyed when the Senator went towards the door instead of the ship. Rejoining her companions, Dorm\u00e9 accused the figure, Second Minister Tarmin, of being involved with the ambushed, which he denied. Amidala then convinced Tarmin to allow them inside to treat Mote\u00e9's words, where she subsequently had words with a mortally wounded Grand Minister Stin. Sometime afterwards, Dorm\u00e9 and Mote\u00e9 escorted a disguised Tarmin as Amidala's decoy back to their ship, while the Senator ambushed the assassin, Lis Mohles. Dorm\u00e9 then personally dragged Mohles up the boarding ramp to bring her back to face Republic justice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dorm\u00e9 had brown hair, brown eyes and light skin.
