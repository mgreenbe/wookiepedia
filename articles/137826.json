Born Syal Antilles in 31 BBY, she ran away from home at age seventeen to pursue a career as an actress. As Wynssa Starflare, she found great success, becoming famous for her roles in Imperial holodramas. She began a romance with Imperial starfighter ace Soontir Fel, also a high-profile Imperial personality, and married him in 1 ABY.

Starflare was brought to the Empire of the Hand, where she raised Davin, Chak, Jagged, Cherith, Wynssa, and Cem, and watched Davin, Chak, and Cherith perish in the harsh struggles of the Unknown Regions. After the Empire of the Hand was absorbed by the Chiss Ascendancy, Syal Antilles Fel suffered when her son Jagged was exiled from the Ascendancy, but he went on to become the Head of State and then Emperor of the revived Galactic Empire, birthing an Imperial dynasty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rising star"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Syal Antilles was born in 31 BBY to Corellians Jagged and Zena Antilles, who owned a fueling depot aboard the Gus Treta Inner-System Market Station, which orbited Corellia.

Growing up in this rough, mechanical setting, she found that it was not the life for her; she dreamed of a more elegant lifestyle than even Corellia could provide.

The Empire propagandized the Second Battle of Ord Biniir in hope of offsetting coverage of the loss of the Death Star in the major defeat at Yavin. Taken by the newly-minted hero Fel, himself a Corellian, Starflare introduced herself to the Imperial pilot, whisking him away from a pair of senators who were attempting to regale him with old war stories. She offered Fel a tour of Coruscant. Fel was himself awed by the fact that the famous Wynssa Starflare was taking an interest in him, and happily accepted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Starflare showed Fel around Coruscant on what became the first of many dates.

At the same time, she learned that her brother Wedge Antilles had survived the explosion that killed their parents, and as the Galactic Civil War increased in intensity, was becoming increasingly prominent as an ace pilot in the Rebel Alliance. She worried that her secret connection to the Rebel hero would bring down her career and Fel's with her. She also feared that her boyfriend and brother would meet in combat and one would be forced to slay the other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After almost a year of dating, Fel asked Starflare to marry him. She was distraught, as she had come to the conclusion that she could not marry Fel and thus jeopardize him with the connection to Wedge Antilles. After she finally confessed her background to him and explained her fears, Fel argued that they were unlikely to be tainted by her brother's actions, and that they were already a couple and thus subject to any repercussions. Starflare conceded that she could not allow her fear to deny her a chance at happiness, and accepted Fel's proposal. The starlet married the martial hero in a gala Imperial wedding ceremony that was covered by galactic media.

Starflare continued acting in major Imperial productions that received the attention of Galactic Emperor Palpatine himself, while Fel's star rose with the 181st. As a prominent pair of Imperial personalities, the couple were frequently used in Imperial propaganda. One day Fel was approached by Ysanne Isard, Director of Imperial Intelligence. Isard made a pass at him, which he rejected, then told him that it had been only a test of his loyalty to Palpatine. Fel reported the incident to his wife, as well as his belief that he had made an enemy of the powerful Isard. Fearing that Isard might eventually move against them and certain she would uncover the secret of Starflare's origins, Fel told Starflare to prepare a plan to flee and disappear beyond Isard's reach on his signal, but not to tell him what her plans were.

As Baron Soontir Fel, he was granted an estate on Corellia, to which Starflare and the family moved. There, Starflare and her family lived with Fel's close-knit extended family. Among them were Fel's brother Todr and Todr's wife Ajai, who had a son, Fyric, near in age to Davin and Chak.

Starflare contacted her husband by hologram, asking about facing her brother and wanting to know that he would be safe. Fel believed that Isard was setting him up for failure, but assured Starflare that he would rejoin her safely\u2014though he resisted her entreaties to put aside the war and return to her. In the battle that followed, Fel personally flew against Antilles and was captured after his TIE Interceptor was disabled by an ion cannon.

Soontir Fel joined the Empire of the Hand, Thrawn's secret faction of the Empire founded to pacify, guard, and colonize the Unknown Regions.

Wedge Antilles's interest in tracking down Soontir Fel, and thereby his sister, became known to the spies of Warlord Zsinj, however, and the warlord used it against him by creating an impostor 181st Imperial Fighter Group and hiring an actor to play the role of Fel as a decoy to draw Antilles into a trap\u2014which Antilles defeated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The family, meanwhile, took up residence at the Empire of the Hand's secret base, the Hand of Thrawn, on Nirauan.

In the forbidding Unknown Regions, surrounded by the grim and demanding militarism of the Chiss\u2014Thrawn's people\u2014the Fels raised a family, adding Jagged, named for Antilles Fel's father, in 7 ABY. Daughters Cherith and Wynssa, who was given Antilles Fel's stage name, followed. The other half of Antilles Fel's stage name was given to the family yacht, Starflare.

The demands of combat were unrelenting, and though by 25 ABY Syal Antilles Fel had the pride of having seen Chak rise to the rank of commander leading a fleet-arm of clawcraft fighters, and Jagged become a colonel commanding the three-squadron force Spike, she also had the grief of having outlived Davin and Cherith, who had both died in combat\u2014Cherith as a teenager and Davin only twenty."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Invasion and upheaval"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25 ABY, the Yuuzhan Vong, fierce beings from another galaxy, invaded the New Republic.

Wedge Antilles\u2014who had named his elder daughter after his missing sister\u2014was at last able to meet his nephew and receive news of his sister. Antilles Fel encouraged her husband to support the war effort and fight in the New Republic himself, seeking to turn back the new enemy. Jagged returned, and Antilles Fel's mind changed abruptly when Coruscant fell to the Yuuzhan Vong. She came to the conclusion that the New Republic could not win against the ruthless invaders, and urged her husband to keep his forces safely in the Unknown Regions\u2014but she also was certain that, with Coruscant's fall, Fel would feel compelled to enter the war. In 27 ABY, shortly after Coruscant's fall, Fel sent Jagged back to the New Republic to gather information preparatory to joining the war. The family learned in his periodic reports that Jagged, who remained in the New Republic longer than he was meant to, had begun dating Jaina Solo, daughter of Rebel heroes Han and Leia Solo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly thereafter, the Chiss Civil War broke out within the Chiss Ascendancy. A dispute over the use of Killik labor led to war between the Chiss houses. Soontir Fel and the Empire of the Hand intervened in the crisis and in the process joined the Chiss Ascendancy. Soontir Fel became the Assistant Syndic of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force, and the family settled in an estate on Csilla, the Chiss capital."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 28 ABY, an expedition from the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, the New Republic's successor state, arrived on Csilla. Led by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and including Mara Jade Skywalker, Jacen Solo, Saba Sebatyne, and Danni Quee, the group sought to discover the location of the legendary living planet Zonama Sekot, a mobile world that had wandered the Unknown Regions for decades, in the hope that it would provide the key to ending the war. The Chiss authorities denied them permission to travel through Chiss space, but allowed them use of the Expeditionary Library to search for information about Zonama Sekot. Antilles Fel feared that the group sought to bring the Chiss Ascendancy into the Galactic Alliance and thus plunge it and her family into the war that she saw as unwinnable. She traveled to the library with her daughter Wynssa and was startled when she came across the Barabel Sebatyne. The impetuous Wynssa eagerly questioned Sebatyne about the group's research, to her mother's embarrassment. When Antilles Fel displayed her suspicion of the Jedi group's motives, Wynssa forced her to admit her fears about the war. Sebatyne countered by arguing that, should the rest of the galaxy fall, the Chiss could not survive alone, reinforcing Antilles Fel's own grudging realization that her family could not avoid the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wynssa volunteered to help the Jedi in their search for information, and Antilles Fel reluctantly agreed to let her stay in the library. When all the group except Jacen Solo decided to take a break and move their ship, the Jade Shadow, from the city of Ac'siel to a location nearer the library, Fel piloted them back to the ship in an ice barge, and Antilles Fel came with them. During the journey, the party came under attack by assailants in snow-fliers, who attempted to halt the barge. As the barge could not outrun or outfight the attackers, Luke Skywalker proposed that they stop and disembark after setting the barge's weapons systems to fire on a timer and provide a distraction. They did so, and the attackers\u2014led by Ina'ganet'nuruodo, a representative of one the families Fel had helped destroy in the civil war\u2014landed to face them. Ganet, as the Chiss was known, announced that her faction had kidnapped Wynssa and prepared to execute her captives, but the timed distraction allowed the group to get the better of their attackers.

After the Galactic Alliance defeated the Yuuzhan Vong in 29 ABY, Jagged was made liaison between the Expansionary Defense Force and the Galactic Alliance, remaining in the known galaxy away from his family. Jagged, Wynssa, and Cem were the only children remaining to Antilles Fel by 35 ABY; Chak had been killed in combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Swarm War between the Chiss and the Killik Colony, Jagged, who had broken up with Jaina Solo and returned to the Unknown Regions as a naval commander, guaranteed the parole of the Jedi Lowbacca, one of a number of Jedi Joiners who had taken the side of the Killiks, after Lowbacca was captured by the Chiss. The conditions of the parole required that the Fel family would be responsible for any damage caused by Lowbacca should he take up arms against the Ascendancy once more. When the Wookiee Jedi did, the Fel reputation and finances were ruined by their need to pay for the damages. Worse, Jagged was shot down over Tenupe at the war's conclusion in 36 ABY. Multiple Chiss rescue efforts were unable to recover him, and finally Soontir and Syal Fel paid for two private rescue attempts, the second of which was able to rescue him from the jungle world two years after he was first stranded. As the Fels could not meet the cost of the losses Lowbacca had caused, though, Jagged was exiled from the Chiss Ascendancy as punishment. He made it his mission to kill Alema Rar, a Dark Jedi who had helped lead the Killiks, and thereby redeem the Fel's family honor. By 41 ABY, he had succeeded, but Syal Antilles Fel still could not see her son; he remained forbidden from returning to the Ascendancy. In the same year, Jagged became the Head of State of the Imperial Remnant, after Luke Skywalker, resolving the Second Galactic Civil War, forced the Moff Council to appoint him as Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon's successor.

That fear was heightened by falling in love with Soontir Fel, a fellow Corellian and Imperial hero. She was terrified not only that a marriage to Fel would expose him to a potential downfall as well, but that, as an Imperial pilot, he might eventually battle her brother and one would kill the other.

Though she knew intellectually that withdrawing and remaining in the Unknown Regions would not save her family from the invaders, she could not overcome her fear of joining the war effort. She finally could take no more of warfare, and was unwilling to face the loss of yet more of her family.
