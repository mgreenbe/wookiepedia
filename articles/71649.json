The organization was a constortium that included smugglers amongst its membership, and it was led by the Trandoshan Captain-in-Chief Kurakk. During the time of the Galactic Civil War, the Development Group outwardly claimed to be loyal to the Galactic Empire, but in reality it paid the Empire little attention. At some point, Jon-Tow began vying with the rival organization the Corsignis Property Alliance for control of Pinett's spaceports. The conflict escalated and both organizations blockaded Pinett, in an attempt to prevent each other from controlling trade that passed through the ports Beliarr and Oscum. Both sides refused to back down and the members the Development became divided as to whether to call off the blockade. In protest at the blockade, a group of Pinett's inhabitants established the Pinett Freedom Force and the protesters attempted to prevent starships that were affiliated with either Jon-Tow or Corsignis from landing on the moon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this time, a group of agents flew to Pinett and as they approached the moon in their starship, the Jon-Tow vessel Herriar and the Corsignis freighter Nosh vu'Ta both ordered the agents to enter a course to their respective landing facilities. The crews of the two rival ships got into an argument and the Jon-Tow vessel ordered the Nosh vu'Tal to stop using a Jon-Tow communications. At the same time on Pinett, a group of Freedom Force members attempted to use a tractor beam to prevent Corsignis and Jon-Tow ships from landing in the landing pad A-13. However, when they activated the beam, they indavertently pulled a Jon-Tow freighter off course and sent it hurtling towards the moon. The newly-arrived agents intervened and they attempted to prevent the freighter from crashing. The agents subsequently tried to mediate the dispute between Jon-Tow and Corsignis, in an effort to resolve the trade dispute."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
