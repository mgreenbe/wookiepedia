Vader flew behind Barvel, matching him maneuver for maneuver. Though Vader was unable to shoot down Barvel immediately, it was quickly apparent to the watchers that the Dark Lord was merely toying with Barvel\u2014a fact made evident when Vader simply swooped down behind Barvel and shot him down, ending the exercise before the ace could react."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime following the Battle of Yavin, Barvel took part in a skirmish against at least one Rebel pilot.
