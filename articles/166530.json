A labyrinth of old Massassi ruins located to the South of the Great Temple, the training grounds offered Jedi students plenty of opportunity to improve their skills in Force Jump, Force pull, Force push, and Force speed. With an inventory of remotes and Jedi training droids, the training grounds also offered opportunities to practice lightsaber combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 12 ABY, Luke Skywalker hid Kyle Katarn's lightsaber in the ruins as a test.
