Todo was given a security chip that gave him access to Jedi Temple's security systems, with the permission to disable them. Todo was able to find a weak point in the shields with assistance from the Clawdite Cato Parasitti. Todo and Bane then made their way towards the Holocron Vault, encountering little resistance, as Parasitti had given them access via shapeshifting into the deceased Jedi Knight Ord Enisence. After losing contact with Cato, Todo was sent to the Temple's communications center. As he entered the communications center, he tried to claim to Jedi Master Mace Windu that he was a maintenance droid. In the process, Todo was destroyed not by the Jedi but by a bomb that Bane had secretly placed inside of him."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Hutts' job"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the job at the Jedi Temple, Todo was rebuilt by the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker in an attempt by the Jedi to learn more about Cad Bane and discover his whereabouts.  The plan went wrong and Todo escaped. Todo was later reunited with Bane and continued to serve Bane in bounty hunting. He assisted Bane in kidnapping Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala's protocol droid, C-3PO. He and HELIOS-3E then kidnapped the astromech droid R2-D2, C-3PO's companion.

Both bounty hunters ended up being on the trail of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Quinlan Vos, who were also tracking Ziro. After questioning Ziro's mother, Todo and Bane went to the planet Teth, only to find Ziro's corpse and council records gone. Todo then assisted Bane in escaping the Jedi, attacking Vos and stealing his lightsaber. Todo attempted to take on Kenobi but was outmatched, but was able to retrieve Bane's hat and escape with him aboard his starfighter, the Xanadu Blood."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Kaminoans' job"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after the fall of the Republic, Todo accompanied Bane to Bracca to capture the clone Omega by order of Kaminoan Prime Minister Lama Su. The pair encountered clone sergeant Hunter protecting their prize, to which Todo stated the clone's dire situation. Todo watched as Bane and Hunter stood off, each with their hands at their sides, ready to fire. Bane acted faster and shot Hunter directly in the chest, causing the sergeant to mistakenly shoot off one of Todo's booster legs. Omega tried to fire her energy bow at Bane, but Todo knocked it away with his severed leg. Bane stunned Omega and the two fled the scene."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Bane's escape, Todo went to the prison section of Bane's ship where Omega demanded Todo let her out. However, Todo refused and told her that Bane doesn't like uncooperative prisoners. After Todo watched Bane speak with Omega, he asked Bane to help him repair his leg, to which Bane ignored him. After Bane went back to the cockpit of the ship, Todo attempted to repair his leg. Omega offered to help Todo if he let her out, to which Todo refused, and said that she was a prisoner and not to be trusted. Eventually, Omega managed to convince Todo to let her out. Honoring what she said, Omega repaired Todo's leg, but then shut down Todo allowing Omega to search for her comm unit. Shortly after, Bane came back to the prison section, where he found Omega missing and Todo shut down. Bane reactivated Todo and demanded to know where Omega was, to which Todo replied that she was obviously right beside them, but then realized she had left."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Bane had left to find Omega on the planet they had landed on, Todo called Bane and told him that there was an incoming ship. Once the ship was revealed to be Fennec Shand, who had killed the Kaminoan, Taun We sent to retrieve Omega, Todo came up behind Shand while her and Bane were in a stand off, and grabbed the case of credits from her. However, as he tried to fly away, a detonator blew up knocking Todo off the edge, who survived with his thrusters, but the credits fell out of the case. After Bane demanded Todo go find Omega, who had just ran away, Todo flew off in search of her. After some time, Todo found Omega and flew into the room she was in but was quickly shot by Shand. Later, as Omega was climbing down a ladder to try to reach a Kaminoan flight pods, Todo flew out of nowhere and they got into a tussle, which ended with Todo being upside down unable to move as Omega ran to the flight pod. Shortly afterwards, Todo caught up and told Omega through the window that she was going to be captured, but then Omega flew off with the flight pod, to which Todo yelled that she would regret this.
