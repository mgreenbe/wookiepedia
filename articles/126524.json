This contingent consisted largely of Klatooinians, Niktos, and Weequays including the individuals: Barada, Brock Starsher, Gailid, Kithaba, Klaatu, Lathe, Pagetti Rook, Pote Snitkin, Vedain, Velken Tezeri, Wooof and Yotts Orren. A number of other Human individuals and three Weequay individuals rounded out this complement of guards. They wore no special uniform and were armed with a motley assortment of weapons, including vibro-axes, vibrostaves, and DL-18 blaster pistols. All of these skiff guards fell victim to either the Sarlacc, or a faster and less painful death at the hands of Luke's lightsaber during the attempted execution of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca at the Great Pit of Carkoon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
