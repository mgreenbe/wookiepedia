By 32 BBY, Bolt had participated in the Boonta Eve Classic podrace that took place annually in the spaceport of Mos Espa on the planet Tatooine.

Annodue also nicknamed the racer \"the Great Dud Bolt.\" Following the introduction of the participants, each of their flags was carried in procession across the front of the racing grid, including Bolt's flag, which consisted of a thin blue triangular flag above a thin dark gray triangular flag and then a large red rectangular flag below that."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The race and further career"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure signaled for the race to begin, Bolt left the starting grid but quickly fell toward the back of the pack.

Artist Terryl Whitlatch drew anatomical concept art of the character on May 30, 1996, and two costume concepts were then drawn with one labeled September 12, 1996. A full maquette of the character was also produced.

The name Bozzie Barada was still erroneously used for a podracer in the film's 1999 novelization by Terry Brooks, while Bozzie Baranta was developed into a separate character in the 1999 Star Wars Legends video game Star Wars Episode I: Racer."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Puppet"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Model maker Danny Wagner produced a hand puppet of Bolt consisting of only the character's torso, head, and arms. It was molded and cast in latex, likely with elements of foam latex, and then had cheesecloth added for strength. Once it was cured, polyfilla was added and then the costume, which was made of vaccu-formed pieces covered in dyed leather and greebles. Green sticks protruding from the back of the puppet's elbows were used as puppeteering rods to control it during filming."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wagner and Mark Siegel controlled the puppet on set and spent about a day shooting with visual effects supervisor John Knoll, although only a few seconds of footage made it into the film. Bolt was one of only two podracers rendered as a physical puppet rather than only computer graphics, although for distant shots of his vehicle he was also digitally rendered. The puppet is included in the touring Star Wars Identities exhibition."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
