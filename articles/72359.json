Flat and crescent-shaped, the hull of the ship was packed with powerful and highly sensitive sensor systems that possessed incredible range. An off-set cylindrical fuselage housed the craft's spartan living quarters, cargo-hold, power generators, and drive system. Relatively lightly armored, JumpMaster's relied on sheer speed and agility - coupled with their powerful sensors - to avoid trouble."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While performing admirably in most regards, the JumpMaster was hobbled by a hyperdrive system that was both slow and prone to breakdowns. Owing to the versatility of a CEC design, however, the craft was extremely modifiable; as a result the first modification done to the craft was often a faster and more reliable hyperdrive engine. Beyond this, the craft was equipped with two hard points for modification, and could be substantially modified with vastly improved shields and significant increased firepower - as Dengar did with the Punishing One."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Designed during the waning years of the Galactic Republic, the JumpMaster was mostly used to scout new hyperspace routes and map newly discovered systems. Indeed, their primary users were the Civilian Astrogation Corps, who used the craft to make sure navigation charts were up to date. That said, due to their speed and powerful sensors, it was not uncommon to find JumpMasters in planetary militias, serving as picket ships and early warning patrol craft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable users"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Perhaps the most infamous user of a JumpMaster was the bounty hunter Dengar, who flew a modified JumpMaster 5000 during the Galactic Civil War, named Punishing One. The Punishing One was substantially modified from stock, with Dengar adding a quad laser cannon, an Ion cannon, and a proton torpedo launcher in addition to a cutting-edge engine bay that drastically increased the ship's speed. Dengar further modified the ship so that an R2-series astromech droid brain could independently operate the quad guns, allowing Dengar to fly the ship without having to worry about firing back."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
