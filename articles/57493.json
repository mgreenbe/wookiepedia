His ship was one of the Imperial Navy vessels that massed at Jakku in 5 ABY under Fleet Admiral and Counselor Gallius Rax, and made up part of the defensive ring around the planet during the ensuing battle against the New Republic. When the Punishment suffered a shield generator coolant leak, which cascaded through the upper levels, Groff went mad and made a deranged comm to Grand Moff Randd on the Super Star Destroyer Ravager, launching into a tirade against the New Republic inspired by Rax's pre-battle speech. His comms then went dark, and the Punishment collided into the Starhawk-class Battleship Mark I Amity, sacrificing both himself and his Star Destroyer for the cause. Despite his fervor, this sacrifice caused a chain reaction that would lead to the destruction of the Ravager and eventually the defeat of the Imperial forces in the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
