The New Republic was protected by the New Jedi Order, which was established by Luke Skywalker, just as the Old Republic was once protected by the Old Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of the restoration of the Galactic Republic, the Empire sometimes referred to the New Republic as the Old Order while in decline, as opposed to their New Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A New Galactic Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The death of Emperor Palpatine, in 4 ABY, at the Battle of Endor, signaled the end of the Empire. The news of the Death Star II's destruction, as well as Palpatine's demise, was broadcast by the Rebel Alliance throughout the galaxy, using their alternative HoloNet system called the New Republic HoloNet. On the capital world of Coruscant, civilians and Rebels reacted to the broadcast by starting an uprising, among other things shouting praise for the return of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A week after the Battle of Endor, at the end of the Bakura Incident, the Alliance to Restore the Republic, was reorganized into the Alliance of Free Planets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One month later, in the aftermath of the Nagai\u2013Tof War, the Alliance to Restore the Republic was reorganized into the New Republic, with the official Declaration of a New Republic was issued by eight of the most important members of the Rebel Alliance, setting forth goals, values, and ideals of the new government. These eight individuals, Mon Mothma of Chandrila, Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, Borsk Fey'lya of Kothlis, Admiral Ackbar of Dac, Sian Tevv of Sullust, Doman Beruss of Corellia, Kerrithrarr of Kashyyyk, and Verrinnefra B'thog Indriummsegh of Elom, became the first members of the New Republic provisional government, or the Provisional Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The main goal of the Provisional Council, and so of the New Republic, was to capture Coruscant. This was more for symbolic rather than strategic purposes. Since the beginning of the Old Republic the seat of galactic government had been on Coruscant, and its capture would legitimize the authority of the New Republic in the eyes of the galaxy. Until the move could be made, the Provisional and Inner Councils met on other member worlds instead, such as Noquivzor. During this period, the Provisional Government continued to provide guidance for the new government and work out a new series of principles and laws."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Initially, Mon Mothma chose to work against the Empire through diplomacy rather than combat, and the newly founded Republic dispatched envoys to thousands of worlds. Numerous systems joined the New Republic, while many others instead declared themselves independent. Mothma's Republic, which was intended as a voluntary union for the common good, respected such decisions. Toward that same end, Mothma devolved control of Planetary Security Forces that had been nationalized by the Empire to their own sectors via the Defense Declarations. Constituent sectors of the New Republic were obligated to contribute to the Republic's starfleet, but were allowed to retain command of their local forces. For some sectors, the Defense Declarations served as the deciding factor that motivated them to join the New Republic; furthermore, the Republic's defeat of the Tofs eased doubts that the former Rebels would be capable of defending the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Onward to the Core"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the first few months following the victory at Endor, the New Republic government made few aggressive lunges into Imperial held space, instead choosing to concentrate on sending ambassadors to the numerous worlds that had overthrown their Imperial governors. As the ambassadors quickly strengthened the stability of the New Republic by increasing membership in the Outer Rim Territories, Admiral Ackbar prepared the military for the first in a series of campaigns aimed at liberating key portions of the galaxy from Imperial rule."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After their conflict with the Nagai and the Tofs concluded, New Republic leaders met on Mon Calamari to plan their assault on the galaxy's inner systems, and in 4 ABY, Admiral Ackbar organized the New Republic's forces into four fleets. The First Fleet, commanded by Admiral Firmus Nantz, initially operated in the Western Reaches; the Second Fleet, commanded by Admiral Hiram Drayson, protected the New Republic leadership in Mon Calamari Space; the Third Fleet, commanded by Ackbar himself, was based in Bothan Space and operated in the Slice; and the Fourth Fleet, commanded by Admiral Voon Massa, was headquartered at Bothawui as a source of reinforcements for the First and Third fleets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the next two years, the New Republic Defense Force liberated countless worlds in the Mid Rim and Inner Rim, expanding towards the Core Worlds and establishing key bases for future campaigns."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 6.5 ABY, 30% of the galaxy fully supported the New Republic, with an additional 20% supporting nominally and cautiously.

This was made possible by a commando team from Rogue Squadron. The team included pilots Wedge Antilles, Corran Horn, Gavin Darklighter, and others, as well as New Republic agents Iella Wessiri and Winter. Together, they were able to bring down Coruscant's planetary shields with lightning created using the planet's weather control systems. Once the shields were down, the team called the New Republic fleet under Admiral Ackbar to cripple the rest of the planet's defenses. This was, to a certain extent, a trap laid out by Imperial Intelligence head Ysanne Isard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Republic settled in to find the Imperials had left behind the Krytos virus\u2014a deadly disease affecting many non-Human races and only curable by bacta. To deal with this threat, the Rogues resigned their commissions and waged the Bacta War against Isard. This brought Thyferra, the primary bacta-source in the galaxy, under New Republic control. The New Republic was thus able to pull through the Krytos crisis and continue to thrive. With the New Republic securely in control of Coruscant, many neutral worlds began to view the new government as a legitimate power, no longer as a weak band of rebels."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rebels to respectable"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the capture of Coruscant and the relocation of the New Republic government, the New Republic Senate was established during Restoration Day. The speech of Princess Leia Organa, New Republic Minister of State, reflected the beliefs and principles of the First Senate:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mon Mothma became the first Chief of State of the New Republic and also, under the new Charter, the President of the Senate and the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. During her administration, the New Republic government remained very similar to that of the provisional government. The Inner Council continued to be at its head, but the New Republic Senate assumed the duties of the Provisional Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fighting a dictatorial Empire proved much easier than forming a confederation of planets. As the Empire was slowly routed out of the Core, many New Republic councilors began to think that the war was near an end. Political ambitions and individual pursuits for power or prestige began to creep into the new government. While this problem was slowly growing more serious, the presence of the Empire as an enemy to rally against kept the Republic together. Despite more localized threats from Imperial warlords like Zsinj, by the end of 8 ABY nearly three-quarters of the known galaxy was aligned with the New Republic. Too many of the government's leaders thought the war was nearly over."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial resurgence"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the first major tests came in 9 ABY when Grand Admiral Thrawn assumed control of the remnants of the Empire and led a successful campaign against the New Republic. Political infighting hampered the New Republic's response to the crisis early on, as ambitious councilors like Borsk Fey'lya sought to gain power at the expense of others. Despite numerous defeats and setbacks, the New Republic rallied again, finally achieving victory during the Battle of Bilbringi. Thrawn was dead and his forces in retreat. Sensing that the defeat of the Empire was in their grasp, the New Republic launched a series of operations into the remaining sections of the galaxy still held by the Empire. The victory was short lived."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A year after Thrawn's death, the resurrected Emperor Palpatine led a major Imperial offensive originating from the Deep Core. Faced with superior forces, including a number of superweapons, the New Republic was forced to fall back and operate in much the same way as the Rebel Alliance had. Ultimately the New Republic was saved by the death of the Emperor during a skirmish on Onderon, thanks to the efforts of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Reorganization and reform"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon the successful recapture of Coruscant in 11 ABY, the New Republic Senate began the first of a series of government restructuring programs. Specialized councils were established, each with greater power than ordinary Senate committees and given the responsibility for a specific aspect of government. These included the Council on the Common Defense, the Council on Security and Intelligence, the Justice Council, the Ministry Council, the Council on Science and Technology, and the Commerce Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Inner Council was replaced by the Ruling Council consisting of the chairpersons of each of the eight Senate councils. The Ruling Council had the authority to remove the Chief of State from office to prevent the head of government from becoming too powerful, as Palpatine had become as Supreme Chancellor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was also at this time that Jedi Master Luke Skywalker convinced the Senate that the New Republic would only be further protected by the establishment of a new Jedi Order. The Senate thus endorsed Skywalker's establishment of the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4. The Praxeum was at first used to train the first Knights, and later became an academy where younger students would work their way up to an apprenticeship. During Admiral Daala's attempt to reform the Empire, Yavin 4 was considered a key point in the New Republic's downfall. It was thus targeted, but the Jedi managed to defend the Praxeum and drive the Empire away. Mon Mothma retired from public life and named Princess Leia Organa Solo as her successor. With the approval of the Senate, Organa Solo became the second Chief of State of the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many important events with long lasting repercussions for the New Republic occurred during the presidency of Organa Solo. The most important of these was the opening of diplomatic talks with the Duskhan League, an alliance of Yevethan worlds in the Koornacht Cluster. This in turn led to what was commonly referred to as the Black Fleet Crisis, during which Organa Solo extended the powers of the Chief of State, amidst two petitions of recall from the Ruling Council and a petition of no confidence in the Senate, in order to protect the New Republic from the fanatical Yevetha and their ruthless campaign of genocide."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was also during this time that many former Imperial worlds petitioned for and received New Republic membership. However, the governments of many of these worlds retained their Imperial-era character and as a result their Senate delegations often advocated views associated with the late Empire. This ideological disjoint often resulted in deadlock within the Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finally, after being criticized for New Republic involvement in the Koornacht Cluster, Almania (during which the Senate Hall was destroyed), and the Corellian system, and because of discord within the Senate, especially between the traditional and pro-Imperial senators, Chief of State Leia Organa Solo took an indefinite leave of absence, upon which the Calibop senator Ponc Gavrisom was chosen as the caretaker Chief of State."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Peace with the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the growing mistrust between certain elements within the New Republic, it remained united in its efforts to defeat the Empire. A campaign launched by Imperial Supreme Commander Gilad Pellaeon ended in disaster as New Republic forces under Ackbar defeated Pellaeon and reduced the Imperial Remnant to a mere eight sectors in the Outer Rim."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ponc Gavrisom's ascension to the office of Chief of State, the construction of a new Senate Grand Convocation Chamber, and a new round of major government restructuring marked the beginning of a new period for the New Republic. The power of government was shifted more to the local, planetary, system, sectoral, and regional levels to avoid the centralization of power that marked the Palpatine era. The New Republic Senate's role was thus reduced to little more than providing for the common defense and mediating inter-system disputes. While any legislation passed by it was still binding, the new limit of one bill per delegation per year prevented gridlock, since any proposed legislation would have to pass the scrutiny of both the committee in which it was introduced as well as the full Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another development made during the restructuring was the creation of the New Republic Observers, an organization that functioned much like the Jedi Order during much of the Republic. The job of the Observers was to move about the New Republic and to report to the Senate what they saw or heard, especially with regard to improper government activities that local authorities preferred to keep out of sight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The major event of this period was the Caamas Document Crisis, which threatened to begin a civil war between pro-Bothan and anti-Bothan factions of the New Republic. The crisis, which began with the uncovering of the Caamas Document at Wayland, ended with the signing of a final peace treaty between the New Republic and the Imperial Remnant, finally ending the twenty-one year Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Changing of the guard"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The end of the Galactic Civil War saw many worlds finally choosing an allegiance, with many joining the New Republic. Leia Organa Solo returned to the Senate shortly after the signing of the Bastion Accords at the urging of her friends. The New Republic and the Jedi would also defeat the neo-Imperial Second Imperium, the anti-Human Diversity Alliance and an attempt by the Black Sun crime syndicate to dominate the galaxy. In 23 ABY, Leia permanently resigned."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the subsequent election, Borsk Fey'lya was elected Chief of State with a three-fifths majority. Many other long-term members of the Senate resigned as well as military leaders like Ackbar and Hiram Drayson. Unfortunately, these senators, beings of high principle and former rebel leaders, were replaced by senators of lesser principle, and the infighting of the Old Republic was seen again."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Yuuzhan Vong War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the subsequent invasion by the Yuuzhan Vong, the Senate was paralyzed by incompetence and cowardice. The administration of Chief of State Fey'lya failed to take the invasion seriously until too late. The invaders made quick progress, conquering huge portions of the galaxy in their trek towards Coruscant. Distrust of the New Jedi Order further complicated things, while the New Republic Defense Force found itself constantly falling back towards the Core, wrecking morale. The Battle of Coruscant sounded the death knell of the New Republic, as members of the Senate hijacked elements of the Defense Fleet to escort themselves out of the system. Fey'lya sacrificed himself in the battle."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rebirth into the Galactic Alliance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 28 ABY, the Senate reconvened on Mon Calamari, and, after a long campaign, elected Cal Omas as Chief of State. That would be the final election of the New Republic. Following the decisive Battle of Ebaq, Omas reorganized the remnants of the New Republic into the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. With a new constitution, increased checks and balances, and a new federal structure, the Galactic Alliance strove to correct many of the flaws of the previous government. Furthermore, it committed itself to working closely with the Jedi Order to ending the war. In 29 ABY, the Galactic Alliance and the Jedi Order defeated the Yuuzhan Vong during the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar and one year later, had officially taken authority of the galaxy and thus officially reforming the New Republic.
