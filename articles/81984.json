Though lightsaber duels were rare during most of the Republic Era, lightsaber dueling was nevertheless taught as part of Jedi training."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
