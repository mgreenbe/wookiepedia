In Lothal Year 3272, the street urchin Ezra Bridger spent a day in the pavillion picking pockets and managing to steal a reasonable amount of credits, a mini-holoprojector that played propaganda, a level 9 Commission for the Preservation of the New Order identification card and a fire ruby. He later wrote in his journal about his haul, commenting that he assumed the ruby was fake, but that he would be able to sell the ID to the fence Ferpil Wallaway, keep the credits for himself and strip the projector for parts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial pavilion was first mentioned in Rebel Journal by Ezra Bridger, a reference book written by Daniel Wallace and released in 2014."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
