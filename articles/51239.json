Expert hunters, they could run very quickly and catch most smaller prey. Averaging around half a meter tall, fwits were kept by Amanin on Maridun as both pets and guardians, due to their vicious, savage nature.

Their fur ranged in color from black to brown, sandy or even gray. When their mouth was closed, fwits appeared to be smiling; however, this was rarely the case. When opened, their mouths were enormous compared to their heads, with two rows of razor-sharp teeth capable of shredding skin and bone. Fwits had a pair of oversized, white eyes located at the sides of their head, and two large, floppy ears, as well as a small, sharp nose."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although they appeared to be innocent, friendly creatures, fwits were in truth vicious carnivores; they preferred the taste of freshly killed meat to any other food. Fwits were expert hunters, skilled at catching practically any small mammal. They were able to outrun most creatures that were smaller than them, and liked to eat them in one bite. When hunting larger animals, fwits would bite their prey, holding on until their enemy was rendered unconscious. They were also extremely stealthy. Fwits rarely attacked their owners and those they were used to, but they were extremely aggressive to outsiders, especially those who did not know how to care for fwits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fwits were kept on the planet Maridun as pets and guard animals by the large humanoid sentients native to Maridun called the Amani long before the Galactic Empire arrived on Maridun, although when the Empire was in control of their homeworld, fwits were outlawed in all the major cities and ports, and hunters were encouraged by the Empire to kill fwits on sight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, the Hutts once again took control of Maridunian slavery, and fwits were re-allowed into all the former Imperial spaceports.
