The shack was equipped with several tables and chairs and a water trough for happabores, and travelers on the road would stop there to rest. The scavenger Rey stopped at the shack at least once, and managed to sketch two of the tattoos on Meru's arm while no one was looking. She also witnessed someone messing with Meru, which resulted in the cyborg fetching the biggest gun Rey had ever seen from within the shack and silencing all of the guests by clicking off the safety.
