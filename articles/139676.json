It was long rumored to be just a reconnaissance post, but the Imperials eventually learned the base acted as a launching point for Rebel sabotage efforts in the Corellian system and was harboring one of the last known Jedi Knights, Rachi Sitra. A direct order from Emperor Palpatine himself was given to destroy the outpost. During the Battle of Talus the Rebels initially managed to thwart the under-prepared Imperial assault. However, the Rebels realized that they could not properly defend the base and organized the evacuation of all personnel. When on the next day the Empire attacked again, with a larger force, they found that the last evacuation transports were already leaving the base. Several of them were shot down, but most of their passengers managed to escape anyway. Though the base was destroyed by the Empire, only a handful of Rebel Jedi were apprehended or killed during the assault."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The defense of this base is the key event in both Light Side and Dark Side scenario campaigns of Squadrons Over Corellia, the second expansion of Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
