Karr Nuq Sin, a Force-sensitive teenager who collected such items in the hopes they would trigger glimpses of the antiques' history with his power of psychometry, owned a copy of the Guide on a datapad. The guide gave details about how much military antiques could be bought and sold for, and revealed that he had been overpaying and spending too many credits. When Maize Raynshi, a new friend who attended Nuq Sin's school, discovered his copy on a datapad in his home and asked what the publication told him, he admitted that was what he had learned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Antique Military Collector's Guide was first mentioned in Force Collector, a 2019 young adult novel by Kevin Shinick."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
