It was principally a non-combat award that was issued to civilians who provided aid and material support to the Rebel Alliance at great risk to themselves, or to non-combatant military personnel such as clerks, analysts, cargo handlers, supply personnel, and others who provided vital support to Alliance operations despite not participating in the front lines of combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Distinguished Service Medal was characterized by a small, round, silver medallion that featured the Rebel Alliance starbird that was surrounded by Aurebesh text on three sides that said \"For Meritorious Service\" and the date \"0 BBY\" at the bottom. The medallion was suspended from a silver rectangular ribbon with a lone broad blue stripe that ran vertically down the center. The award was usually issued once to an individual."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
