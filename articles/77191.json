He was grounded by his father, literally, for the stunt, being assigned to traffic control and resupply for three standard weeks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke Skywalker unsuccessfully attempted to escape from Mara Jade by using a drop-kick Koiogran turn when they were both flying Skipray Blastboats in the atmosphere of Myrkr.
