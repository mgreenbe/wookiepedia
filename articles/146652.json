Stationed aboard the frigate Mawrunner, he began dating Syal Antilles, to the tacit disapproval of her father, Wedge Antilles. After less than a year of dating, they decided to be married after the end of the war. However, when the Galactic Alliance Second Fleet, including Mawrunner, was ordered to accompany the Galactic Alliance Chief of State to negotiations with the Confederation, the Confederation activated the Centerpoint Station superweapon, obliterating the Second Fleet and killing Rordan.
