It was the site of the Sixty Hour War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire during the early part of the Galactic Civil War. During the invasion of the planet, six Imperial Star Destroyers annihilated the third largest city of Paran, using concentrated turbolaser fire. Several wings of TIE Fighters followed the assault to ensure the devastation of Paran was complete. The city was the home of Senator Wuxod, who was a vocal critic of Emperor Palpatine. Wuxod himself disappeared shortly before the invasion. Paran once had a population of over half a million people, though the population during the attack was reduced to about 3000. Most of the remainder died of injury, disease, and starvation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Treidum made a run out to Derilyn of Roche Siak Protocol Droids but he was jumped by the Khuiumin Survivors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 ABY, the Rebel Alliance and the  Khuiumin Survivors destroyed the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Brazen stationed at the Derilyn Space Defense Platform."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Derilyn was eventually liberated by the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
