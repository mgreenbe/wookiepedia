QS-2D decided to keep it around Uffel, while the rest of line was sold. It was usually assigned to follow around any visitors to the moon. MSF-F2 was very obvious when it did this, so visitors knew they were being monitored. Most did not mind, but a few did try to give the MSF-F2 the slip. It would always show up again, almost as if it were everywhere at once."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "MSF-F2 was a silver-trimmed mouse droid. When it moved along the ground, it would seem to waddle, due to a uneven calibration of its wheel wells."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
