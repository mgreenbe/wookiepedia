It was a traditional Herglic holiday that celebrated commerce and family (which were interrelated in the Herglic race). Shelova Week was a time to exchange gifts, make new business alliances, discuss trade arrangements, and spend time with family members. As the Human population of the sector began interacting with the Herglics, they too began celebrating the holiday, although many Humans simply took the vacation instead of also developing business partnerships. On the Tapani local calendar, Shelova Week fell between the months of Helona and Melona."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
