Zare sought to make contact with Diago by sending Geonosians to raid his spice warehouse on the edge of the Jundland. At the same time, a smuggler captain seeking a sensor computer from Diago, investigated on behalf of Diago's lieutenant, Tookreek, to claim a krayt dragon bone. Zare attempted to persuade the smuggler to arrange a meeting with Diago, but was refused, forcing her to disarm her opponent. She spared the smuggler, leaving with a reminder that her offer was still open."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zare later sent Imperial commandos to attack Diago's summer palace, where the smuggler was meeting with Tookreek.

A neutral option of ignoring both can be chosen, that results in Zare's victory as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
