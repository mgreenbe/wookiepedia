In 41 ABY, Ship, a Sith Meditation Sphere, arrived on Kesh and began to help them form a new armada. Two years later, after the members of the Tribe felt Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker's presence in the Force when he touched an Aing-Tii relic, the Codex, Ship abruptly left Kesh to follow a call through the Force.

Meanwhile, Abeloth had discovered Skywalker and his son, Jedi Knight Ben Skywalker, at Sinkhole Station, a space station in the Maw. Ship transported the female Keshiri and the other Sith to Sinkhole Station, where they ambushed the Skywalkers.
