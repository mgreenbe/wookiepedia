When the Confederacy of Independent Systems was shipping supplies to their secret base on Mokivj through Batuu, they used the cantina as a transfer point for the cargo, unaware that Janott was in league with thieves and smugglers who were siphoning the cargo for themselves. When Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala came to Batuu to find her former handmaiden Duja, who had alerted the Galactic Republic to Separatist activity in the area, she stopped at Janott's cantina. While Janott served Amidala an Andoan White, she explained to him that she was looking for a man named Kuseph Jovi to deliver a starship to him and wondered why Jovi had picked a spot like Batuu for the meeting. Janott responded that Batuu wasn't exactly New Codia. Then Amidala questioned Janott about Duja, who had been laid on a funeral pyre outside the cantina, and offered to write a farewell song to the deceased. After the song was ready, Janott offered to call people to watch as Amidala sang the song if she wanted an audience but she replied there wouldn't be much for anyone to hear or see."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, after Amidala had left Batuu, her husband Anakin Skywalker arrived to search for her and teamed up with a Chiss called Mitth'raw'nuruodo. The two of them interrogated Janott about Amidala and Duja, but before they got anything substantial out of the bartender, they fell under attack from a group of separatist agents. The initial gas attack knocked Janott out instead of its intended targets. While Janott was unconscious, Thrawn fixed a listening device into his clothing that enabled him to listen what happened in the cantina after he had Skywalker left. A group of thieves who had been skimming the separatist's shipments carried Janott to another shop close by, but they were observed by Oenti and his separatist allies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
