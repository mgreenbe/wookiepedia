Similar to Heavy Isotope in many ways, glimmik differentiated itself with a fitter, more extreme image, and featured inspirational lyrical content. By 31 BBY, glimmik had gained significant popularity throughout the galaxy, particularly among non-Humans and those who led high-energy lifestyles; many racers, daredevils, and soldiers favored glimmik music. Glimmik music was often played at shockball courts, and a number of shockboxers used glimmik tracks as entrance music at venues across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boles Roor, a male Sneevel podracer, was a successful glimmik singer who regularly performed sold-out concerts at the Kallarak Amphitheater on Coruscant, the capital world of the Galactic Republic. Roor's superstar status was thought to be the cause of many sentients becoming fans of glimmik. The night before competing in the Boonta Eve Classic race on Tatooine in 32 BBY, he gave a concert, and after losing the race, Roor retired from the sport of podracing and went on a galactic singing tour."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clone commando RC-8015\u2014known by the nickname Fi\u2014was a lover of glimmik music. During his service in the Grand Army of the Republic, Fi would often listen to glimmik music at a loud volume within the confines of his helmet's audio circuit to mentally prepare himself for an upcoming operation, and developed a habit of nodding his head along with the thumping beat of the music. Though his pre-combat glimmik music ritual was not one his squadmates shared, Fi listened to glimmik prior to a TIOPS mission at the Corellian\u2013Perlemian hyperspace intersection, and both prior to and during a mission to the planet Gaftikar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
