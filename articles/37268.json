In all of these reference guides, Dervish is listed as being situated on Tatooine. However, it is not clear if Dervish is actually this individual's name, or some kind of title. The Quick Reference Guide and Total Experience guide do not capitalize the name, while the Complete Guide does. The Quick Refence Guide is also the only one of these three guides to identify Dervish as belonging to a \"social group\" known also as the Dervish. The other two simply list Dervish as not being affiliated with any particular faction. The Quick Refence Guide identifies Dervish as a level 9 non-player character, while the other two identify Dervish as a level 5 NPC. The Total Experience guide further identifies Dervish as an individual skilled as a carbineer and pikeman. Despite being listed in these reference guides, Dervish is not definitively known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. The reference guides do not elaborate on Dervish's species or gender, nor any quests Dervish may have been associated with. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what she would have looked like if she were added to the game. The tree files also contain some information pertaining to camps operated by the Dervish organization. The game's creature database also list a type of NPC known as \"a dervish,\" a generic title belonging to those within the Dervish organization itself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
