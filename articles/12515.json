They were sold by the Whiphids Fillin Ta and Norun Gep, at Gep's Grill on Tatooine. The meat was bought off hunters on the outskirts of Tatooine, and occasionally needed to have the former owner's brand removed before they could be sold. On slow weeks, the Whiphid partners would loot the bantha stalls to supplement their supplies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bantha burgers were popular with the local workers.
