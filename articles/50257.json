Their mission was to collect Rebels who were stranded or in danger of being captured by Imperial security and intelligence forces, and arrange for their safe passage back to the Alliance. Rebel starfighter pilots would be given the names of Foster Agents operating in the area, giving them a ground-based contact in case they were forced to bail out. SpecOps teams and other operatives had similar arrangements in case their transportation was lost or their cover was blown."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This was generally considered the most dangerous position within the Rebel Alliance. This was because so many Rebels would be given the names of Foster Agents: if even one was captured and interrogated, they could expose the Foster Agent to the Empire. The Foster Agent could then be caught by the Empire through no fault of his or her own."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable Foster Agents"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
