They did not require food or water, as nutrients were fed directly into them via wires. In the decades following the Battle of Endor, luggabeasts could be found on the desert world of Jakku, where the Teedo population used the beasts for scavenging. To help locate droids and other valuables, the Teedos gave the creatures cybernetic implants such as armor or optical instruments. By the time of the Cold War, a Teedo and his luggabeast captured BB-8, a BB unit, before it was set free by Rey, another scavenger."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luggabeasts were first revealed in an article published by Entertainment Weekly which contained exclusive photos from Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens.
