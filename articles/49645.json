Commander Varth's wing was stationed at Folor Base when they were pulled Core-ward for defense during the Hunt for Zsinj. Folor Base was an excellent facility for starfighter training thanks to its proximity to the Pig Trough and the challenging flights offered by Folor's asteroid field."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The base was supported by two Rebel transports and had a secondary unmanned facility 180\u00b0 around the moon's equator. Beacons and other electronics could be remotely turned on at this facility to lure any attackers there instead of the well-hidden base under the moon's surface. This was, in fact, what fooled Admiral Apwar Trigit long enough for the pilots stationed at Folor Base to escape during the battle that resulted in the abandonment and destruction of Folor Base in 7 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
