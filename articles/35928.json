Though the Alliance Fleet deployed shields and tractor beams to deflect falling debris away from their strike team on the Endor, a few chunks were still able to fall to the moon's surface. However, Endor was spared any significant environmental damage and the second Death Star's remains were left to decay in the moon's vast forests, attracting historic sightseers and souvenir hunters by 6 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The agony of Emperor Palpatine's death aboard the second Death Star manifested itself as an angry clot of dark side energy staining the fabric of the Force. When in proximity to the battle station's wreckage, Force-sensitive travelers were known to have suffered blackouts and even internal bleeding when exposed to the noxious evil. Even those without sensitivity to the Force still experienced a vague tingling of dread."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Death Star ruins were originally created for the Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide, a 2001 reference book written by Ben Burtt and illustrated by Sergio Aragon\u00e9s."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
