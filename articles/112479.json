It was a recruitment poster requesting youths to join the Rebel Alliance military, with an X-wing pilot standing over a planet with the Rebel Starbird logo behind the pilot and Aurebesh writing. It was often sold and/or put up during Empire Day festivities, although they sometimes ended up torn off by the Empire's officials. Despite their animosity, some Imperial officials would sometimes sell them during festivities alongside the Imperial Recruitment posters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel Resistance Poster is sold during Empire Day festivities for 20x Rememberance Day tokens or for 20x Empire Day tokens."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
