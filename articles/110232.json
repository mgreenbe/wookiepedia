After the destruction of the first Death Star by the Rebel Alliance, the Empire commissioned the construction of a second Death Star. By 4 ABY, construction of the battlestation had begun over the forest moon of Endor. R5-J2 was one of the droids assigned to the station; he was present in one of the Death Star's hangar bays when the Sith Lord Darth Vader arrived to order the station's commander to speed up construction on the superweapon, and was also present among the other droids when Emperor Palpatine's shuttle arrived at the Death Star's Hangar 272 shortly afterward."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, the Rebel Alliance gained knowledge of the second Death Star's existence. Additionally, they learned that Emperor Palpatine was personally overseeing the superweapon's final stages of construction. Determined to destroy the Death Star and kill the Emperor in one act, the Alliance launched an assault on the incomplete battlestation. The Alliance ultimately proved victorious and the Death Star was obliterated. R5-J2 perished in the resulting explosion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R5-J2 was an R5-series astromech droid that possessed masculine programming.
