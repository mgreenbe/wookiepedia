It was inhabited by enormous sand burrowers, which emerged quickly from the ground to devour unsuspecting prey. The terrain of Blenjeel was comprised mostly of wide deserts, noted for the unusual consistency of the sand, which shifted over time. Rocky outcroppings which were stable one day seemed to sink into the sand the next. These shifts were mostly attributed to the movements of the sand burrowers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ten years after the Battle of Endor, a merchant vessel was attacked by an Imperial Immobilizer 418 cruiser and crashed on Blenjeel, and Jedi Initiate Jaden Korr was sent to investigate. However, his shuttle was struck by lightning on its landing approach and also crash-landed. He was unable to save the merchants, the last of whom was eaten by a sandworm shortly after his arrival, but was able to avoid the native sandworms for long enough to salvage from the merchant's ship the parts necessary to repair his shuttle. Shortly after this, Blenjeel was listed in the New Republic Galactic Database as a dangerous planet to be avoided."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The concept of Blenjeel shares a similar environment to the Dune planet Arrakis, a desert planet with giant sandworms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
