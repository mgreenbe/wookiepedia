Assisting in the establishment of Kalikori village, Ayon was named the Minister of Flesh and Spirit among the pilgrims and served as a healer and spiritual leader. As incursions by the native and hostile Flesh Raiders became more frequent, Ayon came to believe that a rumored elixir was indeed making the natives more aggressive. Unable to go herself, Ayon hired a visiting Padawan to destroy the elixir in hopes it would put an end to the raids. This Padawan was then asked by Odumis Mer to keep the elixer in hopes that it could be used by the pilgrims to protect from further attacks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vederiat appears in the mission known as \"Strength of the Flesh Raiders\" in the 2011 BioWare game, Star Wars: The Old Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
