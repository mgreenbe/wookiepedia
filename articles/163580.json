General Jan Dodonna, commander of Yavin Base, analyzed the plans and found a weakness\u2014a thermal exhaust port, located in one of the Death Star's surface trenches, would be vulnerable to a proton torpedo assault.

In 2012, The Essential Guide to Warfare included Chan in a roster of Red Squadron at the Battle of Yavin, and expanded on his background. An X-wing pilot figure in a LEGO set released that same year was later identified as Wenton Chan in a display at the 2014 San Diego Comic Con."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
