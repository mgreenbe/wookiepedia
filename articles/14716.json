During this battle, Asajj Ventress commanded Separatist forces, but was targeted by Count Dooku, who wished to prove his allegiance to his Sith Master, Lord Sidious. Ventress was presumed dead in the conflict, but had escaped, while the Galactic Republic succeeded in its objectives with moderate cost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite her past failures during battles on Teth, Rugosa, and Kamino, Ventress was Count Dooku's most trusted and cunning assassin. However, his master, Darth Sidious, feared that she was being trained by Dooku to overthrow him, so that Dooku would become the master and Ventress as his apprentice. Dooku then sent Ventress to Sullust."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 20 BBY, Ventress and TJ-912 led the Confederacy navy against the Republic Navy under Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Admiral Wullf Yularen. Ventress, in her Ginivex-class fanblade starfighter then led two groups of fighters in attacking the Republic's flagship, the Resolute. Trident group one attacked the starboard engines and Trident group two disabled the port shield generators. Using this oppurtunity created by the Droid tri-fighters, Ventress was able to destroy the Resolute. Yularen was able to escape the Resolute's destruction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ventress and her fighters then pursued Kenobi and Skywalker in their fighters. Ventress pursued Kenobi while her fighters went after Skywalker. Ventress was then able to shoot down Kenobi and force him to land on the Separatist command ship.

Sidious told Dooku that he sensed a disturbance in the Force. Sidious suspected Dooku was training Ventress to his Sith apprentice to destroy him, and demanded that Dooku eliminate her as a test of loyalty to him. Despite his objections, Dooku carried out his master's wish and recalled Ventress' reinforcements. Dooku then contacted Ventress, telling her that she was no longer his apprentice and would die."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ventress then dueled Kenobi and Skywalker in the command ship's hangar. She was able to evade the Jedi's attacks until they force-pushed against her fighter. However, Ventress was able to force-choke them until TJ-912, under Dooku's orders, had his ship fire on the command ship to kill her. Hyena bombers along with the destroyer's cannons took out the Providence's shields, exposing it to enemy fire. One bomber sustained heavy damage and crashed into the hangar. Skywalker and Kenobi then decided to flee the doomed flagship. Ventress barely escaped the cruiser's hangar before the ship was completely destroyed. However, her fighter's life support failed and she was left unconscious in her fighter. TJ-912 reported to Dooku that Ventress was killed. Dooku then ordered the tactical droid to withdraw from Sullust with what remained of their forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dooku then reported Ventress's death to Sidious, who was pleased with Dooku's compliance. Both Dooku and the Jedi Order believed that Ventress was killed during the battle. In truth, Ventress was found alive by Ratch's crew of the Raider. She was then revived by them and demanded that they take her home to Dathomir. When they refused, Ventress force-choked and killed them. She then took the Raider to Dathomir. There, she was taken by Mother Talzin and her Nightsisters where she recuperated by the Water of Life. Together, Ventress, with help from her fellow Nightsisters, planned her revenge on Count Dooku."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
