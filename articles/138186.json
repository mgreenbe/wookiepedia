He was one of several bounty hunters hired by Khamus of the Mourner's Wail Syndicate as part of a team led by Nakano Lash, whose mission was to attack a sanctuary of the Unbroken Clan on the planet Corellia. During the mission, Lash killed Khamus as revenge for the murder of his target, and T'ongor contacted the other hunters, warning them of Lash's betrayal and the mission's failure. As they made their escape, Boba Fett attempted to kill Lash for her betrayal, but due to the intervention of Lash's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Beilert Valance, T'ongor was instead killed.

The siblings were associates of the Nautolan hunter Nakano Lash as well as the Abednedo technician Jhorstek. At some point after 10 BBY, the four criminals shared a drink in Phelar Port on the planet Eriadu when a young thief was apprehended by stormtroopers. Although Lash wanted to help the boy, Jhorstek and T'ongor decided against it, not wanting to cause trouble. The group looked on as the ex-Imperial soldier Beilert Valance rose to defend the boy and attack the troopers. When Valance was shot down, Lash came to his aid and had her companions assist the wounded hunter."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Working for Khamus"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later, T'ongor was part of a team led by Lash, who had been hired by Khamus, heir of the Mourner's Wail Syndicate.

When one of the sentries escaped Bossk, Khamus began to complain about the quality of the bounty hunters' work, but T'ongor jammed the escaped sentry's comms, preventing him from warning the rest of the Unbroken Clan. Lash killed the sentry, and she, T'ongor, and Khamus entered the Unbroken Clan facility once the other hunters had killed the remaining guards. Upon learning the identity of Khamus' target, Lash attempted to stop him. Khamus killed the target, and was shot dead by Lash in revenge. T'ongor was shocked by Lash's murder of their client, and contacted the other hunters about her apparent betrayal, insisting that they escape before facing the consequences of Khamus' death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime between the mission and the year 3 ABY, T'ongor died, and was survived by T'onga.
