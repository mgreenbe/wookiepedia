More Glee Anselm-oriented Nautolans learned Anselmian language, the language of their non-amphibious neighbors from Glee Anselm, the Anselmi, instead of Basic. It was unusual to find a trilingual Nautolan, speaking Nautila, Anselmian, and Basic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
