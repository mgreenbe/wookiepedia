One of the first conquests of the Pirate King Xer VIII when he expanded from Argai, its prominence was rapidly eclipsed by nearby Jaminere. By the time of the Galactic Empire, it was a bleak agricultural world notably only for a handful of Xim-era aeries in the planet's mountains that were remarkably well-preserved by the thin air."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bleys Harand visited the planet in the hopes of finding an accurate representation of the face of Xim the Despot and was told of a statue of Xim in the aeries. However, he found the courtyards empty but for a ruined statue that was missing everything above the calves. He recorded his journey in Travels Amid Strange Stars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
