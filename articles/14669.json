Grand Admiral Thrawn decided to use Zaarin's desire to get the latest technological advantage to lure him into an ambush and arranged a Convoy consisting of two Container transports Neelie and two Beta-class ETR-3 escort transports Bob 1 and Bob 2 as bait. Leaking to Zaarin that they contained Missile Boats, in reality, they carried munitions, and the only Missile Boat was one piloted by Tan Maarek Stele. Stele was ordered to ensure that the transports reach Hyperspace and then Thrawn will send a strike force led by his flagship, the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Grey Wolf."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stele soon moved out of the container transport to engage the TIE Advanced star fighters, soon 5 CR92a Assassin-class corvettes Kormoran arrived and began launching TIE Bombers after Stele destroyed the 3 TIE Advanced, he provided cover for Neelie by destroying the bombers until they could reach hyperspace. Once that happened the Grey Wolf arrived with 3 Strike cruisers Formidable, Indomitable and Triumph. The Grey Wolf began to launch bombers at the corvettes, which began to retreat to hyperspace. Stele, under the orders of the Secret Order made a quick sweep of the corvettes to find each had no cargo, and helped the Bombers destroy the corvettes before they could escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although a victory for Thrawn, it wasn't the result he was hoping for. Zaarin had deliberately committed a minor force with no attempt to capture. This was likely because Zaarin had Spies in the Empire and relayed to him the information about the trap.
