After the early rebellion suffered losses against the Galactic Empire during an attempted blockade run, rebel Hera Syndulla and members of her crew came to Shantipole in order to retrieve the prototype B-Wing, Prototype B6, which he dubbed the \"Blade Wing.\" Quarrie was initially uninterested, as he did not believe Syndulla to be the right pilot for his ship.

For the journey, he also installed a hyperdrive and an exterior astromech socket on Hera's shuttle Phantom. The Phantom then towed the B-wing prototype to the planet Ibaar.

After the Arrowhead sank into quick sand and exploded, Quarrie and Rowan worked together to rebuild the ship.
