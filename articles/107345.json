A four-thousand-meter battlecruiser, the Praetor-class was the successor of the Procurator-class Star Battlecruiser, though both were restricted in terms of hyperdrive capability and armament due to the Ruusan Reformation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the Quaestor was one of several Praetor-class battlecruisers that received additional armor and weaponry before leading strikes deep into Separatist space; the Quaestor was destroyed at Pammant when it suffered a hyperdrive mishap due to sabotage and crashed into the planet. This crash also fractured the planet. After the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Praetor-class battlecruiser Battalion hunted Separatist remnant forces, participated in the conflict known as the Sy Myrthian Insurrection and helped destroy a faction at Trasemene. While stationed in the Dalchon sector, the ship's commander, Adar Tallon, had grown disenfranchised with the Empire and defected from military service with a loyal crew. To cover their escape, Tallon arranged to have the Battalion be destroyed by his friend, the pirate captain Quist, in a mock rescue attempt of a freighter under attack by pirates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Praetor-class was eventually succeeded by the Praetor Mark II-class battlecruiser.
