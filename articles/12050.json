They escaped extinction, having been exported to Bespin long ago, along with the common thranta and its cousin, the giant thranta."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Balana subspecies was distinguished from the others by its larger body that had a brownish coloration. Furthermore, the wings themselves seemed more hook-like at the front giving an appearance of hands. The tail itself was also different with the horizontal lobes being larger than the vertical ones. Like the other thranta species, the Balana thranta would be trained to serve as a form as a transportation beast and allowed an open-seated raft to be strapped on the creature's back."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
