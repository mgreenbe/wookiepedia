When the leader of the colonists, Larbo, emerges to see what is happening, the young Boba Fett hurls a thermal detonator and flees into one of the tents. As chaos ensues, Jango Fett arrives to slaughter the scattered prey. When approached by two gun men, a flick knife appears from his gauntlet and, presumably, slits their throats. He then hunts down the other colonists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Larbo finds Boba cowering in the corner of his tent and holds him at gunpoint to interrogate him.
