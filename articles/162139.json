The birds had a wingspan of over four meters and were covered in waxy red feathers. Blood eagles had curved, red beaks and huge talons that were able to grab a fully grown member of the sentient Vratix species, which grew to an average height of 1.8 meters. The blood eagles flew over Thyferra's trees and alazhi fields searching for food. When they found prey, the eagles dove and snatched it up. If the target possessed armor, the eagles would use their beaks to beat it against rocks. Although the Vratix attempted to prevent the eagles from attacking them, deaths still occurred during the alazhi harvest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mechanical legs of Grievous, the leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems' droid army, were jointed in a way that allowed them to grab and crush objects similarly to the feet of the Vratixan blood eagle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vratixan blood eagle was first mentioned in the novelization of the 2005 prequel trilogy film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.
