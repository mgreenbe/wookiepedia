Anyone wanting to enter the city's normally-flooded sewer system had to begin at the sewage treatment plant, as the cloacas could only be emergency drained in a chain originating there. When Naboo was occupied by the Trade Federation, this prevented any of the Royal Naboo Security Forces personnel being held at Camp Four inside the city from using the sewers to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
