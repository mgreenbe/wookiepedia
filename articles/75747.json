He never had any objections to Imperial rule and, as a child, had watched landing vessels from a passing Imperial fleet pass over Tondatha and decided he wanted to join the Imperial Navy. This all changed however when the Empire, alleging that the residents of Tondatha had been plotting against Emperor Palpatine, destroyed the town with an orbital bombardment. At the time of the attack, Farlander was traveling through a binka forest in his T-16 skyhopper, on his way home from Calna Muun after running an errand for his father. Upon seeing the Imperial assault ship descending on Tondatha, he pushed the airspeeder to its limits trying to get back home. By the time he reached Tondatha, the Imperial attack had begun.

Due to Farlander's ability to assess a situation and react under pressure, he was selected to fly a lone Y-wing in the mission. The rescue was a success and negotiations between Sullustan rebels and the Alliance soon began. Both Farlander and Blastwell were assigned to fly patrol for a summit meeting between the two resistance groups.
