While visiting the local Imperial posting agency to access Lieutenant Jenkes' personal and military files, the Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk and his local guide Ezra Bridger saw that two of the computer consoles were being occupied by the Nimbanel and Ranat bounty hunters, who both carried holstered blasters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Nimbanel and his Ranat companion attempted to apprehend Bossk, who had been targeted for elimination by Jenkes. Bossk attempted to reason with them but the two ignored him, forcing Bossk to fight them. During the fight, Bossk slammed the barrel of his mortar gun into the Nimbanel's stomach and then stunned him.
