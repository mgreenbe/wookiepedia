He had a chronic disease, smashbone fever, that had been latent for years by 20 BBY. In that year, Zheepho was stationed on the planet Drongar while the Republic fought against the troops of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During his time on the planet, Zeepho suffered a sudden relapse of his disease, leaving him near death. Jedi Padawan Barriss Offee used the extract of bota\u2014a plant native to Drongar\u2014to treat his condition. Zheepho recovered just two minutes after the bota was injected into him, and he thanked Offee for her efforts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zheepho was desperate when he was struck by the smashbone fever on Drongar.

When Offee told him that she was not entirely sure what effects the bota would have on Rodian anatomy, he told her to use it on him anyway and suggested that he would even take poison if she gave it to him. Zheepho was very optimistic despite his illness and believed he could hold still long enough for Offee to inject him with the bota.
