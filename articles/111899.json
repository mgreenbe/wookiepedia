A rat had a hairless tail that was longer than its head and body combined, and Humans often deemed that tail \"ugly.\" They also had sensory whiskers on their faces. There existed various subspecies of rats, including a prong-nosed one that lived on Lotho Minor. Those creatures had a sharp sense of smell, which allowed them to detect both their predators and potential food sources efficiently. On occasion, they would feed on abandoned corpses.
