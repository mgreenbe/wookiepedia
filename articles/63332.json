Captain Hunor visited Ovin's cell and propositioned the Klatooinian with his own death in exchange for martyrdom. After Grunel recorded a barbed message to Chief of State Natasi Daala and the expanse of the HoloNet, Hunor was able to survive the destruction and issued a distress signal transmitter while he left the Fireborn. When the cospiracy fell apart, Hunor was one of the cospirators that were captured and eliminated by General Borath Maddeus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
