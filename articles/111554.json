Unbeknownst to Darklighter, Klivian, likewise accelerating his plans, began his own insurrection with his rebel cell with the help of the other pair of cells aboard the Rand Ecliptic. Klivian was able to lead the mutiny to success, taking over the frigate. Ironically, unbeknownst to any of the rebel cells, the captain himself was a Rebel agent codenamed Starfire, though he could not afford to reveal himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Darklighter and his group escaped the Rand Ecliptic during the chaos on TIE fighters\u2014which lacked hyperdrives.
