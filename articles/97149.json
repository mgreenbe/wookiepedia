He was one of the swoop racers that Revan met in Anchorhead 3956 BBY and the local favorite. Nico was a skilled swoop pilot, ready to tackle the intergalactic circuit. He was offered a contract by Motta that would allow him to race as a pro, but declined since the Hutt would collect most of his winnings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The problem regarding Nico's contract with Motta is a sidequest on Tatooine. The player can either help Nico get a better contract (light side choice), or force him into taking the current contract (dark side). Because the canon storyline features a light-side Revan, it can be believed that Revan helped Nico get a better contract."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
