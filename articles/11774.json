However, while the Bad Kitty was carrying High Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and several clone troopers to a Republic staging area, the gunship was shot down by Separatist flak guns. The resulting crash-landing killed everyone onboard except for Kenobi and a trooper nicknamed Trapper, and the Separatist ground forces soon started to attack the downed gunship, leaving the two survivors trapped inside. As the Separatists neared the Bad Kitty, two clone troopers, nicknamed Waxer and Boil, managed to reach the gunship, pull the survivors out of the Kitty's wreckage, and carry them back the Republic's staging area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bad Kitty was a Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunship, used by the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars between the Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems. Manufactured by Rothana Heavy Engineering, the Kitty had customized nose art painted on both sides, depicting of a nexu riding a bomb with the gunship's name written in aurebesh on the bomb. The Bad Kitty had a cockpit large enough to hold a clone pilot, a pair of anti-personnel laser turrets at the front of the vessel, two engines, and four composite-beam laser turrets, two of which were at either side of the Kitty and the other two built-into both of the gunship's wings. The Kitty had a passenger compartment in its center that was large enough to hold several grown Humans. Although the Bad Kitty was well armored, it could not withstand sustained enemy fire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 21 BBY, the Confederacy reactivated their battle droid foundries on the desert planet Geonosis, which the Republic had previously deactivated at the start of the war. In response, the Republic launched a full scale assault on Geonosis, sending a large Republic fleet\u2014including the Bad Kitty\u2014to conquer Geonosis and deactivate the factories. The Republic task force planned to launch a large, three-pronged aerial attack against the Separatists' well defended primary factory, protected by a shield generator. In the assault, the Bad Kitty would transport High Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2014who would lead the Republic's northern push\u2014and several Advanced Recon clone troopers, including a trooper nicknamed Trapper."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the battle, Kenobi and his troopers boarded the gunship, and the Kitty departed from a Republic Star Destroyer it had been stationed at, being one of the first gunships to launch. As the Kitty and the rest of Kenobi's gunships approached the Separatist perimeter line, they were met by a well prepared Confederate defense, including Geonosian proton and sonic cannons. Several of the Republic's gunships were destroyed by the Separatist anti-air fire, although the Kitty managed to evade the enemy's shot. However, as the Kitty neared the Republic's planned landing point\u2014designated Point Rain\u2014several Geonosian starfighters attacked the gunship, damaging its left engine, forcing the Bad Kitty into a crash-landing. The Republic vessel skidded across the desert ground, snapping off its left wing and killing everyone on board except General Kenobi and Trapper."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The downed gunship settled five kilometers away from the Republic's landing point, near the Separatists' defense lines, leaving Kenobi and Trapper trapped in the Kitty's wreckage. Meanwhile, the remainder of Kenobi's forces managed to arrive at Point Rain and set up a defense square around the landing point. Clone Commander Cody, who had taken command at the square, saw the downed gunship and, believing it to be the Bad Kitty, sent a pair of Advanced Recon troopers nicknamed Waxer and Boil to rescue any survivors. With the defense square giving covering fire, Waxer and Boil ran the five-kilometer distance, barely dodging Separatist artillery fire. The two recon troopers were able to reach the downed Kitty and pry off its right troop compartment door. Seeing the badly injured Kenobi and Trapper, Waxer and Boil helped the two out of the gunship's wreckage and walked the survivors back to the square, supporting Kenobi and Trapper with their shoulders. After getting back to the landing point, Kenobi and Trapper were given medical support."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Crew"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bad Kitty was flown by a clone pilot, and had a clone copilot who operated the ship's wing particle beam turrets.

As the Bad Kitty was clearly not flight-worthy after crashing, with one of its wings having been snapped off, it is unclear if this was meant to be a sister gunship with identical markings, if Bad Kitty was somehow repaired and put back into action in that short period of time, or if the episode's design team made an error in using the Kitty's modeling skin later in the episode."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
