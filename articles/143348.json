The Supreme Prophet Kadann prophesied that the next leader of the Empire would wear the indestructible right-hand glove of Darth Vader. The Rebel Alliance and the Senate Planetary Intelligence Network (SPIN), hoping to find information on the new emperor, send C-3PO and R2-D2 disguised to the planet Kessel. There they discover Grand Moff Bertroff Hissa introducing Trioculus, who claims to be the late Emperor's son, as the heir to the Empire. Although he manages to trick his followers by seemingly producing Force lightning, he demands that his advisors find the glove so he can cement his power. After much searching and no clues on the glove's whereabouts, Captain Dunwell, the head of the Whaladon Processing Center on Mon Calamari, contacts him to inform him that he has found the glove, deep in the oceans of Mon Calamari. By chance, Luke Skywalker and Admiral Ackbar, after picking up the droids from Kessel, bring them to Mon Calamari to download the information that R2-D2 found. Although the Whaladon-hunting submarine is destroyed and Captain Dunwell killed, Luke is unable to stop Trioculus from obtaining the glove and becoming the new Emperor. As he parts ways with Luke, Trioculus swears he will destroy him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 2012 reference book The Essential Reader's Companion dates the events of The Glove of Darth Vader and its sequels to 5 ABY, after Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor (2008) and before Dark Forces: Rebel Agent (1998)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Calamarian minisub from The Glove of Darth Vader later appeared in the 2018 comic book Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 15."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
