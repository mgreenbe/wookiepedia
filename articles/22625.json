After the fall of the Jedi, Kestis went to serve the Scrapper Guild as a rigger, a physically demanding and dangerous job. Kestis had a focused work ethic and a sense of humility. He generally kept to himself and was quiet and hard-working. He usually refused to speak of his past, as he was quite haunted by it. He felt that he could have saved his Master if only he followed his master's teachings. He usually reacted with anger or dismissed his past when it was brought up. Eventually, Kestis began to open up more about his past, and when confronted by the dark side on Dathomir for the second time in the form of his master, Kestis fully accepted his past and grew from the experience, acting much more level headed and wise, showing an almost mentor-like attitude towards others. Kestis had great respect and compassion for nature. When he visited Kashyyyk the second time, Kestis found an injured Shyyyo bird and treated his wound. When the Shyyyo bird helped Kestis to fly to his destination, Kestis was happy to see that there were many natural beauties in Kashyyyk that the Empire had not yet destroyed. At Dathomir, Kestis showed an impressive respect for life forms. He was attacked by a Chirodactyl who persistently tried to kill him, but after it died during his fight, Kestis mourned his death, saying that he wanted to be able to say that the creature was fine, despite trying to kill him. Kestis was extremely selfless, often putting the needs of others above his own. During his time hiding in Bracca, trying to avoid being found by the Empire, Kestis used the Force to save his friend Prauf when Prauf almost fell to death, even though he knew he risked the Empire discovering his Jedi identity.
