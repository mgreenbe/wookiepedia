The crew included Deeve, Jarsa and the droids Effcee and REM-02. They only had to find one good vein and the whole trip would cover expenses, but the first five planets proved to be unfruitful. Besides, the solar fins of the Founder were damaged by Mynocks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Deeve left the Founder to scout the fifth planet in their list.
