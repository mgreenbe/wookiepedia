In addition to greater docility, the clone template was modified to allow for growth acceleration, which was an essential aspect in the clone army's design as it ensured the units would reach adulthood in only a decade's time.

One group in particular had been created approximately five years prior to Kenobi's arrival."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Young clone cadets were given an intense, rapid education within the cloning facilities of the extragalactic planet Kamino. This form of training required the use of focus-enhancing helmets. They were also divided into separate teams as a means of encouraging teamwork and competitiveness among their ranks. At this stage in their training, cadets were supervised by Kaminoan scientists and fully-grown clone troopers who held the military rank of Clone Sergeant. By the time of the Clone Wars, the older cadets were overseen by hired mercenaries and Advanced Recon Commandos, who were on the lookout for clones who showed exceptional skill and potential for joining the ARC troopers' ranks. Jedi Master Shaak Ti, a member of the Jedi High Council, oversaw the clone trooper training program as the Jedi Order's liaison to the Kaminoan government led by Prime Minister Lama Su."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the Jedi's involvement, cadets were threatened with disposal by their engineers if they failed to pass their training.
