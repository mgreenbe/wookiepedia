Twitch was convinced she and the fellow soldier Maximian Ajax had made a big mistake on Bamayar, but instead of bringing up the mishap, Evon began talking to her about the buildings of the port. Hazram Namir, a First Sergeant in the 61st, briefly remembered the fighting on Bamayar while on the planet Haidoral Prime in 3 ABY. Twitch also recounted her experience with Evon at Chenodra later that year at a gathering after Evon's funeral."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle of Bamayar was mentioned in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
