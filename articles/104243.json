Although the Canto Bight Police Department could be called in to handle the most major disturbances, Brunce and his bouncers were responsible for dealing with the day to day security at the casino and used silent hand signals to communicate. During the Cold War between the First Order and the Resistance, Brunce spotted the former casino employee Kaljach Sonmi inside the building and tried to throw him out; however, the Suerton gambler Dodibin helped Sonmi earn enough cantocoins in a hazard toss bet to meet the minimum amount needed for him to remain and so Brunce let him be. Brunce had pink skin and gray eyes and was the only employee in the casino permitted to scowl. He wore a pair of black pants and boots with smartly tailored black jacket that concealed a stun baton."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pemmin Brunce was created for the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, which was released on December 15, 2017; however, prior to the films release he appeared in the short story \"The Ride\", which was written by John Jackson Miller and released as part of the Canto Bight anthology on December 5, 2017.
