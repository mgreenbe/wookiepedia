Two of these tugs helped the brain worm-infected frigate TB-73 dock at the medical station. The infected clone troopers had taken over the vessel and Padawans Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee were trying to gain control back."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tano had started the ship's cooling system, because the brain worms couldn't handle the freezing temperatures. Offee was infected too and there was a lightsaber battle between the Padawans on the main bridge. With no one at the controls, the ship was set on a high-speed collision course at the medical station. The two tugs had to use their tractor beam projectors at full power to prevent the frigate from crashing into the station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tugs were also used to move the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center to the vicinity of the Kaliida Nebula after its refurbishing by the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
