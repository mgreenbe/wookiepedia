Pilots had to choose between leaving hyperspace outside the Lamaro system and then piloting manually to a planet at sublight speed, or using very precise coordinates. Ships crossing The Reef at hyperspeed were known to suffer from hyperspace anomalies that destroyed components of the hyperdrive. Pilots suffering this fate had no option but landing in Bartyn's Landing, the only starport of the system where replacements could be found."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
