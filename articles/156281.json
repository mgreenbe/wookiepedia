Kryze was fleeing from CSF forces after being mistakenly identified as the murderer of Davu Golec of the Republic Ministry of Intelligence. Kryze ducked into an alley from which a driver in an airspeeder emerged a few seconds later. The driver was dressed with a hooded cloak similar to the Duchess.
