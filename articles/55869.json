In 4 ABY, Han Solo, Chewbacca and Weebacca, along with other Wookiee soldiers and workers, reoccupied the city and rebuilt the Government Tree in order to contact the New Republic for the situation on Kashyyyk. However, this was not possible, since the Imperial Remnant had installed three jamming stations nearby. The jammers were soon destroyed by Solo and the Wookiee army, allowing them to send their message."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Government Tree at Kepitenochan appeared during a mission in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its 2002 expansion pack.
