He was sent here by Emperor Palpatine himself, though it was not known why he was imprisoned. He thought that it may have been because the Emperor knew he could one day challenge him for control of the Empire. He helped Mozo Bondog uncover the mystery of the disappearing inmates by tasking a stranger to recover one of the inmates which had reappeared. Sometime after this, he tasked the individual with recovering the shadow shard, which was in fact a piece of a Sith holocron, from a Dark Jedi so that the individual could find the place of shadows and recover the shadow stone. After he studied the shard, Dolac informed the individual that there was an ancient evil on the planet; a Sith who could enslave the minds of others. This Sith was the one responsible for the missing prisoners; they had taken control of the prisoners minds as well as the Imperial guards who would wipe the evidence away and none would remember their actions. He had been contacted by this Sith before who had wanted his allegiance, but he refused to give it. He was also too powerful to be controlled like the other prisoners so the Sith warrior had made arrangements to have him destroyed. Because of this, he arranged for the individual to take out the Sith, and he gave the individual coordinates of where to find them. After this was done, he gave the individual 1,800 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dolac Legasi was a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Though it was never said specifically, it is likely that Dolac Legasi was in fact Force-sensitive; he was imprisoned on Dathomir by Emperor Palpatine, perhaps for being a threat to him, was too strong for the Sith to take control of his mind, and the Sith had wanted his allegiance after discovering this."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
