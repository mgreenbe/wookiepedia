To avoid arrest by the Galactic Empire, Kessra and the Vipers went into hiding and reformed themselves into a swoop gang, and they subsequently seized control of the streets of the city Zarra. Kessra also secretly began to work for the Hutt crime lord Darga Jiramma Mionne and she used the Vipers as a means by which to achieve Darga's goals in Zarra. In about 17 BBY, a group of Alderaanian Resistance agents traveled to Zarra and landed their Baudo-class star yacht Banshee in the city's spaceport. Once the agents had disembarked from their starship, Kessra and the Vipers surrounded the vessel and claimed that the agents had not paid the Vipers a landing fee, and thus each owed the gang 1,000 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
