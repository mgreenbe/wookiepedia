It was equipped with an Ion cannon as the main weapon, with 12 anti-personnel blasters to augment the cannon. While powerful, the SPHA-I also had to manage ammunition carefully like all of its other cousins. It was used to scramble the electronic systems of its targets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
