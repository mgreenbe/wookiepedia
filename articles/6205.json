It was over 1600 square meters in area, and presumably hosted many Imperial ambassadors, perhaps senators and other dignitaries. The pyramid was but a short distance from the Palace, and thus much closer to the main residence of Emperor Palpatine than other residential buildings like the 500 Republica or the Senate Apartment Complex."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This pyramid was first seen on a conceptual image by Ralph McQuarrie depicting the surroundings of the Imperial Palace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
