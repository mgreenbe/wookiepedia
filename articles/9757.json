The solid rock of the asteroid itself provided the equivalent of 95 RU hull plating, making armor reinforcement unnecessary. A generator provided energy for the launcher and a robust shield system, rated at 200 SBD. An eighteen meter tower housed the launcher itself, and it had the capacity to store a significant 50 individual warheads. These were usually concussion missiles, however the launcher could also be modified to fire proton torpedoes, heavy rockets, ion pulse missiles, mag pulse missiles or space bombs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally used around mining outposts for defensive purposes, where asteroid debris was common, these platforms provided a strong hidden defense capability wherever they were installed.
