He admitted in the book that he personally preferred his pikobi eggs served with some freshly grilled dianoga back, but since most readers would not have the skill required to cook a dianoga, he instead included the simpler deviled eggs recipe. He also claimed that the pikobi eggs in the dish could be substituted for almost any other type of egg and still produce a good result."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Deviled Pikobi Eggs were created as a recipe for the 2019 cookbook Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, which was written by Marc Sumerak and Chelsea Monroe-Cassel. In the out-of-universe recipe, boiled eggs are halved with the yolks removed, then the yolks are combined with emulsauce or mayonnaise, white miso paste, and toasted sesame oil to make a filling. The filled eggs are topped with a drop of sriracha and a sprinkling of black sesame seeds and red salt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
