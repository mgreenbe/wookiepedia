In 3640 BBY, Min-Reva was assigned to Sergeant Shanra Immel's squad and served with SpecForce Colonel Jace Malcom during a battle on Kalandis Seven, a desolate Inner Rim planet. During the course of the battle, the squad was tasked with the destruction of the local Imperial-controlled spaceport. On the way to the spaceport, the squad was attacked, though only one soldier was badly wounded, Corporal Amden vor Keioidian. Three hours later, Min-Reva and the squad finally reached the spaceport and started planting targeting beacons, which would allow Republic starfighters to destroy the spaceport regardless of the fog. Shortly after the squad finished planting the last of the beacons, the spaceport was destroyed by Republic starfighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Min-Reva first appeared, albeit voice only, in Alexander Freed's short story \"The Last Battle of Colonel Jace Malcom\" which was published within Star Wars Insider 137 and released on October 23, 2012.
