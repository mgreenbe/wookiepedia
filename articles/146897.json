To-yel spent much of his time sitting at a table in the restaurant and carving wooden figurines. His contented attitude contrasted with most of the other non-Humans in the Free Access Grill and elsewhere on Narg, who suffered under the pro-Human, anti-\"alien\" biases of the TransGalMeg corporate administration which ran Narg."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To-yel was in Grig City when a group of Rebel operatives, including Maytoc Kollene, arrived to rescue the kidnapped Shashay musician Crying Dawn Singer from TransGalMeg executive Braig Farool."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on Narg, To-yel was a cheerful individual who managed to appear friendly despite his heavy brows and protruding head cones.
