Some time after the Battle of Yavin, Ribba owned a textile business which was, on its surface, legitimate. After the Hutt discovered that a member of the organization was embezzling funds, Ribba hired bounty hunters to track down the individual, with the condition that they be returned to Ribba alive. After tracking the embezzler to the planet of Celanon, the hunters killed the wanted man during a firefight within a bar. The preconditions of the bounty dispelled, Ribba refused to pay the reward to the bounty hunters, who remained on Celanon to seek other work."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ribba was mentioned in 1997's No Disintegrations, a sourcebook for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, in an adventure titled Gone To Ground, written by Kevin M MacGregor.
