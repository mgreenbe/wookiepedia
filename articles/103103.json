A human from the Mid Rim planet of Naboo, Sidious was born into a prestigious family that formed part of the nobility in Naboo society. The bloodline was artificially continued through his son, an artificial strandcast grown from the cloned DNA of Sidious, which sired Rey in turn. Unlike her father, Rey inherited her grandfather's powerful connection to the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sidious trained in the ways of the dark side of the Force while serving as the Sith apprentice of Darth Plagueis. He eventually killed his Sith Master and trained several apprentices in turn, from Darth Maul to Darth Tyranus and Darth Vader. Retaining his birth name, he cultivated two identities as Palpatine and Sidious. Both personas served to further the Grand Plan of restoring the Sith to dominance over the galaxy. As Palpatine, he rose to power in the ranks of the Galactic Senate, first as a senator representing the Royal House of Naboo and then as Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. As Sidious, he secretly influenced powerful organizations, including the Trade Federation and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. He secured greater executive authority through the chaos that ensued from the Clone Wars, a galactic conflict that he orchestrated as both Sidious and Palpatine. By the time of the war's conclusion, he formally ended the Republic by declaring himself Emperor of the Galactic Empire. With the rise of his new regime and the near annihilation of the Jedi Order, Palpatine discarded his public persona and lived as Sidious full time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sidious' reign lasted throughout most of the Imperial Era. The name of Palpatine all but disappeared in the minds of the subjects he ruled, and Sidious became known simply as \"the Emperor.\" His rule ended during the Galactic Civil War between the Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic; during the Battle of Endor, Vader sacrificed himself in order to save his son, the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, destroying the Emperor who turned him against the Jedi. As the last Sith Lords in existence, the deaths of Sidious and Vader ended the thousand year lineage of Darth Bane, fulfilling Anakin Skywalker's destiny as the Chosen One. However, Sidious was resurrected on Exegol, an ancient Sith world hidden in the Unknown Regions. His spirit was forced to inhabit a body that was cloned from his own genetic template while his followers, the members of the Sith Eternal cult, searched for ways to ensure his survival."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Emperor's son was a byproduct of Sidious' experiments. The strandcast exhibited no sensitivity to the Force despite inheriting Sidious' bloodline, which continued through his daughter Rey.

The name of Palpatine was largely forgotten in the Galactic Empire that replaced the Galactic Republic; it was by the title of Emperor that he was known to the galaxy's population.

However, Vader acted sooner than Sidious anticipated, and while his spirit had managed to escape from his doomed body, his new form proved inadequate. Using the Emperor's genetic material, the Sith Eternal created a bioengineered vessel to replace Sidious' original body in the event of his death. Ultimately, his cloned body could not sustain the dark power attached to Sidious' soul, leading to rapid deterioration and the threat of a permanent death. His followers labored tirelessly to keep the Dark Lord alive while they searched for a solution, using Clone Wars-era technology and an ancient Ommin harness to preserve his new body as long as possible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith cultists continued to work with Sidious' genetic template without success, creating various failed strandcasts, including a non-identical clone who was healthy, but lacked his father's connection to the Force.

However, he allowed his clone to live in order to continue his bloodline through more natural methods, hoping to achieve more favorable results. An unexpected union was eventually formed between the clone and a woman, which, in turn, led to the birth of Rey in 15 ABY.

Though Ochi succeeded in capturing the child's parents, bringing them aboard his starship, the Bestoon Legacy, he was unable to find Rey. Her parents protected her by selling her away.

Unaware of her dormant Force powers, she believed her survival was owed to chance.

The connection between Rey and Ren caused them to gain deeper insights into one another, with Rey sensing the dark apprentice's internal struggle against the pull to the light. However, the bridging of their minds allowed Ren to discover the insecurities Rey harbored about her past and, in particular, her parents, much to the scavenger's dismay.

Although Rey felt more lost than ever due to her experience in the cave, Ren assured her that she was not alone.

He then compelled Rey to confront her worst fears by admitting the truth she had long suppressed\u2014her parents were nobody. Ren elaborated, telling Rey that they were mere junk traders who bartered their daughter away for drinking money. Ultimately, they were both dead and buried in a pauper's grave in the Jakku desert. The revelation brought tears to Rey's eyes, for she sensed no deception in Ren's intentions. Nevertheless, Rey resisted Ren's entreaty and helped the Resistance survive the Battle of Crait.

This turn of events motivated Ren to seek the phantom Emperor's location, unwilling to tolerate any threat to his reign. Using a Sith wayfinder that once belonged to his grandfather, he made his way to Exegol where he confirmed the existence of the Sith Eternal cult.

During their confrontation on Pasaana, Ren pushed Rey to give in to her anger, resulting in a burst of Force lightning from her hand. After witnessing the demonstration of Rey's capacity for darkness, Ren revealed that the Emperor was not only her grandfather, but that he was also responsible for the deaths of her mother and father. Additionally, Ren made a discovery relating to the bond between him and Rey\u2014they were a dyad, two separate beings who were one in the Force.

However, Sidious' plan was disrupted by the actions of Ren's mother, Princess Leia Organa, who, with her dying breath, called her son back to the light, leading Ben Solo to renounce the dark persona of Kylo Ren. During the Battle of Exegol, Sidious urged Rey to succeed him and become \"Empress Palpatine.\" He used Rey's attachment to her friends as leverage in turning her to the dark side. Rey found her grandfather's power intoxicating and was tempted by his offer, believing the galaxy would have no choice but to accept salvation if she became the Empress.

Realizing the power of their bond could heal his clone body, Sidious restored his strength by almost completely draining both Solo and Rey of their life force.

Then after the screening, I went for a drink with my agent and everyone, and we were chatting away and I realized that oh, in their minds it's not answered at all!\" She later revealed that Obi-Wan Kenobi was considered as one of the possibilities for her grandfather; According to Ridley, Abrams went back-and-forth on Rey's lineage, even during filming of The Rise of Skywalker, and making her a descendant of Kenobi was still in the mix.

What is the thing for her and for us what will make her have to stand on her own two feet and will make things the hardest for her?\" After the release of The Last Jedi, Simon Pegg said \u201cI know what J.J. kind of intended, well, at least what was sort of being chucked around. I think that's kind of been undone slightly by the last one. There was some talk about, you know, a kind of relevant lineage for her. But I honestly don't know, and I don't know if anybody knows.

There were some very specific things we did get to do in this movie that we were laughing and going, 'Oh my god, we're finally doing that thing we talked about five years ago.'\" He elaborated thematically that \"one of the themes of the movie is that anyone can be anything regardless of where you're from, and I don't know if it resonates for everyone but I think there are quite a few people who appreciate that idea of not coming from a place that you're not particularly excited about following or proud of. And though I completely understand 'you're nobody' is a devastating thing, to me the more painful, the more shocking thing was the idea that you're from the worst possible place. And is that thing that you feel that you know is part of you somehow, that you're haunted by, is that your destiny? And the idea that there are things more powerful than blood, as Luke says, that thing was a really important thing to convey for us.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
