It was believed that they were one of a few races that survived a full attack from the Mandalorian Crusaders. By not being conquered and their devotion to battle, they earned the respect of the Mandalorians, who allowed many of the Mandallian Giants into their ranks. Since that time, they were allowed to fight in many wars of conquest alongside the Mandalorians. They were known to welcome any fighter that came in their way."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chewbacca encountered a Mandallian Giant casino bouncer when he was aboard The Wheel about 0 ABY, but defeated him easily."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
