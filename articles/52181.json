The background information for several of the alien races who had appeared on screen was also invented for the game. Many of the new species and backgrounds were used in later works in the Expanded Universe with little modification. However, some retcons are needed to bring Galaxy Guide 4 in line with the prequel-era Expanded Universe. The most common retcons necessary are those where a species described as having its first contact with the Galactic Empire are shown in later works to have some contact with the Galactic Republic. Since Obo Rin is said in the text to be an unreliable source with an Imperial bias, these retcons are usually made by blaming inaccuracies on deliberate Imperial propaganda and misinformation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "From the publisher"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aliens!
