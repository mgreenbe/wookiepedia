The ship worked together with two other pirate vessels, one named Profit and piloted by a male named Druug and the other called Pillage piloted by a male named Larken. The three vessels lay in wait undercover of a magnetic storm for their target, a Helix-class light interceptor named Kizbon's Box, whose location they knew due to a tip from a female named Sahr. When the target arrived the Trust Me sent a a binary pulse to signal the others and the ships moved to attack the supposedly unarmed interceptor, only to discover that it was armed with proton torpedos which it used to destroy the Trust Me immediately."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Trust Me first appeared in 1995 the article \"A Buyer's Guide to Alternative Starships\" which was published in the fifth issue of the Star Wars Adventure Journal series of supplement books for West End Games, Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.
