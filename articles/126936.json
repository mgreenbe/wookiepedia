As the speeder attempted to make a second strafing run, Scourge stepped out and threw his lightsaber at the speeder damaging the back end. Shortly after the speeder clipped the statue he was hiding behind and crash landed. The Sith Lord charged the disorrinted male as the female drew her blaster pistols and opened fire on the Sith in an attempt to cover her partner. In response Scourge leapt over the damaged speeder and slew the male mercenary before he could open fire with his blaster rifle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In retaliation for her partners' death she fired another barrage at the Sith and managed to clip his shoulder. In anger Scourge unleashed a force wave that blasted her into a nearby statue. After regaining her balance she pulled out an electrorod, while dropping into a fighting crouch. As they circled each other Scourge offered her a chance to live in exchange for the identity of the person who hired them. Before she could make a decision, she was shot by Nyriss's security chief and five guards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the skirmish Nyriss revealed to Scourge that she hired the mercenaries to follow a lead pertaining to the recent attacks on her life and she was left with an excess of agents after the Emperor's interference. She advised Scourge to think of the skirmish as a test stating that had he failed he would have been unworthy to server her, just as if he succeeded he would have proved that they were a waste of resources, either way leaving her with the perfect candidate for the job. After the revelation she told him about the lead and that the droid that almost killed her during the second attack on her life came from a plant on the planet Hallion. She sent Scourge and Sechel on a mission to infiltrate the the plant and discovered who purchased the droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The skirmish first appeared in Drew Karpyshyn's novel The Old Republic: Revan which was released on November 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
