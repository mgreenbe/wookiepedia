It denationalized control of the Planetary Security Forces back into the hands of the sector governments. Members of the New Republic would also be expected to support the New Republic Defense Force but could also now control their own planetary defense forces and at greater strength than under the Galactic Empire or the Galactic Republic. This decision caused many sectors who had been on the edge, to side with the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
