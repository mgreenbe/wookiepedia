The factory specialized in assembling the interior parts of stormtrooper armor and worked with Quelton Fabrication, another armory company. Many of the company's Ithorian workers were opposed to the Galactic Empire, and delayed the production of stormtrooper armor. The workers were supported by the factory's owner Mawdo Larrth, who treated his employees gingerly. After the Imperial efficiency expert Count Denetrius Vidian executed Larrth for colluding with Thetis Quelton against the Empire, the Empire merged Cladtech and Quelton and brought them under the control of the Imperial Department of Military Research."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
