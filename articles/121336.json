The casino city of Canto Bight was located on its shores. From orbit, the sea's shape belied its artificially created nature. Its creation caused the lower levels of Canto Bight to become damp and dank, with occasional moisture seepage, and coastal sump pumps worked full time to keep the water at bay. Water evaporated at a rate of several tons per day on the desert planet, making the cost of maintaining the artificial sea astronomical. It had the effect of creating the strange phenomenon of a dark-purple glow on the horizon at sunset."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
