It fired bursts of five rounds, which was useful in close-quarters combat. The gun also had two scopes that were used for different firing options. Rebel troopers, Imperial officers, and stormtroopers sometimes used it despite its poor recoil and because of its high rate of fire. It was very similar to the SE-14r light repeating blaster in both name and design."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The SC-14C used in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope is based on a modified Rexim-Favor submachine gun.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
