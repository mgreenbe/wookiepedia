By the year 19 BBY, Attichitcuk was already a light-furred elderly Wookiee. Nevertheless, he participated in the Battle of Kashyyyk, serving as a gunner aboard an Oevvaor Jet Catamaran piloted by Zittaasabba and Wullffwarro. The old Wookiee threw thermal detonators at the enemy, having practiced his throw in virtual-reality games played on a mind evaporator headest. He later went on to mentor the Trandoshan Doshanalawook, daughter of Cradossk and clutchmate of Bossk. With his help, Doshanalawook eventually made a name for saving Wookies from slavery, taking on the alias Chainbreaker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Attichitcuk was first mentioned in Star Wars canon in the 2018 Star Wars Anthology film Solo: A Star Wars Story.

In his conceptual drawings, Johnston described Attichitcuk as a \"350-375 years old\" Wookiee.

According to concept artist Sang Jun Lee, \"Chewbacca's father\" was meant to be killed during the course of the movie, which would have prompted Chewie to run away and meet Han Solo. This concept, however, didn't make it into the final film. In January 2003, Lucas told the creation team that a young Han Solo would be featured and that by the time of Episode III, he was being raised on Kashyyyk by Chewbacca. Eventually, both ideas were utterly abandoned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
