Enraged, he plotted to murder Nettic. At the same time, Lusoff planned to kill Nettic, feeling cheated out of money. Several weeks after the destruction of the Outer Rim ecumenopolis world of Taris at the hands of the Sith Empire,  Nettic was out in an Ancient Grove near the Jedi Enclave during a cloudy morning. Guld intercepted him, and shot him in the back with a blaster. However, at the same time, Lusoff was also planning to kill Nettic. Seeing Guld standing there, Lusoff took the shot with his hunting rifle, shooting Guld in the side of his abdomen. When he ran out of the brush, Lusoff injured his leg, while Guld dropped his blaster and called the authorities, beleiving he was about to be killed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Investigation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Jedi Master named Bolook was assigned to the scene, and filled the role of an investigator.

They sent the dropped blaster and a sample of blood found on the scene to the Enclave for analysis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few hours later, an amnesiac Revan was sent on his third and final initiate trial by Zhar Lestin of the council. Revan was to cleanse a dark taint, the fallen Padawan Juhani, from the Ancient Grove. When he passed through the crime scene, he was stopped by Bolook, who requested his assistance. Bolook saw the investigation as a way for Revan to further his training, wanting him to solve the crime on his own. After examining Guld and Lusoff's stories, Revan began to pick out inconsistencies. When the blood and blaster were confirmed not to have been Nettic's, Revan was able to deduce the true story, and presented his conclusion to Bolook. Bolook was surprised at the boldness of the claim, but took the two men into custody, and escorted them to the Enclave's holding facilities. Rickard Lusoff was charged with agravated assault and attempted murder, while Handon Guld was formally charged with Nettic's murder.
