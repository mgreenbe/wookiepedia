Whenever a slashrat had made a kill, the pack would unleash a combination of sweat and pheromones called killscent. When a slashrat was killed, its corpse would release a different scent called stink, which would warn away other slashrats. Killscent would attract slashrats from miles away, sometimes from multiple packs, forming an inescapable zone called a killball. One strategy for escaping slashrats was to distract them with a killball, since they would ignore all other prey. Ganner Rhysode and Corran Horn fought slashrats when they were on Bimmiel. They also spread killscent all over a Yuuzhan Vong camp so that the slashrats would attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Slashrats were capable of running at speeds of up to 40 kilometers per hour."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
