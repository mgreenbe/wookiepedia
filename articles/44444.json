These devices were employed by the Taris dueling ring during the Jedi Civil War after the Sith Empire outlawed death matches. The fields most often prevented the individuals from dying during the arena combat, but they did not prevent the duelists from sustaining serious injuries or being rendered unconscious."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
