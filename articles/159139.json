Desolate and hot, the valley was 220 kilometers long, and off-worlders and disgraced members of the Yevetha species were often exiled there as a punishment. While the banished Yevetha were only exiled to the valley after the performance of a number of ceremonies and rituals, off-worlders sent to the valley were merely transported there in landspeeders and thrown out. Despite the unforgiving landscape, a small community of off-worlders eventually established a settlement in the valley, were they were able to eke out an existence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
