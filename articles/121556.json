After arriving there, Amidala discovered that Clovis was working with Senator Lott Dod and Archduke Poggle the Lesser in building the biggest droid factory that would give them great profits. Poggle and Dod insisted they should get a greater share of the profits, but Clovis refused. Poggle and Dod then decided to poison Amidala to get Clovis to change the deal. Amidala then stole the hologram disc of the factory before succumbing to the effects of the poison. Skywalker, disguised as her pilot, was able to get the disc and save Amidala when Clovis gave her the antidote. However, Skywalker left him behind without the disc."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle near Dorin, the Republic sent Jedi Generals Ki-Adi-Mundi, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luminara Unduli, and Anakin Skywalker to take Geonosis with a massive invasion. The Jedi Generals then spoke with the Outer Rim Command about their plans for the coming battle. They would attack the shield generator protecting the factory with a three-pronged assault. They hoped to capture Poggle who holed up at the factory.

Despite the strafing runs performed by the BTL-B Y-wing bomber squadron, the gunships came under heavy fire from Geonosian air and ground defenses. Mundi's and Commander Jet's forces then followed. However, Mundi and Jet were forced to land their AT-TEs away from the rendezvous point due to the underestimation of the Geonosian resistance. Simultaneously, Skywalker's, Commander Ahsoka Tano's, and Captain Rex's gunships were shot down and all their AT-TEs were destroyed. Despite that, Skywalker, his team, and the rest of his forces continued towards the rendezvous point. Mundi's gunship was shot down and Mundi was wounded. Commander Cody was able to land his AT-TEs, but the landing area came under fire from the Geonosians and their AATs. Kenobi's gunship was then hit and crash landed away from the landing zone. Only Kenobi and clone trooper Trapper survived the crash, though the two had to be rescued by clone troopers Waxer and Boil after the gunship was spotted by the clones. Kenobi and Trapper were brought to Point Rain, and AT-TE 636 gave covering fire for the group. Kenobi, Cody and their troopers then held the rendezvous awaiting Skywalker's and Mundi's forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Mundi's forces made their way through the Caltrop field to the rendezvous point, Jet contacted Admiral Wullf Yularen for air support. The Admiral however, could not divert any air support with risks to other units. Despite that, Yularen gathered a squadron and put it in reserve. Jet then left a squad with the AT-TEs and went with Mundi and his clone flametroopers to the rendezvous. They went into a cave that Mundi believed would be the quickest way to the rendezvous point. In the cave, they were then attacked by Geonosians, but were able to fight their way to the end the cavern."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker's forces then made their way to the rendezvous point against the Geonosians and their gun emplacements.

Skywalker's and Mundi's forces then joined Kenobi's to plan the last part of their attack. Skywalker would attack the outer defenses of the fortress while Kenobi brought in the AT-TEs and Mundi the gunships. Skywalker, Tano and a squad were able to penetrate the shield. They then threw droid poppers at the fortress's proton cannons, disabling them. Kenobi then brought the AT-TEs in range of the shield generator and destroyed. After the shield went down, Mundi brought in the gunships and captured the remaining Geonosians.

The super tanks were not finished yet but would be ready. The droids were then deployed, marching across the bridge to fight the clones. As the two forces fought, TX-21 then sent in Geonosians to attack from above. Despite this, Skywalker's and Unduli's forces were able to defeat the droids. However, Poggle, at the urging of TX-21, deployed the super tanks. As they moved in on the clones, Skywalker ordered their cannons to fire at it, to no effect.

Unfortunately, Offee inadvertently woke one of the Geonosians, who informed Poggle and TX-21 of this. After planting the bombs, Offee and Tano were then confronted by Poggle, TX-21, their Geonoisans and a super tank. Tano threw a charge onto the tank that failed to even dent the super tank, but destroyed TX-21 in the blast. Offee and Tano then fought the Geonosians to get their bombs back, but failed. When Tano was knocked out, Offee took the droid drivers and took control of the super tank.

It was believed this was a mistake, as the temple had been severely damaged in the open phases of the Republic's campaign, but once inside they were unexpectedly attacked. Buzz was killed in the fighting and Luminara was then captured. After the sandstorm, Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Commander Cody led force of clones, including Gearshift, to investigate. Heading into the catacombs, they encountered reanimated Geonoisans and eventually encountered the Geonosian queen, Karina the Great. She told Kenobi and Skywalker about her brain worms, which would enable her to control the minds of three Force-sensitives. However, using the clone trooper's lights to blind their enemies, the Republic forces managed to rescue Luminara and capture Poggle.
