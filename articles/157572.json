Jho, the owner of the cantina, offered some refreshments when they visited, which the commanding officer refused in anger. He then questioned Jho by showing an holographic image of Clarr.

Meanwhile, unknown to the trooper, Clarr quietly approached to the transport that the stormtroopers came by while Calrissian was drawing their attention. As the squad leader threatened him, Calrissian said he and Vizago would be worth more alive than dead because they were rebels. In response, the trooper ordered his men to stuncuff them in order to bring them to Agent Kallus, however, a laser blast from the Imperial Troop Transport hijacked by Clarr hit his back, resulting in his death.
