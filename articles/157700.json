He was present in the gang's base during the gang's encounter with \"Captain Drebble\", Lando Calrissian in disguise. After helping to deface a wanted poster of Han Solo, the alien witnessed the arrival of \"Drebble\" and his nameless Wookiee. When Koruu attempted to kill Drebble for insulting Lemo, the gang's leader, the tusked criminal was the first to exclaim Koruu's death when Calrissian threw a knife through Koruu's chest. Impressed with \"Drebble's\" skill, the tusked criminal accompanied the gang to a dinner to talk with Drebble about helping the gang find the valuable artifacts, the Dancing Goddess and the Minstrel. The tusked criminal shared a glass of Deltron spice wine with \"Drebble\", but he poured out his drink in order to keep his head, as he was trying to get Calrissian drunk so that he would spill his plan and the gang could just kill the man and take his strategy for free."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the dinner, this pirate let slip that Han Solo was being brought to Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine. Since this was the information that Calrissian had been looking for, he let down his guard, accidentally revealing his true identity. With \"Drebble\" unmasked, the gang pulled their weapons on the man. However, Chewbacca came to Calrissian's rescue, attacking the group with a bench. The two Rebels were able to escape the planet despite attacks by the gang."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
