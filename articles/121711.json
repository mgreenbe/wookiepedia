However, the child was being protected by Din Djarin, a Mandalorian bounty hunter who went rogue from the Bounty Hunters' Guild in order to rescue and protect the child, which he raised as a foundling of his clan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Djarin was quested with reuniting Grogu with his own kind, which a Mandalorian armorer identified as being the Jedi. With the help of fellow Mandalorian Bo-Katan Kryze, Djarin eventually located former Jedi Ahsoka Tano, who refused to train Grogu and instead directed Djarin to a temple on Tython, where Grogu could reach out through the Force and potentially be sensed by another Jedi. There, however, he was found by Gideon's forces, who captured Grogu, returned him to Gideon's light cruiser, and then jumped into hyperspace to a location unknown to Djarin. However, Djarin was joined in his quest to rescue Grogu by Boba Fett and Fennec Shand, who deemed themselves indebted to Djarin after he allowed Fett to keep his armor that he had previously captured. After raiding an Imperial remnant base on Morak with the help of Djarin's friend Cara Dune, a New Republic marshal, and ex-Imperial sharpshooter Migs Mayfeld, Djarin and his allies discovered the coordinates to Gideon's light cruiser."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Djarin, Dune, Fett, and Shand captured Gideon's Shuttle 2743, which had been transporting Doctor Pershing, a clone engineer overseeing the experiments and killed one of the two pilots. They then traveled to a desert world where they enlisted the aid of Mandalorian warriors Bo-Katan Kryze and Koska Reeves; Kryze sought to reclaim the Darksaber from Moff Gideon, who had acquired the weapon following the Great Purge, in order to reclaim the Mandalorian throne and unite the Mandalorians to take back their homeworld of Mandalore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The rescue"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arriving out of hyperspace near Moff Gideon's light cruiser, Boba Fett, from the Slave I, feigned fire on the shuttle containing the rest of the team. He drew away three TIE/ln space superiority starfighters that deployed from Gideon's cruiser while the shuttle crash landed through the launch tube into the cruiser, allowing the team to board it. Fett blasted the starfighters before then jumping to hyperspace himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside the cruiser, Dune, Shand, Kryze, and Reeves made their way to the bridge, fighting against stormtroopers along the way, while Djarin alone snuck to Grogu's cell. As he made his way to the child's cell, Djarin found the cargo bay storing the platoon of third-generation dark troopers; however, the combat droids had already been activated. Using Pershing's code cylinder, Djarin closed the doors, though one of the droids escaped and caught Djarin. Djarin ultimately destroyed it with his beskar staff and opened up the room's sealed doors, pulling the rest of the platoon out into space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the rest of the team seized the bridge, Djarin defeated the troopers guarding the child's cell; but inside, he found Gideon with the Darksaber unsheathed and above Grogu. Gideon forced Djarin to kick his blaster pistol over to him, and tricked Djarin into a false deal: in exchange for the child, Djarin agreed to leave Gideon and never cross paths with him again. When Djarin moved in, Gideon attacked the Mandalorian with the Darksaber. In the hallway outside the cell, Djarin unsheathed his beskar spear and briefly dueled Gideon, ultimately defeating the moff."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Djarin freed Grogu, took the Darksaber, and delivered a captured Gideon to the bridge before Kryze and the rest of the team. Gideon remarked that Kryze was unable to take the Darksaber, and thus claim the Mandalorian throne, for she had not defeated him in combat, but Djarin had instead. With their rocket boosters, the dark trooper droid platoon flew back to Gideon's cruiser and boarded it, eventually making their way to the bridge; the team sealed the blast doors to stall them, though the droids began to punch the doors in an effort to pound through them. However, before the droids could breach the doors, a T-65B X-wing starfighter arrived out of hyperspace and docked inside the cruiser."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From the bridge, the team and Moff Gideon watched the security cameras as a mysterious robed figure wielding a green-bladed lightsaber cut his way through the droids; Kryze identified the figure to be a Jedi. The Jedi eventually ascended in an elevator to the hallway before the bridge and destroyed the remaining dark troopers. Gideon picked up a nearby blaster pistol that he had been hiding and repeatedly shot Kryze; however, before he could then fire on Grogu, Djarin leaped in front of the child, shielding him with his beskar armor. Gideon then attempted to kill himself with the blaster, but Dune knocked him out before he could."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the remaining dark troopers destroyed, Din Djarin opened up the blast doors as the Jedi entered through the smoke, turned off his lightsaber and removed his hood, revealing himself to be Luke Skywalker. Djarin asked if he was a Jedi, to which Skywalker confirmed he was. Skywalker beckoned Grogu to come with him, and informed Djarin that the child was asking for his permission. Djarin gave the child his blessing and wished him farewell, removing his helmet to say goodbye. Alongside his astromech droid, R2-D2, Skywalker then took Grogu with him as he departed from the cruiser."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rescue appeared in \"Chapter 16: The Rescue\" of Jon Favreau's 2019 Disney+ television series The Mandalorian, written by Favreau, directed by Peyton Reed and released on December 18, 2020."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
