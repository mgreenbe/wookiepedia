The trees grew prolifically, forming large rainforests, leading the native Garqians to practice slash-and-burn techniques to clear areas of land. After cultivating crops in the rich soil produced by the bimiza, the land was then left to be reclaimed by the bimiza forests. In Pesktda, the capital city of Garqi, tall bimizas were used to line avenues and to separate residential suburbs. The trees also lent their name to Bimiza Hill, an area of tapcafes near to Pesktda Port."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bimiza species of tree was created for Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds, a roleplaying game sourcebook published by Wizards of the Coast in 2004."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
