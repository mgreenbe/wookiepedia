During the time of the New Republic, the surviving Mandalorians were scattered in coverts across the galaxy, preserving their way of life. One covert, situated on the Outer Rim planet Nevarro, was home to the group known as the Tribe, who practiced the ancient Way of the Mandalore. After the Nevarro covert came under attack from the forces of the Imperial remnant led by Moff Gideon, one of its members, the bounty hunter Din Djarin, intended to find other Mandalorians and chart a path through the network of coverts in order to return the Force-sensitive infant known as Grogu to the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
