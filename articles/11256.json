The droid served the Galactic Republic's Navy as a strategic advisor and was responsible for the deft tactical maneuvering employed by the Republic at the First Battle of Bothawui. As commendation for its success at Bothawui, the Republic ordered that B-3G9 be returned to his factory of origin and undergo maintenance and upgrades; however, due to an administrative error on the part of Czerka and before it could be halted, the droid's circuitry was already partially repathed to conform to that of a standard protocol droid unit. The changes diminished B-3G9's tactical facilities, but the droid was still able to serve the Republic Navy as a manager of individual starship defense systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "B-3G9 is a non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011.
