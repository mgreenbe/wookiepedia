Around 2 BBY, Melch was a slave laborer who worked on Reklam Station on the planet Yarma. Reklam Station was commanded by Commander Brom Titus, a former Admiral who had been relieved of his position for losing an experimental Imperial Interdictor. There, he was given the call number \"Laborer 429\" and was part of an Ugnaught work gang tasked with dismantling decommissioned Old Republic Y-wing starfighters. Melch was an acquaintance of Terba, an Ugnaught who attempted to escape Reklam Station but was imprisoned on the planet Naraka."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to his death, Terba informed the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka about the Imperial dismantling operations at Reklam Station. Melch and his fellow laborers were working at the orbital dismantling space station when Hondo and the Spectres infiltrated the station. Hondo, who could speak Ugnaught, convinced Melch and his fellow laborers to help the rebels in return for their liberation. Melch agreed to shut down the furnace conveyor belt. When Commander Titus inquired what was going on, Melch claimed that the conveyor belt had malfunctioned. Titus then threatened to execute the Ugnaught if he did not repair it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Melch and the Ugnaughts then helped the rebels refuel the Y-wings. Before they could leave, the rebels were spotted by Commander Titus, who activated the magnetic locks. Melch and several Ugnaughts then followed Hondo into the command tower in order to free the starfighters. There, Hondo and his Ugnaughts spotted an Imperial Sentinel-class landing craft and offered to guard it. While the Spectres dealt with Titus and his DTS-series Dismantler Droids and stormtroopers, Melch, his Ugnaught comrades and Hondo escaped aboard the landing craft and headed into space.

Later, Hondo and Azmorigan returned with Ezra Bridger and Garazeb Orrelios, two members of the Spectres. Upon seeing Hondo, Melch attacked his boss and punched him several times before being restrained by Ezra. Ezra quickly recognized him as one of Hondo's Ugnaught crew he had encountered at Reklam Station. At Zeb's insistence, Hondo told Zeb and Ezra that he had made an earlier attempt to raid the Imperial ship and had abandoned his Ugnaught crew.

The Spectres insisted on loading their cargo of proton bombs first in return for helping Hondo and Azmorigan. When the rebels and their confederates came under attack from DT-series sentry droids, Melch hid inside Hondo's treasure box. He realized that Hondo only cared for himself despite his rhetoric about regarded his crew as his \"sweet, fragrant family.\" This allowed him to survive the destruction of the Imperial cargo ship, which crashed into a vortex."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once aboard the Spectres' ship Ghost, Melch surprised Hondo and Azmorigan by revealing that he had hidden himself inside the chest. While Hondo was disappointed, he remarked that friendship was the treasure he had discovered that day.

Rex managed to shoot the pursuing stormtrooper while Melch exchanged fire with the other stormtroopers in the north tower. However, Melch was struck by a blaster bolt. A distraught Hondo then shot the remaining stormtroopers in revenge. Attending to Melch, Hondo chastised Melch for forgetting that he was not a hero but a pirate. Fortunately, Melch had only been stunned and the two friends celebrated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a pod of purrgil took Ezra and Thrawn away with the Chimaera, Melch and his rebel comrades took the Dome, which turned out to be a mobile Imperial Planetary Occupation Facility, into Lothal's upper atmosphere.

On one occasion, he smuggled himself inside a cargo chest to preempt Hondo leaving him behind.

At times, Melch was prepared to use violence to display his anger and disagreement with Hondo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite this, Hondo did care about him, as seen by how he was overjoyed to see that Melch had survived being shot during the Liberation of Lothal.
