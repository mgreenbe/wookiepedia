The base was commanded by General Carlist Rieekan, and served as a stopover point for civilians moving to Alliance safe worlds. Two months after the base went operational, it was discovered by Imperial forces. An evacuation of the base was ordered, but there were not enough transports to evacuate both civilians and military personnel. With civilians getting priority, Captain Bren Derlin led a squad of soldiers into the Nentan wastes where they stole an Imperial ship and escaped the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
