Capable of reaching a length of two meters, Galub slugs had the ability to adhere to any solid surface using a powerful form of suction. They did this to attach to large sea animals in order to suck their blood. Non-sentient, they were also unintelligent and would mistake the hulls of boats for large sea animals and attach themselves to the unsuspecting passerby. The Galub slug possessed a thick, grub-white hide which was strong enough to deflect spears, but not blaster fire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, a group of Alliance to Restore the Republic agents were participating in the 345th annual Spira Regatta Open when a sea slug attached itself to their yacht, slowing them.
