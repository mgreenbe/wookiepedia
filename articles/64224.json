Over a period of six years leading to the Battle of Yavin, the ship made regular trips to the Corva sector. In 0 ABY, a delay of eight days caused Alliance Intelligence to take notice. Extrapolating from its fuel capacity, the Rebels found a limited list of where it could have stopped, and it was estimated that its delay was caused to a trip to the Stylar Nebula, where it had been suspected the Empire was conducting secret military research. The data, coupled with a hacked transmission mentioning Project Shell-cracker, caused the Intelligence to launch a mission to the site."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "IM-873X was mentioned in \"Operation: Shell Game,\" the adventure in Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: Age of Rebellion Beta."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
