The two lived in the town of Raider's Cove on Rishi during the Galactic War. Around 3637 BBY Gorro mistook a powerful off-worlder for a pirate gang leader thanks to the machinations of Lana Beniko and foolishly challenged them to a fight, which resulted in his death. Grumm swore revenge and confronted Gorro's killer at the streets of Raider's Cove. However, just like Gorro, he was defeated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grumm's first and only appearance is in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Players can kill Grumm as a dark side option."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
