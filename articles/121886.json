During the end of the Battle of the Kaliida Nebula, the Confederate General Grievous was separated from his flagship, the Malevolence. Though unbeknownst to Grievous, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker had sabotaged the warship to crash into a nearby moon when the Malevolence's hyperdrive was activated. Grievous, in his personal starfighter, the Soulless One, planned to rendezvous with the Malevolence at the Sector Four base. However, when the warship's battle droid crew activated the ship's hyperdrive, Skywalker's sabotage came into effect, and the Malevolence was destroyed when it collided with the moon, leading to Grievous' retreat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
