Jarrus states that he mostly has the blocking down, but still needs to purposely defect them and has yet to hit his assigned target: a stormtrooper helmet set on a rock. Bridger feels that he will hit it eventually, but Jarrus notices that he cannot focus and pauses the training to ask what's wrong. Bridger explains that he is worried about missing the latest transmission from dissident Senator Gall Trayvis. Jarrus reprimands Bridger for his distraction and impatience, and tells his Padawan to keep his concentration in the present."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Bridger continues to train, he hears voices in his head of the Senator-in-exile and others, and he sees a vision of the rebels being chased by stormtroopers, the rebels saving Senator Trayvis from the Imperials, and the Senator telling Bridger that his parents\u2014Ephraim and Mira Bridger\u2014were very brave. When he awakens lying on the ground, he assumes he was stunned, but Jarrus points out that he unknowingly deflected all the shots at the helmet. Bridger tells the others about what he saw, and assumes that the Senator must have known his parents to say such a thing.

These unfortunate Rebels are then watched or killed by the Imperial Government after meeting with Trayvis. Bridger tries to deny it, claiming that Trayvis is a voice of freedom just like his parents. Trayvis remarks that no one spoke out against the Empire ever since the Bridger transmissions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Senator Trayvis realizes that Ezra is the Bridgers' son.
