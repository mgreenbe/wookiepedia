As part of Revan's final test, Wynn tasked him with reaching the Rakatan Star Map in the tomb, which Revan was searching for, and retrieving a lightsaber. Wynn ordered Revan to kill Ban after the Jedi found the Star Map and acquired the lightsaber, but Revan sided with the Twi'lek.

Wynn eventually gained enough power to drive his Sith Master out into the Valley of the Dark Lords, where Uln would remain, studying inside the tomb of the ancient Sith Lord Tulak Hord. Wynn then assumed control over the Academy and took a former Jedi Padawan, the Twi'lek female Yuthura Ban, as his Sith apprentice.

During his time at the Academy, Dustil became a promising student. He developed a relationship with Selene, who, compared to Dustil, was not as powerful of a student. This distressed Wynn, who felt that such an emotional entanglement would hinder Dustil's progress. The Sith Master secretly had Selene murdered, believing Dustil to be too promising of a student. Wynn then lied to Dustil about her death, saying Selene had died in the Valley of the Dark Lords. Near the end of the of Jedi Civil War, Wynn's apprentice, Ban, began plotting to take control of the Academy. Wynn soon noticed Ban's ambitions and planned to have her removed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3956 BBY, the final year of the war, the amnesiac former Dark Lord of the Sith Revan, now a retrained Jedi, came to Korriban in his search for a Star Map that led to the Star Forge, an ancient Rakatan space station under the control of Revan's former apprentice and the current Dark Lord, Malak. In order to access the Star Map, Revan and his companions gained entry into the Academy and were brought before Wynn, along with the students Lashowe, Mekel, and Shaardan. The Headmaster welcomed the students to the Academy and spoke briefly about the dark side. He informed the students that the first of them to gain enough prestige would be worthy of becoming a Sith, and then asked each student if they were ready to learn the dark side's ways. When Lashowe answered, Wynn told her that she was brash and fiery, as he had expected, and implored Lashowe to convert her passion into an advantage. Mekel replied that he was ready, and Wynn told the student that he sensed his anger and expressed his belief that Mekel's anger would provide him power. Shaardan said that he was always ready to learn, and Wynn warned Shaardan that he would not survive the coming trials if he did not \"gather his wits.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his conversation with Revan, Wynn told the Jedi that his companions were irrelevant, believing that Revan's allies were his slaves. Wynn informed the students that the first one of them who learned and recited the Code of the Sith to him would be rewarded with prestige. The Headmaster then assigned Ban as the student's teacher, while they attempted to prove themselves worthy of what Wynn considered a full Sith. After learning the Sith Code from Ban, Revan went to Wynn and finished the Code as the Sith Master spoke it, correctly giving the last word for each phrase of the code. Wynn also asked Revan a question pertaining to the code, which Revan answered correctly, impressing the Sith Master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Revan broke into Wynn's room in the Academy and stole his personal datapad, which contained his order to kill Selene. He gave Wynn's datapad to Dustil, causing the apprentice to abandon the Sith ways and leave the Academy. Revan and Ban conspired with each other to kill Wynn at his final trial in the ancient Dark Lord Naga Sadow's tomb. However, Revan informed Wynn of Ban's treachery in order to gain more prestige. The Headmaster gave Revan a datapad\u2014which contained instructions to poison Ban\u2014to give to the Sith Adrenas, promising that Revan would have the opportunity to kill Ban in the final test if he gained enough prestige. Rather than give the datapad to Adrenas, Revan gave the device to Ban and informed the Twi'lek that Wynn plotted to kill her. She instructed Revan to break into Wynn's chambers and place a small device under his bed, which would poison Wynn during his sleep and weaken him for the final trial. The Jedi did as instructed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Revan recovered a Sith holocron near the Sith Lord Tulak Hord's tomb with the assistance of the Sith student Lashowe.

Wynn ordered Revan and the students to locate and execute the Sith apprentice Thalia May and her fellow renegade students. Revan helped May and the renegades escape Korriban instead and deceived Wynn into believing that he had killed the students. After recovering the Sith Lord Ajunta Pall's sword from his tomb, Revan killed the Sith student Shaardan after the Sith attacked him in order to claim the sword for himself. Wynn received Pall's sword from Revan, who also told the Sith Master that he had eliminated Shaardan. Wynn awarded Revan prestige for both these feats. The Sith Master also ordered the destruction of a rogue assassin droid that was hidden in the ancient Sith Lord Marka Ragnos' tomb. Revan helped the droid escape Korriban and lied to Wynn about the droid's destruction. Revan encountered Wynn's former Sith Master, Jorak Uln, in Tulak Hord's tomb.

After Revan successfully completed his task, Wynn congratulated Revan. The Sith Master told Revan that he needed to kill someone whom he had become familiar with in order to become a complete Sith and instructed Revan to strike down Ban. However, Revan, who had befriended Ban during his stay at the Academy, sided with the Twi'lek. Enraged, Wynn tried to attack Ban and Revan, but the poison had taken effect and weakened him.

Kreia telepathically guided Surik through the Valley of the Dark Lords. When Surik approached Naga Sadow's tomb, Kreia informed Surik that after Revan defeated Uthar Wynn in the tomb and left Korriban, the Academy fell into turmoil.

His eyes were yellow due to his immersion in the dark side. Wynn possessed certain traits that were typical of the Sith, such as an intolerance of failure, and believed that those who could not defeat their opponents deserved their fate. Wynn was not above having some of his students killed if it would allow another student to progress further without delay, such as the situation involving Dustil Onasi and Selene. He admired acts of betrayal and deception, but not when he was on the receiving end. Wynn did not view the Force as a burden, instead considering it as a gift. He believed that the Force should be used to acquire power over other individuals and felt that the Sith were what the Force was meant to be. He also believed that an opportunity was to be taken advantage of, even if it was not guaranteed to be successful. To Wynn, victory was temporary and an illusion, unless the victory proved one's superiority. He was not opposed to slavery; when Revan asked the Sith Master about his companions, Wynn said that Revan's \"slaves\" were irrelevant, as long as they did not interfere with Revan's or anyone else's training."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When asked by Revan about his past, Wynn only replied that he strove to hone his power for years until he betrayed his Master, Jorak Uln. Wynn possessed a calm demeanor; however, when betrayed by his enemies, he brought out his rage. Although it was rumored that mentioning Wynn's former Master, Uln, in the Sith Master's presence was not a good idea, Wynn in fact no longer cared about his old Master's fate. Wynn was gullible to the extent that he believed Revan when he lied to Wynn about defeating Thalia May and the renegade students whom the Headmaster had ordered killed, despite the fact that Revan had actually allowed the renegade students to escape. Wynn also did not sense deception from Revan when the Jedi lied to Wynn about destroying the rogue assassin droid. Wynn believed that Naga Sadow was the greatest of Korriban's deceased Dark Lords."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wynn, like Uln, possessed a double-bladed lightsaber containing a red crystal, which he used in combat.

He was also able to use the dark side to drain his enemy's life-force and draw it into himself in order to replenish his own vitality. Wynn was capable of using the Force to render himself invulnerable to most offensive Force powers for a limited period of time.

Revan could side with Ban and kill Wynn. Once completed, Ban would turn on Revan. After her defeat, Ban would plead for mercy and Revan would spare her life and allow her to assume the position of the Academy Headmaster. A second choice involves Revan not allying with either Wynn or Ban; both Wynn and Ban attack him and are killed; as a consequence, though, Revan and his party will be attacked by everyone in the Academy, and be forced to fight their way out. A third option has Revan siding with Wynn and attacking Ban. Revan then allows Wynn to live and go back to lead the Academy. The fourth possible outcome has Revan not siding with Wynn, instead attacking and killing him with Ban's help. Ban then attacks Revan; when Revan defeats Ban, she pleads for mercy. Revan apologizes to Ban and kills her. A fifth choice has Revan choosing not to side with either Wynn or Ban, claiming he was the only true Sith of the three, and killing both."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Revan can also kill Ban for Wynn and then tell the truth about why he sought the Star Map, stating that he never intended to become a Sith. Wynn instantly becomes enraged and attacks Revan, stating that he would \"tear the flesh from his bones.\" Wynn would also attack if Revan did not tell him that Ban was plotting to kill him. If Korriban is the final world that a dark-sided Revan visits, Revan can tell Wynn that he is Darth Revan after defeating the Headmaster. Wynn recognizes Revan, secretly devotes his allegiance to him, and vows to pledge the Academy to Revan should he successfully destroy Darth Malak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
