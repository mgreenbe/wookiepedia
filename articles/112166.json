Aboard the ship as it is being furiously hunted by the Empire, Captain Raymus Antilles gives the datacard containing the plans for the first Death Star to Princess Leia Organa as they travel to Tatooine. Moments after Raymus prepares the escape pods, the hyperdrive fails and the ship exits hyperspace, only about a quarter parsec away from Tatooine. The Devastator, a Star Destroyer carrying Darth Vader, tracks the ship's abnormal hyperspace wake and locks on to the Tantive IV with its tractor beam. As Imperial troops board the ship, Raymus attempts to convince Princess Leia to escape after she gives the datacard to R2-D2. Leia refuses, and she and R2 go to help others escape. Raymus is then captured by stormtroopers and brought to Darth Vader. After Raymus refuses to disclose any information about the Death Star plans, Darth Vader murders him by lifting him off the ground by his throat, crushing his windpipe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
