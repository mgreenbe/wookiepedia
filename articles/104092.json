Physical traits included a proboscis, at least nineteen eyes, and thin, reedy voices. The species was unique in how they understood humour: they could tell good jokes, but often deployed them at what other species considered inopportune moments, such as Peeples joking about how good his aim was during the Great Hyperspace Disaster, when missiles he had fired had failed to hit their target."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
