At some point before or after the fall of the Republic in 19 BBY, he fathered a child. His offspring in turn had a daughter named Tahiri Veila, born on the Outer Rim planet Tatooine in 13 ABY. Both of Veila's parents, Tryst and Cassa, were Force-sensitive, and they passed the trait to their daughter. If they were aware of their family's connection to the Jedi Order, they never had a chance to inform her about it, for both died when she was still very young."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unknowingly following in her grandfather's footsteps, Veila joined Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order when her suitability for Jedi training was detected.

In her vision, he was chased by stormtroopers across a landscape of green grass and shot at with blaster rifles, suggesting he was killed in Emperor Palpatine's Great Jedi Purge around the time the Galactic Empire was formed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Human was a member of the Jedi Order, a group of individuals who were able to manipulate the Force and acted as the guardians of peace and justice in the Republic.
