The Imperial Knights were an order of Force-users serving Emperor Roan Fel of the Galactic Empire, and in that year, the brown-haired female participated in a ruse devised by Fel against the Sith Lord Darth Krayt. Following the conclusion of the Sith\u2013Imperial War, Fel was informed by Director of Imperial Intelligence Nyna Calixte that the Sith who had helped his Empire defeat the Galactic Alliance and win the war were intent on betraying him. Darth Krayt planned to murder Fel and seize the Imperial throne at an upcoming meeting of the Moff Council, and Fel accordingly fled the Imperial throneworld of Coruscant. Before doing so, he arranged for his double to meet with Krayt in the Imperial Palace and buy him time to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mohrgan Fel, an Imperial Knight and the Emperor's cousin, volunteered to lead the brown-haired female and two other Knights against Krayt in order to further the deception.

Krayt arrived with three of his fellow Sith Lords and demanded Fel's life, which prompted Mohrgan to call on the Knights to protect their Emperor. Krayt drew two lightsabers and quickly killed the four Knights despite their attempts at a defense. He then struck down the decoy Emperor and proclaimed himself the Emperor of a new Empire.
