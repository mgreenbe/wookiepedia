At some point, a smuggling ship in the employ of the Hutt crime lord Darga Jiramma Mionne obtained some advanced droid interface technology from the edges of the Unknown Regions and Darga ordered his technicians to use to technology to create toys, for his personal amusement. The results of their endeavors were a set of racing droids, which could be remotely controlled via a visor that allowed the user to see out of the droids' eyes. Darga encouraged members of his court to race the droids on a track inside his palace on the planet Cato Neimoidia and he gave lavish rewards to the winners of the races."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
