As the pall of the dark side of the Force clouded the ability of investigators to rely on the Force, droids such as Russo-ISC were called upon to assist with the crime scene analysis. Around 20 BBY, an explosion destroyed many gunships and killed many Jedi, clones, and civilians alike in one of the Temple's hangars. As a result of this, Jedi Master Mace Windu tasked Russo-ISC with analyzing the damage and to question any witnesses. In the Temple hangar bay, he consulted with Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his apprentice Ahsoka Tano on the results of his investigation. Russo sent a team of droids to search the temple for the supposed perpetrator, Jackar Bowmani. Russo helped Tano locate Bowmani, reporting that only his hand could be found. Russo then continued his work and helped to conclude the investigation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Russo-ISC was based on David Caruso's character Horatio Caine from CSI: Miami.
