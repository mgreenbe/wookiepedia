The tree's leaves resembled feathers, and its bark was scored with diamond-shaped patterns. In 26 ABY, the Jedi Jaina Solo attempted to avoid fellow Jedi Kyp Durron because she believed that the latter would ask her to be his wingmate. Ultimately, Durron was able to find Solo, who greeted him as he passed a groomed stand that contained one such tree."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tree appeared in Greg Keyes's 2001 novel The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth, the second volume of the Edge of Victory Duology, which was itself a part of the series Star Wars: The New Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
