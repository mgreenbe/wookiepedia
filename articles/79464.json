Bearing the insignia of a lieutenant commander, Lagrane met with pilot training officer Commander Wex Dafid, delivering Dodonna's order that Lieutenant Keyan Farlander be transferred to active duty in Red Squadron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Now-Commander Lagrane served as Farlander's debriefing officer for his many engagements with Red Squadron, receiving the pilot's after-action reports and analyzing his performance from the campaign against Operation Strike Fear to the Rebellion's Operation Skyhook, up until the Battle of Yavin. Following Farlander's involvement in a successful rescue mission, Lagrane promoted him to the rank of captain, offering the pilot a set of captain's epaulets and an uncharacteristic smile. Near the end of the Imperial Operation Strike Fear, Commander Lagrane was present for a briefing planning the destruction of the operation's flagship, asking how the Alliance would secure the explosive material necessary, and leading Commander S'man to outline an upcoming mission to recover it from the bulk freighter Gafra. After Captain Farlander prevented a hyperdrive replacement on the Star Destroyer Intrepid, Lagrane recommended that he take some time off, citing a lack of concentration. However, Farlander returned to active duty from the medical bay through the use of the Force, going on to destroy the Intrepid, after which Lagrane informed him of his friend and fellow pilot Sunnar Jan-lo's survival."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, Keyan Farlander's wingman and close friend Breth Gart was killed in battle. Recognizing the impact of Gart's loss on Farlander, Lagrane recommended him for a psychological evaluation. Unwilling to be removed from duty, Farlander again used the Force first on Commander S'man, and then on Lagrane himself to maintain his active status. Lagrane was transferred to Massassi Base on Yavin 4 during the build up to the Battle of Yavin along with much of the Independence's personnel, including Captain Farlander. After destroying the Death Star's communications satellite, Farlander attempted to apologize to Lagrane for his use of a mind trick on him, an action he had come to regret."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A typically dour and serious man, Lagrane had a military bearing and rarely laughed or smiled.
