There's subtle brass with woodwinds for the melody in two distinctive segments from 0:50 through 2:15. Big brass catches the ear of the listener from 2:17 through 2:41, then reprising an earlier segment, before a crescendo to an altered segment of the preceding brass, and then goes off to a segment from Han Solo and the Princess. The piece ends with a quiet, eerie segment, before using woodwinds as a finale."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
