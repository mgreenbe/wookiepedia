The RSSF was founded to counter threats to public safety such as insurgents, criminal organizations and pirates, with jurisdiction in both the Darpa and Bormea sector. It developed from a loose collection of police, colonial marshals and maverick constables into a organized security service. During the Imperial era the force was more concerned with assisting ships in distress with most of the anti-crime activities being assumed by the Sector Rangers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
