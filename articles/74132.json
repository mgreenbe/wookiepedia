To aid them in feeding their people, the Kari became quite adept at creating small mechanical appliances and machines which they exported in exchange for more food. A Kari family was called a Hatch, which was made up of 20 to 30 Kari individuals. Their homeworld's surface was dominated by massive city-like structures which forced a majority of the Kari to live in an underground system of tunnels. This resulted in many of the species almost never coming to the surface and, thus, never experiencing the light of their sun."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of their unique traits was developing a system of songs that served to teach history from one generation to the next.\nThis resulted in a form of Bards being produced among the Kari with each Hatch possessing at least one singer who would preserve the history of the Hatch and 'sing' it to other Hatches."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the New Order, the Galactic Empire banned the Kari from participating or even developing space travel.
