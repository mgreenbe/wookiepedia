It was based at Fedovoi End, which held half a million troops and their families. The Yomo Council committed a number of actions that the loyalists of the Empire saw as treasonous, including not acknowledging the supposed Imperial regent on Coruscant, refusing to follow orders from Grand Admiral Rae Sloane to direct assets to the D'Aelgoth sector, and allying with the Shiortuun Syndicate. As a result, the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing, led by Colonel Soran Keize, attacked the Yomo Council's forces at Fedovoi End."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
