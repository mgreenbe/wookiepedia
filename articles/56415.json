In 25,793 BBY, the darksiders Daegen Lok and Xesh escaped from imprisonment on the moon Bogan and made their way to the Gratz Foundry, to construct Forcesaber weapons for themselves. On arrival there, Lok performed a mind trick on Gratz that caused the forge master to believe that a pack of nashtah had entered his foundry and that if he stayed silent, the creatures would leave him alone.
