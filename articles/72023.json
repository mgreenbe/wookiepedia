After the Battle of Yavin, he moved to the planet Lok to try his luck at Nym's Stronghold after a death mark was placed on his head. Nevertheless, around 1 ABY, the Trandoshan bounty hunters Bossk and Balfur Jhcor localized Joti Laike on Lok. Bossk later proposed to a spacer encountered on Corellia to split the bounty. The adventurer therefore traveled to Lok and tracked the assassin to Nym's Stronghold. The spacer attacked Joti Laike and finally killed him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Joti Laike was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
