It depicted a white visage of a Stormtrooper helmet, and at the bottom it read \"Galactic Empire: Help End the Rebellion Enlist Today!\" Deviating from the standard brutalist constructivism of Dunivee's earlier works like Join and If the Headgear Fits, it was thought that the poster was a direct response to the Rebel artwork done by the Mandalorian Sabine Wren. This attempt at copying the competition was not received well by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, who had Dunivee arrested on trumped-up treason charges, after which she vanished from all records."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial Campaign Poster 34.371.C was first mentioned in the Star Wars Rebels tie-in book Rebel Journal by Ezra Bridger.
