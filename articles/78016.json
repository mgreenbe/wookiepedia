However, the flunky did not want to be bothered by businesses while partying, and told the Jedi to go away. Kreg heard the conversation, and advised Jinn to buy a juri juice or a bantha blaster for the flunky to loosen his tongue. Jinn followed Kreg's tip, and bought a glass of juri juice from the cantina's bartender droid EV-7G7. He gave the drink to the flunky, who immediately became more helpful to the Jedi. Jinn again asked about Watto, but the flunky first told him to buy a drink for Kreg too. Jinn did so, and gave the juri juice to Kreg, who gratefully took it.

Kreg advised Jinn to turn to Anabar, a local merchant who dealed illegal weapons, if the Jedi Master had a need for explosive devices.
