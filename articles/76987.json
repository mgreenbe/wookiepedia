Carrick, meanwhile, sneaks aboard the Deadweight, Carth Onasi's starship, and identifies himself as a Jedi, explaining his vision of the Mandalorian attack. However, Admiral Saul Karath] recognizes Carrick as the purported Jedi-killer and accuses him of being a Mandalorian spy when the two arrive aboard the Courageous's bridge. Carrick's claims of helping \"Squint\" at Flashpoint are laughed down by Karath, though the admiral allows Onasi to try and contact \"Squint\" while Carrick remains on the bridge, and Mandalorian ships arrive in the system moments later. Hierogryph learns of their arrival, but a last-minute rush on the Little Bivoli leads him to forestall departure. Just as Carrick predicted, the Mandalorians launch dozens of nuclear warheads at the Republic fleet, and just before collision the missiles swerve around the ships to slam into the planet's surface\u2014and as Onasi returns to the bridge, Carrick cries out as he feels the deaths of thousands. The sensation is felt by Jedi across the galaxy, including Squint, the Jedi known as the Revanchist, Q'Anilia, and Lucien Draay.

However, Onasi visits Carrick later that night and tells him that he managed to call emergencies down to seventeen of the twenty-seven Stereb cities that were hit by the bombardment, calls that led the Stereb to take shelter in underground bunkers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Production"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon the arrival of the Mandalorian fleet to Serroco, the following line is said:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Author John Jackson Miller has explained in his online notes that the word \"ecliptic\" is meant to be the astronomical term, and explains in the comments section that the italicization of the word was a mistake.
