The reptile had four limbs, which each terminated in three digits, and a long, dexterous tail that it could wrap around tree branches. At its very end, this tail divided into two, curled parts. The reptile had a long, jagged jawline, a stubby nose, and large, round, lidded eyes. A spiky frill ran along the crest of its back from just behind its first shoulder joint down to the start of its tail. An additional frill grew on the final length of tail. In 19 BBY, a reptile of this species slept in a bough near the campfire of the clone trooper Aiwha Squad, shortly after the conclusion of the Battle of Garqi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This reptile appeared in \"Orders,\" a comic published in Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures Volume 4 in 2005. \"Orders\" was written by Ryan Kaufman, penciled by Rick Lacy and colored by Ronda Pattison.
