While carrying out a scouting expedition on Veroleem, Tinwole discovered the ruins of an ancient Sith laboratory. Inside the structure he recovered several Sith texts, which he used his Force powers to translate, and from the writings he learned how to create an elixir of immortality. Tinwole subsequently murdered one of the other colonists and used the individual's brain chemicals to manufacture a batch of the elixir, which he tested in himself. Tinwole then set about using his Force powers and his newly-gained immortality to corrupt the minds of the other colonists and forge them into a cult that became known as the \"Cult of Veroleem.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
