Circa 1 ABY, a ship carrying medical equipment for the merchant Sinis apparently crashed near Tyrena. Sinis thus recruited a spacer to investigate the ship crash site and retrieve some equipment. The spacer spotted several Deflarian scavengers while they were placing a modified flight recorder in the wreckage. The spacer later assaulted the Deflarian Communications Post to find information about the involvement of the Deflarians in the crash. This allowed the spaced to find the location of another Deflarian camp and eventually retrieve Sinis's medical equipment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Deflarian Communications Post appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
