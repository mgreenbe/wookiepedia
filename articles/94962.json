After the militant First Order cored out the planets in the system, Najra-Va was left with a circular tunnel that covered its entire diameter. Despite no longer having matter in its core, a gravity well still existed in the center of the planetoid.

They were cored out by the First Order as tests for the construction of the Starkiller Base superweapon, which also caused the disappearance of the system's sun. Unlike the other planetoids in the system, which cracked and broke apart, Najra-Va was left mostly undamaged, aside from the massive hole that had been mined through its core."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After retrieving intelligence from the First Order, the Resistance spy Kazuda Xiono learned of its activity in the Dassal system. Informing fellow Resistance member Poe Dameron, the two pilots then investigated the system. Discovering the cored and broken planetoids, they came across Najra-Va and flew through its core. The pilots almost crashed their starships due to the planetoid's intact gravity well but managed to escape through the other side of Najra-Va, landing on its moon. Once the First Order was alerted to their presence by a probe droid, Dameron and Xiono were chased back into Najra-Va's core by several TIE fighters led by First Order Major Elrik Vonreg. The Resistance pilots used the gravity well to their advantage, causing the enemy fighters to crash, which forced Vonreg to retreat and allowed the pair to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Dassal system, which included Najra-Va, was once thriving with life.
