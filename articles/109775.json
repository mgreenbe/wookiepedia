They were preyed upon by the native onahks, amphibians which spent the summer season patrolling the wetlands, and the winter hunting fish. These agile creatures were adept enough to wriggle around underwater obstacles such as roots, in order to dig into quoler warrens. Onahks were fearful of any creatures larger than their typical quoler prey, such as Humans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
