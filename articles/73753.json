In the later days of clone trooper Phase I armor, Clone Commanders, Clone Captains, and Advanced Recon Commandos added blast-resistant kamas as additions to their kits, along with other gears. Kama was also worn with Phase II armor. Female members of the Mandalorian super commandos serving the Shadow Collective wore kama as part of their standard armor. The cold weather assault stormtroopers of the Galactic Empire would later wear insulating kamas, as did First Order snowtroopers.
