Walon Vau's mother owned a flawlessly cut one that he stole from the family security box in the Dressian Kiolsh Merchant Bank. The theft of the item gave Vau great pleasure as his mother would no longer have it. Vau gave it to Ordo Skirata to give to Besany Wennen as a gift as he thought it would suit her well. Ordo presented it to Besany moments before he asked her to marry him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
