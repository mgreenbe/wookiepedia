The cannons neutralized all power in their targets, leaving them defenseless and vulnerable without the ability to use deflector shields to protect themselves. That, in turn, allowed the Malevolence to destroy its unprotected prey with its numerous turbolaser cannons. The Confederacy soon began to use the Malevolence in numerous strikes on Republic task forces that left no survivors. The Jedi High Council became increasingly worried with the losses, and the attacks sowed fear among the citizens of the Republic, even more so because the targets were unpredictable and did not form a pattern."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi General Ares Nune and Clone Commander Kite took three Venator-class Star Destroyers\u2014including Nune's flagship, the Laudable\u2014on a regular patrol of the Phu system. However, the Malevolence was also in the system, under the command of the Confederate General Grievous. The cyborg general immediately ordered the Malevolence's ion cannons to fire. As the ion wave obliterated the shields of the Laudable, Nune ordered Commander Kite to organize an evacuation of the cruisers via escape pods. However, the Malevolence moved in and destroyed the vessels before Nune and his crew of clone troopers could escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The defeat of Nune's fleet was reported in the HoloNet News, resulting in increasingly widespread concern among the Republic citizenry.

Koon volunteered to take several Venator-class Star Destroyers to find and destroy the \"mystery weapon,\" as the Malevolence had been dubbed. Aboard the Star Destroyer Triumphant, Koon tracked the Malevolence to the Abregado system and engaged it in battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle of the Phu system was featured in The Clone Wars webcomic Shakedown, which was released on October 2, 2008 and led into \"Rising Malevolence,\" one of the episodes featured in the October 3, 2008 premiere of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series on Cartoon Network.
