At first, the squadron was disorganized and ineffective, but the pilots bonded over time, learning to work with their variety of craft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The squadron's assignments culminated with an attack on the 204th's forces on the fortified planet Pandem Nai, in which Kairos was tasked with detonating the reactor of the Orbital One space station. While the attack went awry and Alphabet Squadron had to let the 204th's remaining forces escape in lieu of saving innocent lives on Pandem Nai, Kairos and her fellow pilots survived mostly unharmed, and the New Republic nonetheless saw the Empire's loss of Pandem Nai as a victory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Kairos, she was born on a world far from the Core, living a simple life.

They were imprisoned together, and along with Ver Iflan and the reprogrammed torture droid IT-O, came up with a plan to escape. However, when they did escape, Iflan was left behind. Kairos also developed a skill at piloting UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft.

Adan had assigned Quell to speak with Tensent, and Kairos waited in the U-wing. Tensent refused the offer, but Kairos went to him once Quell had left, showing him a recording from Adan, which promised a monetary reward if he were able to uncover Quell's true Imperial record.

Kairos returned Quell's mask, letting her live and continue her mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A day later, Quell returned with evidence that Shadow Wing had attacked the New Republic frigate Hellion's Dare above the planet Jiruus and pursued it into the Oridol Cluster. To locate and extract the frigate, Adan and his working group planned to capture Harrikos-Fifteen Research Station, an Imperial space station studying the star cluster. Kairos piloted her U-wing, carrying a New Republic security team led by Corporal Shroi. They successfully captured the station, sending out probe droids to search for the Hellion's Dare."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the A-wing pilot Wyl Lark and the B-wing pilot Chass na Chadic, who had barely escaped the destruction of the Hellion's Dare, jumped into the Harrikos system.

Quell also attempted to utilize a simulation of the Battle of Endor, which Tensent managed to break."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After some time, during which the squadron practiced in simulations and tactical analysis of encounters with Shadow Wing, General Syndulla assigned them a mission. They were sent to the planet Abednedo, which had been unsuccessfully attacked during the Empire's Operation: Cinder shortly after the Battle of Endor. The New Republic had received coded transmissions suggesting that Imperial forces survived on Abednedo, and Quell's squadron were chosen to determine whether the transmissions were true."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The squadron arrived above Abednedo, and Quell ordered Kairos and Chadic to follow her to the surface, while Lark and Tensent waited in orbit. They landed in the city of Neshorino, where Kairos remained with her U-wing while Quell and Chadic spoke with the contact. They discovered that their contact had a number of Imperial prisoners, which Quell inspected while Chadic escorted one, a stormtrooper sergeant, back to the U-wing. Before Chadic could return, she came under attack by Imperial forces. Kairos came to her aid, killing several Imperials, both using her bowcaster and by hand. With Kairos's help, Chadic was able to return the prisoner to the U-wing and signal Quell."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Escorting their contact's freighter, containing the Imperial prisoners, the squadron returned into space, where several TIE bombers pursued them. The bombers chased after Kairos's U-wing, and the squadron managed to destroy two of them.

As they hiked down to the supply cache, Chadic spoke to Kairos, giving thanks for the assistance in Neshorino, which Kairos silently acknowledged."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As night fell, the squadron camped inside a forest, several kilometers from the supply cache. The pilots talked to each other, with Tensent telling stories of his former squadron and Lark speaking of his homeworld, while Kairos merely listened. Once the sun had risen, they continued towards the rebel base, discovering it to be in a temple which Tensent assumed to be built by the Jedi. They began removing the supplies from the base, but had not finished before the day ended, setting up camp outside the temple. As the pilots talked amongst themselves, Kairos stood, illustrating her life story in a series of drawings made of dust and dirt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the night, they were awoken by a starship passing overhead. Quell returned to the squadron's ships in case of hostiles, leaving the other pilots to continue collecting the supplies. There were no further sightings, however, but they were woken during the next night by a ringing sound that echoed throughout the forest. Kairos began to enter the temple, waiting for her fellow pilots before stepping inside, witnessing a galactic map made from a display of light, that they also assumed was created by the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The squadron finished packing up the supply cache, returning to their ships. The gear they had collected was loaded aboard Kairos's U-wing, taking two hours to do so. When the squadron was ready to depart, Lark went to check on the U-wing, discovering that Kairos was outside, staring back in the direction of the temple. Once Lark had approached, Kairos turned and cryptically spoke to him for the first time, before returning to their ships."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Further missions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the mission to the moon of Harkrova I, the squadron returned to the Lodestar in the Borleias system, where General Syndulla gave them a mission to assist with the New Republic's battle against Imperial forces on Argai Minor. They planned to patrol near the Treinhaus Citadel and allow time for a New Republic salvage team to collect data from the ruins."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The length of their patrol was forcibly adjusted when time estimates of the salvage team and predictions from Vanguard Squadron proved to be incorrect. For the first several hours, there was no major threat that needed to be dealt with, but nightfall brought repeated attacks from both Imperial ground forces and TIE bombers. Kairos successfully destroyed two of the TIE bombers during the following five hours, after which the attacks ceased."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The squadron's next mission was to Rentaxius VIII, the location of an Imperial cargo freighter that they believed had been resupplied at Pandem Nai.

While attempting to disable the ship, a stray shot hit an oxygen generator, and the squadron was forced to evacuate the survivors in escape pods."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Rentaxius VIII, the squadron was sent to assist Hail Squadron, who had been targeting a wrecked Star Destroyer in the Haldeen sector when they had been decimated by an Imperial cruiser-carrier. Working together, the two squadrons managed to destroy the capital ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after a mission to raid an Imperial outpost that had been relaying messages to Pandem Nai, Quell called the squadron into their hangar. Quell, in attempt to improve her relationship with her squadron, accepted the \"Alphabet Squadron\" nickname they had been given, getting the mechanic Ragnell to paint a crest on their respective ships.

Quell developed a plan for a starfighter attack on Pandem Nai, which was reviewed and approved by New Republic High Command. Despite Syndulla's doubts about the danger of the plan, Kairos and the other pilots of Alphabet Squadron were willing to attempt it. Quell briefed the squadron on the details of the attack, and they worked over it together. After the briefing, General Syndulla offered the squadron drinks before they began the mission, but Kairos declined, choosing to remain alone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lodestar exited hyperspace in an empty star system at one end of the Skangravi-Mestun, where the pilots of Alphabet Squadron were to depart. The pilots broke away from the Lodestar, jumping through hyperspace to the edge of the Pandem Nai system. Immediately upon their arrival, Kairos broadcasted a jamming signal from her U-wing, blocking communications between the squadron but also hiding their presence from the 204th. Within an asteroid field, the squadron encountered smart mines placed by Shadow Wing, maneuvering around each one. Kairos followed Quell's X-wing out of the field, heading towards Pandem Nai itself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reaching the planet's atmosphere, Kairos deactivated the jammers, allowing the squadron to communicate as they fought off Imperial TIE fighters. Kairos broke off from the rest of her squadron, heading down into Pandem Nai's atmosphere to elude notice before climbing back up to the Orbital One station, where Shadow Wing's forces were based. She landed in one of the station's docking bays, allowing a team of New Republic Special Forces personnel to disembark and infiltrate the station, planting detonators in the station's reactor.

The strike team contacted Kairos, confirming that their detonators were in place. Kairos forwarded the message to Quell, whose response ordered Kairos to activate the detonators. The station was not destroyed by the detonation, but began to tilt and fall towards the planet. However, flames caused by destroyed gas containment pods spread, igniting the rest of the station's pods and setting the tibanna atmosphere of Pandem Nai alight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the firestorm spread through the atmosphere and Orbital One fell, Kairos assisted Lark in saving an Imperial gas tanker by shooting its gas containment pods from their moorings before they could ignite. Kairos and Lark did the same for the other tankers around Orbital One, helped by the Imperial TIE fighter pilots of Shadow Wing, who ceased their attack in favor of preventing the fire from increasing.

When first meeting with Yrica Quell, who asked if she could help pilot the U-wing, Kairos silently refused to allow her to do so, dispassionately disabling the copilot's station. Despite this, Kairos had occasional moments of emotion. When Quell attempted to disobey orders and escape the Buried Treasure to do her own investigation, Kairos at first did not hesitate to kill the apparent traitor, but let Quell live, giving her a chance to prove herself.
