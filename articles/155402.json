Sith Lord Darth Maul, who was on a mission aboard Cog Hive Seven to track down Radique, initially believed the Weequay to be Radique. Because of that, when Maul was forced to kill the Weequay during one of the gladiatorial matches taking place aboard the station, Maul believed that he had failed in his mission to procure a nuclear device from Radique. However, Maul soon discovered that the Weequay had merely been one of Radique's lieutenants."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
