Due to increasing fears of Republic insurgents and terrorists working against General Vaklu which resulted in increasing regulations meant to \"keep order,\" but were in reality thinly-disguised attempts to expedite the planned coup by Vaklu against Queen Talia, he could only sell his products to people with starport visas.

He repeatedly let slip that he was neither as generally happy nor as loyal to Vaklu as he claimed, prompting the Vaklu-loyal soldier posted at his store to warn him: \"Watch it, Geg. The captain already has enough complaints about you\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The merchant also said that in addition to being unable to sell anything to anyone who did not have a starport visa, he had to sell to soldiers (always ones loyal to Vaklu) at such steep discounts he was practically being robbed of his wares.
