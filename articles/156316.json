The assassin lay in wait while they were discussing with his associate, and then silently picked off the entire mercenary guard with a knife in the each of their backs as a warning that the industrialist should leave. However, his actions resulted in the industrialist being more determined to hire him, willing to pay any price. The assassin then had him remove his eyes and his ears as payment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He then tried to ambush Vader and two Royal Guards at an offworld tavern while they were investigating the causes of a failed assassination attempt on Emperor Palpatine.

After Vader wiped out the Heinsnake Cult, he then tailed Vader, although stampeding wildlife on the doomed moon delayed him.
