Several of the individuals who taught the human Wilhuff Tarkin to fly starships originated on this world, despite the great distance between the world and the planet Eriadu where Tarkin lived. Bothawui was considered to be strategically important during the Clone Wars, leading to it being the site of the battle that halted a Separatist advance. Later in the war, around the time the Galactic Republic suffered a loss on Ryloth, Bothawui hosted another battle, though this engagement ended with many Republic losses. Many years later, Imperial resources were redirected from Bothawui by the Imperial Navy to help deal with Tarkin's corvette, Carrion Spike, after it was stolen by dissidents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
