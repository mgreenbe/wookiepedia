Although the accuracy of its weapons were below the norm for most vessels of its class, ST 007 more than made up for it with the increased explosive power of its weapons, not to mention that it carried proton torpedo launchers normally installed on Imperial patrol vehicles. Since power was diverted from the shields to its ordnance, electronic countermeasures were installed to boost the shuttle's defensive systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
