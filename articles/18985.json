In the years leading up the the Clone Wars, Geonosians constructed Geonosian hive factories in the planet's crust. The factories illegaly produced millions of battle droids in secret. Shortly after the Clone Wars errupted, the Galactic Republic discovered the foundries on Xorrn. This led to numerous assaults on the planet, though all failed. At the end of the Clone Wars, the Republic decided Xorrn wasn't worth futher losses and ordered an orbital bombardment of the droid foundries. This resulted in the loss of dozens of Core ships, picking up droid shipments. At least one factory, Foundry Four, survived the bombardment relatively intact."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
