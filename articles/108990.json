Piett argued that the probe's discovery indicated the presence of a hidden Rebel base, but Ozzel dismissed the captain's reports. However, the admiral's objections were overruled by the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, who was confident that they had indeed found the Rebel base and promptly ordered the fleet to travel to the Hoth system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Qeimet system was located within the Juris sector of the Outer Rim Territories.

As a result of the beamcast, the general public first learned of the Ubiqtorate, and in popular opinion the terms \"Ubiqtorate\" and \"Imperial Intelligence\" became synonymous.

Taking a look at the probe's transmission, Vader immediately expressed his confidence that the Empire had indeed discovered the site of the Rebel base.
