Ungassan wanted to subvert the financial control that the Desilijic Hutts had over the planet Ando Prime with their Ando Overland Podracing event, as well as secretly mine the valuable metal Vonium without having to get the land rights or permits. To do so, Ungasan planned to host a new racing event, the Ungasan Cross Country. He had the Twi'lek Podracer Ree acquire scanning equipment from Geon Justic of the Elesa Mining Union in exchange for CSA merchandise, which he then had attached to Podracers in order to scan for deposits of Vonium during the new event.
