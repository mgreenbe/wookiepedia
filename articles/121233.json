The scrubber, which resembled a squat box, moved about in search of fuel spills and other areas where potentially dangerous chemicals pooled.

The box-shaped droid was equipped with fuel scrubbers and two sensors called \"sniffers\" to detect any dangerous fuel leaks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The scrubber was effective at its work, collecting as much of the hazardous material as possible without any sort of fear of its dangerous situation. In those situations where a fire broke out before the scrubber could clean up a spill, the droid was equipped with a fire extinguisher to put out a variety of fire types."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A scrubber droid model was used by the Royal Naboo Security Forces in 32 BBY.
