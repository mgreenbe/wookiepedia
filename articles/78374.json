The Blood Carvers were a warrior species with a thirst for blood and a reputation for working as assassins and bounty hunters; Vrat was no exception, becoming a member of the Bounty Hunters' Guild."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vrat was dedicated to the hunt, with a penchant for operating by his own rules. However, this proved to be harmful as he killed his brother during a hunt; it was speculated that his brother had become an obstacle in the way of Vrat's quarry. For his crime, Ku Vrat was exiled by his people, and the Bounty Hunters' Guild ultimately followed suit, expelling him for interfering in other hunters' bounties, which was a violation of the Bounty Hunters' Creed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 137 ABY, Vrat had found work with Black Sun. He was employed by Black Sun Vigo Lun Rask as an assassin, operating from Rask's fortress on Kaer, until he was one of Rask's most trusted and capable killers, alongside Anzati lovers Sint and Nakia Yoru,."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "On the hunt"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 137 ABY, Vrat, alongside the Anzati married couple Sint and Nakia Yoru, was tasked by Lun Rask to assassinate both former Jedi Padawan Cade Skywalker and Imperial agent Gunn Yage. Thanks to information provided by Nieve Gromia, the Imperial Moff of Arkanis sector, Black Sun pirates had been stealing Imperial shipments for months, but lately Skywalker and his crew began to interfere and take the cargo for themselves, upsetting the deal between Rask and Gromia. Meanwhile, agent Yage was sent by Moff Nyna Calixte to help Gromia stop the pirates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vrat tracked down both targets to Gusha's Luck, a cantina in Mos Eisley, and set out to kill them, but was prevented from doing so by the Yorus, who reminded him that they had been ordered to be discreet and offered the Blood Carver to work together. Despite not trusting the Anzati couple, Vrat agreed. The three assassins followed Skywalker and Yage to the Jundland Wastes and attacked them after Skywalker Force choked Yage and caused her X-34 landspeeder to crash. However, the pair managed to escape thanks to a sandstorm. Vrat blamed the Yorus for the targets' escape as they had shot at them without the intent of killing them. Vrat and Sint had a brief fight which was stopped by Nakia, who explained the Blood Carver that once she and her husband got the scent of their prey's luck, they would be able to track them. She also offered Vrat to take credit for the assassinations as she only cared for feeding on Skywalker's soup."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The trio tracked their targets to the abandoned Lars homestead, and a fight ensued, in which Ku Vrat engaged Morrigan Corde and Jariah Syn, who arrived at the scene. Corde shot Vrat with a poison dart, and then Syn finished him with two thud bugs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
