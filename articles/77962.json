The syndicate mostly consisted of either five to six hunters: Fett, Bossk, C-21 Highsinger, and Latts Razzi operated with the team regularly, while other members like Oked, Dengar, Asajj Ventress, and Embo participated less frequently for various reasons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mission to Quarzite"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Bossk, Latts Razzi, and Oked were present at a cantina in Mos Eisley. Oked approached Asajj Ventress and began to flirt with her, which ultimately led to his death. After witnessing their partner die, Razzi and Bossk blackmailed Ventress into joining their team. The two bounty hunters took Ventress to meet their leader, a human male of Mandalorian heritage, Boba Fett. Fett's team were hired by Major Rigosso to protect a chest of unknown contents on a subtram to Belugan leader Otua Blank."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While delivering the chest, the group was attacked by Kage Warriors. Razzi fought alongside C-21 Highsinger, Dengar with Ventress, and Bossk with Fett. The group fended off many Kage Warriors by matching their skill in martial arts, but Razzi, Highsinger, Dengar, and Bossk were ultimately defeated by the Kage leader Krismo Sodi or the Kage Warriors. Which left Ventress and Fett to fend off the forces alone. During the struggle against the raiders, Boba inadvertently knocked the chest over, revealing its contents: a young woman named Pluma Sodi, who had been kidnapped so she could be married to Otua Blank against her will. The leader of the raiders, Krismo Sodi, was her brother, who had been trying to save his sister. Ventress and Boba, who managed to remain on the tram, argued about the situation after Pluma pleaded with the former Sith apprentice, who felt sympathy for the girl; Ventress had also been forcibly taken from her home. Boba, on the other hand, intended to continue with the operation. Ventress used the Force to choke Boba, preventing him from fulfilling the mission. After the mission was over, Ventress parted ways with the group."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mission to Serenno"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being assigned by the Jedi High Council on a mission to assassinate the Separatist leader Count Dooku, the Jedi Master Quinlan Vos visited several members of Krayt's Claw at a bar in Coruscant's Level 1313. Vos wanted to recruit Ventress, Dooku's former Sith apprentice and a bounty hunter, for the mission. From Fett and Latts Razzi, Vos learned that Ventress was pursuing a Volpai fugitive named Moregi on Pantora."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After their mission to assassinate Dooku failed and Vos was captured, Ventress contacted Fett's syndicate at Chalmun's Cantina on Tatooine to enlist their support for a rescue mission. The syndicate was initially reluctant to participate until Ventress agreed to pay them 250,000 credits on demand. Several members including Fett, Latts Razzi, Bossk, Highsinger, and Embo participated in the rescue mission and traveled to Serenno. While Krayt's Claw distracted Dooku's forces by attacking several shuttles, Ventress attempted to rescue Vos only to be spurned by the Jedi, who had learned that she had murdered his former master Tholme. Despite trapping Dooku under a net, the syndicate and Ventress were forced to flee after Vos pursued them and sided with Dooku. Due to the failed mission, relations between the Krayt's Claw and Ventress deteriorated and they parted company."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
