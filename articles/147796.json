Other motives were simple revenge or the sadistic gratification of the torturer. Torture also served as a way of intimidating or coercing individuals, or for discriminatory reasons of any kind. Occasionally, torture was the adverse byproduct of medical or scientific research, studies, or procedures, and usually occurred without the consent of the victim. Torturous methods could be initiated at the directives of heads of state or other individuals or groups. Since Force-sensitives could sense the reactions of loved individuals, torture could be used as a means to manipulate them, even from a considerable distance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Torture was widely considered as a gruesome and unethical practice by most cultures in the galaxy. Despotic governments and heads of states often coerced prisoners into revealing sensitive information through the use of intimidation and torture, and the known examples varied from a galactic level (the reigns of the Galactic Empire\nand Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire) to the sectorial (the New Sith Empire and the Corporate Sector Authority) to the system- or planet-wide, which included everything from royal houses (like Queen Sarna's monarchy on Drogheda  and the Doan Royal House of Doan) to elites (like the Krath in the Empress Teta system, the Tundei of Abregado-rae and the Absolutes on New Apsolon) to single dictators like Dictator-Forever Craw of Targonn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Torture was also utilized by gangsters and criminal organizations; one notable example was the Hutt crime lord Rokko, whose invention and enjoyment of various forms of torture was the stuff of many a con being's nightmare. To bounty hunters like Boba Fett, Aurra Sing and Feskitt Bobb, torture was a useful tool for locating their prey."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galactic Republic was founded on the principles of law and justice, and torture was against the bylaws of the Galactic Senate. Torture droids were also illegal by the laws of the Republic. However, beyond the Republic's boundaries, there were planets with much lower moral codes, where sentients tortured other sentients for power or greed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Palpatine, a former senator from the planet Naboo, assumed the position of galactic Emperor, the Imperial Senate approved his call for more freedom in the treatment of the enemies of the Empire (\"in times such as these, extreme measures can be called for\" - Imperial Inquisitor Malorum). Under Imperial rule, there was intense demand for torture droids and torture equipment of all kinds, and torture droids were invented behind the curtain of Imperial secrecy. This was in strong contrast with the Rebel Alliance, who would never resort to either torture or interrogation droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the fall of the Empire, the resulting New Republic took a firm stand against the use of torture, but apparently, some members of the New Republic Intelligence Service would simply ignore this; certain members of the organization, like Heol Girdun, would routinely resort to torture during interrogation sessions. In addition, torture equipment and droids were still manufactured in secret, and were often used by criminals and Imperial Remnant worlds. Many remaining Imperials like Admiral Natasi Daala, Imperial Guard Carnor Jax, Moff Leonia Tavira, Admiral Ysanne Isard, Grand Admiral Thrawn, and the sadistic scientist Leonis Murth\u00e9 also perpetuated Palpatine's Imperial tradition."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Yuuzhan Vong War, the central government of the New Republic was unable to coordinate an effective response to the invasion. The result was that the government was reorganized into the much more centralized Galactic Federation of Free Alliances (\"The Galactic Alliance\"). This new government was strong enough to drive back the Vong, but would also take many political and military decisions away from individual star systems. Five years into the new regime, the new government's methods had become increasingly dictatorial; in the face of growing protests and violent terrorist groups, a covert branch of intelligence called the Galactic Alliance Guard (GAG) was created. Tasked with finding and eliminating those who threatened galactic peace and order, the members of the GAG would not only subject a suspect to torture, but also arrest her or his entire family and make them watch. After the defeat of Darth Caedus, the leader of the GAG, who had also elevated himself to the position of president of the Galactic Alliance, the GAG was formally disbanded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the reign of Darth Krayt more than a century later, the agency in charge of torture was Sith Intelligence and Assassination."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Torture varied in both method and purpose between species and cultures. One notable example was the Yuuzhan Vong, who glorified pain not only as a motive for action, but also as a state of living. The Vong warrior caste derived perverse pleasure from their own pain and from the pain of others."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Curiously, the Trandoshan first name Flayss meant fate, specifically fate of death by slow torture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Methods"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There was no set standard as to what could or could not be used for torture. Victims were usually held in place with restraints (for example with binders, shackles, ropes, or restraints that were part of the torture mechanism itself) or rendered immobile by other means (like the Geonosian containment field), to lessen any potential opportunity for escape. Sometimes, the person was stripped of most of their clothing; a member of a hairy species might have their fur shaved off, or an avian species their plumage plucked out). The victim might also be imprisoned within a cold, dark cell, adding to their misery. The torturer would often taunt and mentally abuse the victim both during and after the ordeal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Physical torture methods ranged from a beating with nothing more than fists and boots, to the use of sophisticated custom-designed devices such as the IT-O Interrogator droid. Other types of torture could include sensory manipulation, sleep deprivation, uncomfortable extremes of heat and cold, loud noises, radiation, or any other means that inflicted physical pain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Psychological torture used non-physical methods to cause extreme mental suffering. Torture was sometimes combined with a false display of sympathy or affection from the torturer, such as expressed regret for having to put the victim through the procedure, and/or tending to their injuries. A similar way of manipulation was through sexual seduction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some people utilized their torture skills as an occupation, and were paid to glean desired info out of their contracted victims. Others, like the Sith Lords Scourge (of the New Sith Empire) and Darth Maladi (of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire) were experts in the field. Lord Scourge viewed effective interrogation as an art. He knew what questions to ask and in what order, when to ratchet up the intensity and when to pull back, how to use the threat of pain and the reward of mercy to control his victims, how to use multiple sessions over several days when necessary in order to achieve the desired results. In his mind, the ultimate failure was to push his victims too far and accidentally kill them; one could get no answers from corpse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some bounty hunters, like Boba Fett, would gladly torture their bounties if they were paid to or as necessary to extract information."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Blows"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi was captured by the Sith Lord Darth Maul and his brother, Savage Opress.

They captured group of Separatist terrorists, M'truli, Gysk and Farr Orjul, and took them to a soundproof apartment. There Walon Vau proceeded to beat information out of them, to the point that the walls were splattered with blood.

The bounty hunter Aurra Sing used this method to tear information out of people to find the location of her bounty, Jax Pavan. When the young Rebel Deena Shan was confronted by Imperial Captain Red Rishyk, Rishyk decided to toy with her before killing her and got the idea of breaking every single bone in her body. Fortunately for Deena, Rishyk was killed before he could make good on his threats."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Branding"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Branding involved using red-hot metal to burn the victim's flesh.

A victim could also be injected with pain-enhancing drugs. Bavo Six was a powerful liquid chemical notable for being used in the large syringes of IT-O interrogation droids. The serum could lower pain thresholds, stimulate cooperation and trigger hallucinations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Torture could be combined with truth drugs and/or chemicals designed to break the victim's will.

One of her methods was cutting Kenobi and Alpha with a knife again and again. When bounty hunter Boba Fett was searching for Starkiller during the Galactic Civil War, he interrogated a mechanic and threatened to torture him with a fusioncutter if he didn't give him the information he wanted.

Burra Stone, who took great pleasure in torturing his victims and was the most feared interrogator in the Empire, once threatened to pull every hair from an Imperial steward's body\u2014from the inside, and was utterly serious about it.
