The DD6 was stronger and more powerful than its counterpart, and its production set off the so-called \"blaster wars\" between Merr-Sonn and BlasTech. Considered by most to have been a \"standard\" blaster pistol with no distinguishing features, it was a popular weapon for personal protection as well as for use as a military sidearm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
