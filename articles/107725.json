Because of their similarity to Humans, which were primates themselves, those species were often referred to as humanoids, though it depended on their sentience designation. Most primates gave birth to a single live young at a time, although multiple births were not unheard of in Humans. Examples of non-Human primates included the hesten, momongs, Taurill, and nightmare demons. The wampas, which were reptomammalian creatures, were also linked to primates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taungs and Humans were considered to be a simian species.
