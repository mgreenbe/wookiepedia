Though bulkier and heavier than a standard blaster pistol, the heavy blaster's advantage was firepower. It had the destructive power of a blaster rifle without the longer range that a rifle typically provided. The power pack was generally the same size as a standard pistol and was consumed at a considerably higher rate than a typical blaster pistol. Due to the weapon's formidable power it was heavily restricted in most systems if not entirely illegal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Heavy blaster pistols were very popular with soldiers and mercenaries of all sorts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Arkanians were the first to experiment with creating blaster pistols with the same energy output as blaster rifles around 5,000 BBY.
