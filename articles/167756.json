Circa 1 ABY, he met a spacer who was trying to acquire an Old Republic droid module from Stonewall Labs. Hudmasse agreed to help and dispatched the spacer to get a Stonewall Labs security beacon from former Chief Security Officer Vance Groten. He later dispatched the spacer to get a sequencer that can be used in a security beacon for Stonewall Labs from former technician Tanoa Vills. Professor Hudmasse finally assembled the sequencer into the security beacon. With this tool, the spacer was able to enter the Stonewall Labs headquarters and recover a Strategy/Tactics Simulation Chip installed in a droideka that was being studied in the laboratory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zanier Hudmasse appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
