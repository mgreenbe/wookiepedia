Buffed chromium finishes on the craft's forward surfaces glinted in the sun for fly-bys and parades, and represented the royalty of Naboo, complementing the Royal Starship. The N-1's chromium stood in stark contrast to its overall yellow finish."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The craft carried two J-type engines and a Nubian Monarc C-4 hyperdrive engine, and had a single on-board astromech droid which was mounted from the bottom of the craft. It featured an autopilot system and shielding, along with offensive weaponry that consisted of two blaster cannons and proton torpedo launchers. It could attain a maximum speed of 1,100 kph and was eleven meters in length. The ships central rat-tail acted as a power charger collector, and received energy from onboard generators when it was not in use. The ships two outer finials served as heat sinks for the engines."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The N-1 starfighter was originally built by the Naboo, and was most notably used during the Trade Federation invasion of the planet. During the invasion, the pilots of Bravo Flight flew the N-1 during the final assault against the Droid Control Ship Vuutun Palaa. Young Anakin Skywalker fired a pair of torpedoes into its starboard main reactor, effectively destroying it from within. They later joined in the celebration on the planet below, flying overhead Naboo's capital of Theed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A decade later, three N-1s were used to escort Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala to Coruscant in order to vote on the Military Creation Act.

They landed without incident, but the bounty hunter Zam Wesell hit the ship shortly after, destroying it and killing the senator's double; one of the three N-1s was also knocked off the landing platform by flying debris. N-1s remained in Naboo service during the Clone Wars, with several being kept in Theed Hangar during this time. During the war, Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano trained Amidala in starfighter combat, with Amidala flying an all-chrome N-1."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, following the climactic Battle of Endor, N-1 starfighters flew in celebration after the Galactic Empire's second Death Star was destroyed. Shortly thereafter, Imperial agents received posthumous orders from Emperor Palpatine to commence the destruction of Naboo via weather manipulation as part of Operation: Cinder. Rebel leader Leia Organa, ace pilot Shara Bey and Naboo's own Queen Soruna flew three long-abandoned N-1 fighters in the Theed Hangar into space to destroy the Imperial satellites that were causing the extreme weather conditions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Cold War, an N-1 starfighter was in the service of Jinata Security officer Leema Kai, and was modified with seismic charges in place of proton torpedoes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 35 ABY, N-1 starfighters were part of a fleet assembled by Lando Calrissian to assist the Resistance during the battle against the Sith Eternal forces over the planet Exegol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The N-1 starfighter first appeared in the prequel trilogy, but was added to Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi as part of the ending montage in the DVD release."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The full-size N-1 Starfighter prop used by Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, was on display in Boston's Museum of Science as part of the Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination exhibit in 2005, and remained on display in the museum's Blue Wing for several years afterward, hanging above guest's heads with several large wires.
