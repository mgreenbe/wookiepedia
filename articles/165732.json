In response, the workers formed the Worker's Militia and staged an uprising against Xeran Mining. The workers initially sabotaged a number of the HND-9 droids, causing the Corporation to force the former miners out their corporate housing. The workers then reprogrammed some of the droids to attack starships that were leaving the system, so Xeran hired some bounty hunters to hunt down the leaders of the Militia. Eventually, the New Republic intervened and ended the conflict."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
