Several centuries before the Cold War with the Galactic Republic, the Jarastok family killed a member of the Eteelan family, sparking a feud that would last until the entire Jarastok family was exterminated by the Sith Lord Darth Baras over the course of a decade, a process that ended sometime before 3643 BBY. Baras then took advantage of his newfound favor with the Eteelans to set the family upon his own rival Darth Angral."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jarastok family was first mentioned in the Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia, a 2012 guide book for the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
