It essentially pushed an object rather than pulled. Pressor or tractor fields were too diffuse to cause any difference in organics or small vehicles. However, larger vehicles were at risk of repulsor failure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Usage"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pressor fields were artificially generated for numerous applications. The Imperial-class Star Destroyer Devastator used a pressor field to contain the Tantive IV in the event that the Rebels attempted to explode the ship once it had been brought onboard using tractor beams. In this instance the pressor field was created akin to a ray shield type of deflector shield in that it followed the contours of the captured craft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the surgery to save Admiral Daala following an attack on the Death Star, a very small pressor field was used in a medical application to stem the flow of bleeding from a hemorrhage. In this instance the field was used to apply pressure to a specific point."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jax Pavan and the droid I-5YQ flew into a pressor field (possibly a tractor field) to escape a PCBU.
