This was part of an agreement between the Telgorn Corporation, who manufactured the vessel, and the Corporate Sector Authority, who planned to use the ships to launch surprise attacks on pirates and other outlaw craft. While the deception was eventually discovered, attempts to update the model's classification led to widespread confusion, and it is still widely considered a heavily armed cargo ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Capabilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to its array of concealed weaponry, the 4R3 class carries a Stinger Assault Boarding Tube as standard equipment to assist in breaching the hulls of hostile or criminal craft in order to deploy boarding parties."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
