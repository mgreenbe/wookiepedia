Outsiders were forbidden to enter, though some aliens were known to use disguise kits to gain entrance, despite the penalty of death if discovered. The royal palace was located in Giat Nor, as well as a sophisticated monument to Nil Spaar. The palace, however, remained empty, with no viceroy or royal ruler, after the disappearance of Nil Spaar in 17 ABY, as many Yevethans continued to hold out hope that he would return. The city of Hariz was located 150 kilometers southeast of Giat Nor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
