Binks was born in Otoh Gunga on Naboo some time prior to the fall of the Galactic Republic, to a family of whalers. The Binks family had practiced the whaler profession for centuries, and he was no exception to that tradition. As a mere youth, he commanded his own gang of fishermen in his home town. At some point, he decided to join the family business, the Binks & Son Whaling Company. In his capacity as a professional whaler, Binks often went on long sea voyages, even sailing across the entire globe of Naboo on more than one occasion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one point, he fell in love with the warrior-woman Sheebla, and planned on marrying her. But when he learned of Sheebla's infertility, Binks broke off his wedding plans and left her; to him a son to carry on the family name was more important than love. He eventually married another woman, not out of love, but because she had the ability to bear him an heir. She gave birth to his son, Jar Jar Binks, in 52 BBY. Starting when his son was quite young, Binks frantically attempted to teach Jar Jar the whaler profession and involve him in the family company. But much to his chagrin, Jar Jar was uninterested and prone to clumsiness. As a result of these qualities, Binks began resenting his son."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Shipwrecked"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On a whaling trip with his wife and son in the southernmost seas of Naboo, Binks happened upon a large whale. His initial attempt at harpooning the creature was unsuccessful, and in the ensuing fight the whale got caught in the rigging of Binks's ship. He issued a series of commands to Jar Jar to take the wheel and maneuver clear of the situation, but his son was unable to comply. As a result, the ship sank, and the Binks family was forced to seek refuge on a barren island."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A month later, Binks and his family were still stranded on the island, which he christened \"Binks's Woe.\" He grew increasingly annoyed by his son's antics, so that when Jar Jar offered to swim for help\u2014a suicidal task due to the treacherous seas as well the distance involved\u2014Binks encouraged the boy. However, this attempt at getting Jar Jar killed was cut short when his wife intervened. Overcome with feelings, he drew a gun and turned it on himself. His wife tried to encourage him not to, but only ended up encouraging him into pulling the trigger by telling him to think of their son. The shot merely grazed his skull, knocking him unconscious.

So concerned was he with securing a male heir to the Binks name that he left the woman he loved because she was infertile. When he finally received a son, Jar Jar, he worked hard to teach the youngster the whaling profession. His son's repeated failures at living up to his expectations became a source of discontent for Binks.
