They were used by the Sanyassan Marauders living on that moon to do their heavy labor. The Sanyassans originally used them as attack creatures, but they were too calm and slow while carrying cargo, so they used them as beasts of burden instead. They controlled them with spiked chain bridles, riding on their backs with stiff saddles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The blurrg's huge mouth could chew through almost anything edible, which made it perfect for clearing savanna grass, weeds, and saplings. Blurrgs were strong, fast, but stupid\u2014so much so that they walked right into small trees, knocking them down. The egg-laying creatures usually produced 5 or 6 babies at a time. In their early years, babies stayed very close to their mothers for protection from Boar-wolves. Blurrgs communicated through a series of roars. They were also vicious when driven to a fury, and reputedly noisy when agitated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, clone troopers mounted on blurrgs were used as heavy cavalry on various worlds. Twi'leks somehow acquired dozens of blurrgs, and used them as beasts of burden and as riding mounts against Confederacy of Independent Systems forces during the Battle of Ryloth. There was also a location on the forest moon of Endor named Blurrg's Isle, which seemed to be the home of a significant population of blurrgs. During the time of the Mission to Zygerria, some blurrgs were sold in the markets of Zygerria."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rothana Heavy Engineering sold blurrgs as mounts to Imperial forces.
