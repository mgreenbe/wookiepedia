Its duties included regular patrols of Galactic City, criminal investigations, counter-terrorism and counter-intelligence operations, crowd control, diplomatic protection, maintaining the world's skylanes, and, in some cases, the military defense of Coruscant. Early during the Republic, the CSF was commanded by the Chief of Security and centuries later by the Coruscant Security Force Senior Command, later the Sector Command. As the Empire established its rule, control of the CSF was changed from the Sector Command to a Commander, that position itself later replaced by a Commissioner. The CSF operations were based out of a central headquarters and various divisional headquarters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though staffed mostly by sentient police officers, droids were used as well, including different kinds of police droids, probes, and crime scene investigation droids.

Specialized units included the SWAT unit, the Anti-Terrorism Unit, the Organized Crime Unit, Traffic Division, and the Forensics Unit. The lower levels of Coruscant were patrolled by the CSF's Underworld Police division. The CSF utilized VAAT/e ships, assault ships, and Republic police gunships as rapid troop deployment and patrol craft. They also had Coruscant police speeders and RapidResponse police speeders which were used as patrol and pursuit airspeeders. If at times officers felt they could be entering a dangerous area, they could receive an escort by a police cruiser backup unit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The CSF was one of the oldest planetary police forces in the known galaxy. After the Sacking of Coruscant and the subsequent Cold War, it battled for control of Coruscant against crime syndicates such as Black Sun and the Migrant Merchants' Guild. However, with severely depleted resources and a high rate of burnout among its embittered officers, the CSF had to leave large sections of Coruscant under gang control. During the later years of the Galactic Republic, the CSF was assisted by the Senate Guards\u2014who served as a secondary police force for Coruscant\u2014and the Jedi Order. Together, they would investigate severe crimes though rivalry and resentment were always present. During the Clone Wars, the CSF was supported by clone shock troopers of the Coruscant Guard and the Republic's clone commandos.

Some officers turned a blind eye when spotting Jedi, and in the following years others spied for the Rebel Alliance. Under the Empire, the Coruscant Guard took over the primary responsibility of Coruscant's security. The CSF acted in a support capacity to the Guard and was staffed by stormtroopers as well as regular police officers. It was also given a new name, the Imperial Sector Police, though many still referred to it as Coruscant Security, Police, or Constabulary. During that time, CSF commanders shared their police officers' resistance to the Emperor's rule.

The Second Galactic Civil War placed the CSF in the middle of the conflict between the Galactic Alliance and the Confederation. Some CSF officers were recruited into the Galactic Alliance Guard (GAG) to counter Corellian terrorist activities on Coruscant. The GAG was later disbanded following the death of the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Caedus. After the Civil War, the CSF continued to serve as Coruscant's police force.

Most politicians and influential citizens refused to do much about the situation, preferring to live in the upper levels and skyscrapers away from the unpleasantness of the lower levels and slums. Areas such as the Factory District and the Crimson Corridor were especially heavy with crime. The environment of the underworld was very cutthroat and police officers on patrol traveled frequently in groups. The cops who patrolled the underworld were also notoriously harder and burlier than officers assigned to the upper levels.

The CSF provided protection services to the Chief of State, including bodyguards and intelligence information. Day to day control of the Coruscant Security Force changed several times throughout its history. During the Old Republic era, a senior officer was appointed to lead the CSF with the title of Chief of Security though he would also hold a separate police rank. Centuries later, the commanding officers who were placed in charge of daily operations were collectively referred to as Coruscant Security Force Senior Command, later changed to Sector Command under the Galactic Empire.

The CSF also had other titles for various duties\u2014Agent was used to describe those working undercover or on special assignments, and the title of Incident Commander was used by the officer in charge of a major police operation.

Major investigations were handled by the Detective division. During the Old Republic era, CSF's Coruscant Control would monitor incoming and outgoing space traffic and the Customs Enforcement Division was charged with customs and immigration operations and checkpoint enforcement.

Shortly thereafter, the CSF uniform changed to blue-gray shirt and pants with a yellow strip that ran up the side of the pants and on the arms of the shirt, brown utility belts, and black boots. They could also done blue-gray blast vests over their chest and lower torso. In the waning years of the Republic, the general CSF uniform was a dark blue shirt and pants, dark boots, a utility belt, and dark blue body armor with a yellow blast vest as optional. This uniform would be used as the CSF standard in the decades to come."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Apart from the general, day-to-day uniform, special uniforms were used as well.

The rigid programming of the droids resulted in them being beyond weariness or corruption though it also would mean slick criminal could outsmart. In this, the droids, while heavily deployed, never fully replaced sentient officers.

Specifically, the Jedi could claim jurisdiction over a matter if a Jedi was involved, or at the request of the Republic. If involved in an incident, Jedi would inform the CSF of that but would not always give full explanations of their involvement.
