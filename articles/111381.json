At some point, Ramid and Ania attempted to escape their prison camp. While Ania managed to escape offworld to the Carreras system, Ramid was recaptured, beaten and imprisoned by the guards.

That year, an opportunity to settle scores with Ania emerged when the Galactic Federation Triumvirate, the new galactic government, placed a bounty on her head for the alleged murder of the Imperial Knight Teemen Alton. While Ania and her companions were visiting Lasgo Port, Ramid and his crew tricked Ania into coming aboard their starship under the pretext of repairing their damaged engine systems. Once aboard, Ania was kidnapped and imprisoned. Ramid and his crew intended to take Ania to the next inhabited system and hand her over to the Imperial authorities. However, Ramid's plans were thrown into disarray by the arrival of a third party\u2014a mysterious bounty hunter who had been Ania and Ramid's former jailer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following a prolonged pursuit over a remote world that rained acid, molten silica, and glass, the bounty hunter succeeded in downing Ramid's starship and killing his crew. However, Ramid and Ania survived the crash and joined forces to evade the bounty hunter and make their way to the planet's sole settlement, where they hope to get a transport offworld. While sheltering under Ramid's speeder bike during a \"glass storm\", the couple reconciled their differences. Ramid forgave Ania for abandoning him on Drash So while Ania forgave Ramid for kidnapping her. After the storm had subsided, they made their way to the settlement only to come under attack by the mysterious bounty hunter.

At some time, Ramid developed a romantic relationship with Ania Solo, a distant descendant of the smuggler Han Solo and a relation of the future Empress Marasiah Fel. Near the end of the Second Imperial Civil War, Ramid and Ania ended up in an Imperial labour camp on the planet Drash-so. During their time, the two were regularly beaten and mistreated by their Imperial guards, who wielded laser whips. At some point, Ramid and Ania plotted to escape from the labor camp.

However, Ramid survived the shooting and was thrown into solitary confinement by his Imperial captors. During his incarceration, Ramid was regularly beaten and tortured by the guards who demanded to know Ania's whereabouts and hos she had escape. After holding out for an unspecified period of time, Ramid broke down and told them everything he knew about Ania. The Imperials then followed Ramid's information but were unable to find Ania. Assuming that he had been lying, they had Ramid beaten up again. Following the death of the usurper Emperor Darth Krayt, the Drash-so prison camp was liberated by Fel Empire forces and Ramid was released. Due to his brutal experiences, Ramid harbored a deep sense of resentment and anger towards Ania, whom he believed had betrayed and abandoned him."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Bittersweet Reunion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 139 ABY, Ramid had become the captain of a starship and commanded a crew that included a female Twi'lek pilot and a Nikto crew member. While visiting the spaceport Lasgo Port which was based on a planet surrounded by a dangerous minefield, Ramid learnt that the new galactic government, the Galactic Federation Triumvirate, had imposed a bounty on her head for the alleged murder of the Imperial Knight Teemen Alton. Ramid somehow learnt that Ania was visiting the planet while her assassin droid companion AG-37 was delivering a shipment on his freighter. Ramid saw Ania's visit as an opportunity to exact revenge against his former lover. Ramid and his crew switched off their starship's atmospheric and communication systems and left their vessel adrift in the space minefield."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When AG-37's freighter passed by Ramid's starship, Ramid fired small-bore blaster shots at AG-37's freighter. Ania and her crew thought that a meteor had hit their starship and sent their Imperial comm droid to repair the surface damage. While doing its repair job, the droid spotted Ramid's seemingly-stricken vessel nearby. Ramid and his crew had switched off their ship's atmospheric and communication systems and donned spacesuits, creating the impression that their starship had broken down in space. After AG-37's freighter came to their aid and docked with Ramid's starship, Ania and her companions boarded the vessel to offer help and assistance. Ania soon encountered Ramid and his crew, and the two former lovers shared a passionate kiss. Ania was surprised that Ramid had survived which prompted the latter to comment that he was tougher to kill that he looked."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After introducing Ramid to her companions, Ania asked them whether they needed assistance, offering her Mon Calamari engineer Sauk's services and even a lift somewhere. Ramid claimed that his ship's net isolater had been damaged by a space mine, which fried the starships' systems. Since their deflector shield generator was down, they were unable to travel through the orbital minefield and had to wait for assistance. Due to her skills as a junk dealer, Ania was able to deduce that Ramid's starship needed a couple of new parts for the integration circuit. She then sent Sauk and her other companions AG-37 and the Imperial Knight Jao Assam back to AG-37's freighter to procure spareparts. When Ania was separated from her companions, Ramid claimed that he had something to talk to her about and led her into his starship."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Kidnapping"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once Ania was safely aboard, Ramid's crew sealed the docking hatch and flew away from AG-37's freighter. Ramid's Twi'lek pilot and Nikto crew member then grabbed Ania from behind, restraining her and locking her in a makeshift holding cell. Before jumping into hyperspace, Ramid's ship opened fire on several nearby mines in an attempt to destroy or delay Ania's companions. However, Ania's companions managed to survive the attack and quickly realized that Ania had been kidnapped. On Ramid's starship, Ania was locked in an improvised holding cell. When a Nikto crew member brought her refreshments, she demanded to see Ramid. When the guard refused, she hit him in the abdomen with a metal rod and made her way to the cockpit to confront Ramid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Ania was quickly overpowered by Ramid's Twi'lek pilot who restrained her with a blaster rifle. At that point, Ramid resurfaced and forcibly led Ania back to her cell.

He also revealed that wanted to collect the Triumvirate bounty on her head as revenge for her alleged betrayal on Drash-so.\nWhen Ania denied killing the Imperial Knight, Ramid refused to believe her and told her to be thankful that he and his crew were taking her to the authorities alive.

The pilot explained that their cold hyperspace jump had consumed more fuel than they had expected. Short on fuel, Ramid and his crew decided to land on the fourth world of an unnamed star system, which was home to a small outpost. This planet was an inhospitable planet with clouds that contained acidic vapor and rained molten silica or shards of glass. Despite the inhospitable nature of their destination, Ramid's crew had few choices due to the remote location of the star system. While descending into the planet's surface, Ramid's freighter was attacked by a TIE Bomber, a relic from the Galactic Civil War. Due to the poor quality of the ship's deflector shields, the smaller and more maneuverable TIE Bomber inflicted damage on Ramid's ship, killing his Twi'lek pilot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bereft of a pilot, Ramid dragged Ania out from her cell and forced her to land his ship. At the helm of Ramid's freighter, Ania struggled to land the heavy ship while dodging laser blasts from the TIE Bomber.

A mysterious bounty hunter than emerged from the TIE Bomber, which had landed nearby, and demanded that Ania surrender.

During that time, Ania and Ramid reconciled their differences. When Ania asked Ramid whether he could have crashed on a nicer planet, he retorted that he was not the one pilot the ship. Ania's hand was cut by a shard of glass and Ramid urged her to wrap it up. Ramid apologized for his actions and said that hurting her had not been part of his plan. Ania recalled that she had not seen a laser whip since their time at the Imperial prison camp on Drash-so. Ania also confided that there was something eerily familiar about the mysterious bounty hunter she had encountered. Ramid then discussed his plan to travel to the outpost and escape offworld before the bounty hunter caught up with them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ania then confronted Ramid on why he had kidnapped her despite knowing that she did not kill the Imperial Knight. Ramid admitted that he had been bitter about her leaving him behind during her escape from the Sith labor camp. Ania explained that she had fled because she thought that Ramid had been shot dead by the guard. She had kept on running because she knew that the guard would have shot her dead. She also had witnessed the guards dragging Ramid away and presumed that he was dead. She then escaped offworld which she admitted was not a proud thing.

The only reason the Sith had kept him alive was because they wanted to know Ania's whereabouts. In the end, Ramid had broken down and told them Ania's whereabouts. However, by then, Ania had fled to the Carreras system so the guards assumed him beaten up further. Ania apologized for the beatings and tortures which Ramid had endured and the two reconciled. As the storm began to deteriorate, Ania and Ramid witnessed several beetles approaching. However, the beetles were not interested in them and proceeded to devour the glass shards.

Ramid then expressed his regret on embarking on a foolhardy mission and getting several of his closets friends killed. He acknowledged that his animosity towards Ania had been misguided and asked her to forgive him. Ania forgave him, commenting that she was not good at holding grudges.

Ramid then stumbled upon a computer console and found that the station had transmitted a distress call. He then looked outside the window and saw the masked bounty hunter's TIE Bomber parked nearby. Realizing that Ania was in danger, he quickly went to look for her. Meanwhile, Ania had stumbled across the corpses of the settlement's inhabitants, which had been piled in a room.

Before the bounty hunter could deal with Ania, her Imperial Knight friend Jao Assam arrived on the scene and fought her with his lightsaber.
