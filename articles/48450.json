They came out of their habitat, usually caves, at dusk. The insects communicated to each other via their blinks, with short blinks indicating a summon. Firedrakes might attack anything their size or smaller while hunting, which Jaina Solo and Tenel Ka experienced. They distracted their prey with the flashes and ambushed in packs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Firedrakes were brought to other worlds such as Hapes, but they did not adapt to them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
