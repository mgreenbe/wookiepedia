Goron, along with fellow Trandoshan Clutch, also served the guild as pilots, flying a Trandoshan prisoner ship across the galaxy to kidnap potential prey. After kidnapping the Wookiee Chewbacca whom they got took as captive, the freighter was attacked by stranded Jedi younglings when the Trandoshans attempted to drop Chewbacca off on a Wasskah island. Goron climbed out onto the freighter's hull to repel the Jedi directly and was nearly successful in the ensuing fight. However, Clutch had dueled the Padawan Ahsoka Tano in the starship's cockpit.

As it happened, Tano had survived the past several days of Trandoshan pursuit, and had banded together with two kidnapped Jedi younglings, O-Mer and Jinx. Tano had inspired the younglings into fighting the Trandoshans, and had waited at Island Four's beach in order to take the Trandoshan freighter for themselves. Using the Force, Tano and the Jedi leaped high into the air and onto the ship, with Tano landing directly on the windshield, making her presence known to the Trandoshans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On orders from Clutch Goron climbed out onto the long hull of the ship, blaster rifle in hand, and attempted to shoot the younglings while Tano climbed into the ship behind him. Goron was disarmed, and resorted to hand to hand combats. Although stronger than either O-Mer or Jinx individually, the two Jedi working together proved to be a handful. Meanwhile, Tano engaged Clutch in the cockpit, which caused severe damage to the ship's controls and electronics, which caused the vessel to spin wildly and nearly throw Goron and O-Mer off of the ship. Both managed to hang on, with Goron hanging from a ledge just below the young Cerean Jedi. Goron grabbed O-Mer's leg in an attempt to drag him down, but the ship bucked and Goron lost his grip on the ship. Hanging from O-Mer's leg, Jinx intervened and kicked Goron away, sending the Trandoshan to his death below."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clutch was killed by Tano, and the ship crashed on the beach.
