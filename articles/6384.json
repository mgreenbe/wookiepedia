She would be required to return with the cargo to the Alliance Fleet's predetermined rendezvous point beyond the rim of the galaxy within five days, where, due to dire supply shortages, the Fleet's ships desperately needed the blaster gas. Indeed, Natejeka's mission was of great importance, for which Rieekan provided her with a Cloud City landing permit and four identi-sealed credit chip cards totaling 12,000 credits to complete."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "First, however, Natejeka would need to safely lead the Treasure Trove past the Imperial blockade of Hoth.
