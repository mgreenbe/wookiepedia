Gome entered Darga's employ after the Hutt first rose to power and the Duros was responsible for handling Darga's finances, to ensure that no data trails could be traced back to the Hutt. By the time of the early years of the Galactic Empire, Gome was elderly and had been working for Darga for decades, and he lived in an apartment within Darga's palace on the planet Cato Neimoidia. Gome spent most of his time inside his residence and he had little daily contact with anyone other that Darga's servants, who provided him with food."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
