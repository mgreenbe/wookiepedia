The port was captured by the Rebel Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry during its deployment to the world as a part of the Alliance's Mid Rim offensive, which began around 1 ABY. During a cleanup at Chenodra, Captain Micha Evon, better known as Howl, approached the rebel soldier Twitch, who was convinced she and fellow soldier Maximian Ajax had made a big mistake during their time on Bamayar. Instead of bringing up her mishap, Howl talked about the buildings at Chenodra and their columns and arches. Twitch later recounted this to a number of 61st personnel at a gathering after Howl's funeral in 3 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chenodra was mentioned in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
