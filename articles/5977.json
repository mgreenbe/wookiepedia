Not a member of the Republic, the native Althiri were forced to defend themselves when the first battle took place in 3976 BBY. As Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders invaded, the warriors of Althir fought valiantly against the barbarous conquerors but were eventually cowed under the forces of Canderous Ordo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While under Mandalorian rule for several years, Althir III was liberated when the Republic stormed the planet circa 3960 BBY. Leading the charge, Jedi Knight Revan was credited with handing a massive blow to the Mandalorian army. Not long after, Revan turned to the Dark side of the Force and deemed himself Dark Lord of the Sith. Along with his followers, Revan established an Empire to counter the Republic. Joining the Empire, Althir III would remain with Revan until the Republic beat back the Sith and once more rose victorious against the enemies of the Jedi Order. At the time of the Cold War, a proxy conflict between the Sith Empire and Galactic Republic, a nearly-dead smuggler programmed the coordinates of his great wealth into a droid that then went missing on Althir. Eventually, someone was sent to retrieve the droid on the planet and acquire the treasure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not aligning with the Republic after the war, it remained in contested space throughout the New Sith Wars up until the Ruusan Reformation when it was deemed safe to allow the planet to remain independent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Free of the evils of the Galactic Empire throughout the Galactic Civil War, Althir III's space was taken by Warlord Zsinj during his campaign against the New Republic.

While its status during the Galactic Alliance is unknown, Althir III was forced to become a member of the Empire of Darth Krayt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
