Trained as expendable death squads, they were activated after the Great Jedi Purge and subsequent termination of the cloning operation on Kamino. Not every Purge Trooper was one of the Jango Fett clones, but at least one group was from the last generation produced from the Fett template. As with their precursors in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic, Purge Troopers were programmed to obey Order 66, making them hostile against all Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 18 BBY, Purge Troopers accompanied Vader as well as the Sixth Brother, Ninth Sister, and Tenth Brother to the planet Mon Cala where they confronted Padawan Ferren Barr and his disciples.

Purge Troopers were also involved in the hunt for Cal Kestis, another Padawan of the fallen Jedi Order, during which they served under the Second Sister."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Purge Troopers were also assigned to guard the key locations of the Empire like Kashyyyk which housed a prison, that was later attacked by Cal Kestis with his crew and the unexpected help of Saw Gerrera, whose rebels had captured Wookiees from a resistance movement led by Chieftain Tarfful."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Purge Troopers were specialized Imperial soldiers who served the Inquisitorius, although some engaged their enemies without nearby support.

Using the Zeta-class shuttle Infernum, the squad touched down on a landing platform in Dac City. After the death of Ambassador Telvar, the Empire dispatched landing craft to Dac City under the command of Major Rantu, as well as landing craft throughout the world. Eventually, the Battle of Dac City commenced and the squad aided the Inquisitors in securing the platform, and then accompanied Vader and the Inquisitors to Dac City palace to capture King Lee-Char in order to uncover the location of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two enormous creatures jumped from beneath the ocean's surface and crashed back down, unleashing a tidal wave that destroyed the city. At the palace, Vader and the Inquisitors created a Force barrier in an attempt to stop the wave but were ultimately unsuccessful. Vader was separated from the others and the squad lost two members.

In the fight, which continued to Bel City, several members of Barr's group were killed and Vader left the group to find the king, while the squad and the Inquisitors continued. Barr, Verla, and Daren became trapped in an enclosed chamber. The Sixth Brother killed Daren with his lightsaber and the Tenth Brother told Barr and Verla that there was no escape.

After the Ninth Sister retorted that they knew him as well and that their original names were dead, Barr countered, saying that the past didn't die and that he studied how Sidious manipulated the galaxy, including the role clones, had, and unmasked the clones, revealing their faces. Barr continued, as he then knew he was correct when he thought that the clones were from the last production line and were activated after the Jedi Purge. When the Sixth Brother stated that the past did not matter, Barr retorted, saying that once someone was a Jedi, they were always a Jedi, and used the Force to command the squad to execute Order 66."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The young clones, in accordance with their programming opened fire on the three Inquisitors despite their protests. The Tenth Brother was almost immediately gunned down, while Barr and Verla escaped. Ninth Sister and Sixth Brother used the Force to push the clones out of the way so they could pursue Barr. However, Sixth Brother sliced off Ninth sister's leg to buy him time for his escape. He wished her good luck, and slyly remarked that she was always his favorite. Enraged, Ninth Sister told him he was dead and his actions wouldn't stop her. As the battle came to an end, only one Purge Trooper survived the chaos and sat amongst his fallen brothers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Hunting Cal Kestis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Five years into the Jedi Purge, Purge Troopers accompanied the Second Sister and Ninth Sister to Bracca in search of a Jedi, who turned out to be a Padawan named Cal Kestis.
