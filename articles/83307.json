The Loronar range of products contained everything from infantry weapons to space stations.

During the military build up that followed the establishment of the Galactic Empire, Loronar received a lucrative contract for the production of capital ships like the versatile Strike-class medium cruiser and massive Torpedo Spheres."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over time, Loronar gained a reputation for corruption, initiating riots on Ampliquen, staging a coup on King's Galquek and committing rights violations in the Gantho system. With the death of Palpatine and the decay of the Empire, Loronar, under the leadership of then-CEO Gnifmak Dymurra, aligned itself with Seti Ashgad in his bid for power in the Meridian sector. After subduing the revolt and returning the Loronar-abused tsil, the New Republic penalized Loronar heavily and brought those responsible for known crimes to justice. Loronar came close to bankruptcy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite this, the New Republic came to rely on the conglomerate for military supplies as the Empire and Old Republic had before it.
