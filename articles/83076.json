The Lontars defeated the Blood Carvers so completely that their target species was driven almost to the point of extinction; the Galactic Senate, however, intervened in the hostilities and forced the Lontars to halt their onslaught. Although some Blood Carvers remained on Batorine following the Lontars' cessation of hostilities, most of the survivors were taken to Coruscant, the capital of the Republic, where they were kept in seclusion, finally joining the Republic in 110 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lontars were created by Greg Bear for his novel Rogue Planet, published by Del Rey in 2000.
