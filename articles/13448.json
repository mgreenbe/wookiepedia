Hoping to obtain information held in the memory banks of a Confederate tactical droid, Jedi General Aayla Secura, along with Marshal Commander CC-5052 and three other clone troopers, set a trap by fabricating an information bunker, which\u2014as the tactical droid was led to believe\u2014stored important Galactic Republic data files. A force of battle droids commanded by the tactical droid soon walked right into the trap, where they were attacked by the clone troopers. The clones quickly destroyed the tactical droid's escort, and Secura beheaded the droid herself. The Jedi then took the droid's head in order to perform a robolobotomy and discover what secrets it held."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY during the Clone Wars, Jedi General Aayla Secura and a squad of clone troopers led by Marshal Commander CC-5052 attempted to obtain information held in the memory banks of a Confederate tactical droid.
