Agolerga counted among his friends the Naberrie family, and in 22 BBY, he was approached by the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO, who were presenting a private holographic message. Agolerga accepted the message, which contained an image of a young woman who was requesting that he perform a secret marriage. The Pontifex was surprised by the request, as no member of the Brotherhood had presided over a marriage for 300 years, since civil ceremonies had become popular during the reign of King Narml\u00e9."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Agolerga accepted the task, and donned his holy purple robes, before the two droids led him to a Gondola Speeder, and took him to Varykino, an estate on the other side of the Lake Country. There, the Pontifex met the young couple, who identified themselves as \"Ver\u00e9\" and \"Set\", named for the fabled Ver\u00e9 and Set, lovers in an old Futhork legend. After a brief ceremony, Agolerga pronounced the couple husband and wife. Before he departed Varykino, \"Set\" instructed the Pontifex not to tell anyone of their union, and so the only record Agolerga maintained of their matrimony was kept on a scroll in the Brotherhood's archives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Agolerga later recorded the event once again, this time in a data book. When it was learned that the people he had wed were Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, he passed the information onto Amidala's niece, Pooja Naberrie. The information, however, had not been kept as much of a secret as Agolerga thought, as both a member of the civil clergy and Captain Quarsh Panaka of the Royal Naboo Security Forces had discovered it, and seen fit to inform Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who used the information to bend Skywalker to his will in 19 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the fact that he had been summoned to perform a wedding he knew nothing about, Agolerga was willing to take part in the ceremony.
