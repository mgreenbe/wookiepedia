With the help of Darth Sidious, Gunray invaded the planet to end the trade dispute and secured all facilities in the capital of Theed. He attempted to force the incumbent Queen of Naboo Padm\u00e9 Amidala to sign a treaty to make his invasion legal, however she refused and the Siege of Naboo continued.

The Trade Federation, under Gunray's command, joined Dooku's separatist movement and Gunray was named Head of the newly formed Separatist Council and so formed the Separatist Army.

Gunray's plan ultimately failed and he was captured by the Republic and given to Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano. Dooku sent his Dark Jedi apprentice, Asajj Ventress, to rescue the Viceroy from the Republic forces.

OOL-2 mistakenly reported to Nute Gunray that Gundarks had destroyed the power core and the Viceroy ordered that the gundarks be exterminated and their pelts sold to their Trandoshan ally Pekt. The droid army attacked the gundark nest, but there encountered Chewbacca and a group of Wookiee bowcaster troopers, who were also prepared to kill the gundarks.

Sceptical but curious, Gunray declared that he would have no part in covert schemes, but Sidious offered to enhance his position in the Trade Federation, both flattering and blackmailing the Viceroy with knowledge of his childhood and of his meetings across Coruscant.

Sidious repeated his offer of a partnership, offering to demonstrate his power by choking the pylat over the call. Aghast, Gunray grudgingly accepted cooperation with Sidious, who told him that Naboo and the Republic were planning to betray the Trade Federation: Sidious' public identity of Palpatine was advocating for renewed taxation of the Free Trade Zones that had made the Federation wealthy, while King Ars Veruna of Naboo was planning to abandon the planet's export agreement with the Trade Federation. Sidious flattered Gunray by saying that only he could provide the leadership the Federation needed. Promising Gunray a \"surprise promotion\", Sidious dispatched his apprentice Darth Maul to the mining world of Dorvalla, where Maul pit the rival companies Lommite Limited and InterGalactic Ore against one another. The Trade Federation had long sought to control the planet's lommite trade, and owing to Maul's actions the two companies merged to form Dorvalla Mining, which soon agreed to allow the Trade Federation to export lommite ore, and to accept Trade Federation representation in the Senate.

Fearing the repercussions of Darth Sidious were to discover Monchar's treachery, Gunray told Sidious that Monchar had simply been taken ill from too much rich food.

However, the two Jedi managed to escape, but Gunray decided to keep this secret from Sidious for the time being. Gunray was smug when talking with Queen Amidala, telling her he knew nothing of any ambassadors. Amidala told Gunray he had gone too far before ending the transmission.

Gunray was also a highly successful businessman, his talents in this field catching the attention of Darth Sidious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gunray was openly fearful of Darth Sidious, but was frequently forced to place his fate in the Sith's hands. Early in their relationship, working with Sidious yielded great rewards for Gunray, though by the end of the Clone Wars, he had come to regret ever allying with the Sith and placing himself under their control. His personality grated against General Grievous, who, unlike Gunray, was a vicious, strategically-minded military commander with a sense of authority. Gunray, in turn, despised Grievous, and believed the General to be unstable and arrogant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although frequently perceived as a coward, Gunray was willing to get his own hands dirty if he was threatened, and delighted in exacting revenge upon those he felt had wronged him in some way; this was especially true in the case of his unhealthy obsession with killing Padm\u00e9 Amidala. While often perceived as villainous, Gunray was not any different from his Neimoidian peers, whose culture was entirely devoid of the notion of morality that motivated other species. However, he was at least pragmatic enough to realize if he broke the law, he would suffer for it, as evidenced by his skepticism towards Darth Sidious's order that he have the Trade Federation invade Naboo due to the likelihood of such an action being illegal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gunray wore a large headdress as a symbol of his power, and forbade his colleagues from wearing a taller piece, even instituting regular measuring contests to enforce his own ego. Gunray was highly acquisitive, and kept a vast trove of treasures and keepsakes in the vaults of his private redoubt on Cato Neimoidia. Amongst his collection were robes and miters, resplendent jewelry, priceless works of art. Gunray was particularly fond of Hutt artwork, as he greatly admired the species for their business skill,[source?] power, and success. He also purchased his personal mecho-chair to emulate their repulsor-thrones."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nute Gunray was played by Silas Carson, who also played Ki-Adi-Mundi, Neimoidian Senator Lott Dod, and Republic Lieutenant Williams in all three episodes of the prequel trilogy. Carson, when portraying the character, voiced him with a Thai accent. He was played by voice-actor Phil Proctor in the game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, by Tom Kenny in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars TV series, by David W. Collins in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith video game, and by Scott Cleverdon in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace video game. Besides Palpatine, he is the only villain to appear in all three episodes of the prequel trilogy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A scene cut from Attack of the Clones shows Anakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala put on trial by the Geonosians. Nute Gunray watches from the side and, when the trial goes on too long, he shouts to Poggle the Lesser: \"Get on with it, carry out the sentence. I want to see her suffer!\". Poggle the Lesser quickly wraps up the trial and orders his guards to take Anakin and Padm\u00e9 to the execution arena."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A scene in the script for Revenge of the Sith, which did not make it into the film but was probably filmed, featured Nute Gunray and Rune Haako hiding under a table as Darth Vader slaughtered the Separatist Council. Rune Haako panicked and tried to escape, but was quickly killed by Vader (seen in the film), but Nute stayed hidden. As Vader killed the others, Nute quickly got out from under the table and activated the control panel for the doors to open. As the other council members were all killed, droidekas entered and opened fire on Vader. Gunray watched as the smoke cleared and found Vader gone. Vader then drops down from the roof and destroys the droids, after which he jumps over to Gunray and cuts off his head. This explains why Nute is so surprised when Vader jumps at him\u2014he thought he had been killed off by the droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Various adaptations of The Phantom Menace and Revenge of the Sith had minor differences. In the The Phantom Menace video game, Gunray can be killed while playing as Queen Amidala in her final level (this will lead to the next phase of the level regardless if the final droids he summons are disposed of, this also does not affect the final outcome of the game). In the Revenge of the Sith video game, Gunray escaped Vader in the Separatist control center on Mustafar and attempted to flee in his ship, which was destroyed by the vengeful former Jedi and then plunged into the lava river beneath. In the Revenge of the Sith novelization, Vader responded to Gunray's remark of the promise of peace by saying that Sidious's transmission had been garbled, and that the Sith had actually said they would be \"left in pieces\" (though Gunray's body was relatively intact when compared to most of the other Separatist leaders). In the Revenge of the Sith comic adaptation, Gunray appears in his Attack of the Clones costume on Utapau, unlike in the film."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gunray's Revenge of the Sith head piece is the only one without three points."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nute Gunray's name had two sources from real life: The first was the Republican congressman Newt Gingrich, and the second was former president Ronald Reagan. The former source was because Lucas primarily wrote the Trade Federation members in terms of motives and characterizations in response to the 1994 Republican Revolution (which occurred eight days into Lucas's draft-writing the film), specifically then-Speaker of the House Gingrich's Contract with America, and the latter source was as a response to Reagan's SDI program being labeled as \"Star Wars\" without Lucas' permission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
