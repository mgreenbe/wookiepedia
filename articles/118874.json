Sometime before the raid on Kessel, she was involved in an airspeeder crash and badly damaged. She was then sold to Tibbs Ospe, who stripped out her cognitive unit for the bar at the Fort Ypso Lodge and used her as a translator. The bartender Midnight made a deal with the custom droid L3-37 that she could keep parts for Essvee. Midnight later wrote about his work with Essvee in his journal, saying that she only complained about the job once an hour."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SV-38P was first mentioned in the 2018 Studio Fun International replica journal Solo: A Star Wars Story: Tales from Vandor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
