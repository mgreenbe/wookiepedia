The room was dominated by a huge bed covered by a crown-shaped canopy, which was surrounded by other furniture, including many couches, armchairs, and writing desks. It had two other rooms that in 36 ABY included a simple sleeping pallet that Tenel Ka preferred to sleep on and in the farthest room, a crib for her baby Allana. It was here that Jacen Solo came to meet the Queen in 36 ABY, when he discovered he was Allana's father."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
