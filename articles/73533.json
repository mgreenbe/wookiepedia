Prior to a vote on Indu San deciding the outcome of an alliance between the Indu San system and the New Republic, Darme planted a bomb in the comm and voting panel at Barayel's position on the Indu Council's U-shaped conference table. Before Barayel could cast his vote on the volatile issue at stake, Darme remotely detonated the bomb. In the midst of the confusion, he followed Ambassador Dictio L'varren's aide, Tev Aden, into a corridor and proceeded to kill him with a blaster. Galactic News Network reporter Kella Rand had followed Darme and another Authority Officer into the corridor. There, Rand's hovercam recorded Darme as he appeared to remove a detonator from Aden's body. However, the detonator was in fact planted by Darme in an effort to pin the assassination on the New Republic. By doing so, Darme hoped to weaken New Republic support and bring the Empire back to Indu San."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, at the Indu GNN bureau, Kella Rand discovered an image of Darme planting the bomb that killed Barayel while going through several of her past interviews.

Meanwhile, Juloff, an Imperial supporter like Darme, notified Darme that Rand held evidence incriminating him. When Rand arrived at L'varren's hotel, Juloff singled her out to Darme, who quickly chased after her. As Rand raced to L'varren's residence in Suite 44-1, she sent her hovercam ahead with the evidence. However, Darme managed to catch Rand before she could reach the suite. He pulled her into a turbolift, threatened her with a vibroknife, took her datacards, and shot her with a stun bolt. Darme then used his vibro-knife to escape the turbolift, but was soon caught by L'varren's people, who had seen the evidence and set out in pursuit of the killer. Darme was quickly brought to justice, and Kella Rand was rescued and able to report her story."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kaleb Darme was staunchly loyal to the Galactic Empire, working to weaken New Republic support and bring the Empire back to Indu San.
