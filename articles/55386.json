The bedrock that comprised the station's foundations harbored several strange characteristics. When heated, the mineral compounds absorbed ambient light rays, but when it cooled, it released those rays, playing them back; essentially, a natural hologram."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the Battle of Hoth, the Rebel Alliance maintained a temporary base of operations on Golrath.

During his occupation, he discovered several holograms projected from the bedrock foundations detailing Rebel training sequences.

Aware that Golrath Station was now under Imperial control, she personally led a strike team to the planet's surface to destroy any past evidence of their existence.

Both Leia and Giel managed to escape before the reactor core exploded, destroying the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
