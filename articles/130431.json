Sometime prior to 10 BBY during the reign of the Galactic Empire, the Besalisk Dexter Jettster traveled to the Tingel Arm world Athus Klee on a star-streamer. When the vehicle landed, the other passengers quickly disembarked and moved into the Spacers' District, and by the time Jettster had made it down the star-streamer's ramp, every nearby inn was fully booked. Jettster later wrote about the incident in the book that would become known as the Smuggler's Guide."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A star-streamer was first mentioned in the 2018 reference book Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide, which was written by Daniel Wallace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
