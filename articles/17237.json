It steadied the weapon to facilitate aiming and firing. Normally, it was used while prone or adjacent to waist-high or chest-high cover. A bipod could also be used as a mount for heavy weapons such as heavy repeating blasters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The image shows a custom-made Verpine sniper rifle with a bipod, made by the U.S. soldier Raymond Ramirez, a fan with a special connection to Karen Traviss and Star Wars. He made a Verpine sniper rifle on Karen Traviss' request which she posted on her livejournal.com blog - the entry has, unfortunately, been deleted, but an image of the weapon can be found at photobucket. Ramirez's blog has been featured on StarWars.com, where a smaller image of the Verpine sniper rifle with bipod can be found. One of his blog entries goes deep into the weapon's functions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
