The power generator was located at the rear of the bike, flanked by two cargo panniers capable of holding up to 100 kilograms of supplies. Its inhibitors prevented it from raising more than 6 meters above the ground. Like most swoops it emphasized speed and power over safety and maneuverability."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Owen Lars purchased his swoop bike from a Revwien trader in Mos Nytram.
