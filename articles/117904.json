Its creator, the Dark Lord of the Sith Skere Kaan, argued that the strong should see their power increase while the weak should see their power decrease. That philosophy was also present in the culture of the Ailon species. Under that rule, Lord Kaan and his allies sought to topple both the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order and install a dark side theocracy. With the rise of Darth Bane and his Order of the Sith Lords, the Rule by the Strong was supplanted by the Rule of Two, which reduced the number of Sith Lords to a single pair at a time: a master and an apprentice. However, the three-eyed mutant called Darth Millennial, although he was a Banite Sith, decided to resurrect the Rule by the Strong. In order to do so, Millennial rebelled against the teachings of his master Darth Cognus, and he left the Order to create the Dark Force religion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
