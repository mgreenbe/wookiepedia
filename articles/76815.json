He and Navett opened a pet store\u2014Exoticalia's Pet Emporium\u2014as a cover. Using this cover, they put a plan into motion to use metalmites and baby mawkrens so Navett could gain access to and sabotage the generator buildings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterward, he accompanied the two other members of the cell (Pensin and Horvic) and infiltrated the Ishori cruiser Predominance posing as maintenance workers. Once Navett succeeded in taking the planetary shields down, the three agents killed their Ishori escorts, seized control of a weapons turret, and began the bombardment of Drev'starn, setting off a battle at Bothawui. They fired eight shots at the defenseless city before being neutralized."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
