In 6 BBY, Captain Lun Tessra, the commander of the 37th Imperial Fighter Wing, suffered from temp-flu while fighting in the Reslian Purge, against the forces of the Lortans. As a result, Tessra's subordinate Lieutenant Soontir Fel assumed a leadership role within the unit, to compensate for Tessra's neglectfulness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
