Koon eventually became the Padawan of Ithorian Master Saldith. In 44 BBY, she was involved in the Stark Hyperspace War between the Galactic Republic and the Stark Commercial Combine and assisted her uncle and the Jedi High Council in bringing an end to the conflict. After rising to the rank of Jedi Knight, Koon took the Jedi Baylis Archan as her Padawan. In 19 BBY, the final year of the Clone Wars, Koon fought alongside Jedi Knight Halagad Ventor and a detachment of Republic clone troopers in a battle on the planet Bal'demnic. Later that year, Koon, Archan, and a command of troopers fought against the Separatists in a battle on Giju. During that engagement, Koon's soldiers were killed, along with her Padawan.

She escaped the attack on the Jedi Temple, which was led by the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader. Weeks after Palpatine declared himself Emperor of the Galactic Empire, Koon lured Darth Vader into a trap in the Jedi Temple's underlevels. In the ensuing duel, Koon was able to injure Vader but was mortally wounded by the Sith Lord.

Saldith reassured the Council that Koon's mind was calm and told the Jedi Council member Mace Windu that he had felt it best to approach the Council on this matter, since Saldith knew that the Kel Dor species communicated with their minds.

After the battle, the Republic assigned a fleet to protect Bal'demnic from further Separatist operations. Later that year, Koon and Baylis Archan were sent with a command of clones to the planet Giju. A battle ensued with the Separatists, and both Koon's forces and her Padawan were killed.

Before Koon dueled Vader underneath the Jedi Temple, she told the Sith that she believed him to be a murderer of children, a traitor to his friends, and a destroyer of the Jedi to whom he was once allied.
