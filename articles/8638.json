This particular forearm shield unit afforded the wearer protection against temperature extremes, namely heat and cold, as well as energy- and sonic-based weaponry. The unit's power cell could burnout from the stress of absorbing damage or from excessive use. Such a burnout required that the entire unit be replaced."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
