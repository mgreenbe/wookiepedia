Although light freighters could usually hold their own in combat against other fighter craft, larger vessels, such as bulk freighters tended to be less capable. These large freighters could be easy targets considering their large size, slow speed, and weak armament. For this reason most heavy freighters required escorts when navigating more dangerous regions of the galaxy.
