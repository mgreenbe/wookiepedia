Local legend told of sunken treasure in Zelosian's Chine, a prominent coral ridge in the Great Zelosi Sea. On the Day of the Sepulchral Night, the fourth moon of Zelos II aligned with the sun, putting the tides in that region at their lowest and the purported treasure at its most accessible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The local Zelosians were very superstitious about the eclipse and kept themselves indoors during the Day of the Sepulchral Night. As a Qwohog, K'zk couldn't risk exposure to seawater, so he offered a 50/50 split with Diergu-Rea and Solum'ke."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the way to Zelosian's Chine, they encounter two Corellian survivors of a recent shipwreck, Hanugar and Sevik.

The treasure is enough to set all of them for life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The small cave suddenly begins to fill with water, as the eclipse begins to end.

However, Diergu-Rea points out that Solum'ke is wearing a green crystal necklace that he put on her while in the cave, and that his pockets are full of crystals and jewels. Diergu-Rea assures her that another ship will be coming by shortly and tracking down two Corellians and a Qwohog shouldn't be too hard for the best bounty hunters in the sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
