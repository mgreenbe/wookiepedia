Katooni travelled to Ilum on board the Crucible alongside his fellow younglings and Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who was their guide for the experience. Upon touching down, Katooni and the other younglings travelled to the Crystal Cave, where they and Ahsoka met with Grand Master Yoda for the beginnings of the trial."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yoda explained that the younglings would have to travel deep into the caverns of the cave to retrieve the crystal meant for them, and if they didn't make it back before the exit froze over they would most likely die. The younglings hastily travelled into the cave and split up to find their crystals. Katooni was able to find her crystal rather quickly, but she had to climb to get her crystal. Eventually Katooni was able to obtain her crystal, escaping the Crystal Cave with little time to spare, as she had been trapped in ice. When Petro, the last one inside, also made it out, the group travelled back to the Crucible with Ahsoka to build their lightsabers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After leaving Ilum's atmosphere, Katooni and the other younglings were greeted by Huyang, a droid who had instructed Jedi for millennia on how to construct their lightsabers.
