It was built by Assembler Kud'ar Mub'at who lived there with his subnodes. The Ghostling Nest was destroyed by Boba Fett and the Prince Xizor during the Bounty Hunter Wars. Boba Fett and Dengar partially rebuilt the web by the time of the Battle of Endor, and the Ghostling Nest was eventually used by Balancesheet in some occasions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
