The nebula consisted of mostly gases but contained some meteoroid or dust clouds which were dense enough to prevent sensor arrays or transmitters penetrating the area, making it especially dangerous to navigate. The nebula appeared to be a crimson red color to those who viewed it in space. The nebula slowly expanded, engulfing more of the Cholgana system as it did so. By the time of the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, the planet Cholganna passed through the nebula for approximately two thirds of its orbit of its star systems sun."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chol nebula first appeared in 2013 in Beyond the Rim, an adventure module written by Sterling Hershey for the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game, Star Wars: Edge of the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
