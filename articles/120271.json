It shared common ancestry with other species, including the rathtar, blixus, and vixus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sarlaccs began their lives as spores and were able to travel great distances. When a male and female encountered one another, the smaller male would parasitically feed off the female, diminishing her size while increasing his own. Once the male reached the female's original size, he would burst, releasing millions of spores into the air and atmosphere."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once sarlaccs reached their maturity after 30,000 years, they would burrow themselves nearly 100 meters below the surface, feeding on creatures unfortunate enough to fall into their mouths. Victims of the sarlacc were injected with immobilizing neurotoxins that caused constant pain, and, while still conscious, digested for millennia due to the creature's weak stomach acid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A hundred meters in height, its entire body was buried in sand, save its massive mouth and beaked tongue. The sarlacc had several appendages that branched off from its buried body, and many stomachs. The creature swallowed its prey whole, and its mouth contained rows of hundreds of spear-like teeth, which kept the victim from climbing back out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There was some debate among xenobiologists as to whether the creature was an animal or an unusual carnivorous plant, though most found the creature far too dangerous to merit an extended study of the question. The sarlacc shared a common ancestor with the rathtar, blixus, and vixus, and all possessed a large maw, tentacles, and a voracious appetite. Each was native to different worlds and had adapted differently to become a great hunter in its specific environment, with the sarlacc becoming the largest and least mobile of its relatives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A predator to the sarlacc was the krayt dragon. According to Tusken Raiders, krayt dragons could eat sarlaccs alive, then burrowed in the cavity left behind, only coming out when hungry or provoked."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A sarlacc was mentioned on a bill seen in the Power Sliders diner during the Clone Wars. After Luke Skywalker killed Jabba's rancor Pateesa as part of his rescue of Leia Organa, Han Solo. and Chewbacca, Jabba became outraged and ordered that they all be fed to the sarlacc. Luke described this as being the last mistake that he would ever make, but Jabba was unimpressed and had the group escorted out. Upon arrival at the Great Pit of Carkoon, Skywalker, using his recently developed skills as a Jedi Knight, rescued the group, and led to a number of Jabba's guards becoming victims of the sarlacc instead. The bounty hunter Boba Fett was also knocked into the mouth of the sarlacc by Han Solo. Unable to move quickly, the creature was wounded when Jabba's sail barge, Khetanna, exploded. Sometime before 9 ABY,[source?] Boba Fett escaped the belly of the Sarlacc."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Cold War, a squad of Resistance members known as J-Squadron landed on the planet Vodran, and encountered a Sarlacc that tried to ingest them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sound of the sarlacc in Return of the Jedi was created from sounds of alligator hisses, as well as the sounds of some of the Jedi crew's stomachs after eating pizza."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Special Edition of Return of the Jedi, the sarlacc in the Great Pit of Carkoon was revised to include a beak-like maw, with a tongue and extra tentacles.
