Headed by a case officer stationed at sector headquarters, they were immobile intelligence networks based in a star system. The cell network was populated by natives of the system or planet, recruited by either the Case Officer on on-site operatives. Once in place, the network was left to run itself without outside interference from Alliance Intelligence unless the system or planet was vital to the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Networks varied in size and competency, depending on the system, which resulted in varying levels of quality in gathered intelligence. Each case officer was usually a retired 23er, constantly on guard for Imperial infiltration attempts and ready to close the network at a moment's notice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Systems Operations operatives commonly authored the SecuriDexs issued by Analysis that detailed potential threats to the Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
