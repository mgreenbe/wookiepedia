The Yuuzhan Vong took with them the genes of the p'hiili with the purpose of recreating the creatures later on. After the Yuuzhan Vong conquered the New Republic's capital world of Coruscant in 27 ABY, the p'hiili were recreated and placed on the newly terraformed world, which had been renamed Yuuzhan'tar in memory of the Yuuzhan Vong's original homeworld. In 28 ABY, on the new Yuuzhan'tar, some p'hiili were present in a pool of water that was overlooked by a shrine to the Yuuzhan Vong god Yun-Harla, and their cries intermingled with those of the ngom, another type of creature."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "P'hiili first appeared in author Greg Keyes' 2003 novel, The New Jedi Order: The Final Prophecy, the penultimate installment in The New Jedi Order series.
