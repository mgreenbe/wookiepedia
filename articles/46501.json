Similar to other models of the series, the Star Guard had two wings and four rear engines, and it featured laser cannons on each wing. The Clarion lacked the weapon capacity typical of other strike fighters, but possessed a powerful sensor suite and command-and-control systems to boost squadron effectiveness. It sacrificed some maneuverability and speed for heavier defenses, and its secondary weapons were designed for eliminating stationary and armored targets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
