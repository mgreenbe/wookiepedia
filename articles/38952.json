In 3643 BBY he operated on Coruscant along with his Rattataki Big Jan. To avoid Republic authorities, they smuggled the spice in small plastic ampoules implanted under the skin of their traffickers. When \"Doctor Hope\" was approached by Voidhound and Corso Riggs looking for information on Corso's cousin Rona Riggs, he conned Corso into serving as a trafficker for one delivery in exchange for setting up a meeting with his kin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
