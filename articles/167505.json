It was the sixth planet in the star system and had a very cold climate that resulted in it being covered in ice. Due to its remote location, ancient Jedi Masters traveled to the planet to hide the Soulsaber, a dark-side device. They constructed the Cavern of Light and placed the artifact there. During the Galactic Civil War, the Dark Jedi Thaum Rystra traveled to the planet in order to steal the Soulsaber. A group of Rebel Alliance fighters battled him there, but he was able to flee with it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
