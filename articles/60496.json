The heavy squadron was generally configured in one of two ways. The first configuration consisted of two heavy attack lines, a attack line, and a recon line, for a force of between eighteen and twenty-four ships. The second configuration was composed of three heavy lines, and a skirmish line, for a force totalling between twenty-eight and thirty-six ships. The first configuration was deployed when an enemy was known to be present, but the disposition and location of the enemy was unknown. The second configuration was deployed when enemy ships were known to be defending an asset, so a fight was more likely than an enemy withdrawal. Victory-class Star Destroyers were commonly assigned to the latter configuration of heavy squadron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
