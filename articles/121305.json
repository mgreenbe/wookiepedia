Scyva was said to weep beside those Zakuulans who marched to embrace Izax, and Scyva and Izax had four children: the god of rage Tyth, the twin goddesses of passion and envy Aivela and Esne, and Nahut.

After defeating Tyth, Aivela and Esne, the strike team head towards an empty chamber, where the Son of Shadows remains stealthed, asking Scyva to destroy the strike team. Unlike with her other children, Scyva refused to his request and active his containment protocols.
