However, he ensured the information was not released. During the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, the comm station was left offline; preventing communications between the planet and the New Republic. Given their hatred of mechanical technology, the machine was presumably destroyed by the Yuuzhan Vong during their occupation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
