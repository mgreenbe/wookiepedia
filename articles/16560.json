He later became a trooper in Galactic Alliance Security, a security force located on the galactic capital of Coruscant. There, he served under the command of Security Captain Savar. In 43.5 ABY, Bessen took part in the arrest of Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker, who had been indicted with failing to prevent former Jedi Knight Jacen Solo's fall to the dark side of the Force. The Security troopers were joined by three bounty hunters hired by the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances\u2014Skakoan politician Hrym Mawarr, Human bounty hunter Zilaash Kuh, and Quarren inventor Dhidal Nyz."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the arrest, ex-smuggler Han Solo, who was accompanying Skywalker at the time, insulted Savar, causing the captain to stiffen. Nyz assumed that Skywalker was attempting to use the Force on the captain, and he exclaimed that the prisoner was resisting. Surprised by the sudden commotion, Bessen lost his nerve and involuntarily fired off a shot at the Jedi from his blaster. Skywalker dodged the bolt, and Jedi Master Kam Solusar, who had also been accompanying Skywalker at the time of his arrest, deflected the shot aside with his lightsaber. Solo abruptly shot Bessen's gun out of his hand, destroying it before he could fire it again. As the situation was brought back under control, Savar punished Bessen for firing on the prisoner and ordered Carn, a sergeant, to watch him do 200 push-ups and then run back to the Galactic Alliance Security blockhouse on foot. Meanwhile, Savar and the other Security troopers took Skywalker back to the blockhouse in the captain's personnel carrier speeder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to his inexperience in the field, Bessen was slightly anxious and easily startled, resulting in his reflexive shot at Skywalker.
