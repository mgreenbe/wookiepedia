It was roughly the size of the EnhanceScan general purpose scanner and was designed for the inspection of existing structures. Through the use of an SE-90, an engineer could determine the materials used to build a structure and could see through the walls to the hidden structures within. The device could also detect stress fractures and weak points in the structure, as well as concealed armor, reinforced sections, conduits, hidden spaces, and the like. The cost of an SE-90 Structural Engineering Scanner is 675 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The SE-90 Structural Engineering Scanner was mentioned in Gadgets and Gear, a roleplaying supplementary sourcebook for the Star Wars Roleplaying series that was published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
