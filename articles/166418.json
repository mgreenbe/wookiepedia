They had thick skin and were found on both Carreras Major and an unidentified planet that hosted the spaceport of Lasgo Port. They were wild beasts but could be domesticated. In 138 ABY, the junk dealer Ania Solo and her Mon Calamari friend Sauk encountered a yarthul, that was being ridden by a security guard.
