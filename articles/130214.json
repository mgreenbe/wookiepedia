Hegerty, disillusioned by the attitude of the Empire, deserted her post, stole the vessel used to transport rutgar-4 from the mines into orbit, and started to lead a group of Ssither in raids against the Imperial mining facility. In reality some Imperials had already discovered the existence of the Ssither before Hegerty's arrival and some had been put to work in Jatee's mines before an explosion that resulted in the deaths of a number of humans convinced the authorities to fully automate the operation. The information on the existence of the Ssither was never relayed to Demophon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the Demophon Star went Supernova, late in the Galactic Civil War, Dr. Hegerty and a group of rebel agents rescued a number of the Ssither from their doomed homeworld. There was not enough room in the stolen Imperial ship, The Hard Shell, for all the Ssither so they were forced to select the youngest and strongest to ensure the species survival. The rebels deposited the Ssither on the uninhabited world of Butler's Cove."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
