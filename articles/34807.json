He slew Kolar, Tinn and Fisto easily, but had an extended confrontation with Windu. The Jedi guided the battle towards the bay window of the Sith Lord's office and out onto the wind-blown ledge outside. Windu disarmed the Sith Lord with a surgically precise kick to the face, throwing Sidious off-balance and causing the Sith Lord to drop his lightsaber as he flailed for purchase. The lightsaber fell out the window into the seemingly bottomless streets and alleyways of Coruscant below just before Skywalker showed up. Consequentially, Sidious was forced to use only one lightsaber from there on out."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Showdown in the Senate Building"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda realized what had happened, Yoda went to face the Emperor personally at the Senate Building, while Kenobi headed off to kill Darth Vader. Yoda surprised Sidious, who told him that his arrogance blinded him and that his apprentice would be more powerful than both of them. Yoda answered Sidious that his faith in Vader was a mistake along with his faith in the dark side. Yoda then dueled Sidious, who used his remaining lightsaber to face the Jedi Master. The duel brought them to the Galactic Senate Chamber, the heart of the Senate. Sidious hurled Senate pods at Yoda, and the effort to avoid them exhausted the Jedi Master. Sidious then blasted Yoda with Force lightning, but with the last of his strength, the Jedi Master repelled it enough to send both himself and Sidious over the pod's edge. Sidious was able to hold on to a senate pod, while Yoda fell to the Senate floor, leaving only his cloak.
