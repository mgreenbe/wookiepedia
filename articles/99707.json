The story is about a clan of Jawas who salvage an X-wing starfighter. It is noticeable as it does not have any dialogue, much like the comic book panels of Peter M.

One Jawa is attempting to repair an R5 unit but becomes frustrated and knocks over the droid. Other members of the clan begin to laugh at the Jawa, and he lashes out, attacking his fellow Jawas and destroying all the droids in the garage. When the Jawas arrive at the moisture farm, the Jawa leader discovers the destruction and scolds the perpetrator. With no droids, the sandcrawler drives right by the moisture farmer and his family. Later, a scouting party of Jawas goes out to search the desert, when they happen across a crashed X-wing starfighter. The downed Rebel pilot surrenders to a squad of sandtroopers, but the Imperials immediately execute him and then leave the area. The Jawas decide to claim the X-wing, and the Jawa leader claims that they will repair the craft and sell it to make a profit. The Jawa who destroyed their droids is forced to fix the craft by himself, and he uses his R5 unit to eventually repair the starfighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, when the Jawa tells the good news to the leader, he is turned away. The leader has spotted a TIE Advanced x1 being salvaged by a trio of scavengers, and the X-wing now seems worthless by comparison. Frustrated, the Jawa repairer fits the R5 into the repaired X-wing and takes off to steal the TIE Advanced. Using magnetic clamps, the Jawa pulls the TIE Advanced off of its repulsor platform, to the shock of the scavengers. The Jawa makes his way back to the sandcrawler, but the weight of the TIE Advanced causes the Jawa to veer towards the sandcrawler. As the Jawas panic and run for their lives, the Jawa pilot crashes into the side of the sandcrawler and completely destroys his X-wing starfighter. However, the TIE Advanced is completely intact, and the Jawa clan celebrates their new hero."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally published in Japan, the stories from Tokyopop's Star Wars Manga were considered to be of \"fuzzy\" continuity by Lucasfilm.

When the Jawa clan first spy the TIE advanced fighter, they discuss a scenario where a YT-1300 light freighter shoots down the TIE and it lands on Tatooine. This seems to suggest that the fighter is actually Darth Vader's TIE Advanced x1, since one of the pictograms shows Vader next to the TIE advanced. This may be just a story heard by the Jawas, meaning that the TIE advanced that they steal by the end of the comic is not actually Vader's."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
