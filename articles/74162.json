It was commanded by Colonel Jarvis Tala and Lieutenant Wes Gevar. They also had the astromech droid R2-F7 on the base, who was the pilot of their skiff while the base was under construction. A group of Rebels delivered supplies here from Greyman's Planet and were attacked by Imperial biker scouts while they were going through the canyons en route to Karinda Outpost. They managed to get past the Imperials and delivered their cargo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
