However, while Ebra was under the repressive rule of Imperial governor Evitch Jenton, this trade was cut off in favor of Imperial-allied corporations and species. Much of the lu-ramin mined at this time came from mines in the Grythsorin canyon system, which was worked by political prisoners and exiles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
