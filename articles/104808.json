The station handled signal traffic for Phaeda and kept the planet connected to the rest of the galaxy. It was also equipped with Med Station with a quarantine area, and was protected by a mine field. The seizure of Phaedacomm cut off all communications of the planet Dantooine. The Jedi Enclave on Dantooine was later targeted by the Mandalorians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3962 BBY the station was taken over by Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders under the command of Dorjander Kace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
