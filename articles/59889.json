They were five meters long, had cutting jaws, three pairs of legs, flat heads, and were able to carry up to five times their body weight on their swept backs. Their heads had a pair of looped feelers which served as both feelers and pheromonal communicators."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They, along with manax trees, were an integral source of the fungus that gave the Neimoidians their riches. The Neimoidians tamed the beetles, which were separated into castes: laborers, harvesters, soldiers, and breeders. At the height of the harvester beetle hierarchy was a queen, who controlled what the other hive members ate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
