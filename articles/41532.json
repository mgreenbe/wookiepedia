Under orders from the Republic Military, Dar intercepted a group of Mandalorian mercenaries who had attacked a Republic communications center on the planet. The Mandalorians almost proved too much for Dar, but he was saved by the timely intervention of Acaadi, now a Sith agent, who used the encounter to persuade Dar to join him and possibly turn him to the dark side. Dar was convinced that the Jedi Order had been holding him back, preventing him from using his natural aggressive feelings. Unaware that it had been Acaadi who had ordered the Mandalorians to attack the communications center in preparation for a planned Sith attack on Iridonia, Dar decided to join Acaadi. The conversation between the two Zabrak was overheard via comlink by a group of Jedi and spacers under orders from the Republic, who had earlier defeated another group of Mandalorians that had ambushed them.

During their conversation, Dar attempted to justify joining the Sith by pointing out holes in the Jedi teachings.

If, however, Dar falls to the dark side, he will defend himself against the agents and retreat to the ship himself.
