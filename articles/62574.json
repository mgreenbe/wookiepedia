At the session, Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala of the planet Naboo made a plea for the Senate to help her end the invasion of her homeworld by the forces of the Trade Federation. Ryyder sat with another Anx in a repulsorpod that had been adjacent to Amidala's pod while the Trade Federation representative Lott Dod stalled Amidala's request with support from Senator Aks Moe.

Coppinger liked the concept sketch enough that he only made small alterations necessary to translate the design from 2D to 3D when sculpting, adding some details and changing proportions. The maquette was ultimately used in the creation of both Ryyder and another Anx, who was named Graxol Kelvyyn in the Star Wars Legends continuity."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Costume design and name"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The basic rig for both Anx characters consisted of the performer standing on twenty-four inch stilts with the head standing thirty-six inches above that of the performer, making the character almost eleven feet tall in total.
