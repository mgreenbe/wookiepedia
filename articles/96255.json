The freighter managed to hide for a time from the pursuing vessels within the Hoth asteroid field, but upon exiting the field, it encountered the Avenger, which had been patrolling the edge of the field. Failing to jump to hyperspace due to issues with the Falcon's hyperdrive, the freighter's captain, Han Solo, flew his ship directly at the Avenger while Nemet moved over to one of the crew pit consoles on the bridge of the Avenger. He was leaning over the shoulder of the bridge crew member at the console when the Falcon flew in close past the viewport of the bridge, causing the commander to quickly glance up out of the pit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo then landed the Falcon on the Avenger's command tower, causing the freighter to disappear from the Star Destroyer's scanners. Needa immediately ordered that the freighter be tracked, but after checking his screen, Nemet reported the loss of the vehicle. He confirmed it after checking his screen again when Needa questioned if a vessel like the Falcon was large enough to have a cloaking device. Communications officer M'Kae then informed Needa that Vader wanted an update on the pursuit of the Falcon, and the captain left to apologize to Vader, who executed him for his failure.
