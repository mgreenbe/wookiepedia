During the war, he worked as a merchant on the planet Nal Hutta, the adopted homeworld of Hutt species. On Hutta he owned a small stall in the market area of Jiguuna, an industrial town controlled by a Hutt crime lord named Suudaa Nem'ro. The stall consisted of a large table with a cloth draped over it on which he placed sacks of the goods he sold, which included blue sparkle powder which he sold for 125 credits and Imperial targeting devices which he sold for 825 credits. As all merchants in Jiguuna were, Dorheek was expected to pay some of his profits from his stall to one of Nem'ro's lieutenants at the crime lord's palace. Whilst at the stall the Kubaz wore a pair of goggles with red lenses to protect his eyes as well as blue shirt and pants. Dorheek had grey skin and purple hair."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dorheek first appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011.
