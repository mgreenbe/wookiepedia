It was part of the Hormick Range and was located near the Lycinder Plain and straddled the planet's equator. In 44 BBY Mount Avos was the site of the final battle of the Stark Hyperspace War, where a Galactic Republic army under the command of Jedi Master Plo Koon secured the conflict's final victory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was also the rendezvous point where Finis Valorum, Plo Koon, Adi Gallia, Qui-Gon Jinn, and Obi-Wan Kenobi were supposed to meet Ranulph Tarkin and the rest of the survivors of the attack by Iaco Stark. Soon afterward they were met by Tholme and Quinlan Vos. While moving further and further into the caverns of the mountain, Obi-Wan and Quinlan roused the challat eaters, insects native to the mountain, from their slumber. In an attempt to find an alternate way out of the mountain, the group of Jedi made their way to a nearby shipyard in search of a ship to get off the planet and deliver Senator Valorum back to Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
