The three ate in relative silence, which was broken by Dav asking for a food dish to be passed to him. The Imperial-loyalist Webb refused to oblige, insulting Dav about his rebel affiliation. The brothers argued, and the ensuing brawl was broken up by their father throwing a salad bowl at the wall. Glen ordered them to sit and explained that, in the end, the side they should pick is family because governments would come and go."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Glen was soon interrupted by the sound of TIE fighters arriving over the Taffral home.

Upon receiving confirmation, he told his son to sneak out the back window and use the speeder bike stored in the homestead's barn to escape. Dav asked what his father would do, and Glen replied that he would tell the Imperials that Dav had shot him.

Dav kept his composure longer than his brother when tensions between their conflicting loyalties ensued, although he was willing to brawl with his brother after several heated exchanges. While his father, Glen, believed that the New Republic could become corrupt just like the Republic of old, Dav believed that would not happen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dav Taffral appeared in Aftermath, a 2015 novel written by Chuck Wendig as the first installment in Star Wars: The Aftermath Trilogy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
