At the time of the Clone Wars, he stood 1.83 meters tall. He wore his black hair cropped short. In 21 BBY, he and a squad of troopers under the command of Captain Lock were assigned to investigate the remains of a battle in the Kaliida Nebula. Breaker found a computer from the crashed cruiser Malevolence, which revealed it had been constructed by KynachTech Industries. His interest in technology prompted Lock to grant him the nickname \"Breaker.\" The squad was then assigned to investigate Kynachi with Jedi Master Ring-Sol Ambase. Their ship was ambushed by Vulture droid starfighters and destroyed. Along with Ambase's stowaway Padawan, Nuru Kungurama, Breaker and the survivors took an escape pod to the surface. They eventually liberated the world from the Techno Union and earned the moniker of Breakout Squad.

The sniper, a Mandalorian managed to reach his transport and engaged the Hasty Harpy, causing both ships to crash and leading to the apparent death of the sniper.
