Sometime after her death, Amidala's wardrobe was inherited by her daughter, Leia Organa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Padm\u00e9 Amidala was a Naboo human female who served as Queen and later Senator of her homeworld, the planet Naboo. She maintained a large wardrobe of elegant, ornate, and occasionally elaborate disguises, dresses, and robes throughout her life with the assistance of her handmaidens. Many items in her wardrobe were decorated with the Symbol of the Royal House of Naboo, also known as the Queen's crest. Her wardrobe was adjusted again during her pregnancy. After her death, her body was dressed in a funeral gown that evoked the water she had loved in life."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Royal attire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Queen Amidala wore traditional, stylized royal makeup that included a scar of remembrance, a red stripe painted on the lower lip to symbolize the suffering endured by the Naboo before the Great Time of Peace. Her face and fingernails were painted white, though at times only her thumbnails were painted. The Queen's hairstyles were said to take several hours to perfect, and her handmaiden Rab\u00e9 would use that time to provide counsel. However, the Queen wore headpieces with wigs that matched Padm\u00e9's natural hair color. Her real hair was tightly-braided, pinned down, and gelled; the gel held the headpieces in place and prevented them from itching. Queen Amidala's makeup helped to mask her features and her headpieces distracted from her face; these made it easier for Sab\u00e9, the Queen's decoy, to serve as the Queen while Padm\u00e9 stepped into the role of a handmaiden."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two of Amidala's handmaidens, Eirta\u00e9 and Yan\u00e9, had significant roles in establishing the Queen's wardrobe after her election. Yan\u00e9 was a talented weaver and Eirta\u00e9 was an engineer. Working together, they designed new garments and headpieces and replicated historic items to make them lighter in weight than they seemed to be while still having an elaborate appearance. They incorporated additional considerations for safety and security, such as fabrics treated with blaster-resistant resin and jewelry containing concealed recording devices or personal shields. The heaviest dresses served as a physical barrier surrounding the Queen, but were also designed to be quickly removed when free movement and speed were needed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Disguises"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Action attire"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Senatorial attire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Padm\u00e9 Amidala's wardrobe as the Queen no longer suited her role when she became the Senator.

It was a necessity as the Queen and as the Senator representing Naboo. Depending on the occasion, she wore formal clothing selected from her wardrobe for official diplomatic functions or utilized specialist equipment for physically-demanding situations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Padm\u00e9 and Sab\u00e9, her handmaiden and decoy, worked together to develop the persona of \"the Queen\" to ensure that either girl could portray the role of Queen Amidala without giving away who was behind the voice, mannerisms, makeup, and wardrobe. The \"decoy maneuver\" was utilized when Padm\u00e9 was incapacitated or endangered. Whoever wore the Queen's makeup would be addressed by the other handmaidens as \"Your Highness.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The creation of Padm\u00e9 Amidala's wardrobe began with her election. Initially, the wardrobe system attached to her palace dressing room was stocked with traditional and antique pieces. When she was joined by her handmaidens Eirta\u00e9 and Yan\u00e9, they maintained and added to her wardrobe while additionally developing a corresponding wardrobe for the handmaidens. Yan\u00e9 also blended the cosmetics that were used while at the palace. As Amidala's intelligence officer, Rab\u00e9's public duty was wardrobe mistress, providing a reason for her to be near the queen and have access to her personal possessions. She directed the other handmaidens when selecting the queen's attire and packing for her travels. Though Sach\u00e9 did not have a specific duty related to the wardrobe, she practiced styling the others' hair to assist with dressing quickly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The handmaidens wore identical outfits that complemented the Queen's or helped them fade into the background by matching their surroundings. They used hoods and similar makeup applications to resemble each other as much as possible and further obscure their individual identities. Hoods became a fashion trend on Naboo during Amidala's reign."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A generic brand of makeup and a portion of Amidala's wardrobe were kept on the Naboo Royal Starship for the Queen's use while away from Naboo; Padm\u00e9 and Sab\u00e9 both observed the face paint felt different, and it made Sab\u00e9's face itch. After the ship and its passengers escaped the planet's invasion by the Trade Federation, they were forced to land on Tatooine for repairs. The price of the necessary parts and the need to raise funds in the local currency led Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi to comment on the Queen's wardrobe as an item of value."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Amidala completed her two terms, four of her royal handmaidens retired from her service; only Sab\u00e9 remained. When she became a senator with new handmaidens, Dorm\u00e9 stepped in as her new wardrobe mistress and Cord\u00e9 became her decoy. Sab\u00e9 had privately observed that Padm\u00e9 Amidala was a different persona from that of Padm\u00e9 Naberrie; Padm\u00e9 herself found that the persona used for the Queen was not suitable when she became Senator Amidala, necessitating adjustments to the Senator's wardrobe, voice, and behavior."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Heirloom"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Padm\u00e9 Amidala's death at the end of the Clone Wars, her wardrobe was kept preserved on Naboo. The traditional jubilation dress had been returned to royal service for other queens such as Daln\u00e9 to wear. Queen Daln\u00e9 kept it at her home on one of Naboo's moons, Onoam. Amidala's daughter, Leia Organa, had been adopted and raised on Alderaan by Bail and Breha Organa. On a visit to Onoam, Leia needed something clean and formal to wear, and Daln\u00e9 loaned her the jubilation dress. Neither of them knew that it had once been worn by Leia's birth mother, but Moff Quarsh Panaka was struck by the resemblance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Leia had not known her birth mother or her identity during her lifetime, Padm\u00e9 Amidala's wardrobe eventually found its way to her and helped her learn more about who Amidala had been."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Hunt for Lor San Tekka"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By around 32 to 34 ABY, General Leia Organa, leader of the Resistance, sought to locate the scholar Lor San Tekka. The Resistance was in a cold war against the First Order, and the scholar may have known the whereabouts of her missing brother, Luke Skywalker. After discovering San Tekka had been captured by House Maccon on Cato Neimoidia, Organa and her bodyguard, Suralinda Javos, traveled to the planet aboard the general's personal ship in search of the prisoner for extraction. Padm\u00e9 Amidala's wardrobe was brought to the Neimoidian purse world, as Leia Organa plotted to implant the containers holding her mother's wardrobe into the palace of Baron Paw Maccon, where Lor San Tekka was being held prisoner."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The wardrobe was stored in three separate repulsorlift container racks that were key to the extraction plan. Within the racks were thin metal boxes inlaid with a magenta-colored material, and each box held an individual set of clothing behind a metal grate; the leading box of each rack was hermetically sealed by an additional plate. The box containing Padm\u00e9 Amidala's lakeside gown led one of these container racks, while the other two were led by boxes modified with a breath mask device that allowed for humans to be stored alive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By hiding Poe Dameron within one of the modified wardrobe boxes, he could emerge to locate San Tekka, free him from imprisonment, and place him safely inside the other box. To give him that opportunity, the Resistance would stage an incident as a distraction, creating a pretense for Organa to seemingly believe the palace had proven too insecure to safeguard her mother's wardrobe. She would remove the wardrobe to her vessel, thereby extracting San Tekka. The plan for the mission did not succeed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "First Order forces arrived, seeking Luke Skywalker's whereabouts to prevent the Jedi Master from joining forces with their enemy, the Resistance. A brief exchange of fire ensued between Baron Maccon's clientele and First Order forces, during which Lor San Tekka initially escaped amidst the confusion by hiding inside a wardrobe box that was relocated from Maccon's vault to Organa's ship, just as the Resistance had planned. However, the First Order Security Bureau's Agent Terex abducted San Tekka by commandeering Organa's ship afterward."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Terex ignored San Tekka's words about the wardrobe having belonged to Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Cautious of Resistance tracking beacons or other sabotage and wanting to hurt Organa, Terex jettisoned Amidala's wardrobe from an airlock as the stolen craft traversed through hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The finished costumes seen in the prequel trilogy films were realized by costume designer Trisha Biggar and her department.
