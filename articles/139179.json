The object or person would radiate the dark side to any Force-sensitives. If the being was neither of the dark side, or light side, and they came into contact with the object then it would cause them to suffer a stun effect. Because of the nature of this power, it would cause beings to be seduced by the dark side."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
