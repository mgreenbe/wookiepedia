Pizztov meant to shoot Fett with a blaster, but being greedy and hasty, did not learn how to shoot well and thus lost to Fett, who returned fire, killing the villain with a single shot to the chest. While he was clever and not without his better ideas, he was shown to not be very bright, in fitting the canister with a death seal which could only be deactivated with Pizztov's eye pattern. Fett opened the canister, revealing the images and taking Pizztov's corpse to auction off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He also possessed a girlfriend, although he was shown to be very abusive to her.
