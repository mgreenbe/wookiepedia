He warned her not to trust her companion, Atton Rand, claiming that they had crossed paths before during the Jedi Civil War years earlier. He told her that Rand had come to Nar Shaddaa claiming to be a refugee of the war, and informed Surik that Rand was a murderer, as opposed to a soldier. Surik was skeptical, but the Twi'lek stated that she could believe him or not. He had warned her about Rand and left the rest up to her. Surik would later use that information to confront Rand, who admitted to murdering Jedi for the Sith during the Jedi Civil War.
