The first of these was Objective: Retrieval, a stand-alone scenario. The other four scenarios were included as a campaign called A Time for Silence, in which rebel forces attempted to destroy an Imperial communications base. The first three scenarios (Pulling the Plug, To Seize the Bay, and Through the Backdoor) were independent of one another, but their outcomes directly impacted the final scenario, King of the Mountain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
