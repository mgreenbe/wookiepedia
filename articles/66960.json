Despite being a relatively rare sight in the Imperial Navy, it was considered a dangerous design by rebel groups that relied on hit-and-run tactics. It was used against the rebellion around 4 BBY, and several featured as part of the Seventh Fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Interdictor-class Star Destroyer possessed four spherical gravity well projectors, which contained equipment to pull a number of ships out of hyperspace. Superficially it vaguely resembled an Imperial-class Star Destroyer. It was 1,129 meters in length and could achieve a speed of 975 kilometers per hour. It was equipped with a class 2 hyperdrive as well as a deflector shield generator. The Interdictor-class was armed with twenty quad laser cannons, and outfitted with escape pods. It could maintain a complement of twenty-four TIE line starfighters deployed from one ventral hangar bay opening. Interdictor-class Star Destroyers were crewed by 2,800 personnel, including Imperial officers, Imperial weapons technicians, and stormtroopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Interdictor-class Star Destroyer served in the capacity of an interdictor vessel and command ship. In this role, it was deployed to blockade worlds, investigate suspicious hyperspace routes, and prevent the escape of enemy ships. Interdictor-class vessels typically formed part of small battle groups, supporting heavier lines of capital ships in conjunction with frigates and starfighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A prototype Interdictor-class was tested in the Del Zennis system in 4 BBY,[source?] under the command of Admiral Brom Titus. After pulling the rebel ship Liberator out of hyperspace, the crew was imprisoned. However, they escaped and sabotaged the ship, destroying it in the process of their escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two were later used by Grand Admiral Thrawn's Seventh Fleet during its assault on Atollon. However, the Star Destroyer under the command of Admiral Kassius Konstantine was drawn out of position by an approaching rebel Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier. The carrier deliberately collided with the Interdictor, destroying both ships, to allow Ezra Bridger's Gauntlet to escape and seek reinforcements. The other Star Destroyer was later destroyed by a Mandalorian strike team from Clan Wren, brought by Bridger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, an Interdictor-class Star Destroyer fought alongside other Imperial forces against an MC75 Star Cruiser, at least two EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigates, and other Rebel Alliance forces. One vessel, called the Interdictor, created an interdiction field around a planet with two other Interdictor-class Star Destroyers that prevented a CR90 corvette from entering hyperspace. At the time of the Battle of Jakku, one of the last Interdictor-class Star Destroyers, the Spectral, guarded the shipyards of Fondor, before the fall of the planet to the New Republic. The ship left for Jakku, but was brought down by the efforts of Bak Rychuk and his droid Zeetoo-Zeetoo, and crashed on the surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Interdictor-class Star Destroyer first appeared in \"Stealth Strike,\" an episode of the second season of Star Wars Rebels.
