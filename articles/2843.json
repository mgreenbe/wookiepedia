Wicket wishes that Chirpa will give him a chance. Chirpa tells the older Ewok youths that a true warrior must teach what they know to others. Overhearing the conversation, Wicket believes that if he can teach another Ewok to be warrior in order to move up the Ewok hierarchy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Latara laughs at his idea, he asks her to bet on that. Before they can bet, Wiley and Nippet play a prank on Latara by swinging down on a rope, causing her to fall into a muddy bond. Latara is annoyed with her younger siblings.

Wicket swims towards him and tells him to grab onto a rock."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teebo swims to the rock only to discover that it is a giant water creature called a Blog.

However, the Blog breaks the vine, causing them to land on the bush. They startle some small creatures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teebo notices that the dam has dried up this section of the river.

Teebo pleads for help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Elsewhere, Wicket gets Latara and Kneesaa to shoot him across on the catapult. He rescues Teebo from the Blog\u2019s blowhole.
