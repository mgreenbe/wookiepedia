Etaan possessed a unique property, in that they echoed sound with a humming resonance, a quality that assisted searchers. Once harvested, their resonant properties remained, and when incorporated into a lightsaber hilt, the blade emitted thrummed in harmony with the motion of the blade. Responding well when clashing against another blade, the weapon gave off a near-deafening crack and flared with energy. While a lightsaber powered by an etaan would cause others to bounce off its blade, blaster bolts absorbed some of the energy from the resonant blade and were increasingly dangerous if redirected at a target."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
