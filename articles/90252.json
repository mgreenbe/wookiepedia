Thirk gathered information about Cloud City's new Baron Administrator, Lando Calrissian, for Alliance Intelligence officer Eddriss Sark by engaging Calrissian in small talk during several friendly games of sabacc, during which Calrissian won 5,700 credits, which Thirk attempted to get reimbursed as an expense. Thirk concluded that, though Calrissian had no love for the Galactic Empire, he was unlikely to give up the security and luxury of his position to actually join the Rebellion; however, Thirk also noted that Calrissian was honorable (though not totally honest), and thus could probably be dealt with."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
