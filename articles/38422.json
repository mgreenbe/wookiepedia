The cult led by Dark Jedi Tavion Axmis tried to resurrect the ancient Sith Lord Marka Ragnos, believing that he would give them unlimited power and bring the galaxy under their control. Eventually, their plans were thwarted, mostly due to the actions of Jedi Knight Jaden Korr, and they were defeated in a battle on Korriban."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The crisis was born of the Empire Reborn, an Imperial Remnant splinter movement led by Lord Hethrir, a former Procurator of Justice who dedicated his life to make his vision of the Galactic Empire a reality and rule it with cadres of fanatically loyal followers. To achieve his long-dreamt goal, he tasked Desann, a fallen Jedi and second-in-command of the Empire Reborn project, with creating a Dark Army. Recruiting Force-sensitive members from the Empire Youth and other minions of Lord Hethrir, the Chistori Dark Jedi established the Reborn - an organization of warriors artificially imbued or enhanced with the Force. However, Kyle Katarn managed to kill Desann at the Battle of Yavin IV and the newly-created army of the Empire Reborn were decimated by the combined forces of the New Republic and New Jedi Order in 12 ABY. Lord Hethrir met his end two years later, consumed by a trans-dimensional being called Waru. The death of the key members of the Empire Reborn dealt a devastating loss to the movement. Those Reborn who survived rallied under Tavion Axmis, Desann's apprentice, whose life Katarn had spared on Bespin. Tavion, with the support of the Imperial Remnant established a Sith cult called the Disciples of Ragnos, and henceforth the Reborn serving Tavion were now known as the New Reborn. Before that Tavion had took sadistic Twi'lek Alora as her apprentice and found an ancient Sith artifact on Commenor, known as the Scepter of Ragnos, which could siphon Force energies from locations that possessed some residue of Force power, known as Force nexuses. The scepter was instrumental in empowering many individuals wth Force energy, the so-called Sith Cultists, which made the majority of the Disciples of Ragnos. The final goal of the cult was to resurrect one of the most respectable Dark Lords of the Sith all the time, Marka Ragnos, thus issuing a new era of Sith rule."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Cult emergence"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tavion, having the powerful cult with strict rules and clear hierarchy under her command, established trade contacts with influential mercenaries, smugglers, bounty hunters and bosses of the Invisible Market, including Lannik Racto, a dangerous crime lord from Coruscant. The cult leader hoped that her connections in the underworld would further destabilize the New Republic government who was allied to the New Jedi Order founded by Luke Skywalker. After accumulating enough manpower and wealth she started dispatching her cultists to various regions of the galaxy ordering them to find places that possessed some residue of Force power, especially the planets being tainted by the dark side of the Force. Alora and Kothos twins, extremely skilled in using the Force powers members of the cult, were trusted by their leader with responsibility over these missions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finally, Tavion and her disciples made a daring move, carrying out a surprising infiltration of Yavin 4, during which they drained Force power from one of the Massassi Temples and stole valuable data from Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum. This attack brought the cult's existence to light and due to bravery of Jaden Korr, the new student famous for construction of his lightsaber even before attending the Jedi Academy, the Jedi Order was informed about the growing threat to the galaxy. Luke Skywalker quickly formed many Jedi task forces consisting of experienced masters/knights, including Kyle Katarn and Corran Horn, and promising padawans. He sent them on many missions in order to prevent the Disciples of Ragnos from executing their schemes. The headmaster of the Academy also contacted the New Republic authorities, asking their officials and agents to help the Jedi to track down and halt the cultists. Jaden Korr and his newly-met friend Rosh Penin were assigned to Kyle Katarn and instructed to take part in this broad-based intelligence operation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The hunt for the Cult"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker knew that the Disciples of Ragnos would attempt to possess Force powers present on the worlds catalogued in his personal records. However, it was also crucial for the Jedi Order to find out who was backing the Disciples of Ragnos. As a result, long range reconnaissance was undertaken all over the whole known galaxy. The most important ones were carried out by Jaden Korr and his master, Kyle Katarn in the following places:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were also missions with other participants. Corran Horn made a journey to Wayland to investigate cult or Imperial Remnant presence on the planet. Streen and Tionne Solusar, a scholar of Jedi history, were also involved in the hunt for the cult with the second one providing invaluable knowledge about places strong in the Force. Before Korr's visit to Byss, another student of Kyle Katarn, Rosh Penin was sent to look around the remains of the planet, but was kidnapped by the cult and turned to the dark side of the Force, becoming the second apprentice of Tavion Axmis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Side missions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In-between the missions related to the Sith cult activity, the New Jedi Order had to perform their daily duties, especially by participation in resolving various conflicts and problems erupting in the galaxy. On Bakura, Korr on request of local authorities investigated a power station which was not answering any calls. It turned out that the station had been sabotaged by Imperial Remnant forces and selected it to be used to cause a great disaster in a nearby city. The Jedi Initiate managed to prevent this tragedy on his own even before his master showed up. During the mission to Blenjeel, Korr was tasked to rescue crewmembers of crashed merchant vessel, unfortunately all of them had been killed by local dangerous wild beasts, sand burrowers with the last survivor eaten in front of Korr. Due to Jaden's reports, the New Republic classified Blenjeel as a dangerous world in its database. The talented Jedi, assisted by his master, who was looking for Penin at this time, also rescued Mining Guild elders on Nar Kreeta, preventing their death at the hands of a rancor at a gambling arena owned by a local Hutt crime lord."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
