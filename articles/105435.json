Kolovish preached to her small group of followers about a simple life, espousing the tenets of an ancient code she had uncovered on a distant world. Gathering a larger following as she moved from refugee camps across the region, Kolovish and her wandering band of pilgrims fled into hyperspace after constantly being rebuffed by other host planets until they came upon the recently reoccupied planet Tython."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Landing on the lush forested world, the pilgrims came into contact with the Jedi Order, which had just recently resettled the planet in secret. Building the Matriarch's home over the area of the first craft's landing, the pilgrims petitioned the Galactic Senate to legalize the settlement but were denied. Ignoring the illegality of their settlement, the Twi'leks continued to strive to build permanent structures despite assaults by the local Flesh Raiders and the refusal of the neighboring Jedi to assist."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
