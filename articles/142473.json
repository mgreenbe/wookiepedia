They created the city of Vaale on the planet Dianth out of material that texts called \"living stone,\" as well as several \"wonders\" that included the artifact known as the Rings of Vaale.  The rings became a target for several individuals during the Imperial Era, including the rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Aphra and Tagge family scion Ronen Tagge. The group had a workshop where they created the artifacts that would later be discovered by Aphra's crew, who ventured into an underground area that featured colorful iconography that Aphra believed dated back to the Old Republic and Doctor Eustacia Okka interpreted as warnings about the power of the rings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
