It also contained the Wookiee colony moon of Alaris Prime, orbiting the gas giant Alaris, as well as the Trandoshan moon of Wasskah, where Trandoshans hunted various species captured around the galaxy for sport. The Trandoshans knew it as the Hsskassi system, but the wider galaxy would call it the Kashyyyk system when the Wookiees became its first, and sole, representatives in the Republic Senate. The system was relatively isolated as it was far from the central trade routes, although it was located close to a major route for the southwestern quadrant, and was home to an important Republic navigation and communication relay station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the beginning of the Jedi Civil War, Kashyyyk was controlled by Czerka Corporation, who had struck a deal with the corrupt Wookiee chieftain Chuundar and enslaved the Wookiee population to run an illegal slave-trade operation out of the planet. The amnesiac Revan, aided by his Wookiee life-debtor and brother of Chuundar, Zaalbar, overthrew Chuundar and incited the planet-wide Rebellion on Kashyyyk, forcing Czerka to abandon their slave-trade operation and leave the system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wookiees and Trandoshans of the system were locked in a bitter rivalry for centuries. During the waning days of the Republic, this became a pressure point when debate arose over which planet's representative would be chosen as the system's Senator in the Galactic Senate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
