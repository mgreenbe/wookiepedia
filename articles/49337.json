In this capacity, he\u2014under the directions of Disra and fellow triumvirate member Grodin Tierce\u2014successfully convinced several officials within the Imperial Starfleet to follow his authority in a plan to cause a civil war within the New Republic. While Flim pretended to be the Grand Admiral, Tierce was the military man who came up with the battle plans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The plan called for the exploitation of the Caamas Document Crisis in which Imperial agents spread rumors that the Bothans were guilty of the massacre on Caamas many decades prior. Though some Bothans were to blame for the Caamas incident, the rumors spread made certain that all facts were exaggerated, which prompted a military stand-down between factions within the New Republic in orbit over Bothawui."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Flim spent hours studying Thrawn's history to learn all he could to keep the scheme intact. Even Captain Dorja of the Star Destroyer Relentless, an officer who had served under Thrawn's command, was convinced it was really Thrawn. Shortly after allying himself with Disra and Tierce, Flim revealed himself to Lando Calrissian and Diamal Senator Porolo Miatamia. After this was revealed to the Senate, turmoil ensued. Many did not believe the reports, although some, such as Han Solo and his wife, High Councilor Leia Organa Solo believed it all too well. Few Imperials were told that Thrawn had \"returned\". When Gilad Pellaeon heard of these rumors, he was unsure if they were true, as he had been present when Rukh had killed his mentor a decade before. Believing that Thrawn was indeed back several star systems began to join the Imperial Remnant, the first of which was the Unified Factions. Disra's plot was working, and he believed that soon the New Republic would collapse and the Empire would rise. Eventually though, the plan unraveled."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Supreme Commander Gilad Pellaeon, on a visit to Bastion to accuse Moff Disra of treason along with other crimes against the Empire, discovered a set of datacards in the Moff's desk when left alone in his office. He decrypted these and later met with Talon Karrde, who gave him a datacard that he had been given by Jorj Car'das. Along with the ones he took from Disra, they revealed the truth about Flim and Tierce. On Karrde's ship, the Wild Karrde, he traveled to confront Flim, Disra and Tierce at Yaga Minor, where they were battling the Errant Venture. Pellaeon revealed that Flim was an impostor, that Tierce was a clone, and that Disra was indeed guilty of many crimes, including plotting to overthow the Supreme Commander and funneling of money to suit his own purposes. Tierce was killed, and Flim surrendered both himself and his \"command\" without a fight\u2014indeed, he expressed relief that the affair was over."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Flim was not a Chiss like Thrawn, but a Human or very similar Near-Human who disguised himself using blue makeup, hair dye, and glowing red contact lenses. He demonstrated to Major Tierce and Moff Disra his ability to quickly remove these lenses during a meeting on Yaga Minor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
