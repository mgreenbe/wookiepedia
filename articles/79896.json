Dis tracked the Hutt to the Pluthan asteroid field, and successfully captured her. However, it was believed that Krova allowed herself to be captured, in order to \"clear her name\". Dis delivered her to Hundria Kast, though Krova apparently made a deal that would ensure her freedom. Unfortunately, a group of Dark Jedi led by Noth attacked the Hutt, seeking a Sith holocron Krova had previously swallowed for safe-keeping. Langro was caught up in the fighting, and barely escaped with his life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Langro Dis piloted a modified YT-1300 light freighter named Glorious Spectrum."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
