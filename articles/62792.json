During the Great Galactic War, the Sith conquered the planet of Serenno in an attempt to strike back against the Galactic Republic forces under the command of Jedi Master Ven Zallow. House Palerma, another house of Serenno, had allied itself with the Jedi, with Zallow using their villa as his headquarters. The Sith, under the command of Darth Malgus, succeeded in their attack, and took control of the world. House Comprassi, however, did not sit idly by, and along with House Teramo hired mercenaries to strike back against the Sith. The attack was a failure, as Sith assassins cut down the attackers in the dark, killing them all."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
