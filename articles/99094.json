Later, during the Clone Wars, security battle droids were used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, seeing use at locations like starships and the Citadel prison. Later at the end of the war, Darth Vader traveled to the planet Mustafar with orders to kill the Separatist Council, resulting in the destruction of the OOM-series security droids stationed there, and the subsequent deactivation of the Droid Army by order of Darth Sidious."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Manufactured by Baktoid Combat Automata, OOM-series security droids were a type of security droid and part of the OOM mark of the B1-series. Accordingly, the OOM security droid was also known as the B1 security droid. Their role as security droids was shown by their red coloring. The droids could be equipped with an E-5 blaster rifle and, although not all units wore one, a comlink booster pack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droids were equipped with sensor subroutines and combat programming. Although some were deployed as E-5s sniper rifle-wielding marksmen, security battle droids, as their name implied, frequently saw use in security related roles, acting as sentries and guards for locations, individuals, or valuable items. Security droids could also be deployed for crowd control. Though it commonly strained a security droid's logic module, forcing them to go through regular memory wipes to avoid quickly succumbing to paranoia, the droid model was programmed to scan over their surrounding environment for anything abnormal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Invasion of Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point during the history of the security droid, a unit was taken out by friendly fire as two other battle droids fired at their targets. During the Invasion of Naboo, a group of security battle droids, which included a security droid with the rank of corporal, under the command of an OOM command battle droid were ordered by the Viceroy of the Trade Federation, Nute Gunray, to eliminate two Jedi ambassadors aboard the Saak'ak. The Jedi, Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi, had been sent by the Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum to negotiate the Trade Federation bloackade of Naboo. The security droids were ultimately destroyed by the pair of Jedi. Another group was sent by Gunray to take Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Captain Panaka and others to Camp Four only to be ambushed by the same Jedi duo and cut to pieces. The other security battle droids on Naboo were likely shut down after the destruction of the Droid Control Ship."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, these droids were used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems in its Droid Army. On the battlefield security droids could be deployed among regular infantry and be used as on-the-spot guards for recently captured territory, although they did not function as well in direct combat as the regular infantry cousins. They were also still used as security forces and guards. Many security battle droids were stationed on the Citadel prison on Lola Sayu. At least one security battle droid was under the command of General Grievous prior to the Battle of Dathomir. The droid reported that the Separatist starships were approaching Dathomir, and after this Grievous gave the order to begin landing their troops. Many security battle droids also participated in the Carida incident, which saw the transformation of a Venator-class Star Destroyer into an explosive weapon, which was foiled by D-Squad. BD-15959 was a security battle droid that participated in the mission to Utapau."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the last year of the Clone Wars, when General Grievous attacked the Galactic Republic's headquarters on Coruscant and captured Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, the legendary Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and his apprentice Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker were sent to rescue him from the Confederacy. A large group of security battle droids in the hangar attacked the Jedi aboard Grievous's flagship, the Invisible Hand, but were all destroyed. When the Jedi duo retreated from a pair of droidekas into a lift, they realized that several security battle droids were on the same lift and proceeded to eliminate the droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short time later, a number of security battle droids saw service on the front lines of the Battle of Kashyyyk, riding into battle on the sides of NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcers. The Confederate army was countered by the 41st Scout Battalion and the native Wookiees. Elsewhere in the galaxy, security droids escorted the Separatist Council to the volcanic planet of Mustafar, but the entire guard force was cut down, along with the Separatist aides and leaders, when Darth Vader arrived. Following the slaughter of the Separatist leaders, Vader sent out an order to shut down the droid units across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "OOM-series security droids first appeared in the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.
