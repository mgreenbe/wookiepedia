However, Mantooine was immediately attacked in retaliation by an Imperial strike fleet from the Fest system.

Ultimately, this event led the two planets found common cause in their conflict with the Empire, and the combination of the Mantooine Liberators with the Fest Resistance Group formed the Atrivis Resistance Group.
