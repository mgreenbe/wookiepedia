Their social doctrines being based on anarchy, the Aa'kuans did not believe in the concept of government. They believed in personal freedom, but were mostly pacifist unless sufficiently provoked. However, simply being an unwelcome visitor in their territory was considered sufficient provocation to them, so they were especially dangerous to the uninformed.

By the time of the Battle of Yavin, a schism took place and the Aa'kuans on Talus split into two factions: the True Aa'kuan Order and the Aa'kuans living in the Aa'kuan Champion's Cave. The former followed traditional Aa'kuan beliefs while the latter started a bloody crusade against all those who refused to believe their doctrine. Circa 1 ABY, a True Aa'kuan requested a spacer to kill all the bloodthirsty members of the other Aa'kuan community in order to \"bring back the balance to all things\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Aa'kuans are one of the many factions players may gain or lose points with in Star Wars Galaxies.In Olys Corellisi, Aa'kua meant \"respect, respecting personal space\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
