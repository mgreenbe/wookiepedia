A supporter of the Rebel Alliance, who by 5 ABY had become known as the New Republic, the woman owned a store in the Sulon city of Barons Hed, which was under the control of an Imperial faction led by the Dark Jedi Jerec. One day, two aggressive Gran bounty hunters, under the employ of Jerec, visited her shop, seeking information. The woman did not have the information they seeking, yet the Gran did not prepare to leave upon her request for them to do so. Moments later, the Jedi trainee Kyle Katarn made his way into the merchant's shop and killed the Gran when they turned to attack him. Katarn took what he could from the grateful woman's shop, free of charge, and left."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Human female worked as a merchant in the city of Barons Hed, located on the moon Sulon. She was a staunch supporter of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, also known as the Rebel Alliance, and kept a secret room of her store stocked with various kinds of blasters, various types of ammunition, and personal energy shields. By the year 5 ABY, the Rebel Alliance had defeated the reigning Galactic Empire, and had been renamed the New Republic, although the woman continued to refer to the new government as the Rebellion. However, Barons Hed was still controlled by an Imperial faction led by the Dark Jedi warlord Jerec, whose Government House was located in the center of the city."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During 5 ABY, Barons Hed became overrun with mercenaries and bounty hunters, and many shops were abandoned as the city became a haven for crime. The woman's store remained in service, however. Many of the bounty hunters were under Jerec's employ, and protected the area surrounding the Government House from being invaded. The bounty hunters were ruthless, and often harassed and outright attacked the city's population. One day, two aggressive Gran bounty hunters entered the woman's store, and began to question her. The woman, however, claimed to not have the information that the Gran were seeking. She asked them to let her be, but they did not immediately comply."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that moment, the Jedi trainee Kyle Katarn entered the shop while looking for a way into the Government House. The Gran turned to attack Katarn, but the Jedi used his lightsaber to kill the Gran duo, keeping the woman out of harm's way. Katarn helped himself to some of the woman's wares, free of charge, and then used his lightsaber to cut into her secret room. Katarn took all that he could carry and went back into the store. The woman verbally stated her support of the New Republic, and Katarn left the store. He eventually made it to the Government House."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The woman was steadfast, and remained in her shop even after others had left due to Jerec's influence.

The woman was mentioned, and quoted, in the game's strategy guide, where author Rick Barba suggests that the player avoid killing the civilian, and that they kill the Gran with their lightsaber.
