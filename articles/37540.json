As he dogfighted multiple TIE Fighters, RS-32 was destroyed by TIE Bombers, then turned onto the Sceltor. Stele wasted no time in intercepting the Bombers, but things got more complicated when a Strike-class medium cruiser Serpent arrived and the Nebulon-B2 frigate Shadow were closing in on the Sceltor. Stele used his Mag Pulse warhead to hamper the Serpent and assisted the Sceltor in destroying the cruiser. Stele then turned his attention to the Grappler and launched another Mag Pulse warhead which struck the Interdictor. 3 TIE Bombers carrying Heavy rockets were launched from the Sceltor and fired at the Grappler destroying it. The remaining fighters turned onto the Shadow and with the help of Stele's Mag Pulse warhead disabling the frigate's weapon systems destroyed the frigate. Stele then docked in the hanger of the Sceltor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After this battle, Maarek Stele was awarded the Medal of Dignity for successfully holding off Zaarin's attacks against the Empire's TIE Avenger production facilities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, all plants in the Omar system were eventually destroyed.
