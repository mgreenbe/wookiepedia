Delckis' first assignment was as a junior communications assistant aboard the Victory-class Star Destroyer Stormwind, which was part of the small Imperial armada at Virgillia. Delckis was part of the landing party that attacked a small encampment on Virgillia's heavily-forested moon that was presumably a hideout for Alignment forces. Delckis was very upset when he saw the inhabitants of the camp, refugees, tortured and killed by Stormtroopers. This incident, as well as reports of the use of superweapons and Poison gas by the Galactic Empire, caused Delckis to defect to the Free Alignment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Tessa Manchisco was given command of the cruiser-carrier Flurry, she requested that Delckis be assigned to her ship.
