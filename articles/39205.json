She can appear on any of the following worlds: Ord Mantell, Coruscant, Nal Hutta, Dromund Kaas, Nar Shaddaa, Tatooine, Alderaan and Voss. The player has the option to ask her for information nicely, rudely or neutrally. In any case, she provides the location of a local crime lord's henchman. As such, her role in the game is almost entirely random or player-driven and a canonical path currently cannot be determined."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
