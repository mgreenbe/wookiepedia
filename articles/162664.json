Lufba left the moon on a visiting starship and ended up on the desert planet Tatooine where the Yuzzum found work in the palace of the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. Lufba worked as an exterminator in the palace, dealing with pests which could be quite dangerous, and was present when, during the Galactic Civil War, Princess Leia Organa visited Jabba disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh. While the exterminator watched, Organa threatened the Hutt and his court with a thermal detonator in order to claim more credits for the bounty on the Wookiee Chewbacca. Soon afterwards, Jabba was killed at the Great Pit of Carkoon. Lufba used a blaster rifle and had brown hair, yellow eyes and fair skin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Wam Lufba was created for Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, but not named in the film.
