They could also be used in starships, and the modified YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon was equipped with three: an R3-series astromech droid's brain, a V-5 transport droid brain and a slicer droid brain. The droid brains of the Falcon quarreled endlessly unless they were forced to work together, leaving the ship cantankerous. None of the brains could stand the protocol droid C-3PO, whilst one had a fondness for both romantic gossip and dirty jokes, which the astromech droid R2-D2 provided in large quantities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Droid brains could also be applied to armor; by doing so, the droid brain defense system had an increased defensive ability."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
