Despite being told otherwise, Bossk failed to kill his sister and her cracked egg was given to the Wookiee Liswarr'arindoo in exchange for a bottle of Kowakian rum. Cradossk eventually taught Bossk how to steal landspeeders. Like his father, Bossk became a bounty hunter and a renowned Wookiee hunter. At some point Cradossk expressed his disappointment with his son over his frequent failures in capturing the Wookiee Chewbacca and his companion Han Solo, stating that he had doubts whether Bossk really was the right candidate to have devoured the nest eggs of his siblings and emerge as its only candidate. In 5 BBY, during the Imperial Era, Bossk took a mission to the planet Lothal, where he hired the street urchin Ezra Bridger as a guide.
