The weapon was fitted with a targeting sight for accuracy at long range. The multi-spectrum scope was fitted with infrared enhancers for use at night, and could magnify the image while an inbuilt microcomputer enhanced the image to clear smoke or haze."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The blaster bolt fired by the Sharpshooter V was smaller and tighter than standard blasters. The bolt did not dissipate as quickly as other blasters over long distance, giving the Sharpshooter V an advantage during long range battles. However, the range increase came at a cost, which was the power of the bolt. The Sharpshooter V was marketed at 1,200 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the price tag, the Galactic Empire kept its spending on the Sharpshooter V at a modest level. As a result, they were not generally assigned to standard formations, but were reserved for special commando units. The Empire allowed BlasTech to produce a weaker version for the civilian market, called the Hunter V, which was cheaper and marketed as a sporting blaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
