After the raid on Theed, Captain Quarsh Panaka encharged six Palace Guards of the Royal Naboo Security Forces with liberating the camp. The Naboo forces assaulted the camp and took down the generator, while the captive citizens helped the guards by destroying the battle droids with their bare hands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Retired Palace Guard Pars Varqom later recalled that the sight of the camp was \"terrible,\" noting that battle droids were programmed to kill and thus had no idea of how to take care of people.
