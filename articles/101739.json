Following the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, the planet's Senator Sheev Palpatine was elected to the position of Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, leaving in his wake an empty senatorial seat. Though few politicians were willing to fill this vacancy, Oshadam eventually became Naboo's representative."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 28 BBY, Oshadam felt that her time of service had come to an end and decided to step down. At the same time, the Queen of the Naboo people, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, had reached the end of her term and was succeeded by the opera singer and former queen R\u00e9illata, who requested that Amidala take Oshadam's place. Following her admission to the Senate, Amidala recognized that Oshadam was a polite individual but one eager to resign, and speculated that her predecessor had grown weary of the Senate's tedious and indecisive proceedings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Oshadam was first mentioned in the 2019 novel Queen's Shadow, written by E.
