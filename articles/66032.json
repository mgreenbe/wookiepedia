They were already worn in 19 BBY by the graduates of the first Imperial class from the military academies. Such disks contained coded identification information and consisted of a metallic stepped cone shape appearing to be three disks stacked on top of one another. Code disks were featured on the hat and belt buckle of the most high-ranking Imperial officers. Their function was similar to that of the code cylinders, which were also part of the officers' service uniform."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Galactic Empire collapsed following the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, the code disks remained in use within the Imperial splinter factions, along with the rest of the Imperial uniform."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In an interview published in the ninety-eighth issue of the Star Wars Insider, costume designer John Mollo revealed the \"officers' disks\" came from a shop in Borehamwood, England, where the Elstree Studios are located.
