It is named after Jabba the Hutt, an antagonist from the studio's 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. During the production of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, Javva the Hutt employee Michael Smith supplied coffee to members of Industrial Light & Magic's visual effects team, and both he and the shop are credited in the final film as having \"fueled\" the crew. The shop is again credited in both of the subsequent films of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, though Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith incorrectly lists the store as \"Javva the Hut.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
