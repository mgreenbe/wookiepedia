At the end of the Clone Wars, Hutt Space was substantially reduced by the Galactic Empire, but the Kreetan Narrows remained under Hutt control. In the months following the Declaration of a New Order, the surrounding regions were the site of important Separatist activity. After their defeat at the battle of Trasemene, the Separatists retreated to the Kreetan Narrows, but were followed by the Imperial forces who annexed the region. The Kreetan Narrows were split and shared between five Imperial sectors: the Suolriep, Tharin, Calaron, Kessel and Bheriz sectors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
