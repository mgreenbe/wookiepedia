Known as a top X-wing pilot, Farrell flew a modified R-22 Spearhead during the Battle of Yavin.

However, as the Empire grew more ruthless, Farrell found himself sent on ever more destructive missions.

Farrell originally flew T-65 X-wing starfighters and was considered one of the Rebellion's top X-wing pilots. Despite this, Farrell preferred the extra speed and maneuverability of the R-22 Spearhead and spent much time upgrading the fighter to further improve its performance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 0 BBY, Farrell held the rank of commander and was using his experience to train rookie pilots. One of his trainees was \"Rookie One\", who was sent to Farrell after passing his piloting trials through Beggar's Canyon on Tatooine. Flying a pair of R-22 Spearheads, Farrell led Rookie One through the Tatoo system's asteroid field, instructing him to dodge the rock asteroids and shoot any ice ones in his path.

Having managed to acquire the plans to the superweapon, General Jan Dodonna devised a plan to destroy it\u2014a direct proton torpedo hit on a small thermal exhaust port would trigger a chain reaction in the battlestation's main reactor. Farrell took a pair of modified R-22 Spearheads to Yavin 4 and flew one of the fighters in the subsequent Battle of Yavin.

When the time came for the Rebel Alliance to attack the new battlestation, Farrell, as one of the best A-wing operators, was chosen to fly with Green Squadron with the call sign Green Four. In the initial stages of the battle, Green Squadron and other A-wing units used their jamming units to disrupt Imperial targeting computers. As the battle progressed, Green Squadron pilots scored many kills on Imperial fighters and Farrell joined Green Leader Arvel Crynyd to bring down the deflector shields protecting the bridge of the Super Star Destroyer Executor, leading to the destruction of the Imperial command ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Alliance battle plan, once the deflector shield around the Death Star was deactivated by Rebel operatives, the leader of the starfighter assault, Gold Leader Lando Calrissian, called for fighters to follow him into the battlestation's superstructure for a strike on the Death Star's main reactor. Farrell, among a group of others including Red Leader Wedge Antilles, Gray Leader Horton Salm, Green Three Tycho Celchu, and Red Seven Keir Santage, complied, diving into the workings of the partially-completed station.

Initially, two of the Imperial ships were destroyed when one collided with a wall. However, after Santage's X-wing was shot down, Calrissian ordered a number of the Alliance fighters to split up and head back to the surface, in order to draw off some of the Imperial pursuit. Farrell was the first to comply, followed by Celchu and Salm\u2014he and the others who broke off managed to draw off two Imperial fighters, reducing Calrissian's remaining pursuit by half. Farrell survived the battle and, due in part to his success in lessening the number of pursuers, Calrissian and Antilles were able to complete their mission of torpedoing the reactor, destroying the Death Star and winning the battle for the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Farrell was a serious officer with a no-nonsense attitude and little time for pilots who showed off during training.

Only those that demonstrated these skills would impress the commander and pass his training."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Farrell favored the speed and maneuverability of the R-22 Spearhead and modified his own fighter to improve its performance by upgrading its systems and removing any non-essential components. Farrells skills saw him brought into General Dodonna's team to work on the design of the RZ-1 A-wing interceptor. Already considered among the top X-wing pilots in the Rebel Alliance before the introduction of the A-wing, Farrell transferred to an A-wing unit when the new craft became available. By the time of the Battle of Endor, he was already considered to be one of the best A-wing pilots as well, and so was chosen to fly in Green Squadron alongside such notables as Arvel Crynyd and Tycho Celchu. When Calrissian asked for fighters to join him in his assault on the Death Star's reactor, Farrel was among the first to answer the call; when the general gave the order for a number of fighters to break off the assault on the Death Star's main reactor in order to draw off pursuit, he complied, allowing his fellow pilots to complete the mission, for which they received accolade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Jake Farrell was created for the 1993 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Rebel Assault and his backstory was expanded in the game's manual. In making Rebel Assault, the developers used characters and scenes from the The Star Wars Trilogy as a basis for those in the game. Farrell's appearance was based on a pilot played by actor Michael Drew who can be seen briefly in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, in which he acknowledges Lando Calrissian's order for the Rebel fighters to split up in order to draw off Imperial pursuers during the Death Star assault. In the script for Return of the Jedi, he is simply credited as \"Pilot.\" Decipher, Inc. also fleshed out the character's backstory, with the release of the \"Death Star II Limited\" set for the Star Wars Customizable Card Game in 2000, which established him as a top A-wing and former top X-wing pilot. The Essential Guide to Warfare (2012) further expanded the character's history, describing his part in the development of the RZ-1 A-wing interceptor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In December 2008, Hasbro confirmed that they would be releasing a Jake Farrell action figure as part of their Star Wars: The Legacy Collection toy line.

The trench run in the game is almost identical to that of the movie\u2014only the persons involved are different. In the game, Merrick Simms enters the trench first while Ru Murleen joins Rookie One and Thurlow Harris in providing cover. As they negotiate down the long trench the group is pursued by three TIE fighters, including a TIE Advanced x1 which was presumably intended to be the one used by Darth Vader in the movie. The TIEs open fire, killing Harris and forcing Murleen to pull out, echoing the fates of Biggs Darklighter and Wedge Antilles in the movie. Simms finally reaches firing range but his torpedoes impact on the surface, leaving Rookie One next to make an attempt. With the TIEs closing fast, Rookie One appears to be in trouble when Farrell's R-22 arrives and destroys the TIEs, leaving Rookie One free to take his shot. This again parallels Han Solo's last minute rescue of Luke Skywalker from the film. Finally, it is Rookie One's shot that is depicted as destroying the battlestation, as opposed to Skywalker's."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In December 2006 Leland Chee commented on the StarWars.com Message Boards that Rookie One's trench run was non-canon.

Although Sue Seserman's Star Wars Insider 27 article \"Excerpts from the Journal of a Rebel Pilot\" confirms that Farrell was present with Murleen and Rookie One for the Battle of Yavin, since his only appearance during the battle in the game is during the non-canon trench run, the exact nature of his involvement in the battle is unclear. \"Excerpts from the Journal of a Rebel Pilot\" incorrectly refers to the character as Captain Ferrell."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Inconsistencies"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Farrell's role in the Battle of Endor has been depicted by a number of adaptations of the movie without change; however, in some versions, his line is given to other characters.

However, Stackpole confirmed on his website that Farrell (then-unnamed) is not Celchu, stating that Celchu does not look like Farrell, and that while Farrell flew the first A-wing into the Death Star, Celchu piloted the second.
