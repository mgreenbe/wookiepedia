A series of micromolecular grips kept it securely in place, while an electrical current stimulated a colony of microorganisms. This caused them to multiply and seal the hole in the hull. Once the seal's sensors determined the breach was closed, a negating current would be applied to the microorganism to stop their growth. The resulting patch was temporary but sturdy enough to allow the ship to limp back to a repair yard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
