Unbeknownst to the Republic leaders, Palpatine's secret spy network called Delta Source, a tool he had long used against his own people, was still active and in working order. Once the Republic discovered the information leak, officials quickly removed the ch'hala trees that were supplying the data, and the Palace became safe again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Grand Corridor remained in good condition during the reign of the New Republic until the invasion of Coruscant by the Yuuzhan Vong.

Open to the public and the hub of all activity in the Palace, the Corridor was large enough to accommodate a Victory Star Destroyer and was personally designed by Emperor Palpatine himself. The corridor held a number of cafes and beverage stands, lining both the ground level and upper balconies that peered out from the inner walls of the hall. Planted at intervals along the walls was a grove of ch'hala trees, apparently for decorative purposes but actually a sinister tool that enabled the effectiveness of Palpatine's secret spy network known as Delta Source. The vibration-sensitive bark of the trees would transmit data to a secret location that would decipher the conversations held in the hall and relay any state secrets or plots back to the Emperor himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
