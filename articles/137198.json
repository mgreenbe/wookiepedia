The depots were equipped with Class 2 hyperdrives and thrusters, enabling them to be landed on a planet from space. The Colossus platform on the ocean planet Castilon was one such depot, and by late in the Cold War was one of the last remaining. During the cold war, the First Order sought out the remaining supertanker fuel depots to put them under their control in preparation for the oncoming war, with the Colossus eventually standing as the only one of the stations not under the First Order's control. One of the First Order's supertanker fuel depots was the Titan, which was infiltrated by Kazuda Xiono and Neeku Vozo so they could steal a new trans-binary deflector for the Colossus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
