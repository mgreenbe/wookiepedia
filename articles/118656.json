He was stored onboard a maintenance shuttle docked aboard the cruiser Steady Wing as part of the onboard tool kit. When the Steady Wing was destroyed in an act of sabotage by Nihil pirates, the only survivors of the attack escaped aboard the sabotaged maintenance shuttle, eventually landing on the moon Wevo. Aspiring inventor Avon Starros found SD-7 in the tool kit and brought him with her when the group left their landing spot in search of better shelter. Starros revealed SD-7, who only had a half-charge of power remaining, to locate a cave for the group to shelter in. SD-7 eventually ran out of power while on Wevo, but Starros took him with her when rescue eventually arrived."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
