The comm burst her forces were following had ceased and the Deliverance resumed its system-by-system search. Within hours, Syndulla's forces had found the fighter wing and the bulk freighter Yadeez. After the Deliverance emerged from hyperspace at maximum velocity with its tractor beam primed, it managed to lock on to the Yadeez from a distance. The starfighter squadrons deployed and remained close, to protect the tractor beam projector under the cover of the Star Destroyer's point-defense weaponry. Two TIEs managed to break through, although unable to do any damage with their cannons, however one TIE impacted the beam projector in a suicide run and obliterated it, killing three crew members aboard the Deliverance. The 204th escaped and jumped to lightspeed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
