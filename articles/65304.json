In this operation, four Star Destroyers docked to the station were crippled by an automated CR90 corvette, the Ram's Head, sent on a ramming trajectory by the Rebel Alliance. The corvette was fitted with the Shield X technology which rendered the vessel nearly invincible to damage from the attack. The drydock itself was undamaged, but the attack was a humiliating setback for the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
