Yellow in color, the arrgrar strands grew very quickly out of decaying planet material. The vines spread by the action of underbrush-dwelling rodents who spread its spores. When the vines began to grow, they inserted tendrils into other plants and sucked nutrients and water out of their host. The dying host plant slowly turned yellow, and once its nutrients were exhausted, the arrgrar vine died too."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The yellow of the arrgrar vine was one color used in the Tarasin skintone language."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
