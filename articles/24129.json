It was also the headquarters for House Serenno. The palace was protected by battle droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located on the planet Serenno, Castle Serenno stood on its own grounds at the edge of a large cliff and was complemented by three ornamental gardens, each of which lay at the front of the palace. Those visiting the estate would walk down a long pathway situated in between the gardens to the front of the palace, where they were greeted by the 120-meter-high main tower where Count Dooku conducted most of his business. Ten relay buildings flanked the main tower, which featured a 22-meter-high stained glass window that looked out to a vast city in the valley below, while other buildings and defense outposts clung onto the cliff face. In front of the palace's main entrance was a double line of obelisks. By the time of the Clone Wars, the palace and the surrounding estate was protected by legions of Separatist battle droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside the palace reflected the refined tastes of Dooku himself. Luxuriously fitted out, the finest furnishings and decor graced the palace's corridors. Artworks from across the galaxy adorned its walls, while statues from ages past looked silently on. However, the palace's lavishness on display for visiting dignitaries hid the cells and torture chambers located deep within the cliff face, in the levels where Dooku would conduct interrogations and executions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 20 BBY, during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, former Sith assassin Asajj Ventress and two other Nightsisters launched an assassination attempt on Count Dooku in order for Ventress to claim vengeance over her former master's betrayal of her. Arriving on Serenno aboard a GS-100 salvage ship, the three Dathomirians entered Dooku's palace and struck him with a poison dart in his bedroom to blind his sight, forcing him to engage the three in a lightsaber duel throughout the castle. However, despite their efforts, Ventress and her fellow Nightsisters failed as Dooku struck all of three of them with his Force lightning and threw them through the main tower window. Mother Talzin then brought Savage Opress to the palace to become Dooku's new apprentice. Dooku taught Savage that his anger gave him strength and that he had to feed off it to succeed. He then sent him on a mission to Toydaria to capture King Katuunko."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later on, mastermind Moralo Eval constructed the Box in the palace for training bounty hunters, in order to kidnap Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later Dooku summoned General Grievous to Serenno and ordered him to kill Ventress and the Nightsisters on Dathomir. Mother Talzin attempted to kill Dooku while he was in his base, which caused him terrible agony, but he contacted Grievous via comlink and ordered that he kill Talzin and follow the green mist which would take him to her. Dooku was saved by Grievous at the last moment. He then believed that the Nightsisters were destroyed so he redirected his attention to Savage Opress, his former apprentice. He summoned Grievous to his base and told him that he could sense that Opress was growing stronger each day. Although Grievous dismissed the fact that Savage could be considered a threat, Dooku said he was a threat to all people, including them, and that something sinister was rising."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
