In the aftermath of Admiral Natasi Daala's unification of the Imperial Remnant, the Megador was left abandoned at Deep 3, one of Harrsk's shipyards, with the Star Dreadnought Dominion. In 12 ABY, during his survey of Imperial armories in the Deep Core, Imperial officer Gilad Pellaeon stumbled upon Deep 3 and procured both Star Dreadnoughts for the Imperial Remnant's war against the New Republic. Confident that the New Republic did not know of the existence of the Megador or the Dominion, Pellaeon sought to use the warships to his advantage. The Megador eventually saw action in 17 ABY at the Battle of Anx Minor, a defeat that proved costly for the Remnant, where it was damaged."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Super Star Destroyer's service continued for decades.
