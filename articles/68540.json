At some point, he sired a daughter, who bore him a granddaughter, Jill, after a relationship with Roark Garnet, a smuggler. Sometime during the Galactic Civil War, Farseeker and Jill met Garnet, who had had little contact with his daughter, and were traveling aboard his freighter, the Dorion Discus, with him and the bounty hunter Tantos Dree. While leaving the planet Thorgeld I, the Dorion Discus was hailed by the Imperial Customs Frigate Assessor, requesting they heave to for a customs inspection. Dree made it clear that the Empire could not discover his presence aboard, forcing Garnet to first attempt to bluff the Assessor into letting them go, then initiating evasive maneuvers when they did not believe him. Farseeker spent the time plotting a jump to hyperspace to allow the Dorion Discus to escape. After the two ships traded fire, Farseeker successfully plotted the course, allowing the ship to jump to lightspeed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later, Farsten attempted to bargain with Farseeker to acquire the mysterious alien device called ou'tranoi, offering 100 credits for it.
