At some point, he managed to secure Imperial data which he supposed to hand to the human Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus and the Twi'lek pilot Hera Syndulla, both of whom belonged to the rebel Spectre cell."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, as the Hoopaloo Nest flew near an asteroid field, a mysterious decorporalized entity took over the ship's droid brain. Deathly afraid, Graysom jumped into an escape pod and allowed the Nest to crash onto the surface of an asteroid. Some time later, Jarrus and Syndulla came to the asteroid belt looking for him, and Graysom sent a distress signal. Once aboard his rescuers' ship, the Ghost, the informant discovered with horror that the entity had transferred itself from the Nest to the Ghost. He, Syndulla and Jarrus were almost blown into the vacuum of space when the spirit opened the cargo bay's door, but the astromech droid Chopper managed to close them in extremis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Immediately thereafter, Graysom stayed with Jarrus while Syndulla and Chopper went to the ship's cockpit to try and understand what was happening with the computer. However, the spirit locked both the informant and the Jedi in the latter's cabin. Graysom suggested that Jarrus use his Jedi lightsaber to cut through the door, but the weapon was stuck out in the corridor. Nevertheless, Jarrus used the Force to manipulate the lightsaber from the other side of the door, and started cutting their way out. Meanwhile, in the cockpit, the entity took over Chopper, and started torturing Syndulla. The Twi'lek pilot, however, tricked the spirit into possessing the holocron of Jarrus, which lay on the floor. Right when the entity realized that it was trapped in a holocron devoid of power, the Jedi entered the cockpit, lightsaber in hand, and Graysom followed soon afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
