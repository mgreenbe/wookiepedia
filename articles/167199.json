He pampered his son, and as a result, Yun lacked patience needed in the family business. To develop such quality in his son, the baron decided to send him to Bunduki, to learn from the order of monks known as the Followers of Palawa. However, after spending only a year with them, Yun returned home, because the monks refused to teach him the ancient martial art Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si. The baron then decided that his son should get closer with the baron's fiancee, the Prophetess of the Dark Side Sariss. This proved to be his ultimate undoing, as Yun, manipulated by Sariss, killed his own father and pledged the family assets to Sariss's master Jerec."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This male individual residing on the planet Panatha had a business affiliated with minerals.

The baron was disappointed, but immediately came out with another idea. He decided that it would be good for Yun if he learned the secrets of the dark side of the Force from Sariss.
