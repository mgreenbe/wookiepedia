Tosinqas attacked Lopani from above, falling several stories down on the subject and killing him. After that, Reeft, who was also present, activated his lightsaber and surprised Tosinqas, who attacked the Jedi. Tosinqas was cut in two by the Jedi's weapon and killed. Reeft took both the bodies of Lopani and Tosinqas and brought them to the Republic's capital planet, Coruscant.
