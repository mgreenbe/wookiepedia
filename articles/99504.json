Her mother was a freighter captain, operating the light freighter Happy Failure. When Aurora was six, her father died. Her mother, wanting a better life for her daughter, moved them to Cloud City in the Bespin system, where she established herself as an independent shipping contractor. Unfortunately, the goods she was carrying had, unbeknownst to her, been stolen from Jabba the Hutt. One of Jabba's underlings, the Twi'lek Toln ne Yerres, dealt with the situation by having the Gamorrean Glongfurrp kill her. Aurora was playing with friends at the time, and was warned to never return to the Happy Failure; she never did, and the grounded ship was gutted by scavengers and eventually turned into a casino."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An orphan, Aurora learned to earn a living for herself making jewellery from left over electronics and scrap metal and selling them to tourists. She barely made a daily living selling to tourists at the back of loading bay 372 in Port Town, but refused all offers by other merchants to sell her wares in their shops as she preferred to cut out the middle man. She was a member of the Merchant Guild."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after the Battle of Yavin, a group of Alliance to Restore the Republic agents were directed to Aurora by a contact of hers on the planet Gerrenthum. They were tracking the Lenushaa gang, who had stolen information from an Alliance cell on the planet. Aurora met them at K'cri's Cafe, and relayed information to them that the slicer who stole the information, a vessel named Tresk, intended to transfer the information to Captain Velantia of the Imperial Security Bureau during a sabacc game at the Pair O'Dice casino."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the evacuation of Cloud City in 3 ABY, Aurora worked with the smuggler captain Tristos Arctura."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Odea Aurora was an awkward young girl, who was self-conscious about her own looks when she thought about it and tended to make mistakes when others were watching her. Left to her own devices, however, Aurora could move like an athlete. She stood 1.67 meters tall, and had short, cropped black hair. Although many believed that Aurora was shy, she was focused on one objective; finding her mother's killer and exacting revenge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A skilled jeweller who worked with cast-off pieces, Odea Aurora's work was popular if not totally profitable.
