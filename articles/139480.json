After Opress broke free of the spell that made him loyal to Asajj Ventress, who intended to use him to exact her revenge against her former master Count Dooku, he returned to Dathomir to seek wisdom from Mother Talzin. Talzin gave him the amulet and told him to use it to seek out his long-lost brother, the former Sith Lord Maul. The talisman would glow blue as Opress discovered clues to his brother's whereabouts on Stobar as well as glowing as he neared his brother's location on Lotho Minor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
