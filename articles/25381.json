Djarin knocks at the door and is greeted by a dark\u2013skinned Twi'lek doorman, whom he asks to speak to Gor Koresh.

In return for the information, Koresh suggests that Djarin trade his beskar armor. Din responds that he is willing to pay, but that he is not leaving his fate up to choice.

Motto explains how after the Empire's fall, the planet became a free-for-all in the power vacuum and the city was destroyed by bandits. After calling over her R5-series astromech droid R5-D4 to project a hologram of Tatooine, Motto shows where on the map it should be before the war; explaining that Mos Pelgo used to be an old mining settlement."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mos Pelgo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Djarin begins his journey towards the forgotten settlement of Mos Pelgo on a Zephyr-J speeder bike after Motto informs him that anyone would spot his ship from far away.

Eventually, Djarin finds the city and slowly rides along the main drag of shacks until he spots the small town's cantina. Djarin dismounts his speeder and leaves The Child in his side pack, heading into the small establishment. Looking around at the empty interior Djarin inquires with the Weequay bartender as The Child sneaks in the bar behind him. The bartender asks about a description for who he is looking for, and Djarin simply states that they would look like him.

Ordering two snorts of spotchka, the Marshal proceeds to grab the drinks from the Weequay and sit down at a table, inviting Djarin to a drink. Djarin begins to move towards the table when the other removes his helmet. He then states that he's never met a real Mandalorian, citing stories about their notorious ability to kill. He admits that he expects Djarin to be upset about him wearing the traditional armor of Mandalorians and announces that he believed a duel would ensue until he saw The Child.

While residents had cheered the Battle of Endor and the withdrawal of Imperial forces from Tatooine, their celebration was short-lived because the Mining Collective took advantage of the power vacuum to invade Mos Pelgo and turn it into a slave camp overnight.

The Tusken chieftain is aware that Vanth had killed several members of his clan during a raid on Mos Pelgo.
