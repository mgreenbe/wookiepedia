An imposing structure built of thick beams of richly patterned red wood, the chalet had a terrace overlooking a narrow river. The moff's office had a high-ceiling with broad windows that revealed a vista spreading out to the horizon in three directions. Apart from that luxury, however, the room was rather spartan. In 3 BBY Leia Organa and Queen Daln\u00e9 visited the chalet to discuss the miner strikes on the moon when the chalet was destroyed by Saw Gerrera's Partisans, who planted bombs there in an attempt to assassinate Panaka."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
