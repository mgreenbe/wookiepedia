In this case, Nexia Kirill will seek revenge on them and join the Order of Zildrog led by Vinn Atrius, only to be sacrificed as fuel to awaken Zildrog by GEMINI 16 on Nathema. If the smuggler makes a Dark Side choice to keep the fleet for themselves, Jedi Master Sumalee will appear instead of Nexia Kirill, while the other classes face antagonists from their own class stories."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
