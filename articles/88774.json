The only known screenshots of Mellag depict him to be a male Rodian. However, this would appear to conflict with Mellag's apparent relationship to the Lars family. Due to the nature of many older quests in Star Wars Galaxies, the gender, species, and appearance of characters could change each time a player performed the quest. Therefore, as in the case with Haro Whitesun, this article assumes that Mellag was a Human, given his status as a member of the Lars family. The quest dialogue given by Darth Vader also indicated that Mellag Davin-Lars was a male."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Furthermore, there is some confusion regarding Mellag's canonical name. The quest dialogue and quest information in the player's datapad indicated that Mellag's full name was Mellag Davin-Lars. However, targeting and examining Mellag in the game revealed his full name to be Mellag Devin, which dropped the hyphenated Lars, and altered the spelling of his last name. This article assumes that the full name is Mellag Davin-Lars, as this name and spelling was most prevalent in the game. However, it is possible that a shortened version of Mellag's name could indeed be Mellag Davin. Additionally, even though the quest dialogue did not say so, examining Mellag revealed him to be a mercenary."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
