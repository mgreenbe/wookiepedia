It was disguised as a civilian freighter to avoid notice. Around 1 BBY, it was infiltrated by rebels Saw Gerrera, Ezra Bridger, Sabine Wren, and Chopper during a brief stop at Faos Station. When Gerrera discovered the freighter's cargo, he wired the crystal up to the ship's hyperdrive to create a bomb, which destroyed both the freighter and the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer it was rendezvousing with when it went off."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
