Antilles and Darklighter broke formation to intercept, leaving Porkins and Eirriss to provide cover for the Starduster. However, some TIEs made it through and were able to get on Porkins's tail. Eirriss eliminated his pursuers and Porkins soon reciprocated, but more TIEs came and attacked the Starduster. Though Dantels was able to shoot them off, some of the debris struck Eirriss's X-wing, damaging her shield generator and hyperdrive. With no time to eject before the next wave of TIEs arrived, and no way to leave the system, Eirriss set a collision course for the incoming fighters, telling her comrades to leave without her. Her X-wing was destroyed in a head-on collision with the Imperial fighters. Porkins, Antilles, and Darklighter eventually jumped to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After landing in the Great Temple, they learned that the Death Star was already en route to Yavin to destroy the Rebel base.
