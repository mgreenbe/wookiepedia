Granting them not only extrasensory skills, it also guided racers to think about the meaning of the race in a cosmic sense. Able to know their place in time and space gave a racer a different perspective, and allowed them to ponder their reality on a more philosophical level. Intuition and a need to understand the future as it related to the positioning of self were the vehicles in which the racer drove themselves further along their course; a path carved by the Force. When sensing obstacles, if they feel that their path would end in a particular future, they know to avoid it. Skilled racers' perceptions extend beyond themselves to other beings. Capable of being in the right place at the right time, racers of this advanced skill were capable of rescuing people at just the right time.
