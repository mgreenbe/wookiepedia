As an AT-ST walker moved to engage him, the scout walker's crew alerted the main base, which promptly dispatched a force of AT-ATs led by Kuhru to confront the intruder.

However, the Dark Lord disagreed with Kuhru's assessment of the situation. Rather than execute the officer on the spot for his failure to capture the Rebel, Vader used the Force to convince Kuhru to walk out of one of the Executor's airlocks without a space suit.
