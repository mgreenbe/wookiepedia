They played host to troops of the native hesten, non-sentient primates. The trees consisted of multiple white branch like trunks holding up between one and four flat, purple circular layers. In those trees with four layers, the second layer was the widest and the top layer the smallest. Several protrusions emerged from the top most layer. Some umbrella trees grew out of or on top of cliff faces, while others grew on flat ground."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars in 20 BBY, the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 landed a BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber amongst a patch of umbrella trees growing around hot springs and huge spherical plants on Balnab. A hesten watched them dismount from within the shade of one of a nearby umbrella tree's layers, before bounding away to join a second hesten eating on top of a separate umbrella tree."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droids and hesten then attempted to flee when blaster fire from a group of local raiders hit the tree, but the raiders successfully captured the droids.

A Weequay pirate ship later landed nearby, blowing up large clouds of dust, but not moving the nearby umbrella trees at all.
