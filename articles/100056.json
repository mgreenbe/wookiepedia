The positioning of the trio of interdicting ships prevented the Yuuzhan Vong forces, which were arrayed around Duro, from leaving the star system as long as the interdictor line held. With the Yuuzhan Vong forces stuck at Duro, General Garm Bel Iblis was able to lead a Galactic Alliance force to victory over the minimal Yuuzhan Vong guard the invaders had left at Fondor and its shipyards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Olovin appeared in 2003's The Final Prophecy, written by Greg Keyes as a part of The New Jedi Order series of novels.
