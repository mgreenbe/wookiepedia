The yacht itself was very opulent and large, made with bronze, carmine and gold among other things. It was by no means a fast or powerful ship, having only shields, but was used to transport Crassus in comfort."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the failed meeting of the Imperial Future Council on Akiva, the Golden Harp was used to escape the planet before it fell into chaos. As it made its escape, it was shot from the ground by a turbolaser, taking out the entire middle section of the ship and making it difficult to pilot. However, it made it into space and crash landed onto the Vigilance, killing some of the passengers onboard including Crassus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
