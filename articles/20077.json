Around 1 ABY, Imperial and Rebel agents on Rori were involved in the hunt for Cal Handro, a smuggler who had vanished after crash-landing on Rori while transporting a new kind of spice for the Rebel Alliance.

In order to find Handro, Wolff Kalos dispatched Rebel spacers to interrogate Officer M'Kae because he suspected him to be involved. Since the Imperial officer was not eager to reveal anything, Kalos ordered his agents to attack the Imperial Base where M'Kae was stationed in order to collect incriminating evidence. The assault was successful and the Rebel agents managed to collect M'Kae's journal.
