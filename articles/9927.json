It acted as an extension of the arm, enabling a booma to travel at a greater speed and force than possible with the unaided arm. It had optimal range of 30 meters, and a maximum range of 100 meters. It could also be used without an energy ball, as a blunt weapon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The atlatls used by the Gungan Grand Army were carved from a naturally isolating wood by the Otoh Gunga Defense League."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A real-life atlatl is a tool used for throwing spears farther.
