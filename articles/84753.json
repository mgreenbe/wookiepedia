Due to the system's sophistication, the pilot could ultimately focus on flying; the fire control system doing the vast majority of the heavy lifting by managing the targeting of individual weapons. Able to be activated and deactivated with a flip of a button, the system's versatility and ease of use was countered by a severe weakness; because all weapon control systems were routed through the FCS, if the ship was hit with an ion cannon while the system was activated, then all weaponry would simultaneously be crippled."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The MK.IV was commonly used by bounty hunters, and was notably installed stock on the Lancer-class pursuit craft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
