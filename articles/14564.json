However, his supplies and equipment were attacked again by a Rebel strike force. During the battle B-wings were discovered to be using a new Warhead, after disabling one of the B-wings they discovered that the warhead was a Mag pulse warhead, developed by Galactic Electronics in the Corporate Sector. This was considered treason and Zaarin decided to seize the corporation's Station Pondut and all assets and technology."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zaarin first sent Assault Gunboats Tau, one of which piloted by Imperial Ace Maarek Stele, to take care of the platform's Z-95 Headhunters Adam, Charlie and Delta. While the dogfighting began, quickly in the Gunboats favor, a Stormtrooper transport GEC U47 docked with a container and attempted to flee the battle. But Maarek Stele intercepted and disabled the transport before it could escape. Realizing that their starfighters were losing, a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle Kalree containing VIPs launched from the platform attempting to escape, but the shuttle was also disabled by Stele. A YT-1300 light freighter Lucky Day carrying an arms dealer also launched from the station to escape to hyperspace, only to be disabled by Stele as well. 3 minutes into the battle 3 Gamma-class ATR-6 assault transports Omega arrived as the last of the Z-95s were destroyed. Stele also helped the Assault transports in disabling Platform Pondut, which wasn't easy because the installation was well armed with multiple laser turrets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the station was disabled two A-wings, 4 Y-wings, armed with Mag Pulse warheads, and a Cargo ferry Bujiboi arrived, but the A-wings and the Bujiboi became overwhelemed when Star Destroyer Glory arrived, launching TIE Bombers destroyed the Buhjiboi and the 4 Y-wings were disabled in an attempt to acquire the warheads for themselves. Soon afterwards B-wings arrived to destroy the station, but they were all destroyed by Stele, while he made sure that the Utility tugs, U-4f91, U-4f92, U-4f93, and U-4f94 docked with the disabled Y-wings and brought them to the Glory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The capture of Pondut was considered by the Empire to be an example to anyone who was thinking of trading with their enemies, with the punishment being death. This also, likely, put a strain on relations with the corporate sector as it was 'Neutral territory'."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zaarin then went back to his research and soon his Beam weapon was completed and was loaded onto his starfighters. Palpatine assumed that Zaarin would serve the Empire well with these developments. Unfortunately Zaarin had other ideas. Meanwhile, Stele was then transferred to the Ottega system where Harkov's fleet had been discovered and Darth Vader was soon to personally oversee the operation on his Star Destoryer Garrett."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This battle takes place in the 1994 PC game Star Wars: TIE Fighter.
