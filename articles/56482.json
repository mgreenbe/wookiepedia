The dedicated field created by the disruptor can be set to allow heavy loads to moved about with ease. They can also be modified to work in reverse, causing an object to suddenly become much heavier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Princess Leia Organa used one of these devices to increase Darth Vader's porter's mass to the seventh power, causing him to plunge into a deep hole made by his own mass."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
