In the year 34 ABY, Chewbacca, a Wookiee male from Kashyyyk, used his claws to kill a First Order stormtrooper following the murder of his closest friend, Han Solo. Solo had been killed by his son, Kylo Ren, who was a leader of the First Order. Chewbacca knowingly violated the Wookiee honor code, but he rationalized that there was no honor among the First Order and that Ren had broken all of the rules by committing patricide."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wookiee honor code was first mentioned in the audiobook of Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel, by Michael Kogge, which was published on January 15, 2016.
