This was just 1,855 men strong, and identical to those deployed with the subordinate surface armies, consisting of 784 support personnel, coupled with 200 ISB agents and three companies of COMPNOR observers, and protected by one security company and six perimeter patrol platoons\u2014these last being the only combat troops under the High General's direct command.
