When the members of the SAGroup came of age and were properly indoctrinated, other branches of COMPNOR would recruit them, such as the Imperial Security Bureau or CompForce, or they would go on to become outstanding Imperial citizens, upholding the New Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Branches"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "SAGroup headquarters"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Those assigned to the SAGroup headquarters, or SAGroupHQ, coordinated all communications for the divisions under them, but were not very efficient in their job."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "SAGEducation (SAGEd)"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This branch of the Sub-Adult Group was tasked with bringing education\u2014Imperial history, the New Order, and more\u2014to the worlds of the Empire, specifically to the younger and easily manipulated minds of the Empire's children.
