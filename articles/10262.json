The starship carried several Imperial Moffs, governors and high-ranking officers who died in the attack. The Justice Action Network later claimed responsibility for the terrorist strike and declared it was a retaliation for the Imperial subjugations of independent worlds in the Colonies and Outer Rim Territories. The Imperial Transport Commission was quickly assigned to investigate the explosion and confirm the sabotage. In spite of the Imperial promises of actions, the Core citizen began to fear terrorist actions in the Core Worlds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
