Ikt hired an individual to get this crystal back, and rewarded the individual with 20,000 credits once they had killed Orfa and retrieved the crystal. The crystal itself was imbued with the power of the Force which gave its holder a greater ability to shrug off insidious effects which caused damage over time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
