On his return from the Unknown Regions, for the second time in his life, Grand Admiral Thrawn was a high ranking officer of the Imperial military, holding the position of Grand Admiral. Described by such historians as the young Devaronian history student Pollo Tipn as one of the most capable and cunning soldiers the Emperor commanded, Thrawn's tactical abilities saw him rise to the position of Grand Admiral despite being a Chiss, and despite the Emperor's xenophobia. Having had command of ships prior to the Battle of Endor, as a Grand Admiral, the defeat and scattering of the Empire saw Thrawn's access to a large fleet removed. Thrawn, however, still attempted to retain a number of ships, and to ensure he was able to take control of the Imperial Remnant, the Remnant of the Empire, as Grand Admiral and leader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the fact that a number of commanders and warlords considered themselves above him in terms of importance, tactical prowess and ability, Thrawn was able to gather a fleet small in comparison with that of the Empire prior to the Battle of Endor, however large enough so as to be regarded as the new leader of the Empire, accepted by the Moffs, the governor's of Imperial sectors, and the Ruling Council, the Council composed of numerous Imperial Advisors. The core of Thrawn's fleet, which he was beginning to build, was his personal armada, built around his flagship Chimaera and five other Imperial-class Star Destroyers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Beginning the offensive"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first beginnings of the campaign involved a number of Imperial missions to the planet Bimmisaari, to capture the pregnant Leia Organa Solo, the sister of Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker and a member of the ruling body of the New Republic at the time, the Provisional Council. Thrawn, unknown in both name and position to the New Republic at the time, began mobilizing the Imperial Remnant, and his fleet. The first combat a member ship of Thrawn's fleet saw was on the planet Nkllon, where the Judicator attacked the mobile mining facility, Nomad City. This facility was owned by the human Lando Calrissian, friend to Organa Solo and a former General in the Rebel Alliance during the Battle of Endor. During the Raid on Nomad City, the outpost was raided and the Empire stole fifty-one mole miners, large mining devices."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Criminal boss Talon Karrde rescued Luke Skywalker from searching Imperial forces, before subduing him and imprisoning him in their base on the planet Myrkr. Han Solo, husband of Leia and former criminal, and Lando Calrissian attempted to find Karrde, and were tipped off by a member of his organization as to the location of the base on Myrkr. After Skywalker's escape from his imprisonment, the Chimaera came out of orbit above the planet at the same time that a member of Karrde's organization gave pursuit. Landing craft were dispatched by the Chimaera to Karrde's camp. Patrols were sent to capture Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade, member of Karrde's group. Planning from Karrde's group, Han and Lando allowed Skywalker and Jade to be rescued, the Empire and the Chimaera not taking them prisoner."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next time the fleet saw action was in the first major battle of Thrawn's campaign, the raid on the planet Sluis Van, in an attempt to gain a number of ships for his cause. Using a cloaking device from the Empire's private storehouse on the planet Wayland, Thrawn cloaked his warships and the mole miners stolen from Nkllon and infiltrated the shipyard. Using the mole miners to burn into the command centers of the ships, Thrawn would have been able to steal the entire fleet from the New Republic, however Calrissian activated the mole miners thrusters, using a control code, to render the ships Thrawn was trying to steal inoperable. Of Thrawn's fleet, five of the six Imperial Star Destroyers of were present at the battle. The ship missing from the engagement was the Judicator, being refitted after the strike on Nkllon. These five ships were supported by a close support squadron of twelve Strike-class medium cruisers, and a picket line of twenty-two Carrack-class light cruisers, with thirty TIE squadrons deployed in the fighter screen."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The main offensive"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Sluis Van, Han Solo discovered former Rebel General Garm Bel Iblis and his private militia. Part of the ships in Bel Iblis' militia were made up of those from the Katana fleet, a fleet of ships supposedly lost for some time. The Empire, however, wished to expand their ships, as Thrawn had procured the technology to be able to grow clones. Needing ships to be crewed by the clones, Thrawn jumped at the chance to gain such ships. Reaching the man who knew the location of the ships, Hoffner, first, the Empire were able to make their way to the location of the Katana fleet. The New Republic, however, eventually learnt of the location, and so were able to reach the location too. Finding the Empire already there, the Battle for the Katana fleet ensued, with the Judicator participating as part of Thrawn's personal Armada, in addition to the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Peremptory. With the Empire's benefit of having reached their first, they managed to move most of the ships before the New Republic had arrived. The New Republic's tactical victory saw the Judicator, in terms of Thrawn's personal armada, driven off, and the Peremptory destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This saw Thrawn's fleet expanded, allowing the incoming clones to have a great deal of ships they were able to crew. With these new ships, Thrawn stepped up his campaign a gear, launching a three pronged attack on the planets Crondre, Ando, Filve and Ord Pardron. A great majority of the ships in Thrawn's fleet participated, the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Bellicose attacking Ando, Filve being attacked by the Judicator and Crondre the Nemesis, an Imperial-class Star Destroyer from Thrawn's personal Armada. Thrawn's flagship, the Chimaera, attacked the planet Ukio, in addition to the attack. With the main aim of the three pronged attack being to exhaust the New Republic base on Ord Pardron, so it could be easily taken, the attacks were a success. Insane clone of a long dead Jedi Master, Joruus C'baoth, had been calling for Thrawn to capture Leia Organa Solo and her unborn twins for him so he could \"train\" them. After a strike team sent to the New Republic capital of Coruscant failed, Thrawn agreed to take the fleet there in person. Launching an attack on Ord Mantell to ensure the Republic failed to anticipate the attack on Coruscant, Thrawn took the Chimaera and another Imperial-class Star Destroyer in his personal Armada to Coruscant. In addition to the other ships, this made a strong attack force on the New Republic capital."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Laying siege to Coruscant, using asteroids orbiting the planet to stop ships daring to enter or leave, Thrawn and his fleet were able to cut off Coruscant from the rest of the galaxy. Having launched a successful second attack on Calrissian's Nomad City, attack on Generis and on Xa Fel, the next major battle was the Battle of Bilbringi. All of Thrawn's personal Armada participated in this battle, in addition to the two Immobilizer 418 cruisers Sentinel and Constrainer. Despite, at first, the battle seemingly going well for the Empire, it soon turned around. The assassination of Thrawn at the hands of his Noghri bodyguard Rukh saw the Empire leaderless, and Thrawn's second in command, Captain Gilad Pellaeon, gave the order to retreat.

Death's Head, under the command of Imperial Captain Harbid, saw action at such battles as the assault on the New Republic base of Ord Pardron, the Siege of Coruscant and the Battle of Bilbringi, where it made its last appearance.

Judicator was also present at the Battle for the Katana fleet, where Captain Brandei became incensed at the New Republic for the destruction of the Peremptory. The final battle Judicator saw in the campaign was, like many of the fleet, the Battle of Bilbringi. The penultimate ship in Thrawn's personal armada, the Nemesis, saw action only at Sluis Van and Bilbringi.

For example, in a series of synchronized strikes against planets near Sluis Van, in the preliminaries to the assault on the shipyard described above, the ships of the armada were grouped with other Star Destroyers and then temporarily reorganized into three battlegroups of four, with each Star Destroyer being escorted by a dedicated task force of approximately five smaller ships."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Naval"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial-class Star Destroyers, Victory-class Star Destroyers, Carrack-class light cruisers, Strike-medium class cruisers, Immobilizer 418 cruisers, Lancer-class frigates.
