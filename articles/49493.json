The system used microvalves and pipes of pressured gas or liquids rather than electrical circuits. The system made computers larger than galactic standard, was delicate to physical damage, and was maintenance heavy. However, the mechanical nature of fluidics made it immune to damage from ion weapons or the frequent energy discharges of the Kathol Rift."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
