According to the quasi-historical Qel-Droma Epics series of poems, Sadow was active thousands of years before the time of Jedi Knight Ulic Qel-Droma. During that period, as the Epics claimed, the Sith Empire conducted an invasion that began the Great Hyperspace War. Empress Teta thus allied herself with the Jedi Order and defeated Sadow's forces, scattering them across the galaxy.
