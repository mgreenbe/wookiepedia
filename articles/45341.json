Hett eventually emerged to find the Galactic Empire had fallen due to the efforts of Luke Skywalker and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, leaving him unable to take revenge against the Sith who destroyed the Jedi; Darth Vader and Darth Sidious. Feeling robbed, Hett fled to the Unknown Regions, only to be captured by the Yuuzhan Vong. Upon capture, Hett was brutally tortured and left in the Embrace of Pain. There, he encountered Vergere, a Jedi from before the Clone Wars who secretly trained as a Sith under Darth Sidious. There, the two discussed the future of the Sith Order, with Hett believing an army of Sith would be best to bring order to the galaxy while Vergere preferred to stick with Darth Bane's Rule of Two. Deciding he was a lost cause, Vergere left Hett to the Vong during preparations for their attack on the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Escape"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hett waited as he was being tortured until he was strong enough in the the Force to escape. During the process, the former Jedi attacked his captors with Force lightning and stole a Yorik-et starfighter to flee the ship. In order to keep his survival a secret, Hett destroyed the scout ship, killing everyone on board before retreating to Korriban. There, he took on the name Darth Krayt, after the predators from his homeworld. Finishing his training, he founded the One Sith as the New Republic was distracted by the Vong and their invasion. Over time, he and his followers continued to build up strength. Krayt would later tell Cade Skywalker of his escape while torturing him in an Embrace of Pain over a century later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
