Days after their previous encounter with the bulk freighter Yadeez, another comm burst, that they were previously trailing, came through. With no tractor beam, the Deliverance emerged from hyperspace deep in-system in the hope of surprising the 204th. They arrived in an unmapped system with an alphanumeric designation, that was cluttered with planetoids and debris. The Yadeez and its escorts were forced toward one of the planetoids, to prevent them from jumping to lightspeed. The New Republic starfighter squadrons engaged in a skirmish with the 204th TIEs that lasted six minutes before they escaped. Two TIEs were destroyed with no New Republic casualties, other than a single minor injury to Genni Avremif (Hail Six) after his ejector seat had accidentally triggered on landing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
