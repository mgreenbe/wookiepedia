The clones fire from their attack shuttle but they can't hit the assassin droid's craft. Then the shuttle is hit and crashes into the planet. The group survives but their shuttle is lost. However, the team's gunner, Blasty, says he can repair their walker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clones are then shown traveling across the snow covered landscape with the remade walker. Eventually, clone trooper 1137 notices that 1139 has gone missing. Also at that moment, the gunner spots a Neimoidian shuttle. Inside the shuttle, Viceroy Nute Gunray speaks to an assassin droid to confirm they have R2-D2. A droid tells the Viceroy that he had visitors and Gunray goes to the shuttle's door to see them. Once outside, Gunray is tackled by two of the clones. Just then, 1139 returns riding a tauntaun. The clones board the shuttle and take off, leaving Gunray tied up with his droids. As the shuttle climbs above the planet, someone complains about a stink followed by 1139 getting yelled at for bringing the tauntaun."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"TO BE CONTINUED!\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars comics at LEGO.com."}]}
