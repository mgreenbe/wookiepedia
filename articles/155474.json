When the Wookiee tourist boarded the spacecraft, he or she took a seat between a Mon Calamari passenger and an elderly female. Shortly before departure, a Human youngling sitting in front of them used a camera to take a picture of the two non-Humans. As the flash option was activated, the Wookiee and the Mon Calamari were blinded by the sudden burst of light. While the startled Wookiee tourist threw their arms up in the air in displeasure, the child's mother reprimanded her son. That event was later immortalized when it was included on the safety video Star Tours showed to their passengers before taking off between the years 1 and 0 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The colors of the passenger's fur varied from black to chestnut brown, demonstrating their belonging to the rwook subspecies of Wookiees.
