The team decided that the planet was unacceptable under Moff Kentor Sarne's rule, but team was held by the warlord and forced to work for them.

The staff interrogated him, and found that he was neither. However, to simplify matters, they listed him as incompetent.

When the FarStar arrived at the facility in 8 ABY, Losron assisted in the jailbreak and then volunteered for duty onboard the corvette."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several weeks after leaving Q'Maere, Losron was involved in Chase's mutiny onboard the FarStar, leading the group that took engineering.
