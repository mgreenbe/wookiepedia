Night Ops armor was typically painted black, and featured a special stealth alloy that shielded the armor against sensors and made the wearer almost invisible to the naked eye. The armor itself was a derivative of the standard Katarn-class commando armor that the clones typically used in other operations. Notable users include the commandos of Omega Squad.
