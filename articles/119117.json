They had grey fur and stood from 2.5 to 3 meters tall with especially long arms. The bears' appetites were huge and being omnivores they ate anything they could get their hands on, using their teeth and talons to attack prey, which could include sentients. The safest way to deal with a Sacorrian grey bear was to use heavy weaponry or avoid it all together."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sacorrian grey bears were first mentioned in Suns of Fortune, a sourcebook released in 2014 for Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
