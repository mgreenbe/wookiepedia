Because the bha'lir mated for life, it was rare to see more than one male and female adult in a pack. When hunting, however, several bha'lir packs would often work together to exhaust their prey. Cubs and females ate before the males even though the males were bigger and stronger on average. This was the extent to which most bha'lir packs socialized."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Deforestation on Iyred drove the bha'lir so near to extinction that they were officially declared extinct despite the few refuges that still existed.
