Accompanying Luke were Leia Organa, C-3PO, and R2-D2. Skywalker landed the vessel on pad 583. While Luke was engaged in a secret meeting with a Rebel contact, a gang known as the Freelies tricked C-3PO into allowing them access to the ship, kidnapping Leia and R2-D2. Skywalker and C-3PO were able to rescue them from an Imperial assault ordered by Imperial Intelligence director Blackhole and escape aboard this vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Skywalker utilized it in an uneventful reconnaissance mission, until Massassi One issued a Code Grave order to abandon it and divert to Tatooine to investigate an Imperial transport capsule that landed on the planet and was currently in Jawa custody. After landing the vessel in Mos Eisley, Skywalker made contact with Rebel operative Anduvil of Ogem, and the pair, along with C-3PO and R2-D2, accomplished the mission. Anduvil's ship had been confiscated by the Empire, so she departed Tatooine with Luke and the droids aboard Luke's ship, along with a captured Imperial commander brought as insurance that they would be able to leave the system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
