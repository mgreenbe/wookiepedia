One rocket fired from a single behemoth was powerful enough to annihilate a UT-AT if aimed correctly, as seen in the Battle of Mygeeto. These three-legged artillery droids were formidable in battle, reducing infantry and tanks to rubble. Their rotating multi-jointed assemblies allowed them to change facing almost instantly and they could fire from extended ranges. It was almost impossible to approach such droids, as all sides conceivably faced the front.
