The Galactic Empire's Death Star I battlestation had 123 of the units for propulsion in hyperspace, all of which were connected to a single navigational matrix, in order to ensure the Death Star was carried beyond the speed of light due to its massive size. The hyperdrive system was linked with the navicomputer to deliver the battle station to strategic areas beyond the hazardous range of planetary or stellar gravitational forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
