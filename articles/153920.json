Around 9 ABY, the dock worker was present at a launchpad at the port when the gunship Razor Crest entered Trask's atmosphere at high speed, plummeting towards the surface. The Mon Calamari witnessed the Crest falling and catching fire, before rapidly decelerating before the launchpad to make a swift landing. One of the gunship's sublight engines then malfunctioned and the Razor Crest swerved into the sea beside the launchpad, prompting a shaking head from the dock worker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Razor Crest was carried onto the launchpad by a mobile loading gantry, the gunship's pilot and owner, the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin, came out and was greeted by the dock worker. The Mon Calamari asked what help was required, and Djarin asked back whether the dock worker could fix the Crest. The dock worker replied that the gunship could be made to fly again, and so the Mandalorian gave him thousand credits to do make whatever repairs were possible. Mon Calamari verbally decided to fuel the Razor Crest, but showed skepticism on whether the gunship could still hold fuel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mon Calamari got to work on the Razor Crest, patching up hull breaches, repairing the engines and leaving netting and lines within the cockpit. When Djarin returned, he was dissatisfied with the work, remarking that he had given the dock worker a thousand credits. The dock worker then reached a datapad out for the Mandalorian to consult regarding the commission of the repairs. Djarin complied and agreed to the repairs before departing on the Crest, which took off very shakily."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mon Calamari dock worker had brown skin and orange eyes.
