The slider was designed by the establishment's Besalisk chef and owner, Dexter Jettster, who based it on inspiration from the gambling world of Vorzyd V and considered it to be delicious. It consisted of a Mongo Beefhead patty, saut\u00e9ed Vorzydiak mushrooms, three kibi strips, and Dex's special garnish, all on a trans-shipped medium-density foodboard. The sliders cost 6.7 credits each, with Sernpidalian mayo-ketchup or Bimm mustard available upon request for no additional charge. The Vorzyd slider was served at Dex's Diner at some point prior to the restaurant's destruction during the first two years of the Galactic Empire's rule."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vorzyd slider was first mentioned in the 2009 Hyperspace exclusive article \"Dining at Dex's,\" which was written by Gregory Walker in the style of an in-universe menu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
