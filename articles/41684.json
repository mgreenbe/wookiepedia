When the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong invaded Duro in 26 ABY, the DDF attempted to defend the orbital cities and launched starfighters to push back the Yuuzhan Vong attack. However, the Yuuzhan Vong took Duro in the end and the DDF was presumably destroyed. If any part of the DDF survived and managed to escape, they would have probably been absorbed into the rest of the normal Defense Forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It included four squadrons of E-wings, B-wings, I-7 Howlrunners, and Dagger-D police fighters, as well as defense platforms, under the command of Poesy and Admiral Darez Wuht."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
