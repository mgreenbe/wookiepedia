Considered old by 0 ABY, Skinker formed an arrangement with Beilert Valance, an ex-Imperial bounty hunter who spent several weeks plying his trade on Feriae Junction.

Although Skinker had no particular ire towards droids, Valance paid the going rate for rebuilt droids, so he continued to entertain the unhinged bounty hunter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the meantime, Skinker also kept an eye out for the Rebel that Valance was so set on capturing, as the hunter had a hunch that his target may pass through Feriae Junction due to the Imperial blockade on the Yavin system.

Skinker immediately recognized the man, who was accompanied by his 3PO protocol droid, and directed one of his employees, Polyp, to pass the word along to Valance. Polyp delivered the message and returned to Skinker, but their incessant whispering drew the suspicion of Skywalker, who drew a blaster on the pair and ruined Valance's efforts to get the drop on him.
