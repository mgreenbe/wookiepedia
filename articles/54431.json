Four dark troopers from the platoon were successful in kidnapping the Force-sensitive Mandalorian foundling Grogu on the planet Tython. After delivering the child to Gideon, the entire platoon was tasked with fighting back Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin and his task force from taking over the ship and rescue Grogu."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On his way to rescue Grogu, Djarin, prevented most of the platoon from deploying by sealing their cargo hold, but had to fight one in hand-to-hand combat, eventually destroying it with his beskar spear after a hard-fought battle. After defeating the droid, Djarin jettisoned the rest using the ship's airlock. After airlocking the platoon, Djarin regrouped with his allies with Grogu and a captured Gideon in tow. Soon after, however, the remaining dark troopers returned to the ship and began to advance upon the ship's bridge where two troopers began to punch down the blast doors. Just before destroying the doors, the entire platoon was cut down by Luke Skywalker who had recently boarded the cruiser."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
