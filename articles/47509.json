Habel joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and was one of the leaders of the Rebel cell on the planet Lan Barell. Operating out of the Grill with the acknowledgement of the Human-Qieg Guild that ruled the planet, the cell had agreed to stock no heavy weapons anywhere within the Lan system. However, some firebrand members of the cell secretly established a weapons depot in the Lowlands against the nature of the agreement. When a transport at the base was destroyed by members of the radical Qiemal, Habel had to send in a team to cover the incident and rescue survivors. During the Galactic Civil War, a team of bounty hunters were close to acquiring Habel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
