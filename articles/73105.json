They were very fast, reaching a top speed of 80 kilometers per hour and easily outrunning most other creatures. Kaadu came in shades of yellow and bright oranges. The area around their eyes was a periwinkle color."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kaadu had sharp hearing and a keen sense of smell. They lacked upper incisors, and as such were unable to chew their food. Their diet consisted primarily of snails, tlickweed, and standard aquatic plants. Their blunt, hoof-like claws provided surefootedness. The stub tail counterbalances the head."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They could be found in huge, sexually segregated flocks (20-100 individuals on average), with the total record documented as 3.4 million individuals; male flocks and female flocks come together during mating, at which time the males became more colorful with yellows and purples. They often had close familial ties. Kaadu females laid their eggs on land, often in fields, but also on riverbanks, where they made elevated mud nests that they lined with vegetable matter. Because predators such as the peko-peko ate unattended kaadu eggs, the average clutch of eggs was usually 10-12 at a time. Six to eight young in a clutch would usually make it to hatching. The young themselves are fully precocial at hatching."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Predators of the adults included Narglatches and Zalaacas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kaadu meat was comestible.

Kaadu were highly loyal to their owners; it was said that a Gungan and his kaadu made an inseparable team. Warriors often decorated their steeds with huge titavian feathers. Officers of the Gungan Grand Army rode into battle against the Trade Federation upon their kaadu mounts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were also encountered by the Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi during their task of finding two missing Jedi Master's in the swamps of Obredaan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The kaadu was originally developed as a beast of burden on Tatooine for The Phantom Menace.
