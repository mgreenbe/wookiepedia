In 5 BBY he took part in the battle of Yag'Dhul, betting on the outcome of the skirmish in a contest set up by a group of Hutts. The Imperials, however, detected the gamblers and, believing them to be supplying intelligence to the insurgents, attacked them. Trouvee fled in the Millennium Falcon with his copilot, Waglin. However, as they fled, the Imperial flagship, the Desolator, fired on them, accidentally hitting two TIE fighters and putting the count two above what Trouvee had bet on. Pursued by many beings whom he owed money, Trouvee decided to enter the Cloud City Sabacc Tournament, where he lost his ship to Lando Calrissian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, after this, his life took a turn for the positive, and he became very lucky.
