The eatery known as Dex's Diner located in the CoCo Town district of the planet Coruscant and owned by the Besalisk chef Dexter Jettster, served the oranges as part of a dish named interstellar garden salad, which he considered delicious. The salad also included crisp Revwien lettuce, topatoes, space carrots, Qiraadishes, Sriluurian raisins, and Wol Cabasshews, with Luptoomian dressing and the option to add grilled Gornt meat for an extra credit. The salad cost 5.7 credits and was the most popular salad served at Dex's, which was destroyed during the first two years of the Galactic Empire's rule. The Mandalorians with which the fruit shared its name were a warrior culture based around the planet Mandalore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mandalorian oranges were introduced in the 2009 Hyperspace-exclusive article, Dining at Dex's, which was written by Gregory Walker as an in-universe menu for Dex's Diner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
