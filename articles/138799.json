The droids were designed to be used in the training of Imperial officer cadets, but instructors felt that the lessened amount of training deaths meant that the TRD-series lacked the killer instincts of purpose-built combat droids, and the droids were phased out of service. The Galactic Empire went on to use the TRD-series for crowd suppression and corporate security, while some other organizations continued to use the droids for their original purpose."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
