According the legends, Taradon pursued criminals with a lightsaber and blaster, brining dozens of galactic criminals to justice for almost a century. Taradon had extraordinary prowess as a pilot, and developed Taradon's Helm. Taradon trained alongside Deelguh as a Padawan, though Deelguh eventually betrayed the Jedi Order and became a rogue Jedi and assassin. Deelguh began raiding for kyber crystals, and eventually launched a raid on the Jedi planet Ilum. During the battle, Taradon deliberately crashed his starfighter into Deelguh's ship, killing them both."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
