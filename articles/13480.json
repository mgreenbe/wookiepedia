The Yadeez and its escorts dropped into the atmosphere of a radioactive deathworld to slow down the New Republic forces and buy time for the Raider. TIE squadrons were launched and a battle ensued with the New Republic starfighter squadrons. TIE/sa bombers dropped proton bombs without detonator timers to drift like mines in the planet's fierce winds, which managed to destroy two X-wing starfighters. Squadron Four TIE pilot Garl \"Snapper\" Lykan, known by Alphabet Squadron for his Needle maneuver, was killed by a trio of X-wings that converged on him. The 204th's commanding officer, Colonel Soran Keize found a way out, and so after the TIEs boarded the Yadeez and exited the planet's atmosphere, they jumped to lightspeed, along with the refueling Raider and other escorts. The 204th held a funeral for Lykan shortly after."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
