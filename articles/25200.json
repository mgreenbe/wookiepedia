When Xaverri came to Nar Shaddaa, her shows were held at the Castle. When news of an Imperial attack came to Nar Shaddaa, the Castle willingly allowed Han Solo and Mako Spince to use their auditorium for a smuggler meeting to plan for the defense of Nar Shaddaa, as an attack would be bad for business. It had a fifty story atrium. Bria Tharen, disguised as Bria Lavval, integrated a booking there as a singer as part of her cover story."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
