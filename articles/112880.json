The Rebels were looking for a supply of parts for the Alliance Fleet's starships. After negotiating a deal, Pak revealed the location of the parts was the Imperial training facility on Sirpar. Before he could leave with his credits, Vassk double-crossed him and the Rebels. The henchman planned to turn them all over to the Empire for a bounty. The Rebels managed to defeat the stormtroopers who responded and fled the scene."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An incident occurred at the cantina in 1 ABY, which involved seven barrels of Zelosian wine, the Force-sensitive Gamorrean brothers Thok and Gorc, a Kloo horn, three Gungan patrons who had been bludgeoned to death, and five fricasseed Ugnaught patrons. This also resulted in the arrest and separation of the two brothers by the Imperial Prophetess Sariss, resulting in Thok being placed in Prefect Orun Depp's prisons and Gorc being made into a sithspawn after the former squealed about the latter's Force-sensitivity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
