The addition of the Mon Calamari provided the Rebel Alliance with their first consistent source of large, powerful capital warships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rounded and organic in appearance, most MC80a cruisers were oblong cigar-shaped vessels. The surface of the cruisers were dotted in pods and bulges that contained sensor arrays, weapons batteries, deflector shield generators, and observation decks. Their thrusters were arranged with several on the ventral side close to the bow and several on the dorsal side close to the stern."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The MC80a Star Cruiser's role as the center of most Rebel Alliance fleet formations often pitted it against the larger and more powerful Imperial-class Star Destroyer, which, while unable to match the Star Destroyers in weaponry, was able to outlast in terms of defense due to triple layered shields, multiple redundant back-up shield generators, and double redundancy critical systems. These features, combined with a heavily armored hull and structural fortification, allowed an MC80a to absorb large amounts of damage while other fleet elements either fled or engaged enemy vessels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite this incredible defensive ability however, the MC80a required extensive pre and post battle maintenance. This task that was exceedingly difficult for resource strapped Alliance engineers especially due to the Mon Calamari penchant for artistry, aesthetics, and uniqueness of each ship: extensive time had to be given to understand each ships unique systems and operations before it could be repaired. This was eventually rectified in the standardized MC90 Star Cruiser design."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Subclasses"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While no two MC80 series vessels were exactly the same, most Star Cruisers shared a similar baseline level of protection, weaponry, and features. There were even subclasses among the designs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most MC80a cruisers measured approximately 1,200 meters in length and required a crew of roughly 5,400. A TriLuna 400 MGS Stardrive and Hyperdrive Motivator achieved a Class 1 hyperdrive rating, while a Serridge SEAL Shielding System provided up to 240 SBD in shield ratings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Weaponry was guided by a Plat Dromma targeting computer, and included 20 ArMek SW-7 ion cannon batteries, 6 front-mounted Phylon Q7 tractor beam projectors, and 48 Taim & Bak XV9 turbolaser batteries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "MC80a cruisers also included at least six starfighter bays and one auxiliary bay. These bays housed several shuttlecraft and freighters and six starfighter squadrons, which generally included one squadron of interceptors, two space superiority fighter squadrons, and three bomber squadrons. A light ground assault force was also common, which included a mixture of repulsor tanks, light assault vehicles, and 1,200 troops."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The standard fighter complement included one A-wing, two X-wings, and three Y-wing squadrons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A larger MC80a subclass was distinguished by a sleeker profile. They were 1,300 meters in length. The amount of crew was bigger than on other MC80a models, with 200 additional gunners operating the ship's weaponry. Each vessel carried 1,200 troops and three starfighter squadrons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another subclass, exemplified by the Naritus, had no dorsal thrusters, but instead what appeared to be a command pod near its stern."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 4 ABY, this starship was incorporated into the Alliance Fleet of the Rebel Alliance and was active during the Galactic Civil War. After a rescue on Tatooine for Han Solo, a contingent of Alliance starships converged for a high level meeting in order to establish the plan of attack against the second Death Star at Endor, and personnel met on Home One."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of these vessels was situated near Home One prior to the fleet's jump to Endor. The engagement erupted into the Battle of Endor which resulted in an Alliance victory, and at least six of the vessels survived the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The wingless Mon Calamari starship first appeared, albeit unidentified, in the 1983 Star Wars saga film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. While working on the film, Industrial Light & Magic model artists wanted to pad out the Rebel fleet, which was achieved by modifying their original wingless model into the Liberty type by adding wings and replacing one engine with another pod."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The information on MC80a cruisers is contradicting: some sources say it's a design found before the Battle of Yavin, while others say it was a New Republic design and therefore at least post-Battle of Endor. The text above is a combination of the information from both sources: the history is from pre-Yavin sources, the stats from post-Endor sources.
