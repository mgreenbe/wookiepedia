As such, the Chiss non-aggression protocols prohibited retaliation against the Lioaoin government. He hired the Pathfinder navigator Qilori of Uandualon to guide a convoy of three Chiss ships to the Lioaoin heartworld. At the Lioaoin heartworld, Thrawn purposely declared he had found the pirates in a trade language understandable to the Lioaoi, so they would know for certain that he was hunting pirates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn was aware of the Pathfinders' ability to track eachother through hyperspace, which was supposed to be a closely guarded secret. Thrawn used that knowledge to engage the Lioaoin pirates without violating the Ascendancy's Preemptive-strike laws. He had specifically hired a Pathfinder navigator because he knew from the \"style\" of Lioaoin pirate attacks that the pirates used Pathfinders to navigate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He and Qilori jumped through hyperspace to Kinoss, where four Lioaoin corsairs guided by Pathfinders soon followed to attack the apparently fleeing Chiss.

A chiss warship commanded by Mid Captain Ziara destroyed the corsairs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If Thrawn had been wrong and they would not be pursued by pirates through hyperspace, no harm would have been done as Thrawn had been piloting an unarmed freighter.
