Visz purchased it after several years of saving, and made extensive modifications to the ship thereafter. The Mirialan was highly attached to the Fleece, but lost the ship during a run to Corellia on behalf of Barrga the Hutt. During the run, Visz was incapacitated by Barrga's men, but managed to escape them before they were double-crossed by the Rendili Vehicle Corporation. Visz was left at the Rendili facility on Corellia when Barrga's men attempted to escape the planet with the Crimson Fleece, however, the ship was destroyed by explosive charges placed within the vessel by the Rendili Corporation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
