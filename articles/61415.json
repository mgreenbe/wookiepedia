However, as time went by, even the Ensterites abandoned High Tongue in favor of Galactic Basic Standard, which replaced Old Corellian some four thousand years before the Battle of Yavin. They, however, kept using High Tongue for Ensterite regular rites such as the Purging Days."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
