After the room lost interest in Solo and everyone returned to their drinks, an alien approached the brothers' table and began speaking with Prashee. The alien then left and Cratinus began laughing as Prashee moved a small pouch from his side of the table to Cratinus's side. Not long after this, many patrons of the castle flooded out into the courtyard to witness the destruction of the Hosnian system by the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon.

The pair then tried to stay in character during photo shoots and while on set in order to find their range, as they had little time to practice in front of a mirror.
