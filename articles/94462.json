Around 1 BBY, N'Mrith was the contact for Han Solo and Chewbacca who came to Formos to smuggle spice for Jabba Desilijic Tiure. Unfortunately, the pair had acquired the attention of the local commander, Colonel Quirt. N'Mrith was afraid of attracting Imperial attention, so he asked the two to meet him at Zord's Atmosphere Baths. At the baths, N'Mrith told the duo that they should avoid attracting undue attention and should lay low until he contacted them to load the spice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short while later, N'Mrith was approached by Colonel Quirt who revealed that he knew all about N'Mrith's illegal operation. Wishing to save his own skin, N'Mrith revealed Solo and Chewbacca to be smugglers. To avoid imprisonment, N'Mrith aided Quirt in setting up an ambush for the Millennium Falcon. Unfortunately for N'Mrith, Chewbacca dumped the spice when he sensed the trap, and Quirt's men had no evidence to imprison the pair. The absence of evidence caused Quirt to believe that N'Mrith was lying. Quirt imprisoned the alien on his Imperial prison ship, to be sent to the spice mines of Kessel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
