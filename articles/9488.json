The assassination occurred after an alliance between Lord Darzu and the Mecrosa had fallen apart. Despite their former connections with the Sith, the Mecrosa sought revenge against Darzu for her unwanted incursion in their territory. In addition, Darzu was betrayed by her own Sith followers, who somehow participated in her murder. Using poison, the Mecrosa ended the Dark Lord's life on Tython, a planet located in the Deep Core of the galaxy. The death of Lord Darzu sabotaged her army of technobeasts, the Metanecrons. The Sith were also left without a clear line of succession for a new holder of the Dark Lord mantle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
