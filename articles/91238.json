The Rebels were assaulted by six Imperial Army troopers armed with blaster pistols and grenades.

While exploring the temple, they encountered a native known as the Seer of the Temple, or The Swamp Seer, who first mistook them for Imperials.

The Rebels also learned about the Battle of Gap Nine and a group who inhabited the planet centuries before their time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The group heard the sound of speeder bikes and his in the temple. Two scout troopers emerged from the swamp and investigated the area. Failing to find the Rebels, they decided to inform Traft that they had found a new temple to raid.

The adventure presents the player characters with the option of either defending the temple (which would entail failure of the original mission) or refusing the defend the temple in order to resume their mission (which would entail that the temple is raided). Alternatively, the article suggests that the players can split up and simultaneously defend the temple and resume their original mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
