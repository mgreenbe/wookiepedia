He installed a cloaking device on the planet of Yalara to keep the entire world hidden and thus protect the indigenous primitive species, the Yalarans, whom he thought were not yet prepared to be integrated into the galaxy. In 14 ABY, Jedi Knight Jaden Korr discovered that Noghri commandos had killed the Yalarans guarding the device. Thus, the Disciples of Ragnos, a cult attempting to return the dead Sith Lord Marka Ragnos to life, discovered the cloaking device. The young Human Jedi destroyed Verdox's device to prevent the cult from gaining access to the powerful item."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Broden Kel Verdox was first mentioned in the video game Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, first released on September 16, 2003."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
