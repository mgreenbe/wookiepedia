Initially in the possession of the Eye of Webbish Bog on Mustafar, the Eye gave the device to the Sith Lord Darth Vader after meeting him. At some point after Vader used the device, having sought to learn what his Sith Master, Darth Sidious, was doing on Exegol, Vader returned to Mustafar and tasked the Eye with protecting the Wayfinder. Decades later, the Alazmec of Winsit guarded it at the Fortress Vader ruins in Corvax Fen, but Vader's grandson, Kylo Ren, led an assault on the Sith cultists there to obtain the wayfinder. After the Eye gave him the device, he used it to make his way to the Sith world of Exegol, where Vader's former master, Darth Sidious, awaited alongside the Sith Eternal cult, preparing for the launch of their Final Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
