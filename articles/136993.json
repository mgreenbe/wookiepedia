However the plan was thwarted by the timely arrival of Jedi Ahsoka Tano and four students from the Royal Academy of Government, Amis, Lagos, Soniee and Satine's nephew, Korkie Kryze who rescued the Duchess. After a brief fight, Almec and his guards were arrested and Almec was then imprisoned for his crimes against the Duchess and his involvement in the conspiracy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Darth Maul and Savage Opress took over Mandalore, Pre Vizsla arrested Duchess Satine Kryze and she was imprisoned in her own prison in a cell beside that of former Prime Minister Almec. Soon after Vizsla betrayed Maul and Opress and had them imprisoned so he could rule Mandalore himself. Soon, Maul and Opress escaped the prison and freed Almec, after a lengthy conversation, so he could be a puppet leader for them. The trio then left the prison and and Maul killed Vizsla in return for his earlier betrayal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Maul took control, Satine was rescued twice from the prison. The first time Korkie and Bo-Katan Kryze entered the prison and freed Satine, killing at least two Mandalorian super commandos in the process. They made their getaway with the help of Korkie's friends and the loyalists to Bo-Katan in the Death Watch. They were able to take the Duchess out of the city, and she was able to send a distress message to Obi-Wan Kenobi, but ultimately she was recaptured and imprisoned. Kenobi later came to Sundari and helped the Duchess escape a second time. He disguised himself in the armor that he had taken from a super commando, and took Satine out of the prison under the guise of a prisoner transfer. They too were stopped before they could leave the planet, however, and this time Maul killed the Duchess in front of Kenobi. Kenobi was to be imprisoned, when when he arrived at the prison, he was freed by Bo-Katan and her forces, sparking the Battle of Sundari."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
