The Republic's Venator-class Star Destroyer also sustained heavy damaged and crashed on Zeffo after exiting hyperspace although there were survivors. Jedi General Chiata became separated from her Padawan, Jedi Commander Marseph during the crash. Shortly after the Star Destroyer crashed on Zeffo, the Republic crew began searching for Marseph but the Clone Commander received Order 66, which resulted in a skirmish on Zeffo between clone troopers and the Jedi. Eventually, all clone forces were killed, and Chiata and Marseph eventually died of their wounds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY, the Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis explored Zeffo and found the crashed Venator, learning of Chiata and her clones' fate through the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
