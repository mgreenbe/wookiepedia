Even before their planet was unified, their nations possessed strong militaries; after their unification 700 years before the Galactic Civil War, these militaries were merged into the Iotran Police Force (IPF), which enforced law and provided emergency services on Iotra and throughout the Iotran Expanse. The eight top-ranking leaders of the IPF formed the Joint Council, which acted as parliament for Iotra."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From an early age, Iotrans were trained for military service, and in their fourteenth season, (approximately 18 standard years of age) they were inducted into the IPF for approximately six standard years.
