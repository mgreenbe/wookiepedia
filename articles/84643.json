The class had its main reactor located on the ventral side of the vessel, while its bridge was located on the dorsal side, amidship. Hangar bays were located on the flanks of the ship."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Offensive and defensive systems"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An interim design, the MC80B was an improvement over the original MC80. The MC80B had a much more heavily reinforced hull, and featured multiple backup deflector shield generators resulting in superior shielding. Spread across the hull were turbolaser and shield projector blisters. A sensor cluster was located at the tip of the bow. Built for durability, these ships were able to withstand heavy damage while blasting through the more limited shielding of Imperial ships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The MC80B was armed with forty-eight turbolasers and twenty ion cannons. These weapons were linked in banks of twelve and four respectively, allowing the MC80B to easily concentrate its fire upon a single target.
