Unlike other serums such as Bavo Six, OV600 acted physically upon the victim, rather than mentally. When the serum detected the symptoms of lie-telling, it caused the victim's flesh to break out in a painful rash. The serum was powerful enough to cause death in severe cases."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
