Known to the wider galaxy by the Ruusan Reformation of 1000 BBY, Protogeyser was the homeworld of the fractal urchins, a non-sentient species that lacked cellular structures and thus midi-chlorians, life-forms that lived symbiotically inside cells and allowed their symbiont to detect the Force. This distinction earned the fractal urchins, along with their home planet, a mention in the \"Galactic Bestiary\" section of the Jedi trainee guidebook The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, where the Jedi biologist Bowspritz used the species as an example of animals that were connected to the Force despite their lack of midi-chlorians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Created by author Daniel Wallace, Protogeyser was first mentioned in the 2010 reference book The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force.
