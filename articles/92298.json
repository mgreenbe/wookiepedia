She was cruel and ruthless, not caring if she had to take away innocent lives to get her prey, nor did she care if she brought back her prey dead or alive. Mol and five other bounty hunters were hired by Granta Omega to capture Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker for a large sum of money. She first attacked them with a cruiser on Ragoon-6, but the Jedi destroyed her cruiser and Mol was sent packing hastily on her swoop bike. She did not attack again, however, for Mol knew not to mess with her prey if her first attack failed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
