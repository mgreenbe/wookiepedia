It was armed with two laser cannons that fired red laser bolts. The ship's cockpit was square with open angular windows, unlike the cockpit-windows on regular TIE-series fighters and transports. The solar gathering panels carried the cannons, similar to the panels on the TIE/IN interceptor. The ship had one thruster which glowed with a yellow light, unlike the colorless exhaust on most TIE models."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid bounty hunter used the IG-1000 in the year 15 BBY.
