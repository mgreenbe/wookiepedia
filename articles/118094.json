When the exchangees turned 16, they would return home, to prevent an attack from the corresponding planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two worlds were almost thrown into war once when Rutan's King Frane's firstborn son, Leed, chose to stay on Senali instead of returning to his birthplace on Rutan. King Frane, convinced his son was being brainwashed, threatened to declare war on Meenon, leader of Senali. Instead, he called upon two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi, to come and return his son to him. The two Jedi eventually found a way to avoid another battle, and Leed's younger brother Taroon turned out to have a wish to rule, despite his father's ignorance. He became King after Frane."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pirate raids on the trade route were stopped by the Galactic Empire by 18 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet was attacked by Nagai invaders in 4 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Yuuzhan Vong War, over a year prior to 28 ABY, Rutan and Senali were politically divided by the Peace Brigade.
