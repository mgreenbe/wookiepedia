In 3639 BBY it became the epicenter of the Tion Hegemony rakghoul outbreak on Kaon. Doctor Sannus Lorrick hired a spacer named Melarra to make a delivery to Kaon, which secretly consisted of Rakghouls. As soon as the shuttle touched down, rakghouls burst pouring out of its cargo hold and began spreading the Rakghoul plague, leading to eventual quarantine of Kaon. Melarra herself was able to avoid being infected and hid inside the spaceport for days, until she was eventually discovered by an off-world strike team and provided them with the location of Lorrick's base on Ord Mantell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kaon City Spaceport appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the \"Kaon Under Siege\" flashpoint."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
