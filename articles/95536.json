She was portrayed by Kate Fleetwood, who was credited only as \"First Order Officer\", with the character's name first being revealed as Unamo in the reference book Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released in conjunction with the film. The character was then given the first name Nastia by author Adam Bray in the 2019 reference book Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition. The name Unamo reminded Bray of Russian expatriates that he had known while in Vietnam, and so he chose his favorite Russian woman's name, Nastia, enjoying the fact that it also appropriately sounded like the word \"nasty\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
