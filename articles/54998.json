Called \"The Bright Center to the Galaxy\" in its promotions, the Dome employed over 500 individual holoprojectors to create dazzling illusions, and its audio system was so extensive that it required four droid brains and one sentient operator to function. The Glow Dome's dance floor, called the \"Turntable,\" spun just rapidly enough to disorient unwary dancers. The Corellian sisters Corinna and Kandria A'Daasha were the Glow Dome's proprietors, and it also hosted the Sullustan scientist Dr. Lytos Urtell. Among the Dome's frequent visitors was the dangerous bounty hunter Vallikor En-Vahdi. The Derriphan Ziakas also stalked the Dome's premises, secretly searching for a host; it inhabited Kandria A'Daasha at one time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prices at the Glow Dome"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
