Kiera Swan also used this weapon in the Box.

Fett modified his by adding a stock and an electronic scope for distance shooting, making it a dangerous weapon. Prince Xizor also used an EE-3 to try to kill Luke Skywalker as the Jedi and his friends escaped the Falleen's palace on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: Battlefront II, the rifle discharges a three-round burst.

To make it into the weapon of an intergalactic bounty hunter, prop makers added a rifle scope, some detail parts to the stock and either an MPP Microflash or Heiland Synchronar flash unit protruding from the end of the barrel.

Presumably this was because the prop would be featured prominently in the skiff battle scenes where Luke Skywalker slices it in half with his lightsaber. The Heiland flash unit was gone and a beefier barrel with ribbed hand grips was built over the existing flare gun barrel. The same scope was used, but for some reason it was mounted pointing in the opposite direction from the Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back version. The scope was also mounted farther back on the gun and slightly lower. The blocky detail parts on the scope mounts were also eliminated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
