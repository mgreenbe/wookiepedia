These helmets were fitted with mental receptivity enhancers, to help the clones process the massive amounts of data they received daily. Broadcast signal receivers allowed Kaminoan overseers to transmit data directly into the helmets, which were synchronized to the wearer's biorhythm. Side-mounted earphones served to silence external sounds, providing an isolated audio environment in which the clone could concentrate on his learning. As these helmets were durable plastoid constructs, they could be worn during combat exercises."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
