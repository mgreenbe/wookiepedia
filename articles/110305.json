The Bureau had ordered thousands of RA-7s from Arakyd and installed special programming in the droids to use them as spies. Almost no one would willingly buy an RA-7 as an assistant\u2014so the ISB gave them away as gifts. As those targeted by the droids began to uncover hidden recording devices and surveillance equipment in the nigh-useless droids, they began to hide, misplace or lose them to avoid attention and branding as traitors for spurning a gift from the Emperor. This often led them to be found in junk shops, droid auctions, or swap meets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A number of RA-7 droids were used aboard Star Destroyers to monitor medical equipment, such as life support capsules."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A combination of the destruction of the majority of their droids and the detection of their program caused the Bureau to cancel the RA-7 droid surveillance initiative shortly after 1 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Ominous nickname"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the first Death Star came online, the Bureau grew concerned that Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin would attempt to use the superweapon to overthrow the Empire.
