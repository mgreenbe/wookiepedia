It was designed to offer security and protection to anyone who could afford it. Unlike the 501-Z, it had simplified programming structure and reduced combat capabilities, but was significantly cheaper, allowing one to build an effective security force without hiring living individuals. They had large, red-hued frames and a blaster cannon built-in to each arm, unlike the 501-Z, which had hands with fingers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Criminals, particularly crime lords, tended to use the Z65 model.
