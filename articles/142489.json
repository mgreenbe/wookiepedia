McQuarrie is the artist who originates most of the designs for droids, ships, sets, aliens, and just about everything else in the Star Wars universe. This box set contains an interview with McQuarrie in a small, full-color booklet, along with 15 amazing postcards and 6 collectible postage stamps featuring concept paintings for the movies. Highlights are the great cantina scene, with Sy Snootles singing her heart (or hearts) out, the original Darth Vader concept sketch, and production paintings of C-3PO and R2-D2 and the epic lightsaber battle between Luke and Vader. A great gift for a Star Wars fan or collector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
