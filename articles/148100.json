A simple design, it carried light armor plating, a retractable transparisteel blast shield protecting the crew compartment, and dual fire-linked laser cannons with a range of 600 meters. While not competitive with other front-line military airspeeders used by the Imperials or Rebel Alliance, it was more than adequate for dealing with civil unrest on Bakura."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
