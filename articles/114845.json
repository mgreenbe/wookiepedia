They could be fitted to droids and prohibited their movement. The collar, typically toroidal in shape, would fit around the legs of a droid and, in the case of wheeled droids, held their weight off the floor to prevent the wheels gaining traction. Restraint collars were also used to keep control of slaves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
