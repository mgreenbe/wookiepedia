Based upon Anakin Skywalker's alterations to R4-P17, they were modified by Kuat Systems Engineering to feature the dome of an R2-series astromech droid in place of the conical head of an R4 unit, creating what was essentially a hybrid of the two models. As a result, the R4-P could store up to ten sets of hyperspace jump coordinates in its memory, rather than the single jump of a standard R4 unit. When the Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor gained popularity, many R4-Ps were retrofitted with standard-sized astromech bodies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
