Surviving the destruction of their homeworld, many fyrnocks inhabited the resulting Anaxes asteroid belt, including the asteroid PM-1203, which contained Fort Anaxes, a military base used by the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Fyrnocks were hurt by sunlight and could only live under the cover of darkness, in which they became fierce predators. However, they were immune to lights that were not solar-based. Fyrnocks were typically the size of a small humanoid, but at least one was known to grow much larger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Anaxes, fyrnocks prowled around a campfire set up by Clone Force 99, CT-7567 \"Rex,\" CC-2224 \"Cody,\" CT-5597 \"Jesse,\" and CT-6116 \"Kix.\" Many years after the Clone Wars and the planet's destruction, Hera Syndulla and Sabine Wren encountered fyrnocks in the abandoned Fort Anaxes. Later, Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus and his apprentice Ezra Bridger returned to Fort Anaxes, hoping to lure the Grand Inquisitor into a trap. Using the Force, they were able to convince the Fyrnocks to attack the Inquisitor and his Imperial stormtroopers.
