They required ten legs to support their bulk. Despite their size, greater krayts were rarely encountered because they spent long periods of time literally swimming through the sand. Greater krayts were known to actually prey upon sarlaccs (a rare treat), though they more commonly hunted banthas. Similar to their smaller kin, the greater krayt dragon developed pearls inside their gizzard, called Krayt dragon pearls. However, these were much larger and more valuable than standard krayt dragon pearls."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the video game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed on Imperial Kashyyyk, in Ozzik Sturn's private quarters, there is a greater krayt dragon head mounted on the wall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
