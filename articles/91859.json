Regarded by many as the best military strategist in the navy, he rose to a position of power despite the Empire's strict speciesist policies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn hailed from Csilla, and began his career as an officer in the Defense Force of the Chiss Ascendancy in the Unknown Regions, where he demonstrated his ruthless commitment to eradicating threats to the Ascendancy. These early threats included an advance force of scouts of the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong species, though at that point the Chiss knew them only as the \"Far Outsiders\". However, many of Thrawn's ways were contrary to that of Chiss society, which rejected offensive and preventive strikes. In 27 BBY, he first met the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who held a secret double identity as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine of the Galactic Republic, after having destroyed part of Sidious's private task force. However, they both agreed with the threat posed by the Unknown Regions, most notably by the Far Outsiders. The two sealed their informal agreement when Thrawn destroyed the Republic exploration ship Outbound Flight lest it draw the Far Outsiders toward the Republic, killing many members of the Jedi Order in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn's continued preventive strikes led the Chiss to exile him on an uninhabited world far in the fringes of the Chiss Ascendancy. In 19 BBY, soon after Palpatine reformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire, Imperial Navy officer Voss Parck encountered Thrawn in the Unknown Regions and brought him to Emperor Palpatine. Already aware of Thrawn's command skills, Palpatine approved his admission to the Imperial Navy. Over time, Thrawn climbed the Imperial ladder, believing that he could better defend against the threat of the oncoming Yuuzhan Vong as an Imperial officer than if he returned to the Chiss, and circa 2 ABY became the thirteenth Grand Admiral in the Imperial Navy. The Chiss officer fought both the Rebel Alliance and rogue Imperial officers. Simultaneously, he pacified the Unknown Regions and established a secret empire of his own, believing that only a strong military government could protect the galaxy's diverse species from annihilating each other, and to serve as a bulwark against the Yuuzhan Vong."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Grand Admiral remained in the Unknown Regions around the time of the Battle of Endor, which saw the death of Palpatine and the subsequent breakdown of the Empire under rival warlords. He returned in 8 ABY to take control of the remaining Imperial forces and crush the New Republic, the successor state to the Alliance. Although the Grand Admiral was able to deal the New Republic several mighty blows in a massive campaign the following year, his unexpected death prevented him from destroying the fledgling government. Thrawn perished in the Battle of Bilbringi at the hand of Rukh, his Noghri bodyguard, who had recently learned that the Empire had betrayed his people. Even though his death led to the further fragmentation of the Empire, Thrawn left behind several clones of himself and an empire still unknown to the New Republic in preparation for yet-unknown threats to the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Origins"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mitth'raw'nuruodo was born on the planet Csilla during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. His species, the Chiss, controlled an area of space in the part of the galaxy known to those in the Republic as the Unknown Regions. He and his brother, Mitth'ras'safis, were born as commoners but, after joining the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force, Mitth'raw'nuruodo was taken as a merit adoptive in the Eighth Ruling Family of Chiss society. Mitth'ras'safis also joined the Eight Ruling Family, eventually becoming a Syndic within the family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the practice of military officers becoming merit adoptives in the Ruling Families, and taking on the colors of their adoptive family, was common, they usually ceased belonging to the family upon leaving the military. Mitth'raw'nuruodo, however, soon reached the rank of commander\u2014the youngest Chiss ever to achieve the rank\u2014and impressed the Eighth Ruling Family enough during his early career to be considered a trial-born, with the possibility of becoming a permanent member of the family. His work with the Expansionary Defense Force gave him the opportunity to learn to speak several languages used throughout the Unknown Regions, including the trade languages Sy Bisti and Minnisiat, in addition to his native Cheunh."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "First contact"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 27 BBY, Mitth'raw'nuruodo was the commanding officer of Picket Force Two, a small border patrol fleet based out of an asteroid in the Crustai system on the Chiss Ascendancy's frontier. He was tasked with overseeing the surveying of the system and anticipated that the second planet would be home to a Chiss colony within a few years. While out on patrol, his picket force came across a skirmish between two unknown ships. Deciding to intervene, Mitth'raw'nuruodo ordered his forces to fire Conner nets at both ships to disable them. While the first, a Corellian light freighter called the Bargain Hunter, was disabled easily, its pursuer, a vessel under the command of Progga the Hutt, opened fire on the Chiss vessels. Within six minutes the Hutt vessel was destroyed and Mitth'raw'nuruodo had his starfighters escort the Corellian ship to his flagship, the Springhawk, while his forces began examining the wreckage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After landing on the Springhawk, the crew of the Bargain Hunter, the Humans Captain Dubrak Qennto, Maris Ferasi and Jorj Car'das, were taken to Mitth'raw'nuruodo. With no previous recorded contact between the Chiss and Humans, neither group could understand the other's native language, but soon discovered a common ability to speak Sy Bisti\u2014switching to the trade language, Mitth'raw'nuruodo began questioning the Humans as to their purpose in that region. The group explained that they were traders from Corellia, who were delivering a cargo of luxury clothing when they were pursued into the Unknown Regions by pirates, and thanked Mitth'raw'nuruodo for rescuing them. However, the commander explained that, before he could release them, he needed to examine their ship and confirm that they were telling the truth and not scouts for a potential threat to the Chiss. Until he was satisfied, he was taking them back to Crustai. He then dismissed the group, having them escorted to guest quarters for the duration of the journey back to his base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During their initial meeting, Mitth'raw'nuruodo was intrigued by Car'das. The young Corellian spent his time looking around him, curious about his surroundings\u2014a trait that Mitth'raw'nuruodo prized in others. When analysis of the Bargain Hunter suggested it was too small to cover the running costs by simply delivering cargo and too poorly armed to be a pirate vessel, Mitth'raw'nuruodo concluded that the Humans were smugglers. His suspicions were confirmed by the firegems hidden in their shipment of clothing but the commander decided to question Car'das on their true mission to determine whether he could trust the group. He summoned Car'das alone to meet with him and questioned him further. After Car'das admitted that they were smuggling the gems to avoid the customs fees associated with them, Mitth'raw'nuruodo explained that he was curious about the Humans and wanted their company for a while to learn more of their language and culture. In exchange for teaching him Galactic Basic Standard, Mitth'raw'nuruodo would satisfy Car'das's own curiosity by teaching him and Maris Cheunh. Most of the time the three studied together, but later on Car'das found out that Maris had secret separate lessons with the Commander as well. Since Thrawn had noticed that the Humans struggled to pronounce his name, he would also teach them the easier Minnisiat and suggested that they call him by his core name, Thrawn. As a prolonged stay at Crustai would delay delivery of their cargo, Thrawn also agreed to give them some valuables to offset any lateness penalties."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Vagaari"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Springhawk arrived back at Crustai base three days later, but as it was preparing to dock, the ship received a warning from a sentry vessel about a small group of Vagaari starships not far from the Chiss base. The Vagaari were pirates and slavers who had been moving through the region for ten years, raiding the weaker species they encountered. Since they'd never moved against the Chiss, Thrawn had not previously had any reason to engage them. With the Vagaari so close to Crustai, however, Thrawn ordered a micro-jump, taking the Springhawk into hyperspace and emerging near the intruders; two starfighters escorting a larger Vagaari vessel whose hyperdrive had already been disabled by the Chiss sentry. The Vagaari vessel turned to run, while its fighter escort moved against the Springhawk. When the fighters were quickly destroyed, the Vagaari opened fire on their Chiss pursuers. Their attacks followed a consistent pattern, which Thrawn was easily able to counteract, and the commander concluded that they were undermanned and not prepared for a fight\u2014he decided that he would personally lead a boarding party to the Vagaari ship. Guided through the enemy ship by the Springhawk's sensors, Thrawn's boarding party secured the vessel within half an hour and he ordered the ship taken back to his base for study."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn returned to Crustai base during a routine survey by Aristocra Chaf'orm'bintrano of the Chiss's Fifth Ruling Family. Thrawn went to greet the Aristocra, taking the Humans with him, but having them escorted to guest quarters when the other Chiss showed no interest in talking to the aliens. Chaf'orm'bintrano was uneasy with the presence of the Humans, who he considered a potential threat, and also expressed his displeasure with Thrawn's attack on the Vagaari ship. The Chiss believed that preemptive strikes were immoral and that the Vagaari should be left alone until they actually moved against the Chiss. Thrawn, however, was unwilling to sit idly by while the Vagaari preyed on others. Emphasizing his point, he informed the Aristocra of the treasure his troops had found on the Vagaari vessel, items looted from worlds throughout the region. This was not enough to sway the other Chiss and Chaf'orm'bintrano left, still displeased with Thrawn's actions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn later returned to the Vagaari ship, taking the Humans with him. He was curious whether they might recognize any of the artifacts aboard as coming from Republic space and wanted Qennto to pick some items for them to take as compensation for the delay, in turn establishing which artifacts were valuable. The group quickly identified some Frunchettan-sai art from the Outer Rim Territories, along with some Pashv art from Wild Space, and were impressed when Thrawn was able to describe both species, simply by observing their artwork. Thrawn continued to learn more of the Republic from the Humans, including knowledge of droids and the Jedi, both concepts previously unheard of by the Chiss. In language lessons with both Car'das and Ferasi, who, by now, had developed a serious crush on the Commander, Thrawn quickly took to Basic and, in turn, was impressed by the pair's progress with Minnisiat and Cheunh."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In time, Crustai received more visitors\u2014Admiral Ar'alani of the Defense Hierarchy arrived to take possession of the captured Vagaari vessel, bringing Mitth'ras'safis along as a favor to the Eigth Ruling Family. Thrawn went to meet the admiral and his brother as they arrived, taking Car'das and Ferasi with him. Ar'alani was uncomfortable with the Humans in Crustai base, but Thrawn assured her that they were kept under constant surveillance and that he was learning much about them. He was soon given a report of a Vagaari attack in progress and needed to distract Ar'alani while he investigated. He took the visitors on a tour of the captured Vagaari ship, eventually reaching the treasure room where Qennto was working. Ar'alani was suspicious of Qennto and insisted that she and Mitth'ras'safis take their own inventory of the treasure, providing Thrawn with the distraction he needed. He made his excuses and departed with the Humans, though he expected to be disciplined upon his return."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn's intention was simply to observe the Vagaari and to only attack if he deemed them a sufficient threat to the Chiss. He therefore took Car'das and Ferasi along as independent witnesses. The Springhawk emerged from hyperspace in a safe area outside the battlezone. They soon observed around 200 ships of varying size involved in the battle, with a further 100 Vagaari vessels waiting on the other side of the nearby planet. Thrawn realized that the waiting ships were civilian, indicating that the Vagaari were a nomadic species and not simple pirates\u2014unless they were all destroyed at once, they would simply escape into hyperspace and regroup. As he continued to observe the battle, Thrawn realized that the Vagaari were using a number of gravity well projectors to prevent their victims escaping and decided to capture one of the vessels. He ordered his starfighters to jump to hyperspace on a course that took them through the target's gravity well, bringing them back to normal space near their objective. The Chiss fighters cleared the immediate area of any enemy vessels before Thrawn took the Springhawk to join them. An assault team was sent to the projector to neutralize the crew, before Thrawn charged an engineering team with finding a way to secure it for transport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the engineers worked, Thrawn's forces moved to engage the approaching Vagaari defenders. A close look at the Vagaari warships revealed bubbles located around the hull\u2014'living shields'\u2014each containing a prisoner to discourage their enemies from attacking the ship. Knowing that the prisoners were already effectively dead, Thrawn ordered his forces to continue their attack but vowed to find a way to stop the Vagaari before more sentients could suffer the same fate. During the battle, the Springhawk's bridge was struck by Vagaari fire, causing a hull breach. Though the crew were already wearing enviro-suits, Thrawn's sustained a tear and the commander was knocked unconscious in the explosion. Maris Ferasi attempted unsuccessfully to patch the hole, before lying across him to prevent the air escaping. Chiss medics soon arrived and patched the suit, before taking Thrawn to the medical bay as the Springhawk fled to hyperspace. The Chiss engineers had succeeded in capturing the gravity well projector, which was later installed in the cruiser Whirlwind. Thrawn spent two hours undergoing medical treatment before he summoned the Humans to see him and thanked them for their efforts. He also told the pair that he hoped the Vagaari would be angry enough to attack the Chiss in retribution, giving his people the excuse to eliminate the Vagaari threat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Springhawk returned to Crustai to find that Ar'alani had confiscated the treasure and taken Qennto into custody before leaving. Thrawn released Qennto but informed the Humans that he would be unable to release the treasure until Ar'alani returned to present her case against him. While he spoke to the Humans and expressed his gratitude to Maris for saving his life, Thrawn was also visited by his brother, who had remained at Crustai. With four dead in the recent engagement, Mitth'ras'safis had no choice but to report the incident to the Ruling Families. He would try to portray it as a reconnaissance mission to protect his brother, but warned that the Eighth Ruling Family would disown the commander before they let him damage their reputation. Thrawn, however, was unwilling to turn his back while others suffered, though he would do everything he could to prevent his brother from sharing his fate."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Outbound Flight"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several days later, Thrawn's scouts reported a fleet of unknown vessels nearby and the commander took a group of twelve Chiss ships to investigate. Since the ships were unfamiliar to the Chiss, he also took Car'das in the hopes that the Human could identify them. Upon seeing the unknown fleet, Thrawn noticed hull markings similar to those on the Bargain Hunter, and Car'das confirmed that the ships belonged to the Trade Federation, but was unable to shed any light on their presence. Thrawn hailed the Trade Federation fleet in Basic, hoping to gauge their reactions\u2014there was no response and Thrawn repeated his message for ten minutes before he was contacted by the task force's commander, who introduced himself as Commander Stratis. Stratis assured Thrawn that his forces meant the Chiss no harm, but was unwilling to reveal the nature of their mission. While the two commanders talked, the Trade Federation's Lucrehulk-class battleship Keeper launched droid starfighters to engage the Chiss. Car'das informed Thrawn that the incoming ships were remotely controlled, so Thrawn had his communications officer locate their control frequency before pulling his ships back to just outside the signal's maximum range. While the Whirlwind stayed at a safe distance, using its gravity well projector to keep the enemy from escaping, Thrawn sent a single starfighter to probe the enemy lines, observing the control signals sent to the enemy starfighters as they responded. After spotting a pattern, he was able to replicate the signal, drawing many droid fighters away from the Trade Federation fleet and moving the Springhawk into the resulting gap in the enemy formation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As more droid fighters moved to attack, Thrawn had his fighters launch a single missile each, followed by a Conner net. The droids reacted to the incoming missiles, shooting them down only to be disabled by the shock nets. Vicelord Siv Kav, overseeing the battle from the Lucrehulk-class battleship Darkvenge responded by launching yet more fighters, only for Thrawn to initiate full spectrum jamming to disrupt the control signal. Thrawn's forces were able to cut through the fighters and the thirteen smaller capital ships of the fleet and soon only the Darkvenge and the Keeper remained. When the signal disruption to the droid starfighters still in the Keeper's hangar caused them to auto destruct, destroying the vessel, Dorianna ordered Kav to power down the Darkvenge and surrendered to Thrawn. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, Thrawn's fleet had emerged victorious without any casualties."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn boarded the captured Darkvenge, escorted by Car'das and two of his soldiers, and was met by Kav and Stratis on the bridge. Kav threatened the Chiss commander with a pair of droidekas but Thrawn responded calmly, thanking him for the demonstration and ordering him to send the droids away. After Kav reluctantly obeyed, Stratis explained that they were waiting to destroy Outbound Flight, six Dreadnaught-class heavy cruisers mounted around a central fuselage, which were carrying, among others, a group of Jedi Masters on a mission to explore beyond the edge of the galaxy. He claimed that the Jedi were troublemakers who not only posed a threat to the Republic, but would also attempt to impose their will on the Chiss. Thrawn listened to Stratis's claims, aware that the Human was hoping to persuade him to destroy Outbound Flight for them, then returned to his ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leaving the Keeper to guard the Darkvenge, Thrawn took the Springhawk back to Crustai to meet the returning Admiral Ar'alani. The admiral had recently led Chiss forces to victory in battles at Vun'Hanna and the Twilight Void against a small alien force at the edge of Chiss space. Unknown to the Chiss, this was in fact an advance reconnaissance force of the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong species. Despite outnumbering the invaders, the battle had been extremely costly for the Chiss, and Ar'alani had come to investigate whether the Trade Federation forces belonged to the same group. Though it was soon clear that the groups were unconnected, the admiral was concerned about the prospect of fighting wars on multiple fronts and agreed to look the other way while Thrawn quickly eliminated the Vagaari threat. She dispatched him on a security sweep of nearby systems while she conducted an apparent investigation into his latest act of aggression. Thrawn took the Springhawk to rendezvous with the Darkvenge two days after its capture. He had devised a plan to use the Trade Federation forces against the Vagaari and to deal with Outbound Flight at the same time, but would only implement it if Stratis told him the full story of their mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With little alternative, Stratis told Thrawn that he was really Kinman Doriana, an adviser to Palpatine, who was both Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and secretly the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious. He claimed that Sidious had information that a group known only as the \"Far Outsiders\" were massing an invasion force at the edge of the galaxy and was trying to strengthen the Republic against the threat. If Outbound Flight were intercepted by the Far Outsiders, it could lead them back to the Republic, so Sidious had reached the conclusion that Outbound Flight must be destroyed. To confirm his story, he contacted Darth Sidious by hologram, explaining the situation and introducing Thrawn to the Sith Lord. Sidious was impressed by Thrawn's destruction of his task force and told Doriana to provide Thrawn with their reports on the Far-Outsiders and the technical date on Outbound Flight. He also warned Thrawn to be aware of the Jedi's ability to use the Force against him, though he informed the commander that a high loss of life would dull their senses. Thrawn, realizing that the Far Outsiders were the same force that Ar'alani had encountered and aware of the damage their biotechnology weapons could do, agreed to review the data and to stop Outbound Flight. He immediately put his plan into motion, ordering the Darkvenge's crew to begin unloading their droid starfighters to a nearby asteroid and to assist his forces in reprogramming them for close-approach attacks. Twenty of the starfighters were linked into pairs with a spare fuel tank between them, in which explosives were placed. With the preparations under way, Thrawn departed, taking two droidekas, and four battle droids with him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this time, Thrawn approached Car'das to assist in his plan. Thrawn told Car'das to steal the shuttle holding the battle droids and to contact the Vagaari to offer them a deal\u2014the battle droids and Thrawn's location, in exchange for their freedom and some treasure to take back to the Republic. When the Vagaari came after Thrawn, he would be provided with the justification to destroy them. To ensure that Car'das's actions looked like those of a desperate man, Thrawn publicly accused him of being a traitor, leading Ar'alani to confine him to quarters. After Car'das set out on his mission, Thrawn took his forces to a point intersecting Outbound Flight's course and the course the Vagaari would take between their last known location and Thrawn's base. There, he had the Whirlwind activate its gravity well projector and waited."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Destruction of Outbound Flight"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Outbound Flight eventually arrived, later than expected. Kav, present with Doriana on the bridge of the Springhawk, was eager to attack but Thrawn still hoped to resolve the situation peacefully. He hailed Outbound Flight every five minutes for half an hour, finally getting a response from Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth, the leader of the expedition, who agreed to let Thrawn board his ship to talk. Aboard Outbound Flight, Thrawn was met by C'baoth and his former Padawan Lorana Jinzler. Thrawn was forthcoming, informing the pair about Darth Sidious and the Far-Outsiders. When C'baoth refused to either turn back to the Republic or adjust his course to bypass Chiss space, Thrawn gave him one hour to reconsider, or he would be forced to destroy Outbound Flight. Thrawn was escorted back to his shuttle by Jinzler. When several of Outbound Flight's colonists attempted to approach the commander, to voice their concerns about C'baoth's leadership, C'baoth used the Force to prevent them talking to him, and Thrawn left unaware of the internal conflict aboard the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Thrawn waited for C'baoth's final decision, a Vagaari fleet of over 200 ships was pulled out of hyperspace by the Whirlwind. As Thrawn had hoped, the Vagaari decided to capture Outbound Flight on Car'das's assurance that it was carrying thousands of droids. The Jedi aboard Outbound Flight moved to defend themselves against the new threat, using the Force to numb the minds of their enemies while they moved close enough to shoot without hitting the slave bubbles. The distraction provided Thrawn with the opportunity he needed. He ordered the launch of the droid starfighters, their modified programming making them attack from close range to avoid killing the slaves. At the same time, he activated the battle droids Car'das had presented to the Vagaari and the droids began to kill the Vagaari leaders from within their flagship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vagaari were quickly decimated and the Jedi, taken unawares by the sudden loss of life they sensed, became disoriented. Thrawn moved his forces towards Outbound Flight and initiated a surgical strike at their weapons and shield generators. Once the vessel was defenseless, Thrawn withdrew and offered them one more chance to withdraw. He was soon contacted by C'baoth, but the Jedi Master refused to surrender and, instead, used the Force to choke him. The Springhawk's bridge crew rushed to their commander's side but were unable to halt the unseen attack. Doriana, however, acted quickly, using Thrawn's control board to redirect the droid starfighters to attack Outbound Flight. The droids followed Thrawn's programmed battle plan, striking at specific points to open the ship's hull. Those which had been modified to work in pairs then flew into the hull breaches and detonated the contents of their extra fuel tanks, unleashing a wave of radiation that killed all those aboard the six outer Dreadnaughts. With C'baoth dead, his grip on Thrawn was released."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Thrawn was not happy with the outcome of the battle. Not only had he hoped to spare Outbound Flight, but the droid starfighters had been intended for use against the Vagaari and their reassignment had allowed the surviving Vagaari to flee beyond the gravity well and into hyperspace, allowing them to regroup and eventually return to once more threaten the Chiss. Nevertheless, he accompanied his forces as they began boarding the damaged Vagaari vessels to free the slaves, retrieving Car'das in the process. Ar'alani and Mitth'ras'safis soon arrived with more ships to take the freed slaves to their homeworlds, and the new arrivals joined Thrawn during an inspection of Outbound Flight. Thrawn's brother was annoyed at being manipulated, but agreed that the galaxy was better off without the Vagaari. However, he warned that Chaf'orm'bintrano was on his way with vessels of the Fifth Ruling Family and may see things differently. Thrawn suspected that the Fifth Family were attempting to take control of the remains of the Vagaari fleet and was concerned that they may also seize Outbound Flight. Though any such claim to the ship would be contested, the Fifth Ruling Family would be able to learn from its technology and threaten the delicate balance of power between the Ruling Families. To prevent this, he and Ar'alani decided to take the ship to a military base and declare it Defense Fleet property."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before they could act, however, the Fifth Family ships arrived and Chaf'orm'bintrano ordered Thrawn to report to him on the Chaf Exalted. When Thrawn didn't respond, the Aristocra ordered Ar'alani to place him in custody. Though Ar'alani had to obey, neither Car'das or Mitth'ras'safis was bound by the order; the two volunteered to remain aboard Outbound Flight and take the ship to a military base. The two military officers agreed, instructing them to head to the nearest Defense Fleet base at Pesfavri before leaving. Thrawn and Ar'alani reported to Chaf'orm'bintrano on the Chaf Exalted's bridge, where they were joined by Doriana. Thrawn translated while the Aristocra accused the Human of bringing weapons to use against the Chiss. Catching on quickly to the power struggle between the Chiss, Doriana claimed salvage rights as a representative of the Republic, distracting the Aristocra long enough for Outbound Flight to jump to hyperspace. Before it left, a shuttle carrying Car'das launched from the ship. Lorana Jinzler had survived the attack, along with 57 others in the Central Storage Core. In light of this, Mitth'ras'safis had decided to take the ship to the secluded area of Chiss space known as the Redoubt, where the survivors could wait while he negotiated for their safe passage, and had sent Car'das back to inform his brother."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chaf'orm'bintrano was furious with Outbound Flight's escape and confronted Thrawn, Ar'alani, Doriana and Car'das.

He therefore revoked Thrawn's military position pending a trial. All four Humans would also be charged unless Thrawn was prepared to resign and renounce his status as a trial-born, never again returning to a high position in Chiss society. Thrawn responded that the Eighth Ruling Family would stand by him if he presented the gravity well projector to them, giving them an advantage over the other Ruling Families. If, however, he were to remain an active Defense Fleet officer, he would present the gravity well projector to them instead.

While his reading of Doriana suggested that the other would not do so, he carried a small deflector shield generator from one of the droidekas to protect him from Kav. When Kav drew his blaster and fired at Thrawn, the shot ricocheted from the shield and struck him, killing the Neimoidian. Certain that he could trust Doriana, Thrawn told him that his people had encountered the Far-Outsiders and agreed to an exchange of information. The Darkvenge departed soon after. Before the Bargain Hunter returned to the Republic, Thrawn informed Car'das that Doriana had been impressed by him and wanted to recruit the young Human to build an information network. Knowing that the Chiss and the Republic may one day need to work together, and seeing Car'das as a potential contact for the future, Thrawn encouraged him to take the job and he made him promise not to tell Maris what had happened to the Outbound Flight.

Mitth'ras'safis did not return from Outbound Flight and it would be over forty years before the Chiss learned what had happened to the ship. On top of losing his brother, many in the Ruling Families still saw Thrawn's actions as tantamount to murder and from that point on, his actions were watched carefully. Palpatine, meanwhile, was impressed with Thrawn's abilities and, over the coming years, attempted on at least two occasions to contact the Chiss and secure the commander's services to assist him in carrying out his ambitions of galactic domination. Not coincidentally, the destruction of Outbound Flight had killed eighteen of the Jedi Order's most prominent Knights and Masters, furthering the Sith Lord's plans for the extermination of the Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For his part, Thrawn was intrigued by the idea of working for Palpatine, but knew that he could not honorably accept the offer and turn his back on the Expansionary Defense Force and his people.

Some time before the end of the Clone Wars, his actions in dealing with the Chiss's enemies pushed the Ruling Families too far. After attacking an enemy ground installation that was manufacturing weapons for an upcoming attack, Thrawn was judged to have acted against everything his people believed and was brought up on charges.

Emerging from hyperspace to find the Star Destroyer still in pursuit, Terrik decided to try and hide on a nearby planet\u2014the same world to which Thrawn was exiled.

Arriving at the crashed TIE fighter, Thrawn had sufficient time to examine it before the Imperial troops arrived. After removing the pilot's body from his flight suit, Thrawn hid the body and stole the comlink from the helmet in order to eavesdrop on the visitors. Knowing that the Imperials would notice the missing comlink, Thrawn filled the suit with grass and fermented pyussh berries. This, he believed, would have the effect of convincing the Imperials that primitive natives had removed the body, distracting them from the missing comlink.

The creatures were able to penetrate the Imperial perimeter before their charges exploded. Though the damage caused was minor, it had the desired effect of causing Parck to send TIE fighters to conduct a flyover of the surrounding area, looking for the Imperials' assailant. A monofilament, strung between two tall trees, caused one of the fighters to crash and Thrawn was again the first to the crash site. Ignoring the ruined fighter, Thrawn again removed the pilot's comlink, replacing it with the one from the first crash to make the pilot look untouched, before again ransacking the pilot's survival pack. Shortly after retrieving the body of the second pilot, the Imperials noticed the missing comlink which had allowed Thrawn to listen to their communications since their arrival. Parck quickly ordered the first comlink's circuit shut down, unaware that Thrawn had the second, still functional comlink.

Five Imperial troops died during the night, three as the result of concussion grenade explosions, and two due to friendly fire from their nervous comrades. By the morning, Barris wanted to withdraw commence orbital bombardment, but Parck wanted the smugglers alive and ordered the search to continue, dispatching stormtroopers to assist. When the heavily armored troops began their search of the forest, Thrawn struck once more. Using his stolen comlink to initiate communications jamming to mask the sound of his attack, Thrawn used explosives to kill a stormtrooper in order to study his armor. After finding a way to kill the soldier within, without noticeable damage to the armor, Thrawn struck again and donned the armor of the dead trooper. The communications jamming, meanwhile, had convinced Barris that it was time to leave and the Imperials were preparing to depart as Thrawn entered their camp.

As a squad of stormtroopers entered the hangar, Thrawn surrendered without resistance. Parck realized that the intruder was responsible for the events on the planet and, together with Barris, went to confront the alien. Thrawn explained that he was attempting to get home to protect his people but Parck, impressed by Thrawn's obvious abilities, suggested that by offering his service to the Empire, he may be better equipped to do so.

Thrawn suspected that, despite his claims, Creysis was not the true Ebruchi leader as no genuine commander would have agreed to visit an unknown and potentially hostile ship. As a result, Thrawn had had a transponder hidden in the sculpture presented to Creysis. This, he hoped would eventually lead them to the true Ebruchi leader. The Council of Colonists would consist of Commander Parck and six of Haverel's best troops. To escort their shuttle, Thrawn asked Niriz to select three TIE pilots who could remain calm under fire. After personally briefing the selected men, Thrawn had technicians work on the shuttle and one of the TIEs selected for the mission. The TIE was modified to remove key components and hide the fighter's true capabilities while the shuttle's starboard fuel tank was emptied to allow a dozen stormtroopers to hide inside.

As the Ebruchi moved away with the captured vessels, Niriz ordered the Admonitor to engage at full speed but Thrawn suspected that Creysis was attempting to ascertain the Star Destroyer's abilities so maintained his deception by having the ship pursue at a low speed. Thrawn had concluded that the Ebruchi were in fact pirates. The golden sculpture was intended to establish the Admonitor as a lucrative target and Thrawn was now certain that Creysis would not harm the prisoners or attempt to escape until his people had examined the captured vessels to determine the Imperials' level of technology.

Thrawn's objective was simply to inflict damage and to frighten the enemy and, after destroying the orbital defense platform and several enemy ships, he ordered all three Imperial task forces to withdraw to the rendezvous point, leaving a few hundred dead in the Bpfassh system alone and the New Republic to waste resources sending reinforcements.

C'baoth insisted on being taken to Jomark to wait for Skywalker, to which Thrawn agreed. However, Thrawn actually planned to capture Skywalker himself and had probes left at the edge of the system, to watch for his departure. Thrawn planned to deliver C'baoth to Jomark then backtrack at least twenty light-years to intercept Skywalker on his way there and take him into custody. In addition, he suspected that, with Skywalker on Nkllon, the Millennium Falcon might not be far away, and hoped that the probes would also lead the Imperials to Leia Organa Solo. Thrawn's hunch proved correct when a probe detected not only Skywalker's T-65 X-wing starfighter departing on a course for Jomark, but also the departure of the Millennium Falcon and Calrissian's Personal Luxury Yacht 3000, the Lady Luck, bound for Kashyyyk.

Skywalker was able to escape as the tractor beam pulled the torpedo towards it, causing minor damage to the Chimaera. Thrawn had Rukh promptly execute the responsible crewman, Cris Pieterson, for his inability to adapt to the situation and unwillingness to admit his error, then had his ensign, Colclazure, find him a replacement officer.

During his meeting with Karrde he inquired about the Blastboats and was told that a former employee had stolen one and that another employee had pursued. The truth was that Karrde had already found Skywalker but had yet to decide whether to turn him over to the Empire and it was the young Jedi who was attempting to flee in the stolen Blastboat. Although unaware of this, the lack of communication from the pursuing Blastboat was enough for Thrawn to conclude that Karrde's people didn't want him to know what was happening. Furthermore, when Karrde sounded surprised that the search for Skywalker was still proceeding, Thrawn began to suspect the truth.

Voss Parck, Soontir Fel, and many Chiss soldiers had spent the previous decade continuing Thrawn's fight against threats from the Unknown Regions, staying out of contact with the Imperial Remnant while waiting for his prophesied return. Upon hearing HoloNet rumors that the Grand Admiral had returned to lead the Imperial Remnant, they decided to investigate further. However, Thrawn's goal had always been to protect the galaxy from the dangers it faced. With the Empire's strength greatly diminished, Thrawn may have decided to work with the New Republic instead. Therefore, they were unwilling to reveal their operation to the Empire itself and instead chose to make contact with Mara Jade and acquire her knowledge and expertise of both sides before making a decision."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mara Jade was successfully lured to the Hand of Thrawn complex on Nirauan, with Luke Skywalker following after Karrde's people lost contact with her.

After Jade rejected Parck's offer to join the Empire of the Hand and sabotaged their ships to prevent them contacting the Empire, she and Skywalker returned to explore the hidden section of the fortress. In the course of their investigation, the two discovered the cloning chamber and found a fully mature clone of Thrawn still in the cloning cylinder. The two were uncertain what to do with the clone\u2014though he could represent a threat to the New Republic, since he was not actually Thrawn, he should not be held accountable for his predecessor's actions. However, while they decided what to do, they activated the room's security systems and came under attack from the sentinel droids. When their lightsabers proved ineffective against the droids' cortosis armor, Mara used her blade to cut through the cavern wall and flood it from the nearby lake, destroying the droids but cutting off their only escape route. Left with only one chance of escape, Mara cut through the transparisteel around the cloning alcove. When the water hit the generator, it exploded and blew a hole in the wall through which they escaped. However, Thrawn's clone was killed in the process.

O'Pali believed that Thrawn broke with the Chiss because he saw Palpatine's vision of a militarized Galactic Empire as the only possibility of defeating the encroaching Yuuzhan Vong, which both had been aware of since before the Outbound Flight Project. Further, O'Pali considered that Thrawn had been recalled from the Unknown Regions in 9 ABY by Emperor Palpatine's clone on Byss, and had attacked the New Republic with the aim of restoring the Empire. In O'Pali's judgement, Thrawn believed that a democratic government would only repeat the flaws of the Old Republic and had to rebuilt into a militarized society to resist the Yuuzhan Vong.

This was perhaps best exemplified in a pair of incidents surrounding the tractor beam control pit. During his campaign against the New Republic, a tractor beam operator, Cris Pieterson, aboard the Chimaera was responsible for allowing Luke Skywalker to escape capture. Thrawn investigated the incident and found a defiant Pieterson disrespectfully refusing to claim responsibility for the incident, referring Thrawn to his commanding ensign. Thrawn summarily had the man executed at his post in a rather brutal fashion by Rukh, and informed the ensign that he was free to train the next replacement. On the other hand, when Skywalker escaped a similar trap again, he rewarded the new tractor beam operator, Rejlii Mithel, with a promotion to Lieutenant because the man had employed creative thinking in his attempt to capture Skywalker and took responsibility for his failure to do so. In addition, Thrawn encouraged his senior officers to express their own ideas and gave them reasoned consideration rather than ignore any outside ideas, as many an Imperial commander had done during the height of the Empire.
