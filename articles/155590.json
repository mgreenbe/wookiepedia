After the Frangawl Cult kidnapped Queen Julia of Bardotta and took her to Zardossa Stix to be sacrificed, the Zygerrian was present alongside several other cultists as the kidnappers arrived, carrying a tooka with her. The Jedi Master Mace Windu and Representative Jar Jar Binks visited Zardossa Stix to rescue the queen, locating her kidnappers in a market square.
