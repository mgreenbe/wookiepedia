The imploder functioned by compressing and heating the surrounding atmosphere, thus creating a vacuum that provides a powerful implosion in a large radius. A thermal imploder could seriously damage a turret, an AT-ST, or kill a squad of infantry if properly used. When activated, there would be a timer of about 7-10 seconds before the first explosion erupted. The first was a non-lethal wave of fire that would then come back to the epicenter causing a larger secondary explosion. these weapons were widely employed, most notably during the Battle of Scarif by coastal defender stormtroopers to destroy the Zeta-class Heavy Cargo Shuttle SW-0608 that was assisting the rebels in assaulting the Imperial installation there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}]}
