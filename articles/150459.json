As such, it was 34.1 meters long. Equipped with a Class 3 hyperdrive, its maximum speed  was otherwise 700 kph. It could be manned by a minimum of two crew members: a pilot and co-pilot. The Twilight was armed with two laser cannons: a front-facing one mounted on the foldable fin that extended below the ship in flight, and a rotating one mounted on the fin that stuck out of the right side of the ship. They could be controlled by a pull-down reticle from inside the cockpit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Twilight had a roomy cockpit with chairs for the pilots and a navigator, as well as an astromech droid socket. The ship also had a small medical bay equipped with a holographic medical program that took the form of a 2-1B-series medical droid. The cargo bay was located in the back and contained a launchable cable to pull objects inside."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ownership under Skywalker"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Twilight was originally owned by the Hutt crime lord Ziro Desilijic Tiure, who used it as a spice freighter. In 22 BBY, early in the Clone Wars, Ziro allied himself with the Confederacy of Independent Systems in a plot to take over his nephew Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire, as well as sabotaging relations between the Galactic Republic and the Hutt Clan. As a result, the Twilight was present on the Wild Space planet Teth, at a landing platform near a B'omarr Order Monastery where the Separatists were holding Jabba's abducted son, Rotta. During the subsequent battle at the monastery as Republic forces attempted to locate the child, the spy droid 4-A7 and several battle droids were loading cargo aboard the ship when they were discovered by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, and Skywalker's astromech R2-D2, who had rescued Rotta and were escaping Separatist commander Asajj Ventress. Realizing that 4-A7 was not the \"caretaker droid\" he had claimed to be, Tano destroyed him and the battle droids before she and her master claimed the Twilight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At first, the Twilight refused to start up, but Skywalker and R2 were able to fire up the engines and attempted to land on the nearest Jedi Cruiser. Unfortunately, the Vulture droids prevented them from landing in one of the cruiser's hangars. Thus, Skywalker and his crew were forced to take the Twilight to Tatooine. Aboard the ship, Tano activated the medical droid hologram, TB-2 to save Rota from near death. Upon the Twilight's arrival at Tatooine, the ship came under attack by a pair of IG-100 MagnaGuards using Rogue-class Porax-38 starfighters. Skywalker, Tano, and R2 were able to destroy the starfighters, but were forced to crash land in the Dune Sea."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the mission, Skywalker had the Twilight salvaged. Skywalker would tinker with Twilight's machinery using it to teach Tano mechanical skills, something he considered an important skill one should know.

Their search was initially fruitless, but when Tano sensed Koon in the debris field, she took the controls and piloted the ship to the lone escape pod, where they rescued Koon, Clone Commander CC-3636 \"Wolffe,\" Sergeant Sinker, and Boost. As they prepared to leave, the Malevolence arrived, and the Twilight powered down to avoid detection in the debris field. Unfortunately, TB-2, the 2-1B-series medical droid, was left on to care for the injured clones, and Grievous spotted them and fired the ion cannon. Skywalker then piloted the Twilight through the debris field and barely jumped to hyperspace before being engulfed by the blast."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mandalore"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At Skywalker's encouragement, Obi-Wan Kenobi used the Twilight to travel to Mandalore despite the ship being in extremely rough shape.

However, the concept of a spice freighter upon which Anakin Skywalker served as a navigator dates back to the inaugural 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, wherein Luke Skywalker's uncle Owen Lars told Luke that his father had been a navigator on a spice freighter during the Clone Wars, rather than fighting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
