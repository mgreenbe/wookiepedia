The vessel participated in the Battle of Coruscant during the height of the invasion, where it was supported by the starfighters of Green Squadron. When the squadron was withdrawn to protect a shuttle, which was carrying a senator, the Pride of Honor suffered extensive damage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "241 of its crew were killed in the battle and the damage that the ship sustained was so severe that the vessel was scrapped, since it was decided the cost to repair the Pride would be far more than to simply build a new ship.
