Well-known throughout the galaxy, the two brothers gained the attention of Count Dooku, leader of the Separatists, and was given the challenge of winning the Box, a lethal bounty hunter competition. After gathering with Dooku's other assembled bounty hunters, Bulduga was killed by Cad Bane over a dispute regarding the Ithorian's wide-brimmed hat.

Eventually, Bulduga and Onca attracted the attention of the Sith Lord Count Dooku, who was in league with the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
