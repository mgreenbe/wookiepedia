Hurd Coyle, a salvager active following the end of the Clone Wars and the formation of the Galactic Empire, utilized electro-darts for defensive purposes aboard his salvaging ship. Soon after the rise of the Empire, Coyle rescued the clone trooper pilot HOB-147, who had been stranded for weeks in his damaged V-19 Torrent starfighter and was floating through space unconscious following a battle during the Clone Wars. HOB, unaware that the Clone Wars were over and that the Galactic Republic he had once served was now the Empire, awoke in the medical bay of Coyle's ship, where he was confronted by a group of reprogrammed B1-Series battle droids that worked for Coyle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "HOB incorrectly assumed that he was aboard a Confederacy of Independent Systems craft and attacked the battle droids. Coyle, having entered the sickbay, shot the clone trooper with an electro-dart to stop him from destroying all of his droids.

Unbeknownst to HOB-147, Coyle was transporting a group of fugitive Jedi younglings to the Outer Rim. When HOB came to, he found himself being watched by Nia, one of the younglings aboard the vessel. The clone grabbed her, but Coyle walked into the room and shot the trooper with another electro-dart.
