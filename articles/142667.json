It was a tale of birth, death, and revenge. The witch wanted revenge against the Sith for taking her loved ones, against the Jedi for not doing anything to prevent it, and also against the galaxy for being imperfect. Gallius Rax had a particular liking of the piece, as it was the first ever he had listened to as a boy on Jakku. The Cantata's music included the moda khur, denda drums, and tucari singers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
