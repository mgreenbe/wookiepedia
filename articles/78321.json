In 13 BBY, she and her crew were hired by Goll, a former leader of the Free Ryloth Movement, to transport a shipment of gattis-root purchased from the Karthakk Group to Ryloth. Rheden was injured, to the point of being unable to see out of one eye, during the mission when her ship was fired upon by Imperial V-wings, thus leaving Goll's ward Hera Syndulla to fly the ship into Lessu for their rendezvous."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
