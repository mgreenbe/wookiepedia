Several years before 3956 BBY, his daughter, Sasha, had been kidnapped by the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders during a raid on Sulem's ranch. He employed a Twi'lek named Lur Arka Sulas to help find his daughter. In 3956 BBY, Sulas took up residence in the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine, seeking the help of the Jedi there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the Jedi were unable to help him locate her, Sulas was soon approached by the amnesiac Sith Lord Revan, who had escaped the destruction of Taris and was retraining in the light. Sulas asked Revan to keep an eye out for Sasha, and Revan agreed. Some time later, several foodstuffs went missing aboard Revan's ship, the Ebon Hawk. While investigating, Revan stumbled across a young girl living on the ship who fit the description of Sasha.
