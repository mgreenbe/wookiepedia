The Ewok shaman Logray, who resided in Bright Tree Village on the forest moon of Endor, used the staff as a weapon. The staff allowed Logray to perform more potent \"magic.\" Logray carried it at all times, and he guarded it closely. The staff could potentially be used by anyone that Logray so chose, such as the young Ewok warrior, Wicket Wystri Warrick. Individuals that Logray had not deemed able to use the staff were given a powerful burn or shock when they tried to take hold of the staff. However, the Dark Wizard Stagorr once took possession of the staff."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
