Some models were additionally equipped with a small but intensely bright light appended to the primary barrel that could be triggered to \"flash-stun\" a target; temporarily blinding them. The EC-17's most unique feature compared to other pistols of the same size and caliber was its unique trigger, it was located on the side of the gun rather than directly underneath the barrel and made it easier to fire while wearing gloves. The blaster was designed for short-range targets, and therefore lost much of its accuracy over greater distances."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The EC-17 became the standard-issue sidearm of scout troopers and patrol troopers during the time of the Galactic Empire, and was commonly holstered in a trooper's boot.
