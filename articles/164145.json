While it did transpire that Grievous was in fact waiting on Utapau and was killed by Kenobi, the mission could in fact have been considered a wild bantha chase. Kenobi's defeating Grievous was ultimately largely irrelevant to the ending of the Clone Wars, which came when Sheev Palpatine executed Order 66 and sent Skywalker, now Darth Vader, to Mustafar to defeat the remaining Separatist leaders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The phrase is derived from the real-world phrase \"wild goose chase.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
