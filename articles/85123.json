Despite being the largest and most powerful capital ship in the navy of the Republic when the class was introduced, most ships fell out of favor due to their high operational costs, and as such, few ships saw little to no action during the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Maelstrom, however, served with distinction in the Battle of Kromus and the Battle of Cularin while under the command of Jedi General Darrus Jeht. Once the war ended and the Republic became the Galactic Empire, any remaining Maelstrom-class battle cruisers were broken up, mothballed, or used as test beds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
