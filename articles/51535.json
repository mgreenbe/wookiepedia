It had a highly effective stun setting, making it useful for taking down targets and bringing them back alive. Another advantage was that it was lighter than similar blaster rifles in its class, weighing as little as a carbine. This made it easy to carry especially when tracking targets over long distances. Finally, the Firelance lacked any of the standard corporate or governmental markings, making the weapon untraceable. As a result of high sales to bounty hunters, SoroSuub began marketing the Firelance as \"the most effective weapon available for freelance law enforcement officials.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Nenneb, a Sullustan engineer who worked for the SoroSuub Corporation, was sent to represent the company at the Cularin Trade Show where he exhibited the Firelance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Rebellion era, a male Twi'lek bounty hunter named Gennan Var used a Firelance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
