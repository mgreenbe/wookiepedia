The project's goal was to develop a new weapon for the war in form of a massive, four-legged Walker. Constructed in the Gearbox's bunker, the prototype walker was piloted by Gearbox himself. Republic Special Forces Division General Elin Garza sent the new commander of Havoc Squad to track down the defectors, eventually tracking Gearbox to Alderaan and learning about the existence of Project B from Markus Andarius Thul. Havoc Squad eventually located and infiltrated the bunker and Gearbox confronted them in his Project B walker. However, Havoc Squad managed to disable the prototype, killing Gearbox and ending the Project B."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
