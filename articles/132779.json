He endeavors to set up camp until he meets a diminutive green gnome who unceremoniously begins rifling through his belongings. The gnome learns that Luke is looking for a Jedi Master named Yoda and volunteers to take him to him. They return to the gnome's dwelling and Luke begins to act impatient. It is revealed that the gnome is in fact, master Yoda. Yoda feels that Luke is too old and reckless to learn the ways of the Jedi, but the voice of Obi-Wan Kenobi encourages Yoda to train him. Yoda begins putting Luke through an extensive training period of physical and mental exercises. He pushes him to expand his knowledge and use of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Luke is training on Dagobah, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Princess Leia, and C-3PO continue to outmaneuver Imperial gun ships through an asteroid field.

He lands the Falcon deep within the recesses of the cave as Imperial TIE bombers drop their payloads onto the outer surface of the asteroid.
