In it, Boba Fett would have teamed up with Rogue Squadron to discover an enemy agent with Rogue Squadron, and who his employer was. Mangels discussed it with Dark Horse Comics and very briefly with Michael A. Stackpole, but it was never published. [Note: Michael A. Stackpole was never consulted on this project, has no connection with it and aside from two phone conversations with Mr. Mangels prior to ever scripting a single issue of X-wing Rogue Squadron, has had no contact with Mr. Mangels.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
