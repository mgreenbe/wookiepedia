During the Clone Wars, he encountered a group of Jedi consisting of Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Ahsoka Tano who were searching for the missing people of Kiros. After they infiltrated his ship, Onyx captured Ahsoka and proposed to trade her for his men, captured by Skywalker and Kenobi. However, he was in fact trying to kill them by releasing a giant creature. But it was defeated and the Jedi infiltrated the ship, using the rear air dock opened by Ahsoka. Fearing for his life, he told them everything he knew about the slaves from Kiros. He was later secured in the Jedi's ship with the rest of his crew."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
