He served as a pilot for the Alliance to Restore the Republic. In the year 3 ABY, he was stationed at Echo Base on the planet Hoth. Hetsime was part of the base's pilot contingent consisting of Rogue Flight, Blue Squadron, and Green Squadron. During the Battle of Hoth, when the Galactic Empire discovered Echo Base, Rogue Group was formed from the three Rebel squadrons. Hetsime was a part of that formation, under the call sign of Rogue Seven, with Cinda Tarheel serving as his gunner."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the Empire's invasion of Hoth, Hetsime joined the rest of Rogue Group to listen to a briefing held by Princess Leia Organa, who discussed Echo Base's evacuation plans. The various Alliance transports would depart Hoth one by one, under the cover fire of the base's v-150 Planet Defender, and escorted by two starfighters, which they hoped would allow the ships to slip by the Imperial blockade in orbit of the planet. Hetsime took part in defending Echo Base from the invading Imperial Blizzard Force. Although the battle ended with the Rebels being forced to retreat from their base, Hetsime and Tarheel's T-47 airspeeder made it through without getting shot down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A good pilot, Hetsime could fly anything\u2014whether it was streaking through hyperspace or a few meters above Hoth.
