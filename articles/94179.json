It was just off a trade route in a sector where piracy was a problem. During the Galactic Civil War, the Imperial Navy devoted a substantial amount of its local resources to combating this criminal activity. The Empire also partially relaxed restrictions on starship weaponry for this reason."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
