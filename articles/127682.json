In 0 ABY, the Krantian Resistance in the village was attacked by a squad of stormtroopers from Camp Sagol. The self-exiled Jedi Echuu Shen-Jon joined with the Rebel Leia Organa and killed the attackers. The Krantian leader then contacted them and turned over control of the city's Command center and the labor droids to them in order to recruit an army. The army was then used to save the nearby cities of Peche and Theenes from Imperial attacks emanating from Camp Sagol and Camp Kaxol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds identifies this base only as Small Village during the Leia Organa campaign.
