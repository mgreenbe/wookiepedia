Fonada became a warlord commanding a fleet in the Outer Rim Territories following the Battle of Endor, engaging in a hit-and-run campaign against the New Republic's shipping concerns. In the months preceding the Thrawn crisis, Fonada and his fleet, mostly composed of scavenged Imperial vessels, promptly abandoned their bases in the Vatha sector and disappeared down the Corellian Trade Spine, which was later reported to the New Republic. It wouldn't be revealed until a few months after the Thrawn crisis that the New Republic would learn the circumstances of why it happened, when dealing with the reborn Emperor's forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
