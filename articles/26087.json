The group included a male Human who played a mandolin; Margolis Mingla, a young girl who helped care for the children; the Ho'Din Brigantes Ustu; as well as Nichos Marr, Hoddas Umgil, the Ismaren siblings Lagan and Roganda and their parents.

He was able to shelter the children in his compound. However, the Emperor discovered the location of the children and dispatched the battlemoon Eye of Palpatine to destroy them. Callista Masana and Geith Eris, two Altisian Jedi who had been in contact with Plett, were able to board the battlestation while it was traveling through the Moonflower Nebula and disable it. When the battlestation failed to arrive, the Emperor dispatched a small strike force to attack. Plett and the Jedi were able to repel the Imperial fighters using Y-wings. Plett and the children subsequently fled Belsavis and separated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Of the scattered Jedi refugees, the siblings Lagan and Roganda Ismaren were captured by Inquisitor Ameesa Darys.
