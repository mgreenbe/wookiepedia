In 1 ABY one of the company's mining pilots, Flash Harrison, who was working on a mining project in the Kashyyyk system got stuck on the Wookiee world when the Empire impounded his ship. Harrison paid a spacer to deliver the news to Steele on Talus. The spacer found him in the Dearic Cantina."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Steele now needed a quick replacement for Harrison to aid him with several problems in the space mining business. The spacer seemed to be an able pilot, so Steele hired the adventurer on the spot. His first task for the new pilot was to patrol the Corellian Mining Route 42 and attack any rival mining vessel. Steele rewarded the pilot with 1,500 credits and a used mining laser. After the mining laser was installed in the pilot's ship, Steele sent the pilot to retrieve a mineral sample from silicaceous asteroids that had recently entered the Corellian system. It didn't take long before the pilot returned with the samples. Steele paid the pilot 2000 credits and then sent him to Captain Koh back on Kashyyyk to take over some of Harrison's duties."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thom Steele is a Non-Player Character (NPC) in Rage of the Wookiees, the second addon to Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies.
