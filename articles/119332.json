He populated it with amphibious aliens who worked for him as indentured servants, both in a seafood processing plant and in trawlers for Bartyn Gourmet Delicacies. A speciesist, Bartyn kept his employees in harsh living conditions, with scarce food and little living space in the area known as The Ring. However, he promoted his best sailors to captains of their own trawlers. As Lamaredd was remote, the Galactic Republic held little power there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "C. 517 BBY, seventeen trawlers were under alien captains. One of these, the Chagrian Sirrik Olyeg, organized the others \u2014 and several Humans too \u2014 to rebel against Bartyn. The trawlers suddenly disappeared in the open sea, in a work stoppage. When the workers of the plant discovered it, they joined the strike, not yielding even when Bartyn resorted to violence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Knowing that Bartyn could not maintain the situation for longer, Sirrik Olyeg gave her movement a name, the Sailor's Union, and she became the \"first chair\" of it.

Around that time, due to the sudden loss of power of the Bartyn family, the town council of Bartyn's Landing seized Bartyn Gourmet Delicacies.
