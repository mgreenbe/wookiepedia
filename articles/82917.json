Following the Battle of Yavin, she was a captain of the technology-hating Meatlumps and operated out of the Meatlump Hideout in Coronet City. Around 1 ABY, she tasked a spacer to recover missing supplies lost in the lower maintenance areas of Coronet's maintenance tunnels. The spacer therefore descended into the hostile lower maintenance areas and fought a way through S-1 and S-2 security droids.
