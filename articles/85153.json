By 1 ABY, Doum operated a lucrative business selling T-6 diodems pulled from discarded home service machines to the Empire at an enormous markup\u2014as the diodems were also used in Rebel starfighters, Imperial pilots could use them to lock onto Rebel targets, giving them a distinct advantage in combat. When Rebel leaders Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa visited Arda II to meet with the device's manufacturers over the issue, Doum ordered Kiros Zorad\u2014a local man heavily indebted to Doum\u2014to kidnap and dispose of Organa. Doum later lent his personal speeder to Organa's friend Han Solo in order to deflect suspicion about his involvement, only for Organa to return alive with Zorad and publicly accuse him, leading to a near-riot. Doum narrowly managed to escape to his ship, only for the vengeful Zorad to stow away on his vessel and attack him as he attempted to contact the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Doum's message did draw Vader to Arda II, but the spy was killed during the ensuing battle when Zorad made a suicide run on Vader's Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mag Doum appeared as a primary antagonist in the comic strip story arc As Long As We Live..., written by Don Christensen and released in 1980.
