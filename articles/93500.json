It was the site of a Rebel Alliance base known as Dalgeer's Rim. The base of the volcano was riddled with tunnels that were formed by flowing lava. This made Mount Deldarca an ideal location to house a base, as most of the excavation work was already done for them. By tapping into the lava within the volcano, the Alliance had an unlimited supply of geothermal energy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
