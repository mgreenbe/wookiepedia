During Yeager's racing days, Bucket served as his copilot on his racer. Yeager ended his racing career after his younger brother Marcus Speedstar caused the deaths of Yeager's wife and daughter during a racing accident. By 34 ABY, Bucket was part of Yeager's Team Fireball, a group of mechanics and pilots who operated from Yeager's repair shop on the Colossus platform on the planet Castilon.

Xiono had been tasked with finding out who on the Colossus platform was helping the First Order to build their military. Xiono was also accompanied by the BB astromech droid BB-8, who had been sent by Dameron to keep an eye on Xiono. After Xiono accidentally volunteered to compete in a race against Ace Squadron pilot Torra Doza, Yeager summoned Bucket when the crew began work on refurbishing the aging racer Fireball for the race. Taking a dislike to the newcomer, Bucket slammed into Xiono, prompting the latter to call him a \"bucket of bolts.\" When Doza came to visit her competitor, she patted Bucket."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Xiono continued working undercover as a mechanic, the spy's lack of experience as a mechanic rankled both Bucket and Ryvora. On one occasion, Xiono accidentally pressed a dashboard, causing everyone to hear a loud, screeching sound.

When Yeager scolded Xiono for the slow progress of his repair work, Bucket and Ryvora giggled that Xiono was in trouble. Bucket also tried to obstruct Xiono's path, prompting the pilot to grumble that the droid was now on his case. When Xiono and the local racer Jace Rucklin snuck into Yeager's private hangar to view Yeager's racer, they hid from Bucket, who had entered the room to retrieve a macro-fuser.

As a team, the two acquitted themselves well and took the lead in the race with Speedstar coming second place. Following a prolonged confrontation, Yeager decided to forgive Speedstar for causing the deaths of his wife and daughter and to allow Speedstar to win so that Speedstar could save his Nikto mechanic Oplock, who had been taken hostage by the Guavian Death Gang.
