Rowan Freemaker is meditating but notices his siblings are silent. When he asks them what they are doing, they reply that they are being quiet so that he can lead them to the kyber crystal so that they can finish building the Arrowhead. Rowan says that he is unable to concentrate because it is too quiet and they are watching him. Roger then plays some loud cantina music, which Rowan objects. When Roger asks Rowan what he wants because he doesn't want quiet or noise, Rowan tells everyone to do what they usually do."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Rowan soon gets frustrated that they are acting normal. Zander counters that there is no such thing as normal for the Freemakers. He says that this is the right amount of tension they can work with. Rowan senses that the crystal is far away but thinks they can still reach it. At that point, they are attacked by M-OC's starship Tracker I. Rowan remarks that this is too much tension. Zander wonders how M-OC rebuilt himself so fast."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Roger says that M-OC has got blasters, pulse cannons, and jets, and adds that the Emperor clearly knows how to build a droid unlike some people. Kordi Freemaker tells Roger to shoot at M-OC instead of taking pot shots at them. During the chase, Rowan tells his siblings to buy him time while he tries to meditate. M-OC contacts him by hologram and tells him that time is not in his favor. He taunts Rowan that he is relentless and does not tire unlike Rowan. However, Zander terminates the transmission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Zander's encouragement, Rowan focuses and tells them to jump to Outer Rim Territories, twelve parsecs past Terminus. The StarScavenger jumps into hyperspace. M-OC is about to calculate their jump trajectory but he is interrupted by the Emperor, who queries about the weather on Qalydon before demanding the whereabouts of Rowan and the Kyber Saber. M-OC replies that he has neither Rowan nor the Kyber Saber.

He says he can sense the kyber crystals. The Freemakers subsequently discover that the planet is littered with tiny kyber crystals.
