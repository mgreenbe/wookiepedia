Following a massacre aboard the Sorca Retreat, the rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Aphra traveled to Zeltros to take a break from her recent misadventures. While relaxing at a beach, being served a Dantooine ice-twist by a service droid, she was confronted by Tukan, who had been tracking her since she killed one of his affiliates, Dukan.
