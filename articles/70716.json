By 35 ABY, Issa was an adult and attended the Festival of the Ancestors in the Forbidden Valley, where the tribal guardian stood holding an Aki-Aki infant alongside fellow guardian Fadda-Rarb Arda. As Issa held up the infant and rocked it in the air, a group of Resistance agents searching for a Sith wayfinder passed by. Issa wore a turquoise flowing kaftan that allowed for unimpeded dancing with a monocot-fiber hood suitable for a warm sun. The Aki-Aki also wore a rattling purple pallie-pit necklace and a second, blue necklace with golden beads. Issa had gray skin and brown eyes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jesba-Be Issa was created for the 2019 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, and was first identified in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
