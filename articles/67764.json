It was made of high-impact plastics and kept water circulating inside the armor, since the Iskalonians could only breathe by extracting dissolved oxygen from water. Although those garbs were already ancient at the time of the Galactic Civil War, some were still serviceable. When Kiro decided to accompany Luke Skywalker in his adventures, he donned one such traditional suit, which was later destroyed during a confrontation with Lumiya, Dark Lady of the Sith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
