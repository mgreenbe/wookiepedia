When Minister Zeffren Ecka ordered the Hetzal system evacuated due to a swarm of hyperspace anomalies that threatened the system, the trader kindly offered to take as many people as possible aboard his starship, although the ship's pilot warned him that the vessel was old and its engines were past their prime, which the trader ignored. The vessel lifted off with 582 people onboard, including the trader and his family. However, before it could escape the Rooted Moon's gravity well, the ship exploded after less than a kilometer of flight when the engines gave out, killing everyone onboard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
