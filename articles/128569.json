Sonniod later carried out a trip from Kessel to Oba Diah during which the navigation computer plotted a course with twists and turns around the gravity wells of the Maw, attempting to test Han's route. Sonniod's final heading was thrown off because of the course corrections, and the spacer ultimately logged a run of twenty-two parsecs. Sonniod later included the findings on a map of the Maelstrom kept by Tivoche Bilure at The Lodge on Vandor, adding their route to the chart and writing up a note of the journey."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sonniod became a friend to Han and Chewbacca, and later introduced them to Mama Annie."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
