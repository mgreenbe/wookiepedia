Over 200 years old, the Falleen was on good terms with a disguised Palpatine, claiming not to be a fan of the Jedi and not asking too many questions during a young Maul's enrollment, where he once saved the young boy from being shot by Meltch Krakko. The Falleen could \"smell\" when the Force was used and could tell that Maul was Force-sensitive. After a failed attempt to get rid of Maul by Krakko, Maul was ordered by Sidious to eliminate everyone at the academy. Trezza tried to kill him by throwing a knife at him, but Maul caught the knife with his Force-enhanced reflexes and threw it back, killing him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
