Malk also called in the Mandalorian in order to use his ship, the Razor Crest, which was pre-Imperial Era and was off the Galactic Empire and New Republic grids. Xi'an went to greet Djarin while he met the rest of the team and waved a dagger at him. The team began planning their infiltration of the Bothan-Five, a New Republic Correctional Transport that was holding Qin. Djarin was skeptical about getting in trouble with the New Republic but Xi'an told him that the prison ship was crewed by droids, knowing that the bounty hunter hated droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After determining their plan, the mercenaries began traveling for the prison ship on the Razor Crest, which Zero piloted. The rest of the team sat in the cargo hold, where Djarin quarreled with Burg.

When Burg tried to remove Djarin's helmet, the bounty hunter fought back and the Devaronian accidentally opened a door, revealing Grogu. Mayfeld asked if Xi'an and Djarin made it and Xi'an asked if the Bounty Hunter Code made the bounty hunter soft when he said it was a pet."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The job"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zero announced to the rest of the team that the Razor Crest was approaching the prison ship and began maneuvering it to land on the transport unnoticed.

He turned and pointed his blaster pistol at the group as Djarin expressed surprise at an organic worker being aboard the ship.
