The Twi'lek refused to let her child give Tor some food, saying it was kind but it would be \"bad luck.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One day, Tor met a tooka. She complimented it on its cuteness, but then yelled that unlike her, it had done nothing to make people hate it and attempted to kick it, but missed. She fell off the waterfall, hanging on by its edge.

When Graf asked what it meant, she said that she could be wrong, but she thinks it meant that it doesn't matter what other people think.
