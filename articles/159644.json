They used to swim out to a neighboring island, where an elderly jeweler crafted beautiful vases and necklaces out of glass. Paddy Accu, the retreat's caretaker, was delighted to take the young Padm\u00e9 on thrilling rides in his Gondola Speeder.

Around 21 BBY, Amidala, along with Senators Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, Onaconda Farr, and the latter's aide Lolo Purs, drank this beverage in celebration of her latest speech in favor of the reduction of military spending. Unbeknownst to Amidala, the wine had been mixed with a lethal poison that exclusively affected Rodian blood by Purs, who wanted to take revenge on Farr for his temporary alliance with the Separatist Alliance.

She found peace there because she knew that Amidala loved that place. When Thule finally decided that it was time to return to her life in Theed, Inquisitor Malorum stopped by to interrogate her because, as per Naboo custom, Thule had been the one to oversee Padm\u00e9's funeral. Her defiance to his questions led him to deduce that Amidala's offspring had not died. The Inquisitor then proceeded to kill Thule. A few times later, Ferus Olin and Trever Flume arrived in turn at the Lake Retreat. With her dying breath, Thule begged Olin to protect her granddaughter's memory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, Varykino would have been lent to the Royal House of Naboo and reserved for the private use of friends, family, and loyal subjects.

However, Stradley's statement was made when Revenge of the Sith was assumed to take place over a period of weeks rather than days. Luke and Leia may still have been conceived in Varykino, but this must have occurred nearly nine months before the Battle of Coruscant and the beginning of Revenge of the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Varykino scenes were filmed at Villa del Balbianello, on Lake Como, Italy.
