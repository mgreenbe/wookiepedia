Blastboats were fast and agile enough to intercept most intruders, and were armed and armored enough to deliver an offensive punch and withstand weapons fire. Blastboats operated both in space and atmosphere. The GAT Blastboat was the smallest Imperial Navy starship to be equipped with hyperdrive, and were deployed throughout a sector where combat was expected."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Multiple variants of the GAT Blastboat were produced, including specialized configurations for ground support or missile platforms.
