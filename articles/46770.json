Black Sun became notorious in the lawless Outer Rim Territories and elsewhere, and its Falleen leadership operated out of a well-defended fortress on Mustafar. Xomit Grunseit led the cabal until Maul ultimately usurped control of Black Sun, and installed the leg-breaking lieutenant Ziton Moj as its ruler."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Black Sun was also involved in an underground dispute with the Pyke Syndicate, which led to Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos investigating a kidnapping by the Pykes. Ventress coerced a Falleen guard on Mustafar, leading him to believe his powerful pheromones had worked on her, and she and Vos strong-armed him into giving up information on the Pykes. The pair infiltrated the Black Sun fortress, fighting more Falleen to reach the kidnapped family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the reign of the Galactic Empire, Falleen like other alien species such as Umbarans and Neimoidians, were typically the butt of running jokes at Imperial Academies including the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant. At this time, the Falleen Ango Croom led the Varluk Organization. A Falleen gangster named Annaz was a member of the Malandro syndicate before she was attacked and tortured by the bounty hunter Brand, whose parents Annaz had formerly killed. A number of Falleen worked as overseers in MaDall's slaving operation on Oon, and treated Sabine Wren roughly when she posed as a slave to infiltrate the operation. She inspired an uprising against the slavers, and the Falleen guards were attacked and overpowered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Falleen race was originally developed for Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire, a 1996 multimedia story that was released as a novel, comic series, and video game.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within the first installment of the Prequel trilogy, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, micro-machine toy figurines of Prince Xizor, a major Falleen antagonist from Shadows of the Empire, were used in the Mos Espa Grand Arena.
