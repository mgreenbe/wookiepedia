The Rebel Alliance learned of the impending assault and General Carlist Rieekan ordered the evacuation of the base. After this successful evacuation, Imperial Armored Transports Elusive and Timely recovered sensitive intelligence in the the ruins of the base. As the Imperial transports prepared to leave the Dankayo system, they were attacked by the Lambda-class shuttle Bonderium that had been stolen by the Rebels. The Elusive escaped into hyperspace before it could be destroyed, dumping its garbage before it did so. Shortly, the Squib Momship Thrifty entered the star system to retrieve the rubbish. An Ugor battle-wagon soon appeared as well and engaged the Squibs over control of the garbage dump."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Soures"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
