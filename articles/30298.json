It consisted of a hexagonal spaceport, and a quartet of ten-kilometer bridges that linked it up to the Murkhana City. After the Clone Wars, it was slagged and tipped on the piers that supported it, while the bridges had collapsed into the water below it. Because of its state, starships arriving at Murkhana were redirected to the city's original spaceport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
