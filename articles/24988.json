Attuned to a subject's specific biometrics, these markers catalogued certain features of a person and their history and were used by the law enforcement of the New Republic to identify fugitives. Chain codes were also commonly used by bounty hunters, who used the markers in conjunction with devices known as tracking fobs to locate their targets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chain codes identified specific biometric details of an individual and were made up of several numbers, with the final four digits signifying the subject's age. They contained other information as well, pertaining to topics such as a person's family history and criminal record. Since governments like the New Republic were known to run an individual's chain code upon securing passage on registered starships, it was practice among criminals to lay low in order to avoid having the details of their codes shared."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The information within these markers was used by the enforcers of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, who were given access to their targets' codes upon accepting assignments. Hunters made use of devices known as tracking fobs, short-range sensors that were attuned to a code's specifics. After the hunter had obtained the target, dead or alive, Guild operatives would run a check on the body to ensure that it matched to the information included within the chain code."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chain codes were in usage as a form of identification during the Imperial Era. During the early days of the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, citizens of the newly formed regime were required to register for a chain code in order to book passage off world or to convert their Republic credits into Imperial credits. Due to the new rule, Cut Lawquane and his family had to receive help from Clone Force 99 to forge chain codes for them so that they could book passage off of Saleucami."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 14 BBY, the chain code of bounty hunter Boba Fett was encoded into a set of Mandalorian armor formerly worn by Boba's father, Jango Fett. This code was written in the Mando'a script and contained information on not only the Fetts but Jango's mentor as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 9 ABY, the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin was hired by an Imperial remnant to acquire the Force-sensitive infant Grogu. The chain code provided to Djarin was fractured, only pertaining to the child's age, though the hunter was able to locate the infant on the planet Arvala-7 after also being given Grogu's last known positioning. Later, Djarin's ally, Magistrate Greef Karga, was prevented from entering a city on the planet Nevarro without first presenting his chain code to a persistent scout trooper. Karga turned over a small card, which the scout trooper scanned with a rod-like device."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Carasynthia Dune, a former shock trooper of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, committed several crimes following the Galactic Civil War that carried life sentences should she be apprehended by the New Republic. Knowing the consequences of having her chain code run through official channels, she resolved to lay low on Outer Rim worlds like Sorgan to avoid prosecution. After liberating Nevarro of Imperials with Djarin and Karga, the magistrate offered Dune a position as his enforcer, promising to take care of whatever \"clerical concerns\" she had regarding her chain code. After taking up Karga's offer, Dune later went on to become a deputized marshal of the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many years after his chain code was first encoded into his armor, the mercenary Boba Fett sought to reclaim his father's equipment, which was by that point in the hands of Din Djarin. Djarin was strongly opposed to returning the armor to Fett, as the Mandalorian Creed dictated that it rightfully belonged to the Mandalorian people. In order to convince the hunter that his claim to the armor was justified, Fett showed his chain code to Djarin on the planet Tython, proving to the man that Fett was of Mandalorian heritage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chain codes were first mentioned within the first episode of the The Mandalorian, a Disney+ television series created by Jon Favreau.
