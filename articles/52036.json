The Senate unanimously elected Senator Dorian Janarus of Coruscant as the Supreme Chancellor in 3653 BBY, and re-elected him in 3649 BBY. In 3645 BBY, at the next expiration of the four-year term, the Senate decided he should remain in the position. Like the previous one, the election was a small affair because the candidates feared assassination by the Sith Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
