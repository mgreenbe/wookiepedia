Zildrog then targeted Odessen itself and began to recharge before the next attack, dropping the force field and giving them an opening to engage GEMINI 16 directly. Theron, Lana and the Commander battled and destroyed the GEMINI droid, after which Theron attempted to shut Zildrog down, but was suddenly stabbed in the back with a lightsaber pike by Vinn Atrius. Lana and Commander defeated Atrius and destroyed Zildrog, but the last act also triggered the self-destruct of the Gravestone and disabled the Eternal Throne. The Commander decided Atrius' fate while Lana tended to Theron's wounds, determining that he needed immediate treatment. The Commander ordered to bring Theron home to Odessen, where after some time he became strong enough to walk and approached Lana and Commander in the hangar.

Lana then changed the subject, suggesting that she, Theron, and the Commander stop by the cantina, as a general was offering free drinks to anyone with an impressive Corellia story.

However, just before they departed, and after the Commander had spoken with Lana, Theron told the Commander that he was going with them. When the Commander told him that it would be too dangerous for him to come along, he insisted that he must, as it was a matter concerning his mother. Adding on to that, he assured the Commander that whatever the Emperor was doing, he would be able to resist it, as he had done on Ziost.

Theron was a loyal Republic patriot, refusing to entertained either a notion of defecting when offered by Darth Mekhis and almost instantly suspecting Rian Darok or working against the Republic.

Theron never trusted the Republic Chancellor Leontyne Saresh, feeling betrayed when Rane Kovach was revealed to be working for her and approving the punishment the Commander gave to her on Odessen. It was Saresh's policy that caused Theron to abandon the Republic and join the Alliance, which caused him whatever relationship he had with his father. In the Alliance Theron worked on problems from every angle, to the point that even Lana suggested he take more rest.
