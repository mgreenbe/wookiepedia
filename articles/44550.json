It had been outfitted with enhanced power couplings and sub-systems, which allowed its weapons to fire high powered blasts at a faster rate than average. The performance modifications were built around existing systems, which visibly altered the appearance of the Enhanced T2-B Repulsor Tank from the standard model, with one such difference being the addition of dark colored armor plates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
