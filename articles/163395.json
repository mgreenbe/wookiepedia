Erso particularly focused on Kyber Crystals, which were used to power the primary weapon of the Jedi Knights and Sith\u2014the lightsaber. The crystals were rare in the Galaxy however, so Erso and a field team went to the planet Espinar in search of rare crystals like the Kyber crystals. During the six month expedition on Espinar, Erso's life changed forever after he fell in love with their guide, Lyra. The field team failed to find anything similar to Kyber Crystals, but Lyra and Galen left the planet together."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The wedding"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two were married one year later on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
