In 21 BBY, the Shahmistra held some negotiations with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the leader of the Republic. Palpatine considered the negotiations to be tricky and had chosen to meet with the Shamistra of J'doytzin III himself rather than to entrust the discussion to the Diplomatic Bureau. Their meeting took half an hour, and by the end of their conversation Palpatine had successfully wooed the Shahmistra. However, Palpatine\u2014who was also secretly a Sith Lord and desired to bring the galaxy under Sith rule\u2014found his meeting with the Shahmistra to be rather grating and he vowed that when the Sith came to power the Shahmistra would be among the first people to face Palpatine's retribution."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
