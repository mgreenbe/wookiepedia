The infamous bounty hunter Cad Bane traveled to Rodia to find his next target, the Rodian child Wee Dunn. This mission was part two of a four part mission the Sith Master Darth Sidious assigned to Bane: capture four of the infants listed in the contents of the Kyber memory crystal, a list of every force-sensitive infant in the galaxy. The Jedi Anakin Skywalker, Mace Windu, Yoda, and Obi-Wan Kenobi traced the bounty hunter's kidnappings of the children through the Force, and so Kenobi volunteered to keep an eye on Wee Dunn and to protect the child."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bounty hunter, disguised as a Jedi, failed to convince the child's mother, Mahtee Dunn, that it was time for her son to begin his Jedi training that the Rodian Jedi Master Bolla Ropal had promised her. When she refused to give him the child, Bane resorted to using a hypnogazer, a weapon that alters the victim's mind, to force her to give into his demands. By the time Kenobi had arrived to protect the child, the bounty hunter was already on the run.

Bane deceived Dunn, stating that Jedi impostors had been roaming the galaxy and stealing Force-sensitive children. Bane claimed that in order to keep her son safe, she would need to give her child up for the Jedi training that the fellow Rodian Jedi Bolla Ropal had promised her.

Kenobi made it clear that Bane was no Jedi, as Jedi don't carry blasters: the Jedi weapon of choice is usually a lightsaber. When Kenobi spotted Bane outside, Bane activated his boots, which were modified to hold rocket propulsors, and soared to the landing platform where the Xanadu Blood was parked.
