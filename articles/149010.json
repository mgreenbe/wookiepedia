In 4 ABY, Emperor Palpatine, ruler of the Galactic Empire, was killed at the Battle of Endor, prompting the local Imperial Moff, Kentor Sarne, to withdraw the Kathol sector from the Empire. Four years later, the New Republic launched a campaign against Sarne, liberating the sector capital of Kal'Shebbol and forcing the warlord to flee into the Kathol sector with the majority of his fleet. News of the New Republic's victory at Kal'Shebbol reached the population of Kolatill shortly after, prompting an uprising that resulted in the imprisonment of their Imperial governor, Tetrum, and the reinstatement of the Kolatill Council to lead them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In response to this turn of events, the Imperial Ton-Falk-class escort carrier Kathol Protector arrived in-system and deployed TIE bombers to assault Domaz. The attack left the city aflame and in ruins, leveling much of the infrastructure. Tren survived the assault and, in the aftermath, ran the food distribution efforts from an emergency relief complex. Four days after the attack, the New Republic CR90 corvette FarStar arrived at the planet, having intercepted a distress call about the bombing. Captain Keleman Ciro, commanding officer of the corvette, deployed relief teams to the surface to assist in recovery efforts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to a shortage of available personnel, Tren requested the assistance of FarStar crew members in delivering food supplies to outlying neighborhoods. During the mission, Tren and the New Republic representatives defused an unexploded bomb, protected the supplies from looters, and prevented a building from exploding due to a severe gas leak. They also managed to dig several survivors of the attack out of the rubble of a demolished building."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tren was an effective leader and organizer, running the food distribution efforts in the wake of the bombing of Domaz.
