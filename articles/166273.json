Still, the two men kept in touch and Val later learnt from Jao that another Sith named Darth Luft and his pirate associates had established a presence in the lawless Calamari system. There, they were forcing enslaved Mon Calamari and Quarren refugees to build a pirate fleet.

Once in the Surd Nebula, he decided to launch a comm droid to serve as a beacon since the nebula interfered with the ship's communications. Upon exiting hyperspace, Val's ship crash-landed on Mala, an unidentified dark planet which did not orbit a star and was covered entirely in black rocks. Val's Imperial crew managed to land the ship on top of a rock. The shuttle's stormtroopers immediately fanned out to establish a perimeter around the crash area.

The Sith master gained the upper hand and used the Force to shove Val into the ground. Before the Sith master could deliver his killing blow, he was slain by his own Sith apprentice, an unidentified Human man who donned a mask and cloak. After announcing that his apprenticeship was over, the Sith apprentice imprisoned Val and stole his armor in order to impersonate him.

Meanwhile, the Sith apprentice, who was named Darth Wredd, assumed Val's identity and was rescued by Governor Biala's forces, who maintained a garrison at the communications array in the Carreras system. The \"false\" Val claimed that there was a Sith presence in the Carreras system and that the Sith had attacked his ship and murdered his entire crew, and that he had also lost his lightsaber.

When Val queried why his captor had not chosen to kill him, Wredd replied that he was smarter and more ambitious than his late master. Darth Wredd then presented Val with the choice of embracing the dark side and joining his cause, or waiting in captivity. Meanwhile, Wredd, in his guise as Yalta Val, used Governor Biala's forces in to recover Val's lightsaber from Ania Solo and her associates Sauk and AG-37.

After arriving in the Carreras system, Assam narrowly escaped capture from the \"false\" Val's security force and encountered Ania Solo and her associates on the planet Carreras Minor. Ania and her associates showed Assam the Imperial comm droid's holorecording. Based on the holorecording, Assam quickly deduced that the real Yalta Val had been replaced by an impostor.

While Yalta Val suggested using Darth Wredd as a way to track the underground One Sith, Antares informed him that the Triumvirate was not pursuing Darth Wredd at this time.

Jao disagreed and insisted that Wredd was still a threat. Val explained that he did not like his orders but as an Imperial Knight, he was bound to serve the Force by following the Empress. He reminded Assam to remember his vows and reprimanded the younger Knight for disobeying a direct order to remain in the Ottega system by venturing to Carreras to rescue him.
