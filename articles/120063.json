She pointed out that House Tagge was aware of the heritage of its ancestral ancestor, one of the original founders of the Republic, and continued to support her family's attachment to the Republic, her belief in the Supreme Chancellor, and her willingness to continue serving her faith in the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Baroness, while expressing her loyalty to the Republic unequivocally, withheld promises of concrete assistance to the government. At that time, House Tagge had a fleet of over five thousand armed ships and a private army of over one million soldiers. Nonetheless, Sanya's manifestation of loyalty to a corporation like that of her family was unusual, as most large corporations remained neutral during the crisis. In 20 BBY, the title of House Tagge, with all the privileges, duties, and duties associated with it, fell to Sanya's then seventeen-year-old son Orman. The new Baron Tagge continued the republic-friendly policy of his mother."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
