A hyperspace route connected it to the planet Giju. Kitel Phard shared its name with the Kitel Phard dynasty.

By the time of that conflict, Supreme Leader Snoke of the First Order utilized the Elite Praetorian Guard, a personal bodyguard unit of mysterious origins. The Praetorian Guard's name dated back to the reign of the 14th Atrisian Emperor of Kitel Phard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kitel Phard was first depicted in the current Star Wars canon on a galactic map in the 2016 StarWars.com article \"Where in the Galaxy Are the Worlds of Star Wars: The Force Awakens?\" In the Star Wars Legends continuity, the first mention of \"Kitel Phard\" was in the Imperial Sourcebook, a 1989 supplement written by Greg Gorden for West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game. However, the book did not definitively establish that \"Kitel Phard\" referred to an astronomical object instead of the Kitel Phard Dynasty.
