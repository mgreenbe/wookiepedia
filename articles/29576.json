They were up to a meter and a half tall and covered in feathers. They had a large head in comparison to their lanky body, with a thin neck connecting them; their beaks were filled with small, slashing teeth. Coohas had two thin wings that ended in a long, sharp talon, and two long, thin legs that each ended in a two-toed, taloned foot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cooha primarily fed on the flightless nestlings of noli, a species that, as adults, had powerful beaks and claws. The Cooha's slashing teeth were used to defend it from adults when it raided noli nests. Imperial governor Wilek Nereus of Bakura, a collector of the dentition of predatory creatures, included the cooha's slashing teeth in his collection."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
