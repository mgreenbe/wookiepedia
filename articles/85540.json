Tarrik was the majordomo of the House of Organa around 3 BBY. The Twi'lek Bib Fortuna served as Jabba the Hutt's majordomo during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most majordomos to Hutt crime lords served to run interference with local officials and flatter others in power on behalf of their master, but held little authority of their own. The role was a precarious one, and most lasted only a few months before being ousted. Their terms frequently ended in death, often due to taking bribes, being double-crossed, execution or even murder, after drawing the ire of the Hutt master. One notable exception was Thurible, who was majordomo to Wanbo the Hutt on Teth some time before the Invasion of Naboo. The unintelligent and spice-addicted Wanbo only held power through the efforts of his cunning majordomo, who was the real power on Teth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
