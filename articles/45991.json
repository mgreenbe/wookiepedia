A massive axe, it was a favorite weapon among operatives of the Black Sun, a criminal organization active at the time. Although it was balanced as a two-handed weapon, its low weight gave it the possibility to be used as a one-handed one. Black Sun operatives active within the Death Watch bunker on the forest moon of Endor were known to carry schematics of the weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The executioner's hack appeared in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, which was released on June 26, 2003 and shut down on December 15, 2011. The weapon also appears in weapon indices in two strategy guides released for the game, Star Wars Galaxies: The Total Experience: Prima Official Game Guide and Star Wars Galaxies: The Complete Guide: Prima Official Game Guide. The executioner's hack was made from a schematic which can be looted from enemies in the Death Watch bunker on Endor. The schematic could then be taken to a Munitions Trader who crafted the weapon. Although its in-game description states it could be used as both a two-handed and one-handed weapon, it was only usable by the player as a two-handed weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
