He was deployed on the planet Iskalon where he gathered information and reported it back to the Gamandar Citadel on Iskalon's sister planet. In 3 ABY, the spy was lucky enough to come across the Rebel heroes, Lando Calrissian, Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, and Chewbacca, who were visiting Iskalon. The spy tailed the group as they met with the Iskalonian leader, Primor, learning of their plans. The Rebels were on the world searching for Tay Vanis and had decided to split up in order to search both Iskalon and Gamandar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After gathering as much information as he could, the spy contacted Tower, who elected to fire a missile at Iskalon in hopes that it would kill the Rebel heroes. The spy was ordered to leave in order to avoid the destruction, and he boarded a small shuttle craft following his transmission. As soon as the agent reached the halfway point between Gamandar and Iskalon, he sent word that he was safe. Tower fired the missile immediately afterward, which struck the planet and created a huge tidal wave, which destroyed the city of Pavillion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, several of the Rebels had left the planet before the destruction on a course for Gamandar. Lando Calrissian, disguised and using a false name, contacted Admiral Tower in order to see if he could get more information about Tay Vanis. Tower expected the deception, however, and he asked his spy to watch the meeting in order to identify the Rebels. At the end of the meeting, the spy confirmed that they were the same Rebels who he had uncovered on Iskalon, which led to their arrest and imprisonment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
