Their diet was made up entirely of fruit. The Ementes were known for their suspicion of others. Members of the species had spread into the galaxy by 40 ABY. When the Jedi Mara Jade Skywalker and Kyp Durron met up for a drink at the Sanvia Vitajuice Bar on Coruscant that year, the establishment's clientele was made up almost completely of Ementes. The herbivorous beings preferred Sanvia because they could watch their orders being prepared and thus make sure the bar employees gave them only fruit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ementes appear in the novel Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice, written by Karen Traviss and published by Del Rey in 2007.
