There, the Imperials caused disruption to the mine's operations, which threatened to put the production of Mon Calamari Star Cruisers for the Alliance behind schedule, so the Rebel Alliance dispatched a team of agents to locate the saboteurs. In an attempt to thwart the Rebel's efforts, the Imperials arranged for a group of Quarren thugs to attack the Rebel agents in a local bar. The agents survived the attack and the Imperials murdered Moren Chonk, Morjanssik's Chief Manager, and the Rebels were implicated as having killed him, causing a warrant to be issued for their arrest. The Rebels were arrested, but they soon escaped and made their way to the Morjanssik Mine, where they confronted and defeated the Imperial infiltrators, bringing the Calamari Project to an end."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
