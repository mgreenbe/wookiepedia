It responded to a distress call from an Imperial troop convoy that was under attack by Rebel B-wing starfighters, RZ-1 A-wing interceptors, T-65 X-wing starfighters and BTL Y-wing starfighters. The convoy was under escort from Alpha-class Xg-1 Star Wings belonging to Talon Squadron itself, but was outnumbered, so the frigate called for reinforcements from Avenger Squadron, in the form of TIE Avengers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
