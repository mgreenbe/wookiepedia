He was a clan leader amongst his species prior to the year 36 BBY. Whilst a clan leader, he owed a debt to a Hutt criminal named Wallanooga, who asked him to train a Near-Human slave he had purchased from Senex pirates. The Hutt showed Anis the slave, Aurra Sing, and explained that she had been sold to the Senex by the Jedi known as the Dark Woman, whom the Anzati had heard of but assumed a myth. Sing was too obsessed with violence to be a pleasure slave, but the criminal thought she had potential as a killer. Anis initially refused, saying that he and his trainers would only train fellow Anzati, as their ability to feed on other beings' brains was vital to their technique and as a non-Anzat Sing was nothing but a meal to the clan leader. The Hutt then called in the debt he was owed, and Anis accepted, saying he would accept the slave into his classes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anis assigned Sing to one of his ablest assassins and one of his own past students, Torgo Tahn. Tahn not only trained Sing to be a deadly assassin but attempted to establish a relationship with her, although she rejected his advances. After Sing left his training, Tahn and two of his other students decapitated Anis with a chain, believing that the clan leader was old and dying and so would be grateful to be killed by one of his own students and not by a lucky shot from someone less able. The students then fed upon Anis's brain, not wanting to waste it, but were killed almost immediately after by Tahn for insulting Sing. Tahn then left the Anzat clan shortly after and later recounted the clan leader's death to Sing, whom he had captured, in 36 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anis had blond hair and pale skin. He considered non-Anzati unsuitable for training in Anzati assassin methods and saw them as food. He agreed to honor his debt to Wallanooga, however, and train Aurra Sing despite the fact she wasn't an Anzat, although he saw the matter as somewhat humorous. Torgo Tahn believed that Anis would rather have been killed by one of his own students then someone not as well trained who made a lucky shot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anis first appeared in a flashback in the black-and-white comic Aurra's Song, written by Dean Motter and illustrated by Isaac Buckminster Owens and published in Dark Horse Presents Annual 2000: Girls Rule!.
