A Pathfinder model manufactured by Vangaard Industries, the starship remained unmodified by the scout. At thirty-six meters in length, the scout vessel was equipped with a single turret-mounted laser cannon and could attain speeds of 950 kilometers per hour in atmosphere. It was hyperdrive-equipped, with a Class 3 as primary, and a Class 15 as backup, enabling Tekkirl to use it in his various scouting missions to unexplored and dangerous regions of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bill Smith created the Atrivis Advancer for the West End Games sourcebook Cracken's Rebel Operatives, published in 1994, where it received a brief mention among the items in Flinor Tekkirl's equipment list.
