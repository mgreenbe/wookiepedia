Inside, the door to the pod is cut open and Death Watch soldiers including Pre Vizsla and Bo-Katan Kryze enter. They discover the unconscious Zabrak brothers Maul and Savage Opress. Vizsla finds Maul's lightsaber on the ground and Katan asks if they should eliminate them. Vizsla tells her not to as he wants to know their story. The brothers are loaded into a Kom'rk-class fighter/transport and taken to the Death Watch camp on Zanbar. There, Vizsla orders for his men to help the brothers in any way they could, giving Maul new robotic legs and Savage a cybernetic arm.

Maul listens as Vizsla explains how the ways of New Mandalore and Duchess Satine are responsible for the Death Watch being outcasts on their own planet. Maul questions why the Death Watch waits if Mandalore is weak and Vizsla reveals that Kryze has powerful friends, including Kenobi, who Vizsla also blames for their exile. Vizsla believes that fate brought he and the brothers together and Maul agrees that it was the will of the Force. Maul says he can help Death Watch reclaim Mandalore and kill Kenobi. Katan speaks out that she does not trust the Sith, saying they are no better than the Jedi, and Maul Force chokes her. Maul promises that all of their enemies will fall if Death Watch allies itself with the Nightbrothers before he lets Katan go.

As Moj and the guards move in, Vizsla points his blaster at them and Savage kills one of the soldiers by snapping his neck like a twig and tossing the body onto the council table.

When Oruba asks if they have anything at all to trade, Maul responds that he will spare their lives in exchange for Hutt Space and everything it possesses. The Hutts respond with bellowing laughter and Jabba calls for his bounty hunters. Sugi hurls a knife at Maul but it is stopped mid-throw by Opress.
