They were small, starfighter-sized vessels with a bell-shaped hull loosely based on the toothspike raptor from the planet Colla IV, and were 18.5 meters in length. Its engines were mounted where a bell's yoke would be located, and around its base were four long, retractable spikes. Centered inside the base was a hatch that provided access to a cramped passenger compartment and a single-seat flight deck."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As its name suggested, the Droch-class was designed for boarding actions against enemy ships. Launched en masse from their mother ships, they could carry six fully equipped troops or battle droids, and they could fly at their targets at a maximum speed of 850 kilometers per hour, where they would proceed to use their spikes to pierce a target ship's hull and anchor themselves. Once a Droch had attached, a plasma cutting ring burned a hole through the hull, and a boarding tube extends from the hatch, where the troops would proceed to enter the target ship. These vessels were also armed with four turret-mounted twin light laser cannons, and were equipped with close-ranged sensors and had one day's worth of consumables."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Droch-class boarding ship first appeared in \"Rising Malevolence, the second episode of the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars' first season, which originally aired on October 3, 2008.
