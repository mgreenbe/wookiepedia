Initially developed to swiftly eradicate Separatist holdouts that remained after the Clone Wars and to bring Core Worlds under the control of the Empire, the Onager-class saw service throughout the Imperial Era. By the time after the Death Star was active, the Onager was considered to be a possibly greater threat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the decisive Battle of Endor in 4 ABY saw the supposed death of Galactic Emperor Palpatine and the defeat of the Empire, the Onager was seen by the remains of the Empire as a vital instrument to regain power in the Galactic Civil War. There were several examples of this class, including the Cataclysm, the Rakehell, the Sunder, and the Onager-class Testbed. A notable characteristic of the Onager was its alleged kyber crystal-powered superweapons, which could either be Superheavy Composite Beam Turbolasers or Orbital Bombardment Particle Cannons. These weapons were powerful enough to engage capital ships from extremely long range, as well as conduct cataclysmic assaults on planets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the Galactic Civil War and the rise of the Empire's successor government, the First Order, it was believed by members of the Resistance, a private military force with roots to the Rebel Alliance and New Republic, that the First Order may have used technology or inspiration from the Onager. During the war between the First Order and the Resistance, the First Order Navy deployed the Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought which served with similar function as the Onager-class.

A solar ionization reactor was located in the ventral hull, characterized by its dome shape. The bridge was situated inside the elevated command tower at the center of the ship toward the rear, and the bridge itself was located on a near-trapezoidal structure on top of the command tower. The Onager-class Star Destroyer was equipped with advanced targeting and extreme-ranged sensor arrays as well as a navigation computer. It featured a primary class 1.75 hyperdrive and a class 6 backup."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The front of the ship was defined by two prongs that defined the bow as a hammerhead-like T-shaped structure with a long indentation in the center that cut through to almost midship where the primary armament was located. Beyond the end of the indentation but before the command tower structure were two deflector shield generator domes similar to those found in Imperial-class Star Destroyers, as well as several other deflector shield generators. The deflector shields, however, were concentrated in the front of the vessel due to the ship's forward firepower being its unique characteristic. More than half of deflector shields were concentrated toward the front of the vessel, and as such, the aft and sides of the Onager-class were more exposed, leaving the engines and flanks vulnerable. This trade-off was considered to be acceptable by the designers of the vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Also in the same fashion as Imperial-class Star Destroyers, the Onager-class had a ridge that traversed the port and starboard sides of the vessel. The Onager-class had two hangar bays, one located on the rear of each of the two prongs that formed the T-shape of the bow. Its complement consisted of six Lambda-class T-4a shuttles as well as thirty-six TIE line starfighters. The Onager-class was operated by 25,200 personnel that consisted of officers, pilots, and enlisted crew and was capable of holding 240 troops. The vessel maintained consumables for one year."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Armament"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Superweapons"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located in the indentation was the primary armament of the Onager-class, which was either two shorter-ranged Superheavy Composite Beam Turbolasers that were considered to operate as special battery armaments, or two Orbital Bombardment Particle Cannons that were classified as mass-driver cannons. These weapons were speculated by members of the Rebel Alliance to be powered by kyber crystals , believing the crystals were powerful enough to shatter mountains and anything but the strongest energy shield. Because of this, the rebels considered the ship to be a superweapon. The foundation of the weapons was at the end of the indentation by the bridge, and each weapon had at least three rings that were separated along the length of the indentation through which the payload of the weapons passed. When these armaments fired, the indentation and rings glowed red or blue, depending on whether the Orbital Bombardment Particle Cannons or Superheavy Composite Beam Turbolasers were used, respectively."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The particle cannons could fire almost simultaneously one after the other, while the beam turbolasers could be fired at the same time. These two Superheavy Composite Beam Turbolasers and Orbital Bombardment Particle Cannons were considered some of the Galactic Empire's most devastating weaponry and could be used to perform ignition attacks from beyond long range, allowing it to keep the crew of the vessel safe. Against fleets, the Superheavy Composite Beam Turbolasers focused on using auto-fire to burn through a lone target or sweep several targets as a cutting beam. If it used the Orbital Bombardment Particle Cannons, the Onager attempted to shatter the most dangerous enemy vessel immediately. These weapons in the indentation of the vessel were longer than half of the ship. The primary armaments required an enormous amount of power, and the power conduits were susceptible to attack. The destruction of the main weaponry by a focused strike could cause a catastrophic failure to the systems of the ship, leaving it critically damaged or destroyed entirely."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Standard armaments"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Onager-class was also equipped with a number of ship-based weaponry throughout its hull ridges on its starboard and port sides, as well as near the hangars in the pronged sections of the ship.

It was originally conceived to ruthlessly end the deadlock of powerful planetary shields deployed by Separatist holdouts, revolutionary Core Worlds, and other dissident planets. When conducting orbital strikes, it targeted the shield generator and other ground-based defenses. As an uncommon ship, it was used for specific operations. It was also deployed against anti-fleet actions, and in this regard, targeted the largest enemy vessels. It was usually accompanied by escort vessels to protect its flanks, and deployed its starfighters to defend its bow from critical strikes against enemy fighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel Alliance believed that the Siege Breaker, if their intelligence was correct, acted in the capacity of a portable cannon. The deployment of Onager-class Star Destroyers in more sensitive Imperial operations had the characteristic of not being able to be confirmed or denied, and was unlike the common Victory-class and Imperial-class Star Destroyers. Since the Siege Breaker could destroy a base from orbit or punch through a cruiser, it was considered to be a valuable addition to fleets. Although the Death Star was one of the most visible symbols of the Empire's power, it was not their only superweapon, since the Onager-class was hidden in secrecy and may have been considered an even greater threat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early operational history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Clone Wars, the Galactic Empire desired a warship that could efficiently and effectively shorten costly prolonged planetary sieges.

Colonel Delto, however, reported to Cracken on what was known as a Siege Breaker. His analysis led him to believe that the Empire could build thousands of relatively smaller cannons, which the Rebel Alliance dubbed Siege Breakers, for the cost of a single \"planet-killer.\" The document also included possible speculation on the characteristics and armament of the Siege Breaker, an illustration of a Siege Breaker, and a comparison to a Jedi lightsaber, as they both could cut through almost any material while fitting comfortably within a satchel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Delto used the document to pursue the principle that the Siege Breaker was more likely than a large \"planet-killing\" battle station. After receiving both reports by Harinar and Delto, Cracken included them in his own report to Alliance Chancellor and Commander-in-Chief Mon Mothma. The report was later included in The Rebel Files, a central data repository that contained sensitive non-electric documents. Eventually, it was discovered that the \"planet-killer\" was the Death Star, a battle station that had the ability to destroy entire worlds. At one point during the Imperial Era, an Imperial moff ordered an Onager-class Star Destroyer to destroy a city from orbit.

Even during the Galactic Civil War that took place by 4 BBY and lasted to 5 ABY, the Onager-class Star Destroyer was continually refined, and the Testbed allowed for the deployment of the Onager in its experimental variant. The Rakehell at one point was accompanied by two Victory-class Star Destroyers, while the Cataclysm was stationed near a pair of gravity wells and received a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle and two TIE line starfighters. The Sunder at one point participated in a battle against a Rebel Alliance MC80 Liberty Type Heavy Star Cruiser inside an asteroid field and sustained major damage. The Onager-class Testbed at some point fired its primary armament on a terrestrial body.

When Fantasy Flight Games saw the design, it was further developed for their product as the design was appealing and fulfilled a gameplay need. In the English and Latin languages, the onager (\u02c8\u0251n\u0259d\u0292\u0259r) was a type of Roman siege catapult weapon.
