On his first mission with Koon, Wolffe served on board the Jedi Master's flagship, the Triumphant, when Koon led a task force to eliminate the Separatist warship Malevolence. While confronting the Malevolence in the Abregado system, all the troopers from the Wolfpack who were on board the ship were eliminated, save for Koon, Wolffe, and troopers Sinker and Boost. The four were rescued by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, and Wolffe had his unit adopt new clone trooper armor in honor of his fallen comrades.

However, Wolffe came to see reason when Rex spoke up for the rebels and told him they were not a threat. Under Rex's command, Wolffe and Gregor held back Kallus's AT-AT walkers so that the rebels could escape. Following the battle, he and Gregor stayed behind on Seelos while Rex joined the rebellion.

Wolffe talked with Heater and gave him command of a squad of deserters, including clone troopers Sync, Charlie, and Racetrack, telling them they would be free to make their decision concerning their continued service after they completed the mission.

Wolffe informed Koon that the Malevolence had spotted them and had reduced its speed, prompting Koon and Wolffe to report their position and request reinforcements from the nearest Republic military presence: the fleet of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who were in the nearby Bith system.

Just then, another pod appeared through their pod's viewport, but the clones within had fallen victim to rocket battle droids manning a boarding ship\u2014their pod had been \"cracked open\".

Wolffe picked up a signal from Commander Ahsoka Tano and her master General Skywalker, who had come to search for survivors, against a direct order from the Jedi Council and the Supreme Chancellor. Wolffe informed Koon that the Jedi were coming, and Koon then ordered him not to lose the signal as the droid's craft damaged the pod enough that it began to lose pressure. Koon destroyed the craft using his lightsaber and the Force, defeating the droids. Koon, Boost and Sinker remained outside of the doomed pod to allow Wolffe more oxygen as he used his connection to the Force to relay their position to Tano.

Koon, Skywalker and Tano, in the Twilight's bridge, shut down all the ship's systems and Skywalker's astromech droid, R2-D2. However, the 2-1B surgical droid, TB-2, was not shut down and the Malevolence picked up the signal from the droid and fired an ion blast at the Twilight as a result. Skywalker, however, a prestigious pilot, used his skills to escape the debris field, evade the ion blast and enter hyperspace.
