He further announced that he was going to challenge the monarch to face him in an event known as a Doom-Joust. The only way that S'Shah could be replaced as king, was if he were defeated at this particular sporting event. He asked Luke to act as his squire. Luke's ego had grown sizable enough by this point that he disliked the idea of being referred to as a squire, but he agreed to help Elglih regardless. As fate would have it, Elglih proved too old and infirm to compete in the event. Luke acted as his second and killed King S'Shah. By rite of combat, the crown of Serphidi was bequeathed to Luke Skywalker. Luke, in turn, passed the position to Elglih crowning him as the new monarch. Elglih pledged his loyalty to the Rebel Alliance and vowed to do everything within his power to keep Imperial influences off Serphidi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like all members of his species, Elglih had reptilian features with red scales running across the length of his body.
