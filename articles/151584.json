On one such occasion, he recruited a party from the cantina on Roldalna. The job was to transport spice from Nigel VI to Lohopa II, however the crates actually contained lexonite, a deadly poison from Nigel VI. Possessing the poison was illegal on Nigel VI, with immediate execution the penalty. The poison was intended to be used by Imperial terrorists against the fledgling New Republic. Und'l was unaware of the sinister nature of the package when he recruited the smugglers, but they held him responsible nevertheless."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
