It continues with moments from Parade of the Ewoks and more bits and pieces from the Ewok Battle. Towards the end, a part of the song appears that also appears in the alternate take of the Sail Barge Assault, a bonus track featured on the first disc of the same soundtrack, and involves plucked strings. At 2:50, the finale of the music resembles no music from any of the movies, or soundtracks. Music from The Ewok Battle builds up to the most exciting moments of the piece. It uses scaling brass leading up to orchestra hits chording, interrupted by goofy Ewok music for a few seconds and booming drums."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though this music is not actually in the movies, the first three seconds are edited to repeat in the beginning of the Seduction TV Spot for Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. The last 41 seconds are used in the trailer for the video game Star Wars: Battlefront, the end of the trailer for Lego Star Wars II:The Original Trilogy, and the theatrical trailer for Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones (titled Clone War), both with the Ewok interruption edited out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is the twelfth track of the second disc of the soundtrack for Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
