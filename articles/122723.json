Jedi could use the Force to probe the mind of another to determine whether or not that individual had the potential to use the Force. The subconscious of a Force-sensitive was protected by a barrier that prevented another Force user from invading their mind. The barrier violently rejected the probe as an involuntarily defense mechanism. Jedi seeking to see if an individual was Force-sensitive could deliberately stimulate the area in order to trigger a reaction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
