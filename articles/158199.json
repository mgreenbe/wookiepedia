Locking on to these frequencies, the compass allowed the user to use this information to determine the position of the user and possible routes to a destination, as well as other local conditions that might impeded or assist in travel. Traffic data, information on local businesses, customs, landmarks, and government facilities could also be accessed quickly from an up-to-date compass."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
