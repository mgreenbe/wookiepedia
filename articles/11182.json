As a Jedi Master, she held the rank of Jedi General within the Grand Army of the Republic, and commanded a squad of clone troopers. In 20 BBY, Utrila and Omani, along with their troops were dispatched to the Outer Rim Territories moon of Draay 2. According to a holocron, it was said that the Jedi Temple on the moon stored a dangerous Sith artifact, the Gauntlet of Kressh the Younger\u2014a device that, according to legend, could render its user impervious to all physical harm. The Jedi High Council hoped to prevent the artifact falling into the hands of Confederacy of Independent Systems leader Count Dooku, and so it was Utrila's task to either bring the Gauntlet back to Coruscant or secure it permanently."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Making their way to the moon, the Jedi were accompanied by the clone troopers Lieutenant \"Law\", \"Cannon\", \"Glitch\", and \"Horns\".

Law then activated a lamp droid before leading his squad in to secure the temple. Utrila and her Padawan followed into a cavernous hall.

Utrila instructed Law to have his men hold their fire as she and her apprentice attacked in unison with their lightsabers\u2014again, the droid emerged unscathed. Glitch tried in vain to use the Force on the machine\u2014Utrila then realized that the droid was specifically designed to defend the temple from Sith, not Jedi.

Familiar with such devices, Utrila explained to her Padawan that the mechanism would open with a lightsaber blade inserted into the correct hole\u2014an insertion into any other hole would bring the entire temple down on their heads. With a flourish, the Twi'lek activated one of her lightsabers and plunged it into one of the holes without hesitation, successfully opening the chamber. Along with Law and the clones, the Jedi began exploring, and Utrila advised Omani to reach out in the Force to detect any future dangers. The Padawan was unsure of how to do this, causing the Jedi Master to despair\u2014she explained that the Force flowed through all living beings and could help them sense the echoes of those who had walked the halls of the temple in the past.

Ordering Omani to assist the troops, Utrila decided to retrieve the Gauntlet herself\u2014the Padawan, however, soon discovered that the creatures were lightsaber-resistant as well.

Law was curious as to how they would extract the artifact, but Utrila, explaining her brief ordeal with the Gauntlet, decided that it would not be safe to remove it\u2014instead, she was satisfied that they had confirmed its location, and now had to set about ensuring it would not fall into Count Dooku's possession.

An explosion thrust the clone trooper into the temple hall, and he was followed by Mandalorian Death Watch commandos, led by Pre Vizsla, who had taken Omani prisoner. Vizsla, having followed the Jedi to the moon in the hopes of retrieving the Gauntlet himself, ordered the Republic force to drop their weapons lest he harm Omani\u2014Utrila and the clones complied. The Mandalorian then demanded that Utrila lead him to the Gauntlet, before being distracted by the markings on the helmet of trooper Horns\u2014those of the Death Watch.

Law then informed the Jedi Master that she was expected on Coruscant\u2014before departing Omani speculated as to what would happen with the Gauntlet of Kressh the Younger, specifically if anyone would be assigned to defend it. Utrila was confident however, that no such measures would need to be taken\u2014what she did not realize was that Glitch had taken the Gauntlet for himself and as such, had survived the temple's destruction.

Grievous mutilated and felled Moudama quickly, leaving Utrila to battle the general by herself.

She would constantly utilize real scenarios to help instruct her Jedi Padawan, Rennax Omani, but despaired when the young Human would forget basic teachings from her early days at the Temple. She was nonetheless appreciative and proud of her apprentice's efforts, but acknowledged Omani's desire to leave the Jedi Order after the encounter with the Death Watch and the Gauntlet of Kressh the Younger on Draay 2.
