To his astonishment, the ship is hailed by Lord Superior Bosmihi, who eagerly petitions for the Kroctari's readmission into the Empire, having followed \"Thrawn's\" return with enthusiasm and fed up with Coruscant's lack of interest in their security. \"Thrawn\" appoints Disra to handle negotiating the finer points with Bosmihi. Aside, Disra angrily demands to know what Tierce is up to - even if Kroctar is legally free to defect from the New Republic, such a move will only increase the chances of Coruscant retaliating against the Empire, something it is definitely not ready for. He points out that Tierce is too good a tactician not to have considered this, and must have some greater scheme in mind, and Disra demands to know what it is. After a moment's thought, Tierce confides that while he was serving aboard the Chimera during the real Thrawn's campaign against the New Republic, Thrawn mentioned \"The Hand of Thrawn\" as the key to the Empire's ultimate and total victory. Tierce has never found any reference to the term in any Imperial record, and is not sure if the Hand is a person, a super-weapon, or some piece of vital information, but if the Hand is out there, then the best way of luring it or its holder into the open is to spread the word of \"Thrawn\"'s return."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character Alex Winger, who had previously appeared in several short stories from author Charlene Newcomb, makes a brief appearance in Vision of the Future.
