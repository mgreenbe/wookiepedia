The cadet was part of Unit Besh, one of two four-man units which made up the cadet squad LRC077. When Unit Besh and Unit Aurek, the other unit in LRC077, were summoned to the Well training facility in the academy, Thurgos and another member of Unit Besh named Betancy were ordered by Taskmaster Myles Grint to not take part in the exercise and instead stand with Sergeant Currahee and Units Cresh and Dorn. Thurgos and Betancy's shoulders slumped when given they were given the order, but the cadets obeyed and removed their helmets before walking away from their squad."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
