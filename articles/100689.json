It consisted of addicting Sith troopers to a new drug, the Deluge, in order to make them easy targets for later battles. The operation was conducted under the cover of the mercy organization Grace Command and the supposedly voluntary Starfighters squadron Devil Squadron. In the process, entire civilian populations were inundated with the drug which destabilized entire planets throughout the Grumani sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Capture of Devil Squadron, the Hutt crime lord attempted to emulate Operation Deluge's success by synthesizing his own drugs and lacing food supplies with Deluge. By affecting every adult and child in the Grumani sector, Zodoh sought to weaken Sith resistance and become the undisputed ruler of the region. However, these plans were disrupted by Captain Jenn Devaad sabotaging the food containers carrying Deluge with time-rigged explosives and Zodoh's untimely demise at the Battle of Darkknell. This ended any Hutt ambitions of challenging Sith domination in Sith Space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Aquilaris campaign, Devaad and Holt came up with a strategy to sabotage Operation Deluge. Devaad would return to Grace Command and claim that she had gotten for distributing the Deluge on Aquilaris Minor. This ensured that Grace Command would continue to send a transport ship which Devaad would personally fly to and from Sith occupied words. En route, she would get rid of the Deluge while returning to the Republic with civilian refugees. With its underwater Harvester stations, Aquilaris would become a major hub for refugees within the Grumani sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
