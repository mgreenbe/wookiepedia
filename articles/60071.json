A high-powered automated rotating ball turret mounted on the dorsal side of the craft could shoot at targets by itself when the ship's pilot was otherwise occupied. After the Invasion of Naboo, Jinkins added a bank of concussion missiles, proximity mines, and cruise missiles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Deadly as all these armaments were, they were nothing in comparison to the ultimate power of the Havoc: a concealed bomblet generator, capable of fashioning potent energy bombs by drawing from the power of the ship's reactor core. The original prototype was equipped with proton bombs that were released via two bomb chutes. However, after the modifications, the rather unstable bomblet generator could provide an infinite number of bombs for Nym's destructive needs.[source?] This was also supplemented with a charged bomb, called the plasma scourge, which was even deadlier. This generator was totally modular, allowing its safe removal for use in other craft when necessary."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Havoc also possessed a small cargo hold, which Nym utilized when delivering blaster carbines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The original Scurrg H-6 bomber design required a minimum crew of five: one pilot, a gunner for the turret, a secondary gunner, a navigator, and a demolitions expert in charge of the bombs. However, the intensive modifications wrought by Jinkins allowed Nym to fly the starfighter alone, with only two astromech droids as backup."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Birth of a fighter"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Havoc was a one-of-a-kind prototype constructed by the Nubia Star Drives, Incorporated. The Nubians hoped to sell an entire line of these formidable starfighters to the Naboo, but the pacifistic world rejected them as being too heavily armed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lead designer and engineer for the Havoc, a Bith named Jinkins, attempted fruitlessly to convince the Collective that the Scurrg H-6 model still had hope. After a few years of worthless lobbying, the Collective placed the bomber into indefinite storage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A disillusioned Jinkins conspired with Nym to steal the bomber, and after their narrow escape, they set out to form the Lok Revenants.[source?] The intricate design on the Havoc's wings was the logo of the pirate band, which established a permanent base on the planet Lok."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fighting the Federation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He used it until he was captured by the mercenary Vana Sage. He later escaped with the help of a disguised Jinkins and Kole. He continued to use it in raids against Trade Federation shipping in the Karthakk system. In 32 BBY, the Federation took control of Nym's base, and Nym loaned his services and his starfighter to the Naboo Resistance. Nym, Sage, and the Naboo pilot Rhys Dallows teamed up to attack a Federation factory on Eos, then stole armaments in a dogfight over Naboo. Nym and Sage then joined the defense of a Resistance outpost.

He and his crew joined the Jedi Master Adi Gallia. The Revenants attacked Spacestation 1138 to free prisoners, then fought Sabaoth Squadron on Maramere. The Havoc was also used in the multistage battle of Nod Kartha. Nym then flew his starfighter to free his base from the Trade Federation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the height of the Galactic Civil War nearly 22 years later, the Empire created a model of the infamous starfighter, which were later sold during Empire Day by various Imperial organizers of the festivities.
