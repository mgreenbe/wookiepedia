However, before the craft was sent on its way, it was stolen by gambler and criminal Lando Calrissian, in order to pay off a debt with Papa Toren, a crime boss operating off of Castell. Calrissian and his team of criminals, Lobot, Korin Pers, Aleksin and Pavol, spacewalked to the shipyard in stealth suits, sliced into an airlock and knocked a pair of stormtrooper sentries unconsciousness, raced through the wheel-section of the shipyard, boarded the Imperialis, and blasted away from the shipyard.
