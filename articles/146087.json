The shuttle had the markings of the Hapan Royal House on the hull and was capable of traveling in hyperspace. In 23 ABY, Ta'a Chume, the matriarch of Hapes, ordered Yfra, her personal ambassador, to pick up Tenel Ka, the Hapan-Dathomiri princess, from Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 after Tenel Ka had lost most of her left arm when her lightsaber exploded. Yfra picked up Tenel Ka in the Thunder Wraith in the middle of the night and transported her to Hapes where Chume, her grandmother, was waiting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Thunder Wraith first appeared in the 1996 Young Jedi Knights: Lightsabers by Kevin J.
