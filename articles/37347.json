Although the Tuskens refused to sell their sacred wine, they did offer some to Jabba the Hutt. The Hutt, having discovered that the beverage had an exceptional taste, started selling it in small, hard to come by bottles under the name Tusken Wind. At its peak, the price for a single measure rose to 12,000 credits. Soon thereafter, however, a cartel on Coruscant figured out how to synthesize the desert wine, making it commercially worthless."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
