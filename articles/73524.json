Around 13 BBY, the Kaldana sold the flagship in order to enter an auction for a datacube that contained plans for a shield generator. After the auction was eventually won by the Kaldana, the Droid Gotra paid the auctioneer, an Imperial defector known as the Engineer, to destroy a Kaldana ship that arrived to collect the datacube. Following this, Qi'ra noted to Han that with the loss of their flagship and over a billion credits, only a few of the pirates would remain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
