Krossen looked as if he was put together from many different creatures: His arms were from a gundark, and his legs from a Gamorrean. His blood came from a terentatek, which made it immune to the Force. He wore a metal mask and silver armor all over his body. Project Krossen was scheduled for mass-production against the Galactic Republic, but the prototype was defeated by Bant Eerin's Padawan and a clone named Sergeant Lex before it could be perfected."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
