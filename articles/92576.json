The building was a large hangar in which Monarg would house and repair starships; his efforts were aided by a legion of mechanic droids that he owned. There were doors on both ends of the shop that Monarg often kept open when cool winds blew from the continent's southern coasts, and the windows were situated four meters above the exterior ground. Monarg kept a computer console on a desk near one of the doors. In 43 ABY, Monarg housed the SoroSuub StarTripper Yacht She's a Chancer in his shop after purchasing it from the Sith apprentice Vestara Khai; the shop was soon after infiltrated by the astromech droid R2-D2. When one of R2-D2's masters, Allana Solo, arrived to rescue her droid, a brief skirmish ensued within the shop that ultimately resulted in Solo, R2-D2, and the droid's counterpart C-3PO escaping. Shortly thereafter, the yacht was seized by the spaceport's deputy director of operations, Tarth Vames, and given to the former Jedi candidate Dyon Stadd, who renamed it Bright Sun."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
