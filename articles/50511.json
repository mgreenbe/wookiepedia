The basic information in the guide was provided to members of the Brotherhood in good standing, with further features available for a nominal fee. Information in the guide was verified and accurate where possible, but the Brotherhood did not guarantee complete accuracy. They also refused to take responsibility for any lost profits or potential harm that resulted in following information in the Guide. The Free-Trader's Guide had a feature known as \"Trader's Gamble\" which alerted members in good standing of potentially lucrative trading opportunities. These markets were usually in remote, dangerous, and unpleasant places."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
