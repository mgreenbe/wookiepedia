When they were founded, they were an honest organization, but over the years, they were influenced by the growing criminal element present on the planet. They became known for their corruption, and were allied with the Bombaasa Cartel by 8 ABY. They had acquired several New Republic B-wing starfighters over the years, and modified them by sacrificing shielding and hull strength for extra speed and maneuverability. Members of the Security Legion were known as Legionnaires, and they were generally Humans. In 8 ABY, they were led by Chief Magistrate Kebbo, and enforced the will of the Bombaasa Cartel on the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
