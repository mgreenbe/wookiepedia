It bore an uncanny resemblance to the W-165 planetary turbolaser and there were accusations of corporate espionage. Regardless it used four times as much energy as the W-165 and was capable of completely obliterating an Imperial Star Destroyer. It required a crew of 46 to operate but could get by with a skeleton crew of 21."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
