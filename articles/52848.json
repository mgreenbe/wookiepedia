Any crime or business reports were archived, and could later be retrieved by information droids. In 3956 BBY, a report was filed by the municipal authorities about a fight between two colonists named Calder Nettic and Rickard Lusoff. The archive also contained a report that showed Nettic and a man named Handon Guld had rented a speeder together several times. This information was later retrieved by a droid during an investigation into Nettic's death carried out by Jedi Knight Bolook and Revan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
