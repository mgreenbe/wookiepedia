It was built on a mesa, like all other settlements on Endregaad, to avoid the sandstorms that beset the valleys and canyons of that world. The closest other communities were a day's walk away. Tel Bollin had a geode Miners' Guildhall, a warehouse belonging to Skydove Freight, a cantina called the Fallen Warrior and a disused sports ground. The city had a City Hall, the center of all local administration, and apparently the highest level authority on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pre-Republic era ruins were near Tel Bollin, though they had not been studied."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
