Luke Skywalker used this move at a Jedi Convocation on Ossus during the Dark Nest Crisis in 36 ABY, asking every Jedi to rethink their commitment to the Order. This was to distract them so they would have trouble noticing Luke's power play in becoming Jedi Grand Master."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
