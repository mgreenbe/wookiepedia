As written by the band's founder and manager, Gilthos Uksaris, the draft told of how the band originated as a mere ploy of Uksaris's to secure a date with the singer Elinda. The narrative recounted the recruitment of the Bith musician brothers Ujaa and Ujii, and the band's early struggles as a result of Ujaa's lackluster performance, resulting in their replacement by Loopa and Fodo, respectively.

Nevertheless, Uksaris was adamant that the potential reward\u2014for Kang to sign them onto a major touring contract\u2014outweighed these risks.
