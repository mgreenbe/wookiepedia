Between 25,126 BBY and 25,116 BBY, he launched a campaign to conquer the Thanium Worlds. The most notable battle was founght at the planet Ranroon, ruled by the Queen Hylei Indrexu Cortess. The Queen's forces fought Xim's janissaries and resisted bravely in a fierce battle eventually won by the Despot. Impressed, Xim later named his trasure ship Queen of Ranroon. The Ihala Spiral was renamed Indrexu Spiral by Xim in her honor, as well the Far Indrexu, the region conquered after Indrexu's defeat.
