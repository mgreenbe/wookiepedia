Such terminals generally listed the employer, the job available, and the amount of credits offered for successful completion of the task outlined. Mission terminals were subject to slicing, which allowed individuals with the right skills to increase the payout offered. Typical opportunities offered on such devices might include delivery of a cargo, destruction of some target, apprehension of a wanted subject, creation of goods for sale, bookings for performances, or reconnaissance.
