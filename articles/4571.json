Sometime between 52 and 43 BBY, Aitch-Sixteen was ordered to fit laser capacitors into the interceptor of the Jedi Knight Rael Averross. After speaking with the Jedi Master Dooku in the hangar, Averross called out to Aitch-Sixteen, asking whether the droid had fitted the laser capacitors. Aitch-Sixteen had not finished the job, replying to Averross in binary, and the Jedi Knight scolded the astromech droid, claiming it had been given enough time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aitch-Sixteen first appeared in the audiobook Dooku: Jedi Lost, written by Cavan Scott and published in 2019.
