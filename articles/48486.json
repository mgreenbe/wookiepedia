The yacht was mostly stock except for upgraded deflector shields and an added ion cannon that had been taken from a BTL Y-wing starfighter. It was well known as a charter craft for \"up and comers\" who needed to entertain important persons in style, but who couldn't afford a ship of their own."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Serdo had a reputation for being a trustworthy and reliable being. In actuality, Serdo's charter business with the Firerider was a cover for his spice-smuggling operation. His high profile clients provided the perfect shield against customs agents, counting on the fact that customs officials wouldn't chance inconveniencing a Moff, a powerful executive or a high-ranking military officer with an intrusive customs inspection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unknown to either Serdo, the Firerider was a disaster waiting to happen. On one of Serdo's last runs Imperial Intelligence managed to sabotage the navigational computer in an attempt to assassinate a group of Rebel sympathizers traveling on the ship from Coruscant to the Mid Rim. The virus in the nav computer would lie dormant until a specific set of hyperspace coordinates was entered. When activated, the virus would simulate a general systems failure, shutting down power, communications, propulsion and life support, dooming the ship's passengers and crew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After retiring, Serdo sold the Firerider to a Bith named Fiz Cor'gril on Trevi IV. The craft sat on the lot of Fizzi's Slightly Used Starships for some time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
