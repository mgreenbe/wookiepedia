For many years, it was the property of Morag the Tulgah witch, who lived on the Forest Moon of Endor. Morag used the artifact for her dark magic, particularly in her schemes to conquer the Ewoks of Bright Tree Village. Morag eventually regained possession of the Sunstar from Logray, the shaman of the tribe, and combined it with the Shadowstone. While this made her incredibly powerful, Logray outsmarted the witch and vanquished Morag once and for all. The Ewok shaman subsequently hid the newly formed Sunstar-Shadowstone to keep it from once again falling into the wrong hands. Alongside the Sunstar, the Shadowstone was later used to destroy the Griagh, but ended up destroyed in the process."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
