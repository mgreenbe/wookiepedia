As forces of the Galactic Republic searched for the Huttlet Rotta, who the Separatists held in the monastery, the OOM command battle droid ordered a B1 battle droid sergeant to attack the approaching transports, silencing the sergeant after he brought up the possibility that the transports were their own. After the Republic force landed and reached the base of the cliff below the monastery, the sergeant, attempting to locate the enemy, fell off of the edge, and the command battle droid ordered him to return to his post. Despite the Separatists' fire against the Republic forces, Jedi Master Anakin Skywalker, his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, and their force of clone troopers reached the monastery, destroying the battle droids stationed outside."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
