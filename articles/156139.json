She was an expert with transmitters who enjoyed drinking as well as writing obscene poetry together with the rebel trooper Hazram Namir during late, dull nights. On at least one occasion, the comm tech made an obscene gesture at another individual with her eyes closed, a mannerism which Namir appropriated for himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime between the years 0 BBY and 3 ABY, the 61st was deployed on the terrestrial astronomical object Asyrphus. However, Asyrphus was bombarded, and the comm tech, her droid and many other 61st members were massacred as a result. The comm tech was not replaced in the 61st, and Namir pledged to forget her name, though he later remembered her on several occasions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The comm tech was mentioned in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
