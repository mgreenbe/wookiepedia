Plasteel retained the elastic strength of plastics while benefiting from the strength and heat resistance of metal. However, it was not a miracle substance. Pressed thin enough for comfortable armor, plasteel would not impede a blaster bolt, or even an old-fashioned slug. Plasteel was most commonly used in armor, spaceship components, containers, and construction. It was capable of yellowing with age."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Scarab Droid's body casing was made of plasteel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The word plasteel is a portmanteau of plastic and steel.
