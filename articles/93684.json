The Mu-class came in three distinct variants; Model 1 had limited crew space and seating for 24 passengers, making it ideal for short-range missions. Model 2 was best suited for long-range scouting missions, with enclosed cabins, a galley, and reduced passenger space. A third model was designed for the Galactic Empire to transport platoon-sized units, including special missions and stormtrooper forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
