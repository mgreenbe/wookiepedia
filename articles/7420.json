Draco retired to his quarters and consulted the holocron of his former Master Eshkar Niin. His trusted friend and fellow Imperial Knight Ganner Krieg visited him at that time, and as the two sat at the table, Krieg advised Draco to master the anger he felt over Marasiah's capture by the Sith. Draco then recruited Krieg and the Jedi Knight Shado Vao for an infiltration of Korriban."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Antares Draco's quarters were introduced in the forty-ninth and penultimate issue of the comic series Star Wars: Legacy, which was written by John Ostrander, penciled by Jan Duursema, and released in June 2010."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
