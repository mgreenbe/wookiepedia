Linrec had arranged Cressis' wedding to Moff Raiss. However, disliking Raiss, she decided to run away with a local pirate, Jondrell Inx. Inx feigned interest, but in reality he wanted to sell her to the Zygerrian Slavers Guild if Linrec did not pay a hefty ransom. As Inx operated on Kallistas, Linrec notified his underling, Prefect Dengless Rinn, to look for his daughter.
