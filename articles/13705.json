During a flight over the Mid Rim world, a transport carrying a platoon of Republic soldiers from the Army's 45th Infantry Division was shot down. Lieutenant Elin Garza, the platoon's commander, proceeded to lead her surviving forces in a guerrilla campaign against the Imperial Military units on the planet. Aided by the embedded Republic Strategic Information Service agent Marcus Trant, Garza and her troops eventually succeeded in liberating Bomodon, achieving an unlikely and uncommon victory for the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire that began in 3681 BBY commenced in a severely negative fashion for the Republic. At the outset, huge swaths of the Outer Rim Territories were conquered by the Imperial Military while the Republic floundered in crises and debate. The Sith strategy at this time was primarily focused on domination of the Outer Rim, although two instances stand of Imperial activity in the Mid Rim in these early years of the war. The first was the Battle of Talay, wherein naval officer Broysc led his forces into a Republic rout. The second was the Empire's acquisition of Bomodon, a planet in the Churba sector of the Mid Rim. In 3674 BBY, the Republic challenged the Imperial claim to Bomodon, sparking a battle for control of the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The months-long contest for Bomodon was notable for the participation of Elin Garza and Marcus Trant. Lieutenant Garza, a platoon commander from the Republic Army's 45th Infantry Division, was with her unit when their vessel was shot down in flight over the planet. She and her surviving troops were able to evade capture by Imperial forces through the assistance of Trant, an embedded agent from the Republic Strategic Information Service. With Trant's assistance, Garza and her platoon waged a guerrilla war against the Imperial occupation; the ten-month campaign ultimately ended with the Republic forces driving the Empire off Bomodon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The loss of the planet eventually led to the Empire's seizure of the Seswenna sector and its third and most significant attempt at penetrating the Mid Rim in the First Battle of Bothawui. After their victory on Bomodon, Garza and Trant married, though their relationship lasted only twenty-six months. Garza's exploits ultimately earned her the rank of Colonel and Trant's successes ferried him to the position of Director of the Republic Strategic Information Service."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle on Bomodon was first mentioned in the entries for Marcus Trant and Elin Garza in the 2012 reference guide Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
