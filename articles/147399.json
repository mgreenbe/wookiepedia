When Lieutenant Yrica Quell defected from the Empire on the planet Nacronis around 4 ABY, she attempted to cover up her role in a genocide on the planet, claiming in a falsified report to the New Republic IT-O Interrogation Unit IT-O that Tong, along with fellow TIE pilots Major Soran Keize and Shana, had pursued her. Quell additionally claimed that having seen Tong's flight statistics, she felt that she was even-matched. In the false story, Quell caused Tong and Shana to be caught in Nacronis's siltstorms and crash into each other as they decelerated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tong was mentioned in the 2019 novel Alphabet Squadron, the first volume of the Star Wars: Alphabet Squadron trilogy written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
