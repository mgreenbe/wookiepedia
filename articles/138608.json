They were owned and operated by Sienar Fleet Systems, though ultimate ownership laid with the Empire. It was protected by several squadrons of well trained Imperial Navy commandos. This facility was one of the first of its type."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside the facility, the Empire began perfecting its mass production techniques which churned out thousands of TIE/LN fighters. Rows upon rows of TIE components parts moved along a magnetic conveyor where automated laser arms welded the vehicles together before they were transported to loading bays."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 BBY, the facility was taken over by former Jedi General Rahm Kota and his comrades. During the ensuing battle, Kota's men planted explosives throughout the factory. This was, however, not their main objective, as Kota sought to draw out Darth Vader, but instead Vader's secret apprentice was drawn to the conflict. Kota detached the base's command center by detonating some of those explosives in a bid to kill the apprentice, but failed in his efforts to achieve the latter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE Fighter Construction Facility appears in the 2008 video game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, in which it is the first story-based level.

The facility also appears in the novel and comic of the same name."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE Fighter Construction Facility has differing appearances between versions of The Force Unleashed video games. In the Wii/PS2 versions, the facility's external appearance has an array of pods adjoined together on a spine-like structure, with the top having a long bridge area. In the PS3 and XBOX360 versions of the game, the structure is largely more sleeker and also curved, almost bell-shaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
