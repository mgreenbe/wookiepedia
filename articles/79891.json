After pleasing the Hutts sufficiently to become considered a favored species, the Langoonans rebelled against their masters, unsuccessfully. The Hutts drove the Langoonans to the edge of extinction and stripped them of all their technology. The master species then maintained a small population of Langoonans for use in safaris."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 1 BBY,[source?] Langoonan deathmasks were considered valuable pieces of art by Durga Besadii Tai, head of the Besadii kajidic.
