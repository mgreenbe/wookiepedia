Operating under the oversight of Army Command, the Imperial Army was formed from the non-clone forces of the Grand Army of the Republic in the immediate aftermath of the Clone Wars in 19 BBY. By the time of the Galactic Civil War around 0 BBY, the Army numbered in the tens of trillions and utilized a wide range of walkers, repulsortanks, wheeled vehicles and ships in support of its infantry. At the decisive Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, the Imperial Military suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of the Rebel Alliance, and the Imperial Army fragmented as the Empire collapsed into warlordism and infighting, losing ground to the New Republic. Imperial Army troops would reconquer Coruscant for the Reborn Emperor in 10 ABY, but it would not be until 12 ABY that the Imperial Military as a whole was reunified as the armed forces of the Imperial Remnant. The Imperial Army remained the ground force of the Empire after its reconstitution as the Fel Empire, and split again in 130 ABY during the Second Imperial Civil War between Darth Krayt's Imperial faction and that of Emperor Roan Fel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial Army troopers were by far the most common Imperial soldiers, substantially outnumbering the more-famous Imperial Stormtroopers and forming the garrisons of all occupied worlds. Army troopers piloted nearly all of the Empire's heavy vehicles, including the celebrated All Terrain Armored Transport and All Terrain Scout Transport walkers. Army units were often reinforced by Stormtroopers, although the command structure for the two organizations remained separate. On garrisoned worlds, the Army operated in conjunction with Imperial Starfleet, Stormtroopers, and the local constabulary to maintain order and security."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The goal of the Imperial Army was surface superiority during instances of ground warfare, and were equipped with the means of seizing and defending a planet. While the Imperial Navy controlled space and the Stormtrooper Corps led assaults and established bridgeheads, only the Imperial Army was capable of deploying the heavy equipment and sustaining the long operations required to gain control of planets. As such, the Army encompassed various infantry, armored cavalry, special forces, artillery operators, engineers, scouts, and drivers that came to number in the tens of trillions. This also meant that while they were capable of decisive planetary operations and sustained surface superiority, it took longer to deploy their specialized formations and heavy equipment than other branches of the Imperial Military."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aside from this, the Army also had the role of eliminating military threats to the established Imperial political order on planetary surfaces or other inhabited complexes. If on an enemy planet, the Imperial Army was to engage and defeat any local military force that was capable of resistance in order to ensure the transition of control of the planet towards the Empire. The Army when engaged in operations could expect support from the Imperial Navy during the initial drop phase, which included suppressing fire against particularly hard or well-armed targets, as well as \"force reduction attacks\" meant to destroy enemy assets capable of interfering with reorganization after the drop. The Army during later phases of an operation was also allowed to pre-plan for orbital bombardments on specific targets. If the operation proved vital enough, the Army would even work together with naval units on the ground to provide fire support upon being called upon. For garrison duty, their role was largely the same, although they were expected to provide firepower and backup for COMPNOR and Intelligence operatives whenever called upon. Other surface missions undertaken by the Imperial Army included utterly obliterating an enemy possession, engaging enemy infantry and mechanized units, providing strategic insertion of commandos or expeditionary forces, securing control of a key planetary resource or supply line, and/or holding an objective and destroying enemy attackers attempting to reclaim it. Although their primary objective during the Galactic Civil War was the monitoring for and later immediate and decisive eradication of any Rebel presence on planets (with the process being compared to sterilizing wounds by applying heat), the Imperial Army also was cognizant of the criminal underworld, as groups such as the Hutts, smugglers, bounty hunters, as well as others who lived in civilization's fringes were considered enemies even if technically not aligned with the Rebels. The Imperial Army, when hunting for Rebels, didn't need the cooperation of local planetary governments, though they did require obedience from the latter as necessary."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial Army troopers occasionally operated aboard Naval vessels as marines. When aboard a Naval vessel, their standard duties were to steer clear of Naval soldiers and see their equipment was properly maintained, although they were also charged with defending the vessel if it was boarded by enemy units, with Army officers coordinating the crew of the vessel alongside the soldiers in this event. This also had the consequence of creating a degree of friction between the two services."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial Army commanders during the Galactic Civil War were noted to be somewhat uncreative, using outdated \"by the book\" tactics learned in the Imperial Academy. Most Imperial commanders could be more easily defeated if faced with an unexpected situation for which there was no conventional solution. The Imperial Army's orders generally came from a top-down aspect, whereby the Emperor supplied the orders which were transmitted from Army Command down through a clear hierarchy. In addition, Imperial commanders were expected to follow established protocol, and often did so by set objectives that defined in the type of units deployed into battle and how these units were to be used. As such, while the Imperial forces could afford to field specialized troopers in great numbers and in various formations, their Rebel counterparts in those fields tended to have greater training than Imperial specialists. In large part because of the top-down structure of orders, the Imperial Army's policy often led to their ignoring civilian complaints due to not answering to them, although the Rebel General Crix Madine, himself a former Imperial soldier, mentioned that units belonging to the Imperial Special Missions generally ignored that aspect of protocol."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Army's tactics emphasized demoralizing the enemy, specifically through the use of overwhelming firepower to leave them shell-shocked and helpless in the face of a massive, numerically superior frontal assault. The Empire also emphasized striking to disrupt the enemy's plans and expose their flaws while they were in disorder. The Imperial Army emphasized the frontal assault as the centerpiece of ground warfare, which drove the development of massive walkers like the AT-AT, which could use its immense height to deliver overwhelming firepower against targets from far outside the range of most artillery or ground vehicles. Repulsortanks and other such repulsorlift vehicles were considered better suited for \"mid-intensity\" combat, such as urban warfare and fast-moving campaigns in grassy or forested terrain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Formation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the Galactic Republic's Judicial Forces and the various Planetary Security Forces were nationalized into the Grand Army of the Republic.

Forces led by Generals Hurst Romodi and Jan Dodonna defeated Separatist holdouts during the Ciutric Offensive and Sy Myrthian Insurrection of 19 BBY. Romodi again led troops from the front at the Battles of Kelrodo-Ai and Ord Vaug during the Western Reaches Operation of 17 BBY. Owing to the heavy militarization during the Imperial Period, the Imperial Army saw massive expansions, including even increasing the amount of Sector Armies in the galaxy. In addition, the size of the Imperial Army was such that Rahm Kota mentioned that the army that was at the Emperor's disposal was essentially infinite in numbers, and the Rebel Alliance general Carlist Rieekan even acknowledged that the Rebels stand little to no chance at fighting the Imperials in a straight up battle, due to not having the troop strength to engage battle at the regimental level, as well as admitting that not even guerrilla tactics will be enough to dislodge the Imperial Army from the core systems regarding the Sector Armies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Army, compared to the pre\u2013Clone Wars Republic Army, was significantly expanded and overhauled, to such an extent that the process of creating the Imperial Army after the rise of the New Order was compared to reviving it from the dead. In fact, refurbishing the structure and personnel of the Imperial Army to the extent that it was established as a branch equal to the Imperial Navy was one of Palpatine's first actions upon creating the Galactic Empire. Examples of some of its overhauls included the re-establishment of rigorous training and recruitment programs, as well as expanding Imperial Army-related missions to include conducting drop missions into hostile territory for standard troopers instead of just for elite units, and training for complex assaults. Probably one of the biggest differences was that when working together, the Imperial Navy was required by doctrine to provide support for Imperial Army forces during critical phases of a military operation, as well as allowing permanent garrisons to have access to various naval assets such as TIE Fighters attached to Army units for the whole of the mission. By contrast, the Republic's Judicial and Planetary Security Forces before the Clone Wars at best qualified as a poorly trained police force with fancy uniforms, with their main role being garrison duty on member worlds of the Old Republic (and even there, largely as a barrier between squabbling locals). They required the Republic Navy to get them to where they needed to go as well as to have what little remained extracted, and largely had to fend for itself during a campaign since the Republic Navy was stretched too thin to be of any help. The Republic Navy also often jealously guarded its starfighters, leaving morale among Army forces very low and actual membership virtually nonexistent. In addition, the pre\u2013Clone Wars Republic Army, due to it largely having its units being under the direct and exclusive command of the planetary governments of the worlds they served, had its worlds pay only half the expenses and provide half the materiel for the units engaged in operations (the Republic Navy, by comparison, often had its expenses paid for by the Republic as a whole). As a result complaints about the costs of deployed surface forces were very common among those member worlds of the Republic who weren't among the wealthiest members, which consequentially resulted in the Army's expenditures plummeting."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the Reconquest, one of the Army's most common duties was the maintenance of planetary garrisons throughout the galaxy, but from 2 BBY it faced a new enemy on the ground in the form of the Alliance Army after the Alliance to Restore the Republic issued the Declaration of Rebellion and began the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, the Imperial Army's Blizzard Force led by General Maximilian Veers dealt the Alliance a serious defeat at the Battle of Hoth, forcing the Rebels to flee into space.

Although technically originating from the Starfighter Corps controlled by the Imperial Navy, the TIE pilots operated under Imperial Army jurisdiction instead of the Imperial Navy. This was an enforced compromise between the two branches of the Imperial Military, as the Army wanted its own starfighter complement while the Navy wanted exclusive control of starfighters.

Because the Empire could afford to field specialized troops in great numbers, Imperial formations, particularly at the lower levels, could be very diverse.

Since unit commanders were considered supernumeraries, the average Imperial Army formation tended to have a larger headcount than an equivalent-strength formation in the Grand Army of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The largest formation of the Imperial Army was the sector army, comprising around one and a half million men commanded by a Surface Marshal, though due to the political complications of sector administration, this was usually an honorary title held by the sector Moff. A sector army was composed of two to four systems armies, each led by a High General and composed of around 393,000 troops, though the systems armies were largely bookkeeping formations used to control reinforcements to subordinate forces, not operational units. Systems armies were formed of one to three armies, each of around 131,000 troops, commanded by a General and comprising four corps, one of each type.

The corps, comprising around 33,000 troopers and led by a Major General, was deployed for major planetary operations and was composed of four battlegroups, the exact composition depending on role. The type of corps deployed depended on the planetary environment, population, and level of hostility. The line corps was the standard configuration, while the Atrisian corps were among the elite of the Empire's formations. Armor corps were heavy on tanks and offensive power, while mobile corps emphasized speed and mobility. The corps headquarters also controlled air support through the ground support wing. The corps' four battlegroups, each of around 8,000 troopers and commanded by a Colonel, were the standard deployment for major Army offensives and were capable of capturing a continent. The standard formation was the line battlegroup, while reinforced battlegroups offered a mix of specializations for diverse planetary environments. Armored battlegroups deployed large numbers of vehicles to destroy concentrate knots of resistance, while mobile battlegroups focused more on maneuvering mechanized infantry."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battlegroup was composed of four regiments, each of around 2,000 troopers and led by a Lieutenant Colonel. Line regiments were considered the appropriate configuration for the long term occupation of a planetary region while assault regiments formed the vanguard of attacks.

For example a line company was augmented first by a heavy weapons platoon, followed by a second heavy weapons platoon, and then two line platoons. In rare instances an Army unit was augmented in ways other than dictated by the OB. The most common happened when an army commander organized survivors from a battle, creating haphazard units regardless of the OB. The second was when units were augmented with local auxiliaries. Finally a commander could order a special augmentation which he felt was critical to accomplishing his mission. If he succeeded his superiors would overlook this infraction, while failure meant he faced harsh justice.

The Imperial Army troopers were deployed to either keep the peace on Imperial-occupied worlds or otherwise conquer nonstrategic worlds for the Empire, in contrast to the Stormtrooper Corps, which were deployed to raid enemy worlds. Although they were often on foot, several, such as Vehicle Command Crewers, were also responsible for manning mechanized vehicles such as the AT-AT walkers.

Frontier and primitive worlds were also targeted for recruitment drives, the latter especially for filling the ranks with expendable assault troops, although some care had to be taken to weed out Rebel sympathizers.

Candidates who passed initial screening would then be sent to Training Centers for medical examinations and intelligence assessments, including mandatory retina scans that were matched against available records. Desired traits for recruits included physical fitness, bravery, loyalty, and intellect (although the last one could be waived under certain infantry regiments). Cadets would then attend regional military prep schools, which included the AT-ST Training Program, which acted as a means to enter the Imperial Academy. The best students of these schools were invited to attend Army Officer Training Academies, where they completed basic training, learned military history and courtesies, and took examinations to determine what military career would suit them best. Screening Officers at the sector Recruitment Office would then review the cadet's application and decide the type and duration of the cadet's training program. The basic training itself was difficult, and often required the trainees to endure taking orders, sharing a room with six or seven other people, doing various drills, and looking after their equipment and weapons by maintaining them for hours. The drills themselves included long marches and spending hours building up stamina and strength. This was because, due to the Imperial Army being purported to be the best army in the galaxy, they needed to have all personnel be highly trained to carry out the various jobs demanded of the soldier, as well as it reflecting badly on both the organization and the soldier if they sent troops out half-trained, due to having no use for dead soldiers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Basic training took place at one of thousands of drop camps situated across the Empire, each one focused on a different area of operation such as infantry, armor, communications or engineering.

The most pursued trait within Imperial Army officers at Raithal was their ability to lead their men through the most adverse of conditions. Raithal was originally geared towards non-clone recruits into the Imperial Military due to the Stormtrooper Corps originally being composed exclusively of clone troopers. Emphasis was placed on an officer's ability to command men through the twofold method of leadership: drawing upon their fear of disobeying orders, which was disciplined into them during training, and gaining their respect by example.

Their advantages left them able to operate freely in planets possessing atmospheric conditions prohibit the operation of repulsorlift vehicles. Another reason for their use of walkers was under a more psychological warfare aspect, specifically psychological destabilization of the enemy either due to primitive preconceptions of gargantuan beasts or otherwise citizens being trained by Imperial propaganda that the arrival of a walker meant all was lost. The most famous of these were the quadruped walkers known as the All Terrain Armored Transports, which also featured a heavily armored variant. These acted as the pride of the Imperial Assault Armor Division, and, although technically only functioning as a troop transport, were symbolic of the intense power of the Empire, often reinforced by propaganda. The AT-ATs could also be heavily customized to suit the local environments of various planetary garrisons, with the most notable example being the Aquatic Terrain Armored Transport. Largely because it was the first walker to see extensive combat under modern battlefield conditions and its role in the Clone Wars and being the predecessor to the various walkers in the Imperial Army, the All Terrain Tactical Enforcer was retained in the service of the Empire, many being in active use throughout the Mid and Outer Rim, due to being extremely well built, with their acting as patrol vehicles, often being painted in the local camouflage and outfitted with modifications such as floodlights, underbrush grinders, and flamethrowers. Their magnetized footing also allowed them to be used in extra-planetary environments, such as asteroid surfaces or ship hulls.
