It comprised many dialects that prevented clear communication, a vestige of the feudal culture of the planet's past. Because of the difficulties of operating a planetary government with so many different languages, the Assembly established Galactic Basic Standard as the official language of their people as a means of unifying the planet. Because of the pro-Republic curriculum which continued even after the rise of the Galactic Empire, Pantoran was gradually becoming unfashionable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Basic was spoken far more than Pantoran, distinct regional accents continued to flavor the spoken Basic of many Pantorans.
