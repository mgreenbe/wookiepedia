Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, five of his environmental survey devices stopped sending in signals, likely due to atmospheric interference. As a result, someone needed to go out into the forest and download the memory from the devices by hand, but the area around the devices was far too dangerous for the aged Ithorian to travel through, being filled with a variety of deadly predators, including varactyl and bolotaurs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Farnsworth soon met a passing spacer, who\u2014after Farnsworth explained his predicament\u2014agreed to go out and collect the data from the survey equipment and bring it back to the Ithorian.
