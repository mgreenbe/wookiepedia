As such, rocket packs were able to operate in zero, low, or high atmospheres due to internally containing all necessary thrust components; rocket packs provided a better \"all-environment\" flight capability as a result when compared to jet packs, as the latter required atmosphere to operate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though faster than jet packs, rocket packs were often heavier and louder in operation. Additionally, rocket packs lacked the stamina that jet packs had in terms of distance and range; due to size and weight restrictions, the fuels used in rocket packs were rapid-burning, limiting overall flight duration. Rocket packs were also considerably dangerous - because rocket packs made use of large amounts of highly combustible elements, it posed a serious explosive risk if the pack was ruptured or otherwise damaged."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rocket packs were most well known for being employed by the Rocket-Jumper Elite Advance Unit, who used the Zim Systems ROCKET personal rocket pack. Another type of rocket pack was used by rocket battle droids during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
