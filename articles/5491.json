Introduced in the year 19 BBY, it was based on the All Terrain Recon Transport and deployed by the Grand Army of the Republic during the Battle of Kashyyyk. After the Clone Wars, the AT-RCT was used by the Imperial Army and the police forces of Galactic Empire, as well as many planetary and system governments. A revised iteration of the walker was later used by Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire during the Second Imperial Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The walker was open-topped, like the All Terrain Recon Transport model, but larger in scale.

These walkers participated in the Battle of Kashyyyk in 19 BBY. Two were later deployed alongside a clone detachment to the Colonies world of Kestavel, to apprehend the Jedi fugitive Dass Jennir during the Great Jedi Purge of the early events of the Galactic Empire. The type saw increased use in the Fel Empire and Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire, over 150 years later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The All Terrain Riot Control Transport was originally created for the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, though it was cut from the final film. Designed by T.J. Frame, it was dubbed the \"Twin AT-ST\" and would have appeared alongside an AT-RT and Infantry Support Platform in an extended scene where Yoda distracted mutinous clone troopers by acting like a crazy hermit. Chewbacca would have then climbed up the back of the AT-RT and removed the pilot, reminiscent of his boarding of an All Terrain Scout Transport in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though omitted from the film itself, the \"Twin AT-ST\" appeared in the third issue of Episode III's comic adaptation written by Miles Lane, pencilled by Douglas Wheatley, and published on April 13, 2005. Its design was later repurposed as the All Terrain Riot Control Transport in the Legacy Era Campaign Guide, a 2009 supplement for Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Roleplaying Game. While the walker was described as having been based upon vehicle designs dating back to the Clone Wars, the \"Twin AT-ST\" was not identified as an earlier model of AT-RCT until the publication of Far Horizons, a 2014 supplement for  Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
