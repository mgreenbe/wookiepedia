Since Wookiees, due to their large size and bulk could not comfortably ride most models of speeder bike designed for other species of humanoids, they developed their own, more comfortably proportioned vehicles to suit the needs of motorized infantry scouts. It was different from other speeder bikes in that the rider was seated in a reclined pilot's chair that was offset from the fuselage of the speeder bike. The bike's throttle was controlled by a lever to the rider's left, and directional controls and weapons were operated by the rider's right hand. The HummBike was armed with a weak, slow-firing blaster mounted on the forward maneuvering vane as a last-ditch defense. However, like all speeder bikes, the HummBike's almost nonexistent armor and weak weaponry made it ineffective in sustained combat. The bike's speed and maneuverability allowed riders to easily evade enemies, however, and this was typically the first course of action taken by riders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "HummBikes saw some use between 39 BBY and 36 BBY, during the war for the colonization of the moon Alaris Prime between Wookiee colonists and the Trade Federation. On the recommendation of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, an advisor to the Wookiees, a mech factory was built at one of their bases, which allowed two Hummbikes to be assembled. These speeders were made for the purpose of locating a Trade Federation outpost where B1-Series battle droids were manufactured. After exploring to the north of the base the Wookiee riders found no trace of the Trade Federation, leading Jinn to conclude that the outpost was located on the other side of a nearby river. The two HummBike riders boarded a repulsorcraft transport and travelled to the other side, where they disembarked and located the outpost, avoiding the battle droids stationed there. The rider's intelligence allowed the Wookiee leader Chewbacca to lead a force of Wookiee soldiers to outpost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
