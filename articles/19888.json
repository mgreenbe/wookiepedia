Located close to various hyperspace routes, Bracca's strategic importance made it the site of a campaign during the Clone Wars. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, the Scrapper Guild operated on the planet, breaking down starship wreckage and selling the components to the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bracca was a poor Mid Rim world dominated by rocky plains. Large swathes of the planet's surface were comprised of junkyards, with countless decommissioned starships and other machinery spread haphazardly, awaiting destruction. It was orbited by one moon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Given the generally inhospitable nature of the world, the majority of its population was comprised of scrappers, who made their living breaking down and selling the trash left on the world. The Scrapper Guild used to fix and build starships, hiring many engineers, but by the fifth year of the Imperial Era, engineers had turned into scrappers. Nearly all services on Bracca were operated by the Scrapper Guild. Credits earned in a workday were quickly recouped by the Guild due to the prices for food, lodging, and other necessities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The scrappers often tipped platforms full of junk into the Ibdis Maw and harvested the waste products for profit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bracca's surface was crisscrossed by high-speed transport trains that delivered supplies from the scrapyards to the spaceports, where they would then head to the core worlds.

After a workplace accident forced Kestis to use the Force to save his co-worker and friend Prauf, the Inquisitorius was alerted to his presence. Arriving on Bracca, the Second Sister and Ninth Sister questioned several of the Scrappers for the whereabouts of the Jedi. When Prauf stood up to them, he was executed by the Second Sister, forcing Cal to flee with the help of former Jedi Knight Cere Junda and Latero pilot Greez Dritus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Decades later, as war sparked up and the New Republic was destroyed, the First Order started sending claimed Republic starships for decommissioning at Bracca.
