As a solar flare was about to erupt from the star of the system, the Mizi ship, along with the others, took refuge behind an abandoned space station after being alerted of the flare by the transport Vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vessel was the first to land aboard the space station, and its crew determined that the station was safe for the other ships. The Jedi passengers who had been traveling aboard the Vessel organized the arrival, mistakenly placing the Mizi next to an Orincan ship. Several parties, including the Mizi, intended to loot the abandoned station despite the protest of the Jedi and Vessel crew. The Mizi discovered a set of armor from the Amaxine warriors, the original creators of the station, and were later confronted by the Jedi Wayseeker Orla Jareni, backing away when she ignited her lightsaber. Jedi Master Cohmac Vitus achieved a temporary reprieve by levitating within the station's atrium and calling for a cease to the looting."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cooperation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Mizi and the other groups were no longer attempting to loot the station, they were forced to remain stranded for several days with the continued closure of the hyperspace lanes.

After Leox Gyasi, captain of the Vessel, reminded the uncooperative parties of their relative luck in the aftermath of the disaster, the Mizi captain admitted that they had been transporting repair parts, offering them to those whose ships had been damaged while in hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another Mizi later volunteered to join a party tasked with exploring the lower rings of the station. The Mizi descended in a hurry, cutting away vines that had grown in from the station's central arboretum. The station's 8-T gardening model droids saw the group as a threat to the plants and attacked, forcing the group to retreat. Despite the incident, the Mizi rejoined the group on a second attempt, determined to have a share of whatever was to be found in the lower rings. The second expedition was called off after the apparent death of Jedi Knight Dez Rydan, and the Mizi hurried back to his people after returning. Shortly afterward, the hyperspace lanes were opened up for limited travel, allowing those who had been stranded aboard the station to leave. The Mizi and Orincans celebrated together before departing the station aboard their respective starships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mizi appeared in the 2021 novel The High Republic: Into the Dark, written by Claudia Gray."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
