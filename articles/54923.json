They had sharp, white teeth and a jutting lower jaw. Their eyes, located on the sides of their head, glowed blue. They appeared to be capable of mimicking speech, as one was witnessed saying, \"Feed me\". While these predators were not very fast in terms of running, they did have a means of capturing their prey without usage of their legs: a long, prehensile tongue. Boba Fett once used a globblin to intimidate a captive into providing the bounty hunter with a sought-after possession."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
