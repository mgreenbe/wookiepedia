During an interview on The Star Wars Show, co-star Ahmed Best confirmed that Blank, Bromley, and Capoferri had given him considerable flexibility in developing the main character Jedi Master Kelleran Beq including his history, mannerisms, and lightsaber color.

Puckett incorporated buttons and switches from various Star Wars ship sets including the hyperspace levers from the Millennium Falcon set used during the production of Solo: A Star Wars Story.

Tarpley and Holland work together to synchronize the former's live action performance with the latter's voice work.
