It was also used in Bright Tree Village, where the tool consisted of a thick hose which pumped water from a large water tower in the village. The Ewoks Weechee and Willy Warrick once used a firehose to put out a fire in Bright Tree Village which had been formed by the Stranger using the Sunstar. The fire threatened to engulf the entire village before the Ewoks were able to extinguish it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
