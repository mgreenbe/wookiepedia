He and his men were hired by Grand Moff Rycus Kilran to capture the bridge of Republic transport the Esseles so that Kilran could gain custody of Ambassador Vyn Asara, who the Sith Empire classed a terrorist. While an Imperial boarding party distracted a group of Republic defenders, Ironfist's Mandalorian forces seized the bridge of the Esseles.
