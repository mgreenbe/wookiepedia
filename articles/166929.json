Eager to remove his home from the war, Yojan came up with a plan. Using an ancient mechanical construct called the Ardana Shadex, he attempted to destroy the agrocite mines, but was interrupted by Mace Windu, now a Jedi General. Yojan activated the device but was unable to control it. As it rampaged toward the Royal City, Yojan was able to infiltrate the machine and trigger a kill switch. Unfortunately, he became trapped inside and was subsequently killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
