However, Tavo was not as fortunate as Spar had been. Shortly after taking his leave of the armed forces Tavo was hunted down and killed by the deserter eliminating Covert Ops clone troopers. This motivated Sull himself to flee the GAR while on a mission to Gaftikar. Sull's run-in with Omega Squad there led to the exposure of Tavo's death\u2014and the nobody-leaves-alive policy of the GAR\u2014to people such as Kal Skirata and Arligan Zey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
