The Drogheda Royal Guard were known to equip Sky-sleds to face their opponents, as the craft had a small blaster cannon mounted to the front of the vessel. However, during the Drogheda Civil War, the Drogheda Revolutionaries obtained Sky-sleds, which they used to attack the Drogheda Citadel, the headquarters of the oppressive monarchy on the planet. Since the structure was only reachable by Sky-sled, the ruling class found the vessels necessary to keep control over their headquarters, and subsequently, over the world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
