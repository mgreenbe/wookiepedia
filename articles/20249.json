Populated by fisherfolk and merchant marines working within the maritime industry, scavengers often set out across the bay to the Coral Coast to salvage wastes floating in the waters and washing up along its shores. Aside from those private vessels, most other seaborne vehicles kept along the bay were recreational, used by Worlport's tourists or elite residents. The small amount of mercantile traffic coming in from the oceans were harassed by pirates off of the bay when security was lax, but were otherwise kept far afield from the harbors of the Breakwater."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
