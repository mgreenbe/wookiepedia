To that end, Viper probe droids were dispatched in hyperdrive pods all across the galaxy, and a multitude of analysts were tasked with searching the collected data. However, the lack of progress irritated Lord Darth Vader, who executed the project's initial supervisor, Major Yaltza. General Maximilian Veers of the Imperial Army then took the mantle, just when 100,000 Viper droids had already been launched. At the suggestion of Professor Ud, who pointed out that the Alliance had used ancient sites before, Veers assembled a team of archaeological consultants, which included Chelli Lona Aphra. The first lead the new team investigated was a deathshrine of the Central Isopter on Ash Moon 1. There was no Alliance base at the deathshrine, but Ud died after triggering a trap, and Korin Aphra was found lurking on the premises and captured. Eventually, probe XJ9-CS14 was deployed to the planet Hoth and managed to find the base, which led to a major battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
