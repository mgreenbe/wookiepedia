During his childhood on the planet Corellia, the future pilot Wedge Antilles would finish episodes of the show before diving immediately into the holo-novel Fly Fast and Die Young!, which was written by a retired ace. The series contained ample description of high-g maneuvers and pilots shouting defiance over comms, but did not cover other elements of a pilot's life at all, failing to mention that one could not sleep for more than a few minutes in a cockpit, that after battle a pilot would usually be rank and drenched from profusely sweating, or that on extended missions pilots would have to wear \"maximum absorbency undergarments.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zero Hour: The Tentraxis Campaign was first mentioned in Jason Fry's short story \"Rendezvous Point,\" which was published in the 2020 anthology From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
