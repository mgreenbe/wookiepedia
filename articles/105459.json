When a young boy, Talesan Fry, discovered their plans, a bounty was placed on his head. He was captured for them by pirates. Magnus and the other bounty hunters took Talesan to the conference, where they were confronted on a roof top by Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Adi Gallia and Siri Tachi. Pilot held Talesan over the roof while Magus threatned to drop him if the Jedi didn't let Magus and Pilot escape. However when Qui-gon agreed, Magus flew away without waiting for Pilot, who was balancing on the top of the small cruiser. Pilot fell to his death with a muffled scream, however, Siri managed to prevent Talesan from falling as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
