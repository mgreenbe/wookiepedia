However, clone trooper \"Scythe\" was infected with a Geonosian brain worm and secretly brought a batch of eggs aboard the starship in his backpack. Onboard the medical frigate, he caused the infection to spread to other clones, including \"Edge,\" \"Havoc,\" \"Ox,\" \"Pulsar,\" and Lieutenant \"Trap.\" The infected clones even killed their own brothers, executing the pilots as they took over the bridge. Burrowing within the brains of the infected soldiers, the worms controlled their hosts' actions and forced them to attack the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the worm infestation spread to the rest of the ship's crew, infecting Offee in the process, Tano attempted to regain control of the vessel before its arrival at Ord Cestus.
