Arrestees were gathered in mobile repulsorlift holding pens. The spaceport was locked down for Bellassans, but offworlders were allowed to exit. The Imperial ultimatum was then given: the city of Ussa had twenty-four hours to turn Ferus Olin over to Imperial authorities or the arrested civilians would be executed. Obi-Wan Kenobi suspected that the Empire would not honor the ultimatum and execute the civilians even if Ferus Olin was turned in, and then would carry out the scenarios for body disposal and communications suppression."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
