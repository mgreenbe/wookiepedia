His primary task was maintaining situational awareness and environmental status in the midst of battle. During his service, he was recognized by General Davits Draven for both his fearlessness and self-awareness. For this reason, when Draven had doubts that the former member of the resistance fighter Saw Gerrera's Partisans Jyn Erso would successfully connect with Gerrera on the moon of Jedha, he recommended Basteren and several other soldiers to Rebellion chancellor Mon Mothma for a potential raid of the Partisan headquarters in Jedha's Catacombs of Cadera. The general sent a biography of Basteren to Mothma and suggested they start with those soldiers and build a larger squad around them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, once Erso had successfully completed the mission to connect with Gerrera and learned of the Empire's Death Star superweapon, Basteren and the same group of Rebel soldiers volunteered to join her in an unsanctioned mission to steal the Death Star's plans from the Citadel Tower on the planet Scarif. The volunteer squad took the improvized callsign \"Rogue One\" and infiltrated the planet's defenses in the stolen Zeta-class Heavy Cargo Shuttle SW-0608. On Scarif, Basteren was among a squad that set out to create a distraction and draw the Empire's forces so that Erso and a small team could sneak into the Citadel and find the plans.
