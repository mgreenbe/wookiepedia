Sawyer. Unlike the Bantam Spectra novels that were being published at the time, these novels would have been published by Ace Books. When the focus of the project shifted from a story set in the Star Wars galaxy to an original storyline using new alien designs, Sawyer dropped out of the project. In 2003, he released the material he had completed\u2014the first two chapters and an outline for the first novel\u2014to his website as fan fiction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sawyer's proposed storyline is divided into two parts, both of which focus on the history of Humans in the Star Wars galaxy. In the main storyline, the ancient history of the Star Wars galaxy is explored. The protagonist is Cosmo Hender, the leader of the Human slaves on the planet Forhilnor, part of the Varlian Empire. The story of his struggle to free his people, as well as the non-Human slaves on Forhilnor, also touches on the origins of the Force, the Hutt civilization, and the name \"Skywalker.\" The secondary storyline, told through excerpts from a document called The Human Exodus, traces the origins of the Human species to a lost expedition from 25th-century Earth. It also makes references to George Lucas's previous films, American Graffiti and THX 1138."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Sawyer's novel was never completed or published, it has been noticed by the online Star Wars fandom.

When Ace Books approached Robert J.

According to Sawyer, this led him to bow out of the project, whereupon Deborah Chester became the project's new author.

Forhilnor's slaves include Humans, Bith, Ithorians, Kubaz, Ortolans, Kitonaks, Twi'leks, Mon Calamari, and Sullustans. The Varlians\u2014giant insectoids who rule a large star empire\u2014have Rodian and Gamorrean henchmen to oversee the slaves. The slaves are being forced to build a massive stone temple, which by this point has reached a height of one thousand meters. A secret council, consisting of the leaders of each slave species, plots to somehow gain freedom, though their people have been enslaved for at least five generations. The slave council note that all their people are weary, even more than can be explained by the hard work and short rations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Hender is temporarily taken from his regular job in the quarries, and from his pregnant mate Sallee, to serve in the palace of the Varlian governor, Kaxa, he learns several important things. Firstly, he discovers that the Varlians have advanced technology and machinery that could easily complete the stone temple without the use of slave labor. Secondly, he hears about a plague called the Changa Bloodrot that nearly wiped out the Varlians centuries ago (a disaster that they believed to be divine retribution for failing to enslave the primitive Wookiees). Most importantly, after the governor's daughter Delba teaches him to read, he comes across a book called The Human Exodus, which tells of the origin of Humanity in the galaxy. The story of Humankind's escape from a previous group of oppressors inspires him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When he rejoins his people, Hender sets in motion a plan to free the slaves. Hender makes it appear that several slaves who died of overwork really died of Changa Bloodrot. Of all the species on Forhilnor, only the Rodians would be immune to this plague\u2014a fact that inspires the Rodians to put their own plan in motion to find a sample of the Bloodrot and spread it amongst the Varlians. Meanwhile, Hender and three other slave leaders (Ridbrek the Mon Calamari, Ugerat the Kubaz, and Galarax the Bith) put their own plan into motion, and poison the water supply in the palace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Governor Kaxa realizes that a plague outbreak could ruin his plan to seize control of the Imperial throne. He orders that his plan be put into effect quickly. It turns out that the temple was merely a means to keep the slaves occupied, while a crystal in the palace drained their Force energy. Kaxa is using this energy to physically move the Forhilnor system towards the center of the Empire, where he plans to seize power using his slaves as a ready-made army. The movement of the planet causes earthquakes on Forhilnor. When Hender rescues another slave from the rubble, it turns out that Hender has somehow developed the ability to tap into the Force, giving him telekinetic powers. The other slaves nickname him \"Skywalker\" for his ability to levitate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, a disease appears to spread to the Varlians in the palace, causing the Varlian larvae to continue to grow without entering the pupal stage of their life cycle. Astute readers would recognize these giant Varlian larvae, who are petulant and selfish as only an overgrown child could be, as Hutts (who in Legends continuity originated on Varl, settling Nal Hutta only after a cataclysm destroyed the atmosphere of their homeworld). The Varlians think this is a mutation of Changa Bloodrot. Believing the slaves to be infected, a panicked Governor Kaxa sends them on board a fleet of ships to leave the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rodians turn on their Varlian masters and attack the palace with what they think is Changa Bloodrot serum. When the Rodian serum is ineffective, Kaxa discovers that he has been tricked, and that the slaves themselves were never infected. As well, Hender and the other slaves managed to steal the Force crystal from the palace. Kaxa sends a fleet of Gamorrean warships against the escaping slave fleet. However, the slaves escape by flying their ships into the Bloodstars, a nearby star cluster. In order to make a path for their escape, Hender uses the Force to move the Bloodstars aside. Though the strain of using the Force to move the Bloodstars mortally wounds Hender, ages forty years, the former slaves continue to their destination\u2014the garden world of Corellia. On his deathbed, Hender names Ridbrek as his successor.

Their long journey is interrupted when they fall through a \"cosmic whirlpool\" leading to another solar system in another galaxy.

On this new world, they encounter another ship that had arrived in order to investigate the wormhole. This ship turns out to be a Rodian-crewed slave transport, carrying a cargo of Biths. The Rodians intend to enslave the Humans as well. When the Humans discover this, they try to free the Biths, only to be interrupted by a group of Gamorrean slavers, followed by a group of Varlians. The militarily superior Varlians take control of the situation, taking all of the Humans and Bith as slaves to Forhilnor, and hiring the Rodians and Gamorreans to oversee the slaves. As the slaves are taken away, Paxton Solo and Dale Hender look back on what could have been their new home. To honor Antonia Corelli, who was killed by the Rodians, they agree that the planet should be named Corellia.
