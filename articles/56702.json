There, he re-founded the Empire, assumed the title of Sith Emperor, and created a council of other Sith Lords to rule under him.

During the war, Revan traveled to the ancient Sith academy on Malachor V, where the final battle of the Mandalorian Wars would later take place. During his time there, he learned of the true Sith's existence in the Unknown Regions.
