He was given the designation \"TK-605.\" TK-605, along with fellow trooper TK-603 and their corporal fought the New Republic forces at Jakku. As the battle ended in favor of the New Republic, TK-605 realized that the Empire had lost. When the corporal ordered them to fight to the last man under the threat of death, TK-605 shot him dead. When TK-603 expressed shock, TK-605 responded that he did not feel like fighting to the last man and asked TK-603 if he agreed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When TK-603 expressed confusion and asked what were their orders, TK-605 pointed to a stricken Star Destroyer and said that the Empire was dead and there was nobody to order them around anymore. Taking off his helmet, TK-605 said that he did not work for them anymore. When TK-603 asked why he was taking off his stormtrooper armor, Corlac responded that the New Republic would be hunting down Imperials and they had a better chance of surviving without their armor. TK-603 realized that TK-605 was right. As the two buried their armor, Corlac asked TK-603 what was his name.

When Terex expressed unease about abandoning his armor, Corlac agreed that it was little more than \"trash.\" Corlac and Terec spent about a year building an \"Ugly\" out of salvaged parts including the head of an AT-AT walker and TIE Interceptor wings. The two men came to regard each other as squad mates.

While the shipyard had been abandoned, it was still being maintained on auto-security mode by droids and other automated systems. By 7 ABY, Corlac and his associates had taken control of the former Rothana Imperial shipyards. While Terex was repairing Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's former starship Carrion Spike, Corlac informed Wenda and Bett that their plan to rebuild the Empire was a ruse to get Terex's help. Since the Carrion Spike had cloaking capabilities, Corlac planned to use it for piracy operations.

While Corlac served the Empire as a stormtrooper and claimed that Terex was his partner, he was only concerned with looking out for himself. Following the Battle of Jakku, Corlac was pragmatic enough to realize that the Empire was a lost cause and cast aside his stormtrooper armor. Corlac also convinced his friend Terex to do the same. Corlac and Terex used their mechanical and scavenging skills to cobble together an \"Ugly\" out of discarded ship and vehicle parts. Corlac was also a manipulator who played on Terex's desire to build the Empire in order to achieve his own goal of building a criminal empire. Corlac was even willing to kill his former comrade in arms to achieve these goals. However, Corlac in his pride underestimated Terex's vindictiveness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Corlac first appeared in the 2016 comic Poe Dameron 8, written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Phil Noto."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
