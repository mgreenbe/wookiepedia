Promotion of expansion in this region failed miserably on numerous occasions. The atrocities of the Kanz Disorders and the disastrous Outer Expansion Zone initiative paralyzed the development. Finally in the later years of the Galactic Republic, the settlement accelerated with the dispatching of a large fleet owned by the D'Asta merchants from Serenno. They created various markets along the Braxant Run, and Nalroni merchants worked to establish markets beyond the Celanon Spur. With these successes, Coruscant dubbed it the \"New Territories\" and invested heavily in the region; it remained fiercely loyal to the Republic and then the Empire during the Galactic Civil War as a result."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nevertheless, Galactic Empire successor states were established in this region, such as the Pentastar Alignment, the Ciutric Hegemony and the Imperial Remnant.
