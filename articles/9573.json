A Jilruan pirate learned of plans for the next Hutt backed attack which was aimed at capturing a group of nerf herding colonists on the planet Parcovey Minor. The pirate was captured however and informed authorities on the planet Belasco of the upcoming assault, giving the Belasco Free Volunteers time to mobilise and rush to Parcovey Minor's aid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The assault"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The volunteers reached the planet before the Hutt forces and managed to hide in several of the colonists' ranches.
