The planet was rich in minerals and orbited one star. A thick crust of white-colored salt covered nearly the entire planet surface, with red-colored rhodochrosite base beneath. Though dominated by large salt flats, the planet also featured mountains, canyons, and deeply sunken waterways\u2014which were possibly home to aquatic creatures. Among these subterranean water reserves was a \"briny\" ocean. The planet had an atmosphere breathable to oxygen-breathers, such as humans, which was fed by the dissolution of underground reserves of solid oxygen and nitrogen-suspending crystals. The white salt-covered surface reflected the sunlight, which would be blinding at midday. The sodium-containing salt also made the planet surface slippery, hard to travel; with gusts of wind sending up flumes of white salt. The planet was also inhabited by Vulptices, fox-like creatures with white, crystalline fur that lived within the burrows and tunnels beneath the surface of Crait. Occaisonally, large crystalstorms would break out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the reign of the Galactic Empire, the early rebel movement\u2014a loose network of rebel cells led in secret by Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan\u2014established a secret outpost on the northern continent of the planet Crait. In the year 3 BBY, one of these rebel groups attacked Calderos Station, a large Imperial facility used as a deep-space waypoint, to weaken Imperial control and cover rebel shipment tracks to Crait. Although the rebels presumed that all data about Calderos Station was erased, Bail's adopted daughter, Princess Leia Organa, managed to find some old space traffic data which linked Crait and Calderos Station. To discover the identity of the attacker, Leia Organa and her guard Lieutenant Ress Batten traveled to Crait aboard the Polestar. After the ship landed on the planet's surface, Leia was detained by rebel soldiers as she refused their proposal to leave Crait immediately. Upon being taken to the base, Leia found out that it was her father who was in charge of this facility, and her parents were secretly organizing a rebel movement against the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rebel movement eventually turned into a more organized Rebel Alliance, and the Crait outpost was abandoned some time before the Battle of Scarif in 0 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the Galactic Civil War, Rebel heroes Leia, Han Solo, and Luke Skywalker led the Rebellion to Crait while searching for a location for a new Rebel base.
