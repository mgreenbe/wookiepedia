Standing two meters tall with long ears and venom filled teeth, the Draagax was also a dangerous predator when it ate the narcotic Relkass sentinel plant. Using its sight, which was capable of normal and infrared, the frenzied animal would hunt down anything warm-blooded foregoing its normal diet of razor grass and small rodents. The Draagax was a pack hunter, and frequented the equatorial regions of Relkass."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the danger posed by a Draagax under the influence of the sentinel plant narcotic, Relkass officials placed a reward for hunters to cull Draagax herds during the dry seasons, though few were able to take up the offer due to the hazards associated with Draagax hunting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
