However, someone else had paid them more to allow the pilots to enter the prison by themselves. To drive the prisoners away from the door, they put on masks and Pava threw smoke bombs. Firing their blasters, they made their way to Grakkus' open gates, where Grakkus greets them. Dameron entered the building alone with Grakkus, where Terex already is. Both men wanted to know the information about Tekka, so Grakkus offered a competition. Whoever can break him out of Megalox wins the information."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
