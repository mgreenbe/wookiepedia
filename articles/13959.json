It signified the decline of the Empire, with the deaths of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader, as well as many major Imperial leaders, and the destruction of the Death Star II."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plans for the battle began after the Rebels learned that the Empire was building a new Death Star above the forest moon of Endor. In addition, spies had informed Rebel leadership that not only were the Death Star's defense systems incomplete, but also that the Emperor himself would be overseeing the completion of the superweapon's construction. Seeing an opportunity to strike a crippling blow to the Empire, the Alliance planned an attack on the incomplete space station. One group of Rebels would fight on the moon's surface in an attempt to destroy the shield generator protecting the Death Star, while another would fight in space, assaulting the battle station in Endor's orbit once the protective shield was deactivated. Unbeknownst to the Rebels, Palpatine had deliberately leaked false information to them\u2014the Death Star was, in actuality, operational and ready for combat. The Emperor also had a fleet of Star Destroyers waiting to ambush and destroy the Rebel Fleet upon their arrival."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the ground, a group of Rebels led by General Han Solo fought the Imperial stormtroopers stationed on the forest moon in an attempt to destroy the shield generator protecting the Death Star. Meanwhile in space, the Alliance Fleet, led by Admiral Gial Ackbar and aided by Lando Calrissian in the Millennium Falcon, battled the Empire's naval forces and attacked the battle station. However, the Empire held a significant advantage in the space battle due to the massive fleet of Star Destroyers defending the battle station. In addition to the numerical advantage of the Imperials, Darth Sidious's battle meditation further helped the Imperials by scattering the attacking Rebel forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly, the Rebels realized that they had been tricked, for the Death Star's weapon systems were already operational. Despite this quick realization, the Rebel fleet still suffered severe losses through the Death Star's superlaser, secretly controlled by IG-88, who also planned to overthrow the Empire. With the strike team on the ground still struggling to take down the shield, the Rebels were able to turn the tide of the battle with the help of the native Ewoks and gain access to the generator command bunker and rig it with explosives. After Solo's team was able to take down the shield generator, several squadrons of Rebel snubfighters led by Calrissian and Wedge Antilles began their attack on the Death Star's reactor core."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the same time, Darth Vader brought Luke Skywalker to the Emperor in order to turn his son to the dark side of the Force. Skywalker dueled his father in the Emperor's throne room, and used his anger to emerge as the victor. However, after Skywalker refused to give in to Sidious's demands and kill Vader, the Sith Lord attempted to torture the young Jedi using his Force lightning. Unable to see his son die, Vader saved his son and killed his master by grabbing him and throwing him down the Death Star's reactor shaft. He had redeemed himself, becoming Anakin Skywalker once again and fulfilling his role as the Chosen One, though due to the damage inflicted by the Emperor's Force lightning, he died in the act."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after, Calrissian and Antilles were able to destroy the Death Star's reactor core, setting off a chain reaction that obliterated the entire battle station, along with IG-88 and the other Imperials inside it. The Rebel fleet was able to escape its destruction, as did Skywalker. The Imperials, having seen the destruction of the Death Star and no longer having Sidious's battle meditation on their side, were forced to retreat. On Endor, Skywalker and the others celebrated their freedom, as did the inhabitants of many other worlds. With its two main leaders dead, the Empire began its long decline, with multiple warlords fighting for power. Many Rebel heroes of the battle, such as Wedge Antilles, were hailed as liberators, and they helped form the New Republic shortly thereafter. While the actions of the battle did not signify the end of the war, they marked the beginning of the end for the Empire and also succeeded in restoring balance to the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, the Rebel Alliance learned that the Empire was constructing a second Death Star space station under the supervision of Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod. The Alliance leadership soon discovered the Empire had corrected the design flaws that had been exploited in the original Death Star at the Battle of Yavin. It was decided that the station would have to be destroyed before it was completed, as it would be virtually impossible to stop after it became fully operational."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As part of Emperor Palpatine's preparations for the upcoming battle, he arranged for Darth Vader to arrive from Coruscant to Endor in order to ensure with the overseer of its construction, Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod, that the Death Star II's weapons systems were completed by the time the Emperor arrived at the station. In large part due to insufficient manpower, including the deaths of several construction crews in an incident where a stormtrooper infiltrator droid self destructed the second it was potentially discovered from objects falling, as well as the news that Palpatine was arriving on the station with the implied threat of facing a severe punishment should he be delayed any further, Jerjerrod vowed to redouble their efforts to ensure that the station's systems were completed on schedule."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the meantime, when Palpatine was due to arrive at the battle station, Vader commanded an assembly of Imperial officers and stormtroopers to greet the Emperor's shuttle when it arrived, many of whom arrived for the rare opportunity to meet their commander-in-chief face-to-face, as the Emperor rarely left the confines of the Imperial Palace on Coruscant. Afterwards, Palpatine arrived on the station and was met with a parade of fighters and a flanking of troops and technicians. Vader, while accompanying the Emperor when marching to the throne room, informed Palpatine that the systems would be completed on schedule. After this notification, Darth Sidious, sensing Vader was still trying to search for Skywalker, told him that the latter was trying to seek him out, and that due to his growing power, they can only draw him to the dark side together. The Emperor then cackled in triumph as he believed that everything was proceeding according to his predictions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After rescuing Han Solo from the clutches of Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine, Commander Luke Skywalker, while the others regrouped with the Rebel Fleet, traveled to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training with Grandmaster Yoda. When he arrived however, he found the ancient Jedi succumbing to the ravages of illness and old age. In response to Luke's pleas, Yoda informed him that he required no more training, but that, to truly achieve the rank of Jedi Knight, he had to confront Darth Vader one last time. Luke, who had been told by Vader during their duel a year before that the latter was his father, questioned Yoda as to the truth of Vader's revelation. Yoda reluctantly confirmed that Vader was indeed Luke's father as Luke had suspected, conflicting the young Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Through intelligence operations that cost the lives of many Bothan spies, the Alliance learned that the space station was orbiting the forest moon of Endor. In addition, the Rebels learned that, although the station was protected by a powerful deflector shield projected from a base on the moon, the station's weapons were not yet ready for service. Furthermore, they also learned from the Emperor's datapad itself, stolen in the Battle of Korriban, that the Emperor was personally supervising the final construction of the station. Destroying the station while he was still aboard would deliver a crushing blow to the Galactic Empire, perhaps the blow that would free the galaxy. Mon Mothma, the leader of the Rebel Alliance, gave a speech regarding the information with a heavy heart. A few moments prior to her speech, Mothma had received the letter from her then-deceased son, Jobin, who fell during the Battle of Hoth months earlier, and learned of her son's fate from General Crix Madine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Determining the opportunity too vital to pass up, the Alliance planned a two-pronged attack. A commando squad, led by General Han Solo and coordinated by General Brenn Tantor, a former Imperial general who had set up the shield generator, would land on the moon in a stolen Imperial shuttle and disable the base's deflector shield projector. This would allow a Rebel fleet to attack and destroy the Death Star. Although the preparations to the shuttle in question, the Tydirium, including bringing in the task force, were complete, Solo did not find a command crew for the vessel in time, before Chewbacca and Leia Organa volunteered. Skywalker, who had just arrived at the Home One's briefing room after secretly training to become a Jedi at Dagobah, then volunteered as well, announcing his presence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Rebel ships launched an attack on Imperial forces near the planet of Sullust in an attempt to lure Imperial ships away from Endor. While the Rebels were successful in their objectives, it proved to be a miscalculation made by them, as Palpatine had devised a strategy to maintain the majority of the fleet close to Endor. There, the fleet would provide security and support for the second Death Star instead of engaging the Rebel Fleet, a strategy not revealed until the commencement of the battle above Endor's forest moon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebels were unwittingly falling into a trap devised by the Emperor himself. In an attempt to effectively eliminate the Rebellion, Palpatine planned on drawing the Alliance to Endor using simple disinformation: he hid the fact that the station's primary defense systems were already operational. Darth Vader's personal fleet, Death Squadron, was reinforced to a strength of over thirty Star Destroyers, assembled at Endor to await the Rebel attack. With Death Squadron hidden on the far side of the moon and an elite legion of Imperial troops standing by on the moon's surface near the shield generator, Palpatine was ready to crush the Alliance Fleet once and for all. Elsewhere in the galaxy, the Empire assembled massive invasion fleets on the borders of the Calamari sector and Mon Mothma's homeworld of Chandrila. Palpatine planned to smash Ackbar's fleet at Endor between the Death Star and Death Squadron while his fleets fixed the Mon Cals and Chandrila in place. Once the Death Star was completed, it would move to these worlds and destroy them to finally end the Rebellion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Endor strike team arrived in the Endor system, they ran into several tense moments after they gave the de-facto leader of Death Squadron, Admiral Firmus Piett, via Controller Jhoff the confirmation codes to clear the Endor shield, as they were, although technically still functional, old codes. Because of these tense moments, just before Piett gave them the go-ahead, Solo verbally expressed concern and planned to abort the operation as soon as possible. However, as the strike team approached the moon, Luke felt Vader's presence onboard the Star Dreadnought Executor, which was functioning as a command ship for the Death Star's ostensibly light security screen. He quickly realized that, if he could sense Vader's presence, then Vader could likely sense his in return, and that as such he was endangering the entire mission by being there. As Luke had feared, Vader did in fact feel his son's presence aboard the shuttle Tydirium and allowed it to land on Endor for that reason. Before leaving to inform the Emperor of this development, he managed to tell Piett, when asking if he should not allow them in that he intended to deal with them personally."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unknown to Luke at the time, the entire operation was a web of deception set up by Emperor Palpatine as a trap to destroy the Rebel Alliance. Both Vader and the Emperor were in fact expecting Luke to arrive, and each hoped to turn him into a new Sith apprentice. However, Sidious failed to sense Luke onboard the Tydirium, only discovering this when Vader disobeyed prior orders to remain on the Executor and reported his presence inside the Rebel vessel in person. The Sith Master then ordered Vader to go to Endor, anticipating that Luke would surrender himself in an attempt to bring Vader back to the light side. Knowing this, Sidious planned to turn the young Jedi to the dark side, installing the youth as his new apprentice, in much the same manner as Anakin had supplanted Count Dooku at his side 23 years before."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The ground assault"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebels took the Emperor's bait and a squad headed to Endor on board the captured shuttle Tydirium, stolen by Wedge Antilles on Prefsbelt IV. After using a stolen clearance code that, while outdated, the Executor cleared, Solo piloted the shuttle to the moon's surface. At that time, Luke began having second thoughts about coming on the mission after sensing that Vader was on the Executor; he feared Vader would sense his presence through the Force and endanger the entire operation. Sure enough, Vader had indeed detected his son and ordered the ship the pass before reporting back to the Emperor. At the same time, Renegade Squadron also slipped past the planetary shield. Solo's team landed, with Renegade Squadron landing some ways away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After landing on the planet, Solo's team traversed through the forest until they encountered two Imperial scout troopers, Corporal Avarik and and Sergeant Elsek. Solo attempted to sneak up on the soldiers, but the attempt backfired when he accidentally stepped on a twig, giving away his position and forcing him to take them out openly. The commotion alerted two more nearby Scout Troopers, who escaped on speeder bikes to report to the main Imperial base. Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, mounting the speeder bikes of the troopers Solo had felled, left in pursuit. During the chase, Luke Skywalker jumped onto another speeder bike and dislodging the driver. At that moment, another two Scout Troopers arrived on the chase, Sergeant Barich and Corporal Misik on their tail, Skywalker ordered Leia Organa to continue on her chase after the speeder while he take the other two speeders before Leia ended up being knocked away and then crashing her speeder by Barich, although he would eventually die shortly thereafter by crashing into a fallen tree. During Luke's pursuit, the Imperial reinforcement arrived on the chase and assist Misik to engaged Skywalker before several of their speeders ended up destroyed by Luke Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Midway through his pursuit of the Scout Troopers, Skywalker stumbled upon and procured a case of homing concussion missiles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke eventually encountered Misik, and they attempted to ram each other away. However, it resulted in them locking in place. Eventually, Luke managed to jump off from the speeder after disengaging. Misik then attempted to kill Luke by firing at him. However, Luke managed to deflect the blaster fire with his own lightsaber before he quickly sliced Misik's speeder bike's steering vane, forcing the doomed Misik to spin out of control and eventually collide into a tree, killing the corporal. Luke then departed to regroup with the task force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being separated during their pursuit of the Imperials through the forest, Skywalker returned to find Organa had not. Sending the rest of the strike team to continue on to their objective, and vowing to rendezvous with them at 0300, Skywalker, along with Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2, left to search for Organa. However, the search ended up sidetracked when Chewbacca, due to undergoing \"olfactory delirium\" from the scent of a dead animal carcass, unwittingly ended up trapping his comrades in a net, set by the moon's indigenous population, the Ewoks. After R2-D2 brashly freed them by using his buzzsaw accessory, they ended up surrounded by the Ewoks, although they ended up worshiping C-3PO, believing him to be a deity from their pantheon mythology known as the Golden One, resulting in the group being taken prisoner by the Ewoks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Organa, unconscious after crashing her speeder bike, was awoken by a native Ewok named Wicket Wystri Warrick. Unsure whether she was friend or foe, Wicket was initially cautious of Organa because she was human and the local stormtroopers had killed many Ewoks. However, after the two were ambushed by Scout Troopers, including corporal Oberk, and worked together to overcome them, she had gained his trust and he took her back to his village. There she was reunited with Han, Luke, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 after they had been captured by the Ewoks and taken to Bright Tree Village, where they were to be sacrificed. The Rebel heroes would have met their end had Skywalker not convinced the Ewoks to help them by levitating C-3PO on his god-throne. After explaining their story, the Rebels were anointed as official members of the Ewok's tribe. One of the Ewoks also explained that he knew the quickest way to the Endor shield generator, with Han Solo telling C-3PO, shortly after the latter stated this, to ask which way, as well as their need of their weapons back and fresh supplies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That night, Luke Skywalker, after asking about her real mother, revealed to Leia Organa that she was his sister and that Darth Vader was their father, information that shocked the Princess. Skywalker, sensing that Vader had felt his presence and had come to the moon in search of him, then left the Ewok village with a dual purpose: To protect his friends from discovery, and to surrender to Vader in an attempt to turn him from the dark side. Solo, unaware of this revelation when finding her outside shortly thereafter, tried to find out why Organa was upset, eventually asking irritably whether she wanted to talk to Skywalker when she was reluctant to divulge her discovery before consoling her. Afterwards, he ended up surrendering to a platoon of Imperial soldiers and was then boarded onto an AT-AT to be delivered to the main base, denying that any other rebels were in the area. However, both Vader and the commander of the AT-AT, Igar, did not believe his claim and with Vader's permission sent a search party for any potential rebels in the area. Skywalker then appealed to Vader to escape the Emperor and return to the Light Side of the Force, although Vader dismissed him, believing he was far beyond any chance at redemption."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the meantime, Major Derlin and the rest of the team dodged Imperial patrols, then stopped to make camp as night fell. Shortly after starting their first sleeping shift, the camp sensors picked up an AT-ST moving in on their position. Derlin had Corporal Beezer jam its transmissions so it couldn't call for help, then Lieutenant Greeve took out both of the scout walker's searchlights. Finally, Corporal Delevar used the Caspel launcher to pop a smoke canister through one of the viewports in the head, forcing the crew to abandon the vehicle. Forcing the pilot to make check-in calls to explain its absence, the team was able to keep their rendezvous with General Solo without alerting Imperial forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next day, the Rebels, fully rendezvoused with each other, accompanied by a force of Ewok warriors, descended upon a secret entrance to the Imperial bunker. While planning how to infiltrate the bunker, one of the Ewoks, Paploo, in an attempt to create a diversion, snuck onto a nearby speeder bike and raced away into the forest, initially causing the Rebels some concern due to it carrying the high risk of their being discovered. After most of the Scout Troopers guarding the entrance raced away in pursuit of the Ewok, Solo and the rest of the rebels easily gained entrance to the bunker, including luring the remaining trooper towards the waiting task force and forcing him to surrender, and, after capturing the Imperials inside, began to set explosives. Their victory was short-lived, however, as they were soon ambushed by another contingent of Imperials led by Colonel Dyer and later Lieutenant Renz after the former was shoved beyond a railing to his death by General Solo, who led them out of the bunker where they were met by hundreds of stormtroopers and AT-STs. With the hopes of the Rebel task force all but dashed, the concealed Ewok force surrounding the Bunker clearing launched a furious ambush, stunning the Imperials who had already dismissed them as primitive natives. Meanwhile, Renegade Squadron heard over their comlinks that Solo was surrounded, and they rushed to his rescue. First, they liberated an Ewok village captured by stormtroopers. Finally, Renegade Squadron prevented the repairs on an AT-AT that had been crippled by Solo's strike team earlier from being finished."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although initially surprised by the ambush, Tempest Force regained the upper hand and squads of stormtroopers pursued the Ewoks into the forest. Despite being outnumbered by the natives, the stormtroopers with their armor and advanced weapons forced the Ewoks back, and Imperial AT-ST scout walkers decimated Ewok holdouts. The Ewoks tried, but were unsuccessful with a number of tactics, such as using gliders to drop stones on top of the walkers, and trying to trip them with ropes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hoping to take the upper hand, a pair of Ewoks, led by the Wookiee Chewbacca, successfully captured Tempest Scout 2, one of the AT-ST walkers, throwing Lieutenant Watts out of the scout walker in the process, as well as knocking out Major Marquand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after hijacking Tempest Scout 2, Chewbacca, while aiding the Ewoks and destroying Scout 2's former comrades, recovered a case of homing cluster missiles, stumbling upon it due to it being camouflaged."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Renegade Squadron also sent at least one of their men into a walker. The tide of the battle began to turn as Chewbacca used this AT-ST to take out isolated Imperial units as well as another Imperial walker. The sight of this rallied the remaining Ewoks, who had been retreating into the woods, and they doubled their efforts behind the stolen AT-ST. Meanwhile at the bunker door the Rebels try to break in again, but a new security code was put in place by the Imperials during the Rebels capture. Leia called for R2 to open the lock, but the droid was shot and disabled by a stormtrooper while doing so. As Solo tried to unlock the door manually, Leia was injured by a shot to the arm. Two stormtroopers then attempted to capture Han, Leia, C-3PO, and a damaged R2 only to get shot down by Leia who had concealed a gun on her person."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Ewoks springing a number of more successful traps, they, along with Chewbacca's commandeered AT-ST, were able to defeat the remaining scout walkers, before proceeding back to the entrance of the bunker to meet the Rebel Strike Team. The strike team was initially concerned with the AT-ST's arrival until Chewbacca popped out of the hatch. Solo initially ordered for the Wookiee to treat Organa's injuries, although he changed his mind when the AT-ST's presence gave him an idea of how to lessen security at the bunker: With the Imperials in disarray, Solo posed as Marquand, informing the Imperials within the bunker via comlink that the battle was over, that the Rebels were fleeing into the woods, and that reinforcements were needed to continue the pursuit. Three squads of reinforcements were sent to help search for the Rebels. The Rebels, however, were waiting at the bunker door, and the Imperial reinforcements, sorely outnumbered and under the guns of an AT-ST, surrendered to the combined force of Rebels and Ewoks. The Rebels proceeded to infiltrate the Imperial facility, clear out the remaining personnel, and destroyed the bunker with several proton charges. Renegade Squadron prevented any stormtroopers from entering the bunker while they did this. Storm commando Captain Sarkli attempted to intercept Solo and stop him from escaping the burning bunker, but failed and was shot dead, with Solo also stating that Sarkli had chosen the wrong side as the Empire was finished (referring to Sarkli's earlier defection from the Rebel Alliance). Upon rushing out of the doomed bunker, Solo then ordered everyone to clear the immediate area from the impending explosion. The destruction of the facility brought down the deflector shield surrounding the forest moon and the Death Star. At the same time, X2, a former elite clone trooper who turned against the Empire, also participated in the battle. He met up with Col Serra of Renegade Squadron on the surface of the moon. There, he fought a group of Imperial troopers and freed several Ewoks before shutting down the Imperial communications network. The space station was now vulnerable to attack, and the next phase of the battle began."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The space battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the same time the commandos were captured by the Imperials, the Alliance Fleet exited from hyperspace and moved to attack the apparently unshielded Death Star. General Lando Calrissian and his co-pilot, the Sullustan Nien Nunb, noticed that sensors were not detecting the residue of an active or a deactivated shield, which meant that the Empire was jamming the Alliance and the shield was likely still up. As they pulled up to avoid crashing into the shield, the Alliance Fleet spotted a group of Star Destroyers moving toward them. The Empire, having previously anticipated the imminent attack, staged a trap to capture and crush the Rebellion by sandwiching the Alliance Fleet between Death Squadron and the Death Star II. Interdictor cruisers moved into position to project gravity wells to trap the Alliance Fleet in-system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "TIE fighters and TIE interceptors were deployed from the Imperial Fleet to engage the Rebel fighters and capital ships. Some of the smaller warships were destroyed by the TIEs, and the Rebel and Imperial fleets engaged from a distance. Eventually, TIE bombers joined the fray, forcing the various squadrons to fight them before they reached the fleet. They then had to protect the medical frigate, which was heavily damaged from the earlier attacks from the TIE bombers and TIE fighters. The Star Destroyer fleet itself did not attack the Rebels, however, having been ordered by the Emperor to not attack the fleet as he intended to reveal a surprise for the Rebels, the fleet only being necessary to prevent the Rebels' escape. Commander Gherant, when learning from Admiral Piett about how the Executor wasn't going to actually attack the Rebel fleet shortly after Commander Merrejk informed them they were in attack position, was caught off-guard at this revelation. Calrissian also noticed the Imperial fleet's relative inaction despite having a clear tactical advantage in taking out the Rebels and got suspicious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon, the \"surprise\" that the Emperor alluded to his officers earlier was revealed to be demonstrating the battle station's operability: the Death Star II fired its main superlaser on Liberty, destroying it. The Rebels, having believed that the Death Star's weapons systems were not yet operational, were shocked. Ackbar ordered a retreat, though Calrissian talked him out of it, reminding the admiral that this was their only chance to take out the Death Star II. Ackbar ended up agreeing, with Calrissian suggesting to Admiral Gial Ackbar that the Rebel fleet attack the Imperial Navy at point-blank range, hoping that the Death Star would hold fire to prevent destroying Imperial ships, and if that didn't work, they'd at least take a few of the Imperial vessels with them. Soon, the two sides were engaging each other at ranges little more than a few hundred meters, and the Death Star did limit its fire, though it still destroyed the Bulk Cruiser Urjani and an Unidentified MC80 Home One type Star Cruiser. The resulting strategy was also chaotic for both sides, largely because the scale and usage for broadside battles had been unprecedented. Calrissian's strategy along with the X-Wing squadron and Mon Calamari ship's firepower also resulted in the destruction of two of the Star Destroyers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the time Calrissian targeted the two Star Destroyers, he also located and procured a case of homing cluster missiles that were floating in space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even with the Death Star's decreased rate of fire, the Imperial fleet still outnumbered and outgunned the Alliance and with the fleet in their path and interdictor fields raised and generated by Immobilizer-418s in the outer system, retreat was not an option for the Alliance.

As a result, Ackbar needed to bring in X2 for aid. After destroying the enemy fighters, X2 was called to Home One, as it had been boarded by Imperial troopers. He and Ackbar defended the ship's reactor core from a group of stormtroopers, and X2 eliminated the invading troopers. Once the cruiser was secured, X2 proceeded to Endor's surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the course of the battle, the Alliance engaged the Empire's main communications ship, the battlecruiser Pride of Tarlandia, which was generating the jamming that was hampering Rebel communications, and providing communications support to coordinate Death Squadron. The 181st Imperial Fighter Wing led by Baron Soontir Fel flew in defense of the Pride of Tarlandia and inflicted severe casualties on Green and Blue Squadrons. However, Fel was receiving contradictory orders and the Alliance concentrated its starfighters on the Tarlandia, outnumbering the 181st and allowing Gemmer Sojan, a Rogue Squadron veteran flying as Green Two, to destroy the ship with his A-wing. The loss of the Pride of Tarlandia caused the jamming to vanish and disrupted the Empire's communications. The Pride of Tarlandia was also the second-in-command for the fleet after the Executor, and with its loss, the Star Destroyer Chimaera became the next ship in line."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After receiving word that the Rebel strike team had destroyed the shield generator, Admiral Ackbar ordered the fighter squadrons to commence their attack on the Death Star's main reactor. Taking advantage of the new tactical situation, General Calrissian led all of the remaining fighters of Red and Gold Squadrons into the Death Star's superstructure, with several TIE Fighters and TIE Interceptors belonging to Scythe Squadron and the 181st Imperial Fighter Wing in pursuit.

Green Squadron A-wings provided support for the Home One by disabling the ion cannons on three Star Destroyers. One of the Star Destroyers was severely damaged by a ramming attack from a CR90 corvette. With a combined effort of the entire Rebel flotilla of capital ships, the bridge shields were temporarily brought down.

After Jake Farrell - Green Four - destroyed one of the giant sensor spheres, Green Leader Arvel Crynyd attempted to perform a trench run across the Executor's dorsal cityscape, and destroyed several turbolasers before his fighter took critical damage from a turbolaser hit. Crynyd steered his crippled fighter into the Executor's bridge. Gherant witnessed Crynyd's A-wing approaching the bridge and attempted to warn his superior, Piett, about how it's too late to intensify the firepower, causing them both to duck into one of the crew pits as the A-Wing crashed through. This resulted in the cataclysmic destruction of much of the command bridge, killing all of the bridge command staff. Before the secondary command center could regain control of the ship, the Executor was caught by the second Death Star's gravity well, and was consequently pulled toward the battle station.

In the years beforehand, the droid IG-88, a feared assassin and bounty hunter, had prepared to launch a droid revolution.

Hidalgo asserted that a hyperspace wormhole transported debris from the Endor system to the other side of the galaxy, as with Darth Vader's glove in The Glove of Darth Vader. Hidalgo also uses another argument, stating that the laws of physics can be put aside in this case because George Lucas wanted the story to end well for the protagonists.
