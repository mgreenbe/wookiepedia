As such, it became a popular neutral meeting place for Syndics and other Aristocra of various Chiss families, who could meet in private in the March without displaying the weakness of going to another's office. The March of Silence was built thousands of years before the Clone Wars and was reputedly designed for the Nine Ruling Families to punish and sometimes even execute their enemies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From at least the time they were Councilors, Syndics Mitth'urf'ianico and Irizi'stal'mustro privately met there to plot the sabotage of officer Thrawn's career. While hatching the sabotage scheme, Councilor Thurfian mused on the symbolism of the March's reputed history as a place used to censure those found guilty of treason, and wondered whether Thrawn or he and Councilor Zistalmu would one day find themselves censured within the March."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
