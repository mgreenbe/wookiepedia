He was taken to Port Raga and was forced to confess to the Senate about abandoning Havoc Squad on Ando Prime. When the new Havoc Squad arrived to rescue him, Wraith escaped, leaving the Senator on a bomb chair that would go off if he attempted to move. Havoc Squad was able to defuse the bomb and Krasul escorted back to Coruscant under the watch of Sergeant Ava Jaxo.
