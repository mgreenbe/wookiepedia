Gunslingers were known for their phenomenal skill with blaster pistols, making them deadly in battle. Some gunslingers served the Galactic Republic, while others preferred to serve themselves. Freelancing gunslingers would hire their services out as bodyguards, professional duelists, or even assassins.
