In addition, the executioner trooper underwent several rotations during each session, and was even considered at times a test to see whether they would make it within the Stormtrooper Corps. They were trained to deal with anyone disloyal to the First Order, with it being considered an effective method of stormtrooper training. Unlike most stormtrooper variants, however, they were not from a specialist unit, but were instead randomly picked among regular stormtroopers for that day depending on various assignments. When wearing the Executioner trooper armor, their identity was left anonymous by not broadcasting their serial number which would appear on displays of other stormtroopers. The Executioner trooper also had a built in vocoder which disguised their voice.

Right as she gave the order, however, the Supremacy was suddenly devastated by Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo's suicide maneuver when she rammed the heavy cruiser Raddus into the Supremacy at lightspeed.

The three were later captured, with a second pair of executioners escorting them to the bridge. When the Star Destroyer was attacked by the Colossus, the three used the distraction to break free.
