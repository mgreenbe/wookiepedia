After Quelsh asked an independent agent to investigate the theft, Quelsh's aide Edbr Yamagh pointed the spacer to the thugs of Braggan's Fist, because he suspected their involvement. The spacer tried to make the thugs talk at gunpoint, but they claimed to know nothing. However they let slip that Braggan had been acting odd and had disappeared into hiding. They also revealed the location of their main camp near Tyrena where the agent found Braggan's datapad and the coordinates of Braggan's hiding place.
