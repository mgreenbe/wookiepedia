It was used as a ship to surface transport for the SkyBlind. Although only measuring six meters in length, it could accommodate the entire crew and passengers of the SkyBlind, as well as five metric tons of cargo. It was powered by repulsorlift engines, and was both airtight and water resistant. However, it could not travel far from a source of gravity, such as a planet. Not all SkyBlinds carried landing spheres; if the sphere was not present aboard a SkyBlind, the ship's cargo capacity was doubled."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
