After witnessing firsthand the attack on the Jedi Temple by the 501st Legion, Senator Organa departed Coruscant in an attempt to rescue as many of the few survivors of the Jedi Purge as he could. Using a stolen Jedi homing beacon, Organa was able to contact and rescue two of the last surviving members of the Jedi Council, Jedi Masters Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had escaped the Order 66 attacks on Kashyyyk and Utapau."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Organa later took the Sundered Heart back to Coruscant so Yoda and Kenobi could alter a Jedi beacon at the Jedi Temple, to keep the rest of the Jedi Order safe.

Afterward, Organa saved Yoda from a duel in the Senate Chamber, after losing to Darth Sidious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the Sundered Heart traveled to Naboo with the body of Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who had died on Polis Massa shortly after the birth of her twins. It was aboard the Sundered Heart that the fates of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa were decided. The House of Organa would adopt Leia on Alderaan, and the Lars family would adopt Luke on Tatooine. Yoda claimed to Kenobi that he had encountered the Force ghost of Qui-Gon Jinn, and said that he would be training Kenobi in his exile, as well as Yoda himself. Organa then ordered C-3PO's memory to be erased by Captain Raymus Antilles, to keep the locations of the twins a secret. Yoda left the vessel for his self exile to Dagobah via his escape pod, and Kenobi left as well for his self exile to Tatooine. The droids R2-D2 and C-3PO were assigned to the ship at this point."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Period"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, the Sundered Heart was modified with the Vanguard c20 retrofit suite, converting from a CR70 corvette to a CR90 corvette, as well as adding a more powerful engine bank than standard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Captain Raymus Antilles received the ship as a gift for running aid and medical supplies past several Imperial blockades.
