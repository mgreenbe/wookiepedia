It could be used in the player's home as decoration. It was made by collecting all the parts for the \"viewscreen printer\" item which could be looted from various enemies in the game. When all were collected and combined, it would produce one of three random paintings, the others being Coronet Skyscraper Blueprint and Freedom. With the introduction of the New Game Enhancements in 2005, several items required for the viewscreen printer were made unobtainable, making these paintings valuable collectors items within the game. However, this poster in particular was still available as loot from enemies, making it less valuable than the others."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
