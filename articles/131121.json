The name generally applies to both the original Dark Empire, as well as its two sequels Star Wars: Dark Empire II and Star Wars: Empire's End.

The codes the Alliance had stolen or bartered with slicers for did not work, and Luke Skywalker and Lando Calrissian were shot down over the former Imperial City. They should have perished, but successfully landed the gargantuan vessel without many casualties on the surface of Coruscant. For the next several days, Luke, Lando, and their forces hid and fought Imperial battalions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the news reached Han Solo and Leia Organa, they rushed to the rescue along with Chewbacca and C-3PO. They arrived in the nick of time to rescue Lando and the crew of the Liberator. However, Luke informed them of a great disturbance in the Force. At that moment, a Force storm came out of a hyperspace wormhole. Luke told everyone to go but R2-D2 stayed with him. As the Falcon took off, Luke and R2-D2 were sucked in by the anomaly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, at the Alliance base on the fifth moon of Da Soocha, code-named Pinnacle Base, the Alliance leaders reported that the separate Imperial factions had disappeared into the unknown regions of the Galactic Core. Furthermore, the initial phase of Operation Shadow Hand had begun: fleets of World Devastators, brainchildren of Umak Leth, machines which destroyed everything in their path, plunging them into vast furnaces which produced weapons and items which could repair or build new World Devastators. The first target, selected for its long and steadfast support of the Rebellion, was the planet Mon Calamari."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The recently rescued Lando and his crew were dispatched aboard the Emancipator to fight a holding action while the main Rebel fleets assembled."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At this time, Luke Skywalker had reached Byss, a Deep Core world enveloped in the power of the dark side. There he met face-to-face with the Emperor reborn; he revealed that for many years, he took to transferring his mind and consciousness to clone bodies to attain immortality. However, the clones were one crucial step from long life; they were more ravaged by the dark side than sustained by the Force. Luckily, Palpatine had numerous clones to laugh in the face of death itself, allowing him to rule indefinitely. The Emperor offered him apprenticeship and the prospect of controlling the enormous fleet of Devastators, as well as the rest of the Imperial fleet. Faced with an impossible situation and with a  looming threat of doom for his friends and allies, Luke acquiesced to becoming his apprentice, hoping he could defeat the Emperor from the inside.

Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo had gone to Nar Shaddaa, to find transport to the Deep Core. After landing the Falcon in Shug Ninx's garage, meeting Han's former girlfriend, Salla Zend, Han and Leia went to Han's old living quarters. Along the way, they encounter a woman named Vima-Da-Boda, who gave Leia a lightsaber. Upon arriving at Han's place, they discovered that Boba Fett was alive and that their friend, Mako Spince betrayed them. Pursued by the hunters, Han and Leia made it to the Starlight Intruder, the ship that brought them to the Deep Core. Meanwhile, the Rebels in combat over the planet Mon Calamari received aid from the Alliance reserves, including the new E-wings. Suddenly, three Devastators fell into the sea because Luke Skywalker shut them down from Byss."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving on Byss and missing Fett by a long shot, Leia piloted the Falcon to the Emperor's citadel. After she, C-3PO, Han and Chewbacca got off, Salla and Shug took the Falcon to a safe place. The four were brought before the Emperor and Luke. Despite trying to fight back, Leia was rendered unconscious and was brought to Palpatine's quarters to be turned. There, she discovered that he held hostage an even greater treasure: a mysterious and intelligent artifact called the Jedi Holocron, which the Emperor had stolen during the Great Jedi Purge from Ashka Boda. With both the Holocron and Luke Skywalker under his control, the Emperor appeared to reign supreme in the Force. He revealed that he planned to overshadow Leia's third child stirring in her womb as his next new body. In anger, Leia toppled Palpatine from his bed and stole the Holocron. She found Luke, who claimed he was free of the dark side, despite his eyes continuing to shine yellow. Meanwhile, Shug and Salla gained control of a Hunter Killer patrol droid to blast Han and Chewie free. After being joined by Leia, Luke and the droids, the Falcon took off from Byss. However, Luke revealed that he had cast an illusionary projection of himself to make them believe he had boarded so they would escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The real Luke Skywalker then marched into the clone lab during Palpatine's last few moments before the transition.

Unfortunately, he missed one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The newly resurrected Palpatine scoffed at Luke's attempts to vanquish him. When Luke attempted to subdue Palpatine, the Sith Lord seized one of the lightsabers he kept stored in the lab and engaged Luke.

Palpatine proceeded to complete Skywalker's turn to the dark side, reducing him to an obedient watchdog."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, on Mon Calamari, the Devastators were still invincible. Luckily, Luke managed to install a code into R2-D2's memory banks to shut down the Devastators.

George Lucas personally shot down this concept, and instead directed them to bring back the Emperor through cloning. It is unclear whether Lucas suggested the concept himself or merely approved it when pitched; Veitch has made conflicting comments regarding this."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Additionally, Dark Empire was originally set shortly after the Battle of Endor (as that was the timeframe in which the previous Marvel Comics series had left off). During the writing of the Thrawn Trilogy, Timothy Zahn was asked to incorporate references and elements from Dark Empire into his books, since they were set chronologically later than the comic. Zahn refused, however, so Dark Empire was relocated to being set after the events of Zahn's books. Some minor dialogue and art were altered to reflect this change (as it was too far along in production to implement any major corrections) and references to the Thrawn trilogy were inserted into the text of Dark Empire's opening crawl. It wasn't until Kevin J.
