Its gas giant shielded it from harmful radiation. The jungle resonated with life and Resistance scouts would routinely check for new species to be used in medicine, though the moist environment meant technicians had to work double-time to moisture proof electronics. Other annoyances on the planet included fungal and insect infections, but there were no large predators on the moon. Jedi Master Luke Skywalker compared Ajan Kloss with the planet Dagobah, where he trained years before with Yoda. He noted that the similarities between Dagobah and Ajan Kloss were that they were wet, warm, green and overflowing with life, but the main difference was that Ajan Kloss didn't smell bad. The Ajara gas giant reflected sunlight onto the moon's surface, allowing plants to gain sustenance even at night."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Long before the Resistance arrived on the planet, a species called the Kloss lived in the Klosslands and hollowed-out caves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the outbreak of the Galactic Civil War, Alderaanian scouts charted Ajan Kloss, which was located in a patchily explored stretch of space off the Celanon Spur. However, the scouts deliberately hid it from the Imperial Senate because it was short-listed as a potential home for a rebel base like Yavin 4 and Dantooine, but the shifting battlefront against the Empire precluded Ajan Kloss from being used during the conflict, yet it served as a training ground for Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa at the latter's suggestion sometime after the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the formation of the New Republic, Ajan Kloss served as a quiet waypoint between Republic outposts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Resistance maintained a presence on Ajan Kloss during the war against the First Order.
