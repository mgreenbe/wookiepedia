When the energy field of a lightsaber interacted with ultrachrome, it would be uniformly conducted across the entire solid mass, rather than be allowed to concentrate in one area and cut through. However, this also entailed that if enough energy from the lightsaber were transferred to the ultrachrome, the entire piece would melt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kar Vastor crafted his Akk Guard vibroshields out of ultrachrome."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial Inquisitors protected themselves with this metal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
