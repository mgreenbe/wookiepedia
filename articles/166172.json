Most yachts were similar in size to light freighters, though a few were as large as small capital ships. They tended to be fairly expensive vessels, with highly luxurious accommodations. As they tended to be relatively fast ships, some yachts were employed by smugglers, though they usually had less cargo capacity than dedicated freighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
