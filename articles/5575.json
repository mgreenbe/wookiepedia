This sometimes led to gridlock within the Civil Government, so Mothma, though wary of the same type of executive power wielded by the Galactic Empire that the Alliance stood in opposition to, would sometimes have to wield a firm hand in ensuring that decisions were reached."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The members of the Alliance Cabinet each had different responsibilities in Alliance affairs.
