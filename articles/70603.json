Jeremos was tasked with scouring the ship's waste bays. In need of some brute strength to lend a hand, the Squib put out a call for workers. After haggling over the pay involved (Jeremos wanted to pay as little as possible), she hired a group of laborers who, unbeknownst to her, were agents of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Jeremos took them up in her personal shuttle to board the Imperial craft, where they worked more or less independently."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once on board, the Rebels tried to undermine the Indomitable and further the Alliance agenda. The job was not as smooth as they had hoped, however, as the garbage bays were infested with dianogas and trash bats. One compactor even housed a malfunctioning assassin droid that fired on anything within its line of sight. Despite the inherent danger, Jeremos insisted on carrying the droid out of the ship and salvaging it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jeremos did her job with equipment such as a comlink, medpack, survival kit, and metric spanner; she kept this all in her backpack.
