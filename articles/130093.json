Their blue skin was patterned with thin lines across their faces. Their heads were capped with a knobbly ridge running from the bridge of the nose to the back of the skull, which bisected their hairline. Some Squamatans wore their thick dark hair long, partially braided into ponytails. They had pointed ears, and two pointed teeth which could shoot an acidic venom as a means of defense. The Squamatans had forked tongues of the same purple color as their lips, and large, yellow reptile-like eyes with orange-red irises and black, slit-like pupils. Their fingers ended in sharp, talon-like nails. They produced sweat when under physical strain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Squamatans were native to a planet rich in thorilide deposits. The Galactic Empire, seeking the mineral, enslaved the native species in order to obtain it, and ultimately depleted the entire planetary resource. The Squamatans suffered under the Empire, and as of the era of the First Order, few of the species remained alive. However, the species maintained a reputation because of their deadly venom."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Suralinda Javos, formerly of the New Republic Defense Fleet and journalist for Galaxy Beacon, a HoloNet channel, was a female Squamatan. She utilized her species' acidic venom on Lieutenant Weel of the First Order Security Bureau, surprising him before he could cut out her eye during interrogation. Javos admonished Weel for his lack of knowledge of her species, and escaped to rendezvous with her former acquaintance Poe Dameron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Squamata is the order of reptiles composed of lizards, snakes, and amphisbaenians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
