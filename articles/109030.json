She was chosen by Lady Proxima to be the Head Girl after Han revealed to her that Qi'ra had turned down an opportunity to travel the galaxy, but to work for her instead. Qi'ra attempted to flee Corellia with Han, by this point her lover, who had stolen a vial of coaxium during a delivery for Proxima that had gone badly. After a confrontation with Proxima, in which Solo caused a distraction by shattering a window allowing light in, exploiting her vulnerablility of her skin, he and Qi'ra attempted to escape through the Imperial control zone using the coaxium to bribe Falthina Sharest, an Imperial Emigration Officer. Sharest agreed to allow them through, provided they handed over the coaxium before passing through the security gate. Solo reluctantly agreed, and instructed Qi'ra to hand it over.

After a year of failed escapes, she attempted to do so yet again, killing the guard outside her cell and reaching the escape pods, only to find Vos waiting.

Solo devised a plan to give Vos fake coaxium, and give the Cloud-Riders the real coaxium in order to fund their resistance. Qi'ra, Solo, and Chewbacca presented the coaxium to Vos aboard his yacht, but he saw through their plan, made aware in advance by Beckett, who had been Vos' double agent all along.

As Ragon had stabilized the carbonite, Solo remained alive as the agents transferred him to Qi'ra's starship Vermillion, where Qi'ra, wearing a hood that covered her face, greeted Margo and Trinia and learned Solo would likely remain alive.

Speaking with the rest of the Hutt Council via hologram on his Shad'ruu war barge, Jabba was certain they were ready to face the new leader of Crimson Dawn, but Fett, who had received a bounty after Jabba mistakenly believed he had sold Solo to Crimson Dawn, also began to journey to Jekara after viewing the message Jabba received. Her message was also received by Sana Starros and Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra. Meanwhile, with the messages out, the Vermillion landed on Jekara. After landing, Qi'ra explained Solo's importance to galactic powers to Margo.

She then revealed Solo to the crowd and started the bidding at one hundred thousand credits. After multiple bids from different parties, the present members of the Hutt Clan began to bid over one another with increasingly higher offers. But this soon ended when Jabba the Hutt bid with one million credits. With no other bids, Qi'ra congratulated Jabba and told him that the smuggler was his.

Upon first seeing her old lover in carbonite, she questioned if he was conscious, disagreeing with Margo's assessment that such a state would be like Hell; to Qi'ra, if Solo was living in a fond memory or nice dream, it could be preferable to some aspects of life in the galaxy, yet she considered these musings to be unimportant when compared to her plans. She was also confident in Crimson Dawn's abilities, proclaiming that Boba Fett stood no chance against them alone.
