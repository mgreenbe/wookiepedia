While migrating, they used the specific magnetic pulses of nearby stars to guide them and usually avoided inhabited worlds. However, their way of navigation meant that any man-made magnetic pulses of a similar frequency could lead them astray. Ridadi were also known to migrate through the area near the planet Shuraden once every generation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
