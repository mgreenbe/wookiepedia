Learning of Kalaan's connection to the Rebellion, Imperial commanders planned to subjugate the planet and root out any Rebel presence. A task force of five Imperial-class Star Destroyers arrived in orbit above the planet deployed a cloud of dropships, mostly Sentinel-class landing crafts and Theta-class AT-AT barges. Emerging from the drop ships was a combined force of AT-AT, AT-AA, AT-ST and AT-PT walkers, with 74-Z speeder bikes providing combat support."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The columns of Imperial armor closed on the city. Some distance out, they were met by skirmish line of T1-B hovertanks. The hovertanks proved no match for the AT-STs and AT-ATs until the heavier T3-B heavy attack tanks rolled over a ridge to support them. Combined with air support from T-47 airspeeders and Y-wing starfighters, the Rebels were able to put a dent in the Imperial columns."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the temporary halting of the Imperial force, the Rebels' efforts were to no avail, and the city fell to the Empire.
