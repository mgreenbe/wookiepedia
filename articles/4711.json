Tanith's flying later resulted in the terminal illness Bloodburn. To keep her disease in check, Tanith took Hadeira serum, and became addicted to the substance. Tanith died of an overdose in 15 BBY. After Tanith's death, Akshaya became paranoid of Hadder contracting the disease.

Unknown to Akshaya, the girl had recently been abandoned on Tamsye Prime by Saw Gerrera. Jyn was desperate for a ride offworld, and lied that she could fix Ponta's broken droid. She proved completely unable to repair the astromech, but payed for her passage by forging clearance codes. Akshaya pitied Jyn, and allowed her to stay at her home on Skuhl."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Galactic Empire arrived on Skuhl, Akshaya together with Hadder and Jyn prepared to leave the planet. The same day as they were going to leave, stormtroopers showed up at their house searching for Jyn.

Jyn had taken the family's planet hopper, and attacked the stormtroopers holding Akshaya and Hadder, rescuing them. Akshaya and Hadder then took the family's other ship, the freighter Ponta One. Together they flew up in the sky past a dogfight between rebels and TIE Fighters intending to fly to Five Points Station.
