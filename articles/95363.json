Nardek disputed his claim and Bafor, the tribe's Chief, decided that the two would have to fight over the female. The female, who happened to be Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, refused to be anyone's prize and insisted on joining the combat as well. Physically stronger, Nardek quickly defeated Jeru and was going to take the Togruta for himself. Ahsoka, however, surprised him by demonstrating extreme agility and easily defeated him, using the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
