Hydroid Medusas were used by Karkarodon Confederacy of Independent Systems Commander Riff Tamson during the Battle of Mon Cala. They were practically invulnerable, with blasters and lightsabers doing no damage to them. After causing numerous casualties, the Republic and Mon Calamari forces were forced to retreat.
