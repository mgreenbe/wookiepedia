It consisted of two separate wings. The western wing was directly underneath the Garden of Justice, while the eastern wing was beneath the Garden of Equality. The two were connected by a hallway that ran around the north, east, and west sides of the avenue, with several trade consoles connected to the Galactic Trade Network in the northern section of the hallway. The district was home to Mariyk's cantina, as well as a Republic security base.
