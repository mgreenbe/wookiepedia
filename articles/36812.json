Keeping to a safe distance on the battlefront, they wore standard stormtrooper armor, often without a helmet, though some were known to wear them. Demolition troopers were stationed on Chinook Station on the planet Bespin some time after the Battle of Endor, and were involved in a skirmish there against members of Inferno Squad. Demolition troopers also participated in the climactic Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
