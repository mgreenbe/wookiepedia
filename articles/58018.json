The planet was stripped of its natural resources, and left to rot as a barren, uninhabitable wasteland. When the New Republic came to power, it managed to free many Gulmarid from the Azgoghk, returning them to their homeworld - though they soon found Gulma was no longer capable of supporting life. The entire Gulmarid species was brought to extinction until a survivor, Slique Brighteyes, hired Boba Fett to destroy the Azgoghk in 10 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
