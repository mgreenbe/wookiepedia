The Federation retrofitted a series of commercial repulsorlift sleds with the same design and technology, and re-designated the vessels as Platoon Attack Crafts, for use as troop carriers. The craft's drive unit was similarly adapted from a civilian cargo sled. The repulsorlift troop transport was twenty-six meters long, and was manufactured by Baktoid Armor Workshop,[source?] which was also responsible for manufacturing the Armored Assault Tanks and Multi-Troop Transports of the Trade Federation Droid Army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An unarmed variant of the Multi-Troop Transport, the troop carrier boasted no weaponry or heavy armor and had to rely on AATs and battle droids for protection. It was deployed behind the protection of ground armor in secure conditions, or within occupied territory. The troop carrier was also equipped with a forward flood light for use at night. Although the MTT offered greater protection, the troop carrier was faster and more agile, and many were still retained in the Trade Federation's forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The troop carrier was piloted by two battle droid pilots. Similar to the deployment racks used in MTTs, the troop carrier's single rack could hold one hundred and twelve battle droids, folded into their space-saving configurations. Together, these droid passengers formed a single company of troops that consisted of two platoons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Up to 28 troop carriers could be fitted onto one C-9979 landing ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the events of the Invasion of Naboo, the troop carriers were brought to Naboo along with MTTs and AATs in C-9979 landing craft.

On Geonosis, they transported battle droid platoons from the planet's underground droid factories for deployment in the Separatist forces. Troop carriers brought battle droids into the Petranaki arena when Mace Windu's Jedi strike team arrived to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Troop carriers were later used in the Battle of Kashyyyk.
