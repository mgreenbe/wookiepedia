This was symbolised as a sign of friendship in exchange for the hospitality. The custom originally developed during the earlier history of the Twi'lek people when different clans would first meet and change gifts to develop peaceful relations between the two. As the centuries went on, the custom would evolve and extend to personal meetings, business meetings and even during the arrival of a starship to a port; as was the case at Kala'uun."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
