He served in the Imperial Navy, shuttling stormtrooper teams in the shuttle Hard Liner. After he served his time he left the Imperial Navy with an honorable discharge. Erlick bought a YT-1300 light freighter, which he named the Flat Liner, and went into business as a free trader in the Demophon system. Unable to compete with the legal competition, he soon went bankrupt and was forced to turn to smuggling. He became the regular pilot for a group of Alliance to Restore the Republic agents, whom he believed were merely mercenaries, and impressed them enough to offer Erlick a commission in the Alliance Fleet. He accepted, and proved not only a loyal soldier, but an invaluable source of information about the Demophon sector. When the Alliance Army established Asteroid Base on Orflon they put Erlick in charge as a colonel. Before the Demophon system was destroyed by a supernova, Colonel Frodar sent rebel agents to oversee the evacuation of the Ssither from Jatee."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Erlick Frodar was a large, heavy-set man who cut a commanding figure. His experiences ferrying stormtroopers to their target worlds made him aware of how ruthless and bloodthirsty the Galactic Empire was, and he became a very loyal member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He loved space flight, but he loved his home sector of Demophon even more, which led him to accept a planetside posting on Asteroid Base. When he intended to send rebel agents on a mission he had a particular look that those under his command learned to recognize."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Erlick Frodar was an excellent pilot of space transports like the YT-1300, an able commander, and an expert on the Demophon sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Erlick Frodar was the owner and pilot of the Flat Liner, a YT-1300 light freighter.
