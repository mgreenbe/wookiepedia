When the Sith apprentice Asajj Ventress entered the cantina to search for the Crolute criminal Glute, she used the waitress droid's tray to knock a Khormai patron that had been harassing her unconscious. The waitress droid offered to deal with the unconscious Khormai, but Ventress insisted that he be left where he was.
