This technique, when implemented properly, halted the heart's beating, allowing the organ to maintain a type of stasis. The idea was to allow for a Sith to capture a target without having to engage them in battle. It had been rumored that Count Dooku used the heart stun technique to keep General Grievous alive after the wreck of the Martyr. Also Darth Maul used this technique on a Moorjhoni elder named Trisjon, who had sensed the darkness in Maul, only at a more fatal level."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
