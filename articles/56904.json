Hailing from temple island, he was a member of the group known as the Visitors, along with all the other male members of his species from the isle. The group spent almost all of their time traveling to other islands across the planet's oceans on a fleet of handcrafted vessels, fishing and hunting in order to feed the female Lanais back home. When Grebe-Korora and the other Visitors did return once each month they and the females would celebrate with a festival for several days before the males set out again. The porter wore a brown robe with a light brown belt and fingerless gloves and a blue scarf beneath a flat hat tied on with string. Grebe-Korora had gray and white skin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grebe-Korora was created to be a part of the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi; however, the scene he appeared in was ultimately cut before the final release.
