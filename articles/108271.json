In 1 BBY, Alliance High Command discovered that the Empire had issued Protocol 13 for the planet Lothal. Knowing that it meant Lothal had little time left, this revelation helped Captain Hera Syndulla persuade the Alliance leaders to authorize an attack on the Imperial weapons factory on Lothal, where a dangerous new TIE Defender starfighter was being developed. It was activated on Lothal by the rebel forces liberating the planet, to lure the Imperial garrison inside the Imperial headquarters in the capital city before launching it into the air and activating its self-destruct. Despite the intervention of Grand Admiral Thrawn, the ploy was successful, resulting in the destruction of the dome and the deaths of Governor Arihnda Pryce and the entire Imperial garrison."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Protocol 13 was activated by Director Orson Krennic on the holy moon of Jedha in 0 BBY, where the Empire tested a low-powered burst of the Death Star's superlaser. After the evacuation of Imperial forces, a single reactor burst from the Death Star destroyed Jedha City. A short time later, during the Battle of Scarif, Protocol 13 was not used when Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin ordered Death Star to destroy the Imperial security complex on Scarif. This resulted in the deaths of Imperial personnel on the planet, including his rival Krennic and the commander of the planet's garrison, General Sotorus Ramda."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 35 ABY, the First Order garrison occupying Kijimi used Protocol 13 to evacuate all First Order forces from the planet.
