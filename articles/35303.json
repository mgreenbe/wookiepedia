Mother Talzin used it in her transformation of Savage Opress into a warrior of the dark side, and Old Daka would later use it in the Chant of Resurrection in order to resurrect the undead. Symbols of the language, were carved into the sides of the holder of Count Dooku's lock of hair.Talzin again spoke the language after Darth Maul returned to his homeworld, and Talzin exorcised him. Later around 14 BBY, during an encounter with the Jedi Cal Kestis, the Nightsister Merrin repeated the Chant of Resurrection, raising the undead Nightsisters. When hair-braiding together cloth for burial pods, Nightisters recited a spell of protection."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known chants"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Chant of Resurrection"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A chant in which Nightsister Zombies emerged from burial pods."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Choono slalem denni tay'lori olee-ay.\nLucheno vadem klavlane.\nBlenay vedi nalem koreem.\nBlenay vedi nalem koreem.\nVillos susko kono lamal!\nVlemon tagoo!"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Nightbrother transformation spell"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An incantation in which a Nightbrother were given more strength."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Geiss kan erde mak harden ob stein.\nGeiss kan lewf mak krig ob blitz.\nGeiss kan pire mak blud loge raga.\nGeiss kan vass byn skol zum Asajj.\nErde-blitz-raga-byn erde-blitz raga byn.\nErde-blitz-raga-byn zum Asajj."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Spell of Protection"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A spell of protection was recited while hair-braiding together cloth for burial pods."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Unidentified Force spirit binding ritual"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A supposed ritual used to trap force ghosts possibly stolen from the Nightsisters."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Potion conjuring chant"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A chant in which a Nightsister potion could be conjured."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nadee, mah, reez, ven, doo, la, tren."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
