However, while Tomaas Azzameen, piloting the Vasudra, was delivering bacta to the Rebels, The Star Destroyer Corrupter and a pair of Lancer-class frigates, the Cascade and the Blue Hawk, dropped out of hyperspace and began a bombardment of the hospital, executed by TIE/sa bombers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Coen's fate is unclear, as it is possible for the vessel to escape, or be destroyed, depending on a number of situations made possible by random AI events in X-wing Alliance, as well as the actions of the player.
