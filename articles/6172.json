Amarin became a hunting reserve for Xim's empire. Following the collapse of the empire in 25,096 BBY, the Cron Kingdom reasserted its control over the area and remained an independent state. Several millennia later, the planet was enveloped in Darth Revan's Sith empire until its fall in 3960 BBY. Remaining separate from the Republic, the world joined the Brotherhood of Darkness during the New Sith Wars; the world was seized from the Sith after their defeat several years before the Ruusan Reformation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A member state of the Republic for several centuries, the world joined the rest of the sector in becoming member states of the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. While several battles were fought in the sector, the planet was seized following the end of the war by the Galactic Empire. Seeing the area as a threat, the Emperor divided the area in to three sectors, with Amarin being divided into the Allied Tion sector. Patrolled by the Warlord during the Galactic Civil War, the system joined in Grand Admiral Thrawn's confederacy only to be placed under the control of Sector Moff Gronn upon Thrawn's death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Forming an independent government from the New Republic the Allied Tion, of which Amarin was still a member, avoided the Yuuzhan Vong War altogether.
