The planet was home to the saber-toothed ketrann, a solitary hunter that attacked the migrating herds of metarshi. The four white saber-fangs of the ketrann were popular among game hunters, a fact that the Lellish exploited to commercial advantage. Many Lellish became professional advertisers and lured offworlders to the planet to hunt the predators for a fee; in particular, they attracted public servants from the upper-echelons of society."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the administration of the Galactic Empire, the Lellish gave a share of their profits to the local Moff in exchange for the right to limit the number of hunters permitted to kill full-grown ketrann each season. One Imperial civil servant who had dealings with the Lellish was Wilek Nereus, who eventually attained the position of Imperial governor of Bakura. Nereus gained a dental specimen of the four-toothed ketrann for his personal collection, and he later included his experience on Alk'lellish in the notes for his personal memoirs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lellish were mentioned in The Truce at Bakura Sourcebook, a West End Games sourcebook published in 1996.
