Notably, the Executor, flagship of the Dark Lord Darth Vader, carried several Titans.

Wary that enemy starfighters would swarm the dropships before they had a chance to reach their landing zone, Veers instead opted for several Gozanti-class Assault Carriers, which had a capacity of only two AT-ATs each but were more agile."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Y-85 Titan dropship made its debut in the new Star Wars canon in the 2016 reference book Star Wars: Complete Locations, an updated version of a 2005 Star Wars Legends book of the same name.
