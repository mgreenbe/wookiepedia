During his time as a Jedi, Sonam-Ha'ar became good friends with fellow Jedi Master Memit Nadill. In the year 5000 BBY, Jedi Knight Odan-Urr, who was in the service of Empress Teta of the Koros system, saw a vision of the return of the Sith. Alarmed, Odan-Urr, Empress Teta, and Nadill traveled to Coruscant to reveal this omen to the Galactic Senate. Sonam-Ha'ar was one of several Jedi who attended the Senate session. Although most of the Jedi present dismissed Odan-Urr's warning, Sonam-Ha'ar refrained from comment. Odan-Urr's forebodings proved to be true when a large Sith fleet soon arrived in the Koros system and began an assault on the planet Koros Major. When the Sith began their attack, Memit Nadill sent an urgent message to Coruscant, fearing that the Sith would soon strike there and prompting Sonam-Ha'ar to meet Nadill at a landing pad on Coruscant with several other Jedi. Pledging that the Jedi would help in the coming battle, Sonam-Ha'ar began preparing for the coming fight; suddenly however, Coruscant's invasion alarms sounded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A massive battle fleet, consisting of tens of thousands of ships, appeared in the Coruscant skies. From the warships came Sith dropships, which brought the Sith invasion force to the planet. Facing a massive force of Sith Massassi warriors and Sith war behemoths, Sonam-Ha'ar, Memit Nadill, and the other Jedi decided to make a stand on the steps of the Senate Building. The Jedi leaped headlong into the fury of the battle and fought with ferocity, but it seemed that the Sith would soon take the planet. Suddenly, however, the bulk of the Sith force simply disappeared; they were simple illusions. Seeing an opportunity to turn the tide of the battle, Sonam-Ha'ar and the other Jedi charged at the Sith, annihilating the rest of the enemy forces and winning the Battle of Coruscant. Overcome by the joy of victory, Sonam-Ha'ar and the Jedi exclaimed that the Galactic Republic would never fall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sonam-Ha'ar was a courageous and experienced Jedi Knight, one who showed no hesitation in standing and fighting against the Sith, even when the outcome of the battle appeared hopeless.

In these appearances, Sonam-Ha'ar was drawn by Dario Carrasco, Jr., and preliminary black-and-white sketches of Sonam-Ha'ar appear in the back of Golden Age of the Sith's first issue. Sonam-Ha'ar was later depicted in a picture of the Battle of Coruscant drawn by Bill Hughes in The Essential Chronology, written by Anderson and Daniel Wallace.
