During the Berch Teller campaign, Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit suggested that Interdictors be used to pull Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's ship, the Carrion Spike, out of hyperspace after it had been hijacked by an insurgent group. A CC-7700 frigate, a Detainer CC-2200 interdictor cruiser and an untested Immobilizer 418 cruiser became part of a flotilla commanded by the moff to capture the corvette in the Obroa-skai system. However, they failed and the Immobilizer was sent back to Corellian Engineering Corporation after there were many operational issues with it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A prototype Interdictor-class under Admiral Brom Titus underwent testing in the Del Zennis system in 4 BBY.
