During the attempt, Organa learned of Tula's Imperial loyalties, and, no longer seeing her as a useful asset, Dreed had her taken away for processing. To save the traitor, the princess agreed to exchange herself as a captive for Tula on the desert world of Skaradosh, a trade that Dreed chose to personally oversee on the planet's surface."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A short-lived command"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Dreed was gone, Venk was given acting command of their Star Destroyer, which soon became permanent when Alderaanian reinforcements killed the commander on the world below in order to rescue Organa.
