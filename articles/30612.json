It was responsible for conducting patrols of the planet-wide city, enforcing the law, protecting citizens, conducting criminal investigations and providing general security. The Coruscant Security Force was staffed by sentient police officers who wore a blue uniform displaying their rank and the Coruscant police symbol on their left arms. They were armed with a blaster pistol and also carried a baton and stuncuffs. Those officers who worked in the deep lower levels were referred to as underworld police. Swathed in leather and metal armor of shades of gray and yellow to protect them, the officers who patrolled the underworld were much more toughened and burly than their droids and sentient counterparts on the upper levels. The Coruscant Police utilized ranks, including that of lieutenant, captain, and prefect, through which officers could progress to higher supervisory positions. Police detectives were in charge of conducting criminal investigations and were referred to as inspectors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To provide patrol coverage in such a vast cityscape the Coruscant Security Force relied heavily on police droids, which were a much more common presence than sentient police, especially on the upper levels of Galactic City. Specifically, the GU-series Guardian police droid was utilized for patrol services and investigative support while police probes detected and reported crimes. In providing services the Coruscant Security Force primarily conducted foot patrols and utilized a variety of airspeeders. The most common of these were the Panther police interceptors which allowed for two officers or droids as well as a prisoner compartment, and the BARC speeder mostly utilized for patrol and rapid response. With the introduction of the patrol transport the officers were able to show an increased presence and firepower as well as provide for the deployment of larger forces from the troop bay. To assist the Coruscant Police, Jedi investigators, members of the Jedi Order who were experts in the workings of the criminal underworld, used their connection to the Force to help solve crimes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the beginning of the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems the elite clone shock troopers of the Coruscant Guard, a division of the Grand Army of the Republic, were brought in to bolster security on Coruscant.

However, the Coruscant Security Force still remained primarily responsible for policing Coruscant and investigating crime throughout the duration of the Clone Wars. They were present for several incidents including the murder investigation of Senator Onaconda Farr whose killer Lolo Purs was arrested by Lieutenant Tanivos Exantor Divo, and a manhunt for Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano who managed to escape the Republic military base where she was incarcerated for the suspected murder of Letta Turmond. Tano was tracked down by underworld cops and as a result re-captured by Republic forces. With the formation of the Galactic Empire the Coruscant Police phased out its police droids and officers patrolled the streets alongside Imperial stormtroopers. After the Battle of Endor, demonstrations took place across the city. Police forces attempted to restore order and without warning fired into the crowds with blaster cannons from their police speeders. Rioting quickly erupted and stormtroopers were overwhelmed as blaster fights between police and civilians devolved into civil war across the capital.

The planet's deep lower levels were patrolled by the underworld police who used a recruitment test to help hire individuals proficient in memorizing and spotting faces, among other skills.

Shock troopers patrolled together with the Coruscant Security Force, perform riot control, guard vital government buildings and infrastructure and protect the Supreme Chancellor and the Senate.

The most commonly used vehicle for patrol and pursuit was the Panther police interceptor which had a compartment for two officers or droids in the front and a barricaded section in the back for Prison.

Their programming allowed them to cause harm to others to arrest the suspects if a law was being broken or a citizen was in danger. However, the droids' rigid thinking could also be outsmarted, making them more suited to police the upper levels of the city planet than the violent and unpredictable lower levels patrolled by the underworld police."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The blue-gray droids had masculine programming and were humanoid in shape with a head that formed into a cylindrical helmet. Just like their humanoid counterparts police droids carried blasters, batons, and stuncuffs and responded to calls either on foot or in BARC speeders and Coruscant police speeders. Most often the police droids were the first responders to situations. They created perimeters, questioned witnesses, and collected evidence before handing the cases over to organic police officers and investigators."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, as the Clone Wars drew to a close the aging police droids were gradually phased out of service, replaced by clone troopers, and under the Empire, the Imperial stormtroopers.

A second attempt on her life later on was thwarted by the Jedi whose investigation led them to discovering Count Dooku as behind the assassination order and that he was building a droid army for the Confederacy of Independent Systems on the planet Geonosis.

Master Sinube, however, had placed a tracking device on Marcy and he requested to borrow a police BARC speeder from the police droids to which they consented.

Two Coruscant Police droids on BARC speeders picked up the chase, with more following, but it was too late as Kryze avoided capture by staying in the alley.

Five years after the Empire's formation, Prefect Phoca Soot, in charge of police operations on Level 1331, was called to the Imperial Palace by Darth Vader.

The episode introduced the Coruscant police droids which are called upon to assist the Jedi upon discovering a murder and then to help recover Ahsoka Tano's lightsaber. Dave Filoni, executive producer of The Clone Wars series, discussed the police droids in the commentary video for the \"Senate Murders\" episode where he revealed they were based on the Keystone Kops, a series of silent film comedies, favored by George Lucas, about an incompetent group of policemen. Additionally, he stated that the police droids were what he described as \"old bucket cops\" and that by the time of the events of Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, their usage had been largely phased out.

Tan Divo would appear again briefly at the beginning of the episode \"Sphere of Influence\" that aired October 1, 2010, when the Coruscant Police are called to investigate the kidnapping.

The episodes were illustrated in collaboration with the team that at the time was working on the canceled video game Star Wars: 1313. From this, George Lucas personally created the underworld police who were designed to be more intimidating and rougher than their counterparts that policed Coruscant's upper levels.
