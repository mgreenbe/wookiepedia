One of the few protocol droids in the galaxy to bear a criminal record, C2-D4 exhibited an uncommon capacity for deception and murder even before he became Jakarro's partner, and used his language skills to manipulate events towards profitable outcomes. He was eventually assigned to assist the short-tempered Jakarro on the Wookiee's visit to Onderon's royal court, and the court allowed Jakarro to take C2-D4 with him when the smuggler left."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
