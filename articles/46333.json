He joined the rebel crew of the Ghost in 5 BBY and was trained in the ways of the Force by Kanan Jarrus. Bridger's abilities grew quickly, and a message of hope he broadcast in the Lothal sector inspired a number of rebel cells to begin working together to fight the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 BBY, Bridger learned that his parents were killed while attempting to escape from prison. The young Jedi, already having struggled with his dark side, became more conflicted, coming to a head on the ancient Sith world of Malachor where he recovered a Sith holocron in the hopes of destroying the Sith. He also encountered the former Sith Lord Maul, who hoped to make Bridger his apprentice\u2014particularly once Bridger used the dark side to open the holocron. This briefly strained his apprenticeship with Jarrus, who was blinded by Maul on Malachor, but the two repaired their relationship and continued to progress as Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With his powers growing stronger, Bridger took on more leadership roles in the rebellion, including helping Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\" and a surviving battalion of Separatist Alliance battle droids make peace and bring a sense of closure to the unresolved Clone Wars.

While the Graf children were in the Bridger family home, the infant Ezra's giggles drew the attention of Milo, who presented him with his finger to hold and commented that the baby was cute. According to Mira, at that age Ezra was cute when he was not screaming, which he was prone to doing as a baby. Over the course of his early childhood, Ezra came to know multiple acquaintances of his parents, including the Rodian Tseebo and Lothal Governor Ryder Azadi.  At the same time, his parents continued their broadcasts encouraging resistance against the Empire, however this would eventually cost them their own lives. By 12 BBY, his parents were found and taken away by the Empire, leaving Ezra to live largely on his own for the next eight years and find work as a con artist and thief, stealing technology and reselling it on the black market, while unknowingly using the Force to occasionally get himself out of tough situations.

As they reached their destination, Bossk sent Bridger instead to lure his prey, Gronson \"Shifty\" Takkaro, out; soon enough, however, a confrontation between Bossk and the assassins Angrigo and the Kratchell twins ensued, in which Bridger stunned Takkaro, and Bossk killed the assassins, only for Imperial authorities to surround them. Aware of a likely set-up by Lieutenant Herdringer, Bossk was forced to leave Takkaro and follow Bridger, and the two escaped from the Imperials on a speeder bike.

Bridger, then, proceeded to stun the Imperial before he could flee the arena, just before Imperial forces arrived and swarmed the arena.
