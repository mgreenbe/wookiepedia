As a member of the Anchorite sect, Kolob believed in the light side of the Force and that life was based on suffering. During the last years of the Galactic Republic, Kolob ran an orphanage at some distance away from the Plaintive Hand plateau and the Valley of the Eremite. He treated the orphans like servants and taught them that life was based on service and suffering. His young charges included Galli, Brev, Narawal, and Kateena."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The young Galli was particularly rebellious and came to resent Kolob's harshness and chores. At the age of twelve, Galli snuck away from the orphanage and ventured into the Plaintive Hand plateau. There, he stowed aboard Sheev Palpatine's luxury yacht Imperialis. After being discovered by Palpatine, Galli was given the choice of death or serving the Sith Lord. Galli chose to serve the Sith Lord by guarding a secret excavation in the Valley of the Eremite."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After returning to Jakku, Galli wooed several of the other children away from the orphanage including Brev, Narawal, and Kateena. He used them to guard the excavation site and later killed them to preserve its secrecy. This site became the Emperor Palpatine's Jakku Observatory, which housed a holographic map of the Unknown Regions, several Sith Empire relics, and a borehole which led into the planet's core. The Observatory was central to the Emperor's Contingency plan. As a reward for his service, the Emperor recruited Galli into the Galactic Empire.

Following the Attack on Chandrila, Gallius Rax seized control of the remnants of the Galactic Empire and brought them back to Jakku. As part of the Contingency, Rax planned to lure the New Republic to Jakku for a showdown with the Empire. Rax's rival, the former Grand Admiral Rae Sloane, and the former rebel operative Brentin Lore Wexley visited Kolob's hut during their investigation into Rax's plans for the Empire. When Sloane demanded his help, Kolob willingly complied. From Kolob, Sloane and Brentin learned that Rax's true name was Galli. They also learned that Galli had spent several years guarding a mysterious site in the Valley of the Eremite.

Kolob was about to lecture Rax about the Eremite's precepts on torment when Rax interjected. Kolob then recognized Rax as Galli, the boy who had left.

When Kolob demanded to know what had become of the other children, Rax responded that they had fulfilled their purpose. Kolob then questioned why Rax was kidnapping children again. Rax replied that the children would serve a purpose for him. In fact, he intended for them to becoming his new personal guard of child soldiers, who would later become the first in a new generation of stormtroopers.

He derided his former charge as a little savage who had not grown a whit. In response, Rax told Kolob that he had rejected his teachings of servitude and suffering before plunging the blade into Kolob's middle. When Rax added that no more children would be swept into his hand, Kolob smiled and told him that all life was suffering and that Rax's suffering was just beginning.
