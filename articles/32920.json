The pistol was extremely powerful and drew heavily from its power pack, which gave it enough power to punch through laminated armor. The heavy draw drained the pak quickly however, and also meant the weapon lacked a stun setting. This earned it a deserved reputation as being deadly, and the weapons were outlawed or restricted even on some planets that normally only had very lax weaponry laws. DL-7Hs were favored by large numbers of pirates and smugglers during the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The DL-7H was first shown in Dangerous Covenants a sourcebook released in 2014 for the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying game produced by Fantasy Flight Games."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
