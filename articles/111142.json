He was the head of Sienar Fleet Systems, one of the Galactic Empire's foremost military manufacturers. Sienar produced the heavily customized Star Courier, the Scimitar. It was Sienar who designed the original TIE starfighters, drawing influence from Kuat Systems Engineering's Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor. According to Sava Korin Pers, Palpatine's luxury pleasure craft Imperialis might have been a custom job by Sienar himself. Moff Wilhuff Tarkin was a friend of Sienar's. The insurgent Berch Teller attributed Tarkin's ownership of the corvette Carrion Spike to that friendship, although many other shipbuilders played a part in outfitting that vessel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Raith Sienar was known to head his corporation with minimal self-promotion, and was, according to numerous reports, less interested in recognition than technical challenges and customer satisfaction.
