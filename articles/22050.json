While not full bodysuits of armor like their infantry brethren, the CF-9 was an attempt by the Republic Navy to offer everything a pilot required for combat missions without exacerbating the already substantial cost of supplying fighter wings, and the project had been a mixed success in both regards, but served well enough to satisfy the Galactic Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite being lightly armored, the flight suit provided just enough protection in case the wearer was separated from their craft, and improved chances of survival in the case of a crash or ejection. However, the CF-9 lacked many features that full armor possessed, and relied on more basic subsystems, an environmental seal, and the communication systems of the piloted craft rather than having such features built in. The design of the suit instead focused on regulating a clone's physiology during combat maneuvers, through its specialized respirator and other systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The CF-9 Republic Naval Flight Suit was mentioned in Rise of the Separatists, a roleplaying supplementary sourcebook for the Star Wars Roleplaying series that was published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
