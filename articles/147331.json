In circa 12 ABY, the rogue Jedi Dal Konur traveled to the shipyards and obtained a Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft, which he began preparing for a mission into Imperial space. While off-duty, Tomer was mind tricked by Konur into helping prepare the craft for takeoff, and so that the hangar controller would identify himself as Konur if anyone approached him. Konur suspected that Luke Skywalker, the headmaster of the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4, would send agents to capture him, and he hoped that Tomer's deception would momentarily distract anyone that Skywalker sent."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
