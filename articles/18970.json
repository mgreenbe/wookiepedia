By the time of Battle of Endor, the planet Gra Ploven rebelled against the Galactic Empire. The native Ploven refused to pay the expected contribution to the Imperial defense assessments. In retaliation, Grand Moff Dureya ordered the Star Destroyer Forger to execute a punitive orbital bombardment and targeted the lakes and seas of the planet with its turbolasers. The resulting steam clouds boiled alive two hundred thousand Ploven in three coastal cities. Grand Moff Dureya's executive officer Davith Sconn was later blamed for the massacre and forcibly retired from the Imperial Navy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
