A hand-held unit that looked similar to a datapad with a bulky top attachment, the imprinter was a dedicated inventory recorder capable of printing individual marker tags. Spacers could enter pertinent cargo information and create a tag with that information in coding and lettering. Information that could be printed included type of cargo, number of items, name of the sender, name of the receiver, and other pertinent data."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The printed tags could be read by beings, but they were designed to be scanned by tag scanner datapads such as the Data Scanner or by input devices installed on cargo droids. The data could be interpreted and checked against sensor information to confirm the cargo's contents. The Cargo Label Generator took about a minute to print a tag and had programming that allowed the spacer to produce multiple tags for the same item."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
