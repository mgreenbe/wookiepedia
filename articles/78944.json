To complete the move, a pilot had to cut the engine thrust and pull up a fraction of a second later. At that point, wind resistance and gravity would slow the starfighter, forcing pursuing ships to overshoot. Shara Bey, an A-wing pilot in the Rebel Alliance, had only seen one other pilot able to complete it. Bey later taught the maneuver to her son, Poe Dameron, who successfully attempted the flight tactic in the vacuum of space during the skirmish in OR-Kappa-2722 by activating counterthrusters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The L'ulo Stand appeared in the 2015 junior novel Before the Awakening, written by Greg Rucka.
