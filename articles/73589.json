The mission failed and the Kalikori was eventually taken by Grand Admiral Thrawn of the Galactic Empire, to be added to his collection. Some time later, Thrawn established a base of operations at the Lothal Imperial Factory, including an office from which he could strategize his next moves. The Syndulla Kalikori was one of the artworks which he would often examine in his quest to destroy the rebellion. The Syndulla Kalikori was then taken to Thrawn's office aboard his command ship, the Imperial Star Destroyer Chimaera. Thrawn left it in his office at the Imperial Complex following his interrogation of General Hera Syndulla. Jarrus retrieved it and returned to Hera. In 0 BBY, following Kanan Jarrus' death, on the recommendation of Chopper, Hera added Jarrus to her Kalikori. With this act of adding a new piece to the Kalikori, Hera made Kanan an official honorary member of the Syndulla family."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Kalikori\" is a word that first appeared in the 2011 Star Wars Legends video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as the Kalikori village, a Twi'lek settlement on the planet Tython.
