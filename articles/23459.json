This process required molten carbonite to be released into the chamber which was then flash frozen; a resulting blast of air, soon revealing a solidified encasement. The process could induce hibernation sickness after being released, as was the case with Han Solo. The Alderaanian Medical Association also established that inhaling carbon-freezing smoke was a health risk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker used a carbon-freezing chamber to encase himself, his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, his master Obi-Wan Kenobi and several clone troopers, so they might infiltrate the planets Gwori and Lola Sayu undetected during the Clone Wars.
