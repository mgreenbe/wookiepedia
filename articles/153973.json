The pilot retrieved the N-1 from the main Theed Hangar so Naboo's starfighter squadron could attack the Trade Federation Droid Control Ship and disable the Trade Federation Droid Army. After the pilot launched, an engine on the N-1 was struck by cannon fire from an Armored Assault Tank stationed next to the Theed Hangar. The starfighter plunged down into the Great Grass Plains below, killing the pilot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pilot first appeared in 1999 with the release of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace and its tie-ins."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
