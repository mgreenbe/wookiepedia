Starspeeder had a Jedi father named Edward Starspeeder who went to the dark side, taking the identity of Krio Vin and skyhopper racing. His older sister, Christina Starspeeder, attended the Coruscant Jedi Academy, a Jedi academy based at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. He attended an agricultural-based Jedi academy on Obroa-skai, prior to being invited to also attend the Jedi academy on Coruscant. There, he hoped for more excitement than at his previous academy, but his excess of energy often landed him detentions overseen by Yoda, leading Yoda to enroll him in the academy's drama club to channel his energy. He hero-worshiped his sister, but would never admit so in public."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Victor Starspeeder was born a couple of years after his sister, Christina Starspeeder, to Edward Starspeeder and an unidentified mother. However, Edward turned to the dark side and his mother took him and Christina and fled to Naboo, hoping Edward would not sense their presence there. Victor grew up thinking his father was a mighty Jedi who had died mysteriously, as his mother did not want to burden the small child with the knowledge that Edward had become evil and turned into Krio Vin. Several years later, a kindly man named Russell helped raise Victor and Christina."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Training on Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Victor formerly attended a different academy, where he proved himself a skilled yet unbalanced student. He accidentally got a friend of his stuck in a tree. The academy acknowledged that the school on Coruscant would make for a far more effective instruction outlet for people like him."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi academy years"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "First year"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Victor joined the Jedi Academy in the middle of the year, after spring break. He first thought Artemis Oophanoe was a Sith, and he became fast friends with Zachary O'Halleran, despite his sister's warning that he was trouble. He also became friends with Artemis, Emmett and Coleman. He had an instant crush on Maya Phoenix. On his first day at lunch, Victor rejected Coleman and Emmett's offer to sit with them and sat with Zach and his friends. One of Zach's friends used Victor's sandwich to start a food fight, but Mr. Zefyr stopped it. Mr. Zefyr thought Victor was the culprit because of matching bite marks. Soon, a few days later, he joined the drama club."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before he went on holiday, Ms. Catara, Mr. Zefyr and Master Yoda warned him about his grades. So, in the holiday, Victor was trained by Christina. After the holiday, he continued rehearsing for the 194th annual school musical. But he accidentally spilled paint on Maya while trying to paint on a tree. On the day of the drama, Maya and Artemis went missing. T3-P0 freaked out, and Victor set off to find them. Turns out Zach kidnapped them, and locked them in a locker. He blamed Victor for taking his girlfriend. He locked Victor in a duel. Suddenly Christina came and destroyed the locker door and freed Maya and Artemis. Yoda then came to the rescue, and they rushed back just in time for the play, which was a huge success. Zach mysteriously disappeared, and year one for Victor ended."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Second year"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Third year"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Victor Starspeeder was a brave and well-meaning, though often brash and foolhardy student. He hero-worshiped his sister and his father. Even when he learned his father had become a Sith Lord, he admitted that he had held him in such high esteem that he probably would have been duped into joining him. Despite this, he frequently proved that he had the courage to do the right thing. Victor had a crush on Maya Phoenix for a long time, though it is implied no girl has ever caught his interest before, leaving him with a part of himself he had yet to discover. When he learned Elara had a crush on him, he was initially unsure how to respond, but he eventually returned her feelings. However, he notably matured throughout his junior high experiences, taking a lot of his sister's advice to heart. He came to accept he could do nothing to change the opinions of those who gossiped about him, that nothing happened by accident, and most importantly, that it wasn't about him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Lightsaber combat"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Victor was a gifted lightsaber duelist, even though he preferred to use his powers. Victor briefly held his own against the slightly larger and far more experienced Zachary O'Halleran with only a year of formal training. Although Victor did not have enough experience to face him, by his second year, he was strong enough to best Christina Starspeeder herself in combat, albeit because he was being telepathically goaded by Krio Vin. Had Vin stayed his hand, it is likely Christina would have broken through his defensive montage and defeated him. However, in his third year he was the only student who could duel Zachary O'Halleran on even footing. He also defeated a Force-sensitive security guard with his lightsaber during his search for Mr. Zefyr."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Force powers"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Apart from his natural talent for lightsaber dueling, Victor was strong in the Force, being particularly skilled in telekinesis. This was demonstrated by such feats as accidentally getting his friend stuck in a tree, burying a librarian under a huge pile of books, and toppling the Sith Lord Krio Vin with a telekinetic push during their battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Victor was also skilled at using Jedi mind tricks, as they worked on Devlon and even Principal Mar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
