He tried to extort money from the Empire by pretending to have a cloaking device. When the fledgling New Republic also showed interest in the fictitious device, Keela opened negotiations between the New Republic and the remnants of the Empire. During the meeting, Wedge Antilles represented the Republic, while his old nemesis Loka Hask represented the Empire. An Imperial plot, involving faked video of Tycho Celchu and the imprisonment of Wedge during the negotiations, virtually assured Imperial control of the project. In the end, Keela admitted that the project was a fake. After the Empire was driven off Mrlsst, Keela remained in his position as president, and vowed to reform his ways and restore his people to their former glory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
