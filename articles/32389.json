They were almost always at war with each other, and were a client species of the Hutts. When not engaged in battle, they hunted the vicious creatures of their planet to keep their skills sharp. They were known for breeding Cyborrean Battle Dogs, vicious, dog-sized creatures that were fitted with armor and cybernetic implants.
