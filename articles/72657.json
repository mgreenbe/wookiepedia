At one point, he tried to kill rogue Doctor Chelli Aphra on Qlint and also worked with her on Dathomir. In the weeks following the Battle of Hoth, Lucky worked in a crew alongside Aphra and the bounty hunters Black Krrsantan and Tubleek Ruz to steal supplies that the Galactic Empire was transporting offworld. After their successful ambush of a patrol of snowtroopers, Ruz turned on Aphra, but Lucky used a sniper to kill Ruz. The three comrades then left the planet in the Ark Angel III."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The crew traveled to the Shadow University in the Outer Rim and, after buying drinks in the cantina, met University student Detta Yao, who offered Aphra a chance to help her find the Rings of Vaale. Agreeing, Lucky followed Aphra to the Ruins of Kolkur to find Aphra's former classmate, Doctor Eustacia Okka. However, as they tried to recruit her for their expedition, a group of mercenaries arrived on behalf of Ronen Tagge, who also wanted the rings. A firefight ensued, but the group was able to escape, with Okka agreeing to help them in hopes of being reinstated to the University. As they set course for the planet Dianth, Lucky warned the crew about Tagge's influence, saying that he would likely stop at nothing to get his hands on the rings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "En route to Dianth, Okka's droid TA-418 played a message from Tagge to Okka and Aphra, and Lucky noted to Yao that someone with access to her droid must be helping Tagge pursue them. As Aphra told the crew about her past with Tagge, Lucky sat and cleaned his weapon. As they entered Vaale, Lucky began to hear a loud high-pitched noise that none of the other party members could hear. As the group ventured into the workshop of The Architects of Vaale and then underground into their sanctum, Lucky doubled back to the murals to look for clues on how to pass through the door along with Okka. When Yao attempted to use a code to open the door, it began to emit a loud sound. Lucky and Black Krrsantan both fired at the key, causing the noise to stop but the floor to collapse out from under them. Lucky, Krrsantan, and Okka fell while Aphra and Yao remained on the surface, where they were quickly surrounded by forces sent by Tagge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just Lucky first appeared in the first issue of the comic series Star Wars: Doctor Aphra which was written by Alyssa Wong, illustrated by Marika Cresta, and published by Marvel Comics on May 4, 2020.
