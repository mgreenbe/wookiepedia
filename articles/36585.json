After they were freed, Blue accompanied Skywalker on his various missions, maintaining a relationship with not only him but various other individuals along the way. Blue was later abducted by Darth Maladi on Wayland, where she was brutally tortured and grafted to a nearly indestructible Sith bioweapon, incurable by even Skywalker's unique healing power.

Known for being a woman of choice words and being able to fix anything using a hydrospanner, she kept the ship intact through the most depreciated times. Along with co-pilot Jariah Syn, the three became bounty hunters and great friends, Blue taking a sexual interest in Skywalker.

Inside they found Screeger, who they captured easily. However, the group also came across a Jedi named Hosk Trey'lis, only noticing him because the Jedi healer mistakenly thought they had come for him and attempted to flee. Savoring the opportunity to capture the Jedi and make more money, Jariah Syn attempted to kill the Jedi to make capture easier but was stopped by Skywalker. A dart from Deliah's wrist-launcher hit the Bothan Jedi, who proceeded to send Blue flying with the Force. Nevertheless, the dart slowed Trey'lis, setting him up for a thud-bug thrown by Syn.

Skywalker stated that it was his ship, and Syn could leave if he didn't like it before storming off.

Princess Marasiah then informed the Mynock's crew that the craft the Jedi had arrived in would be the way off Vendaxa for her and her companion. Having strongly suspected the Mynock's crew intent to turn her in for a bounty, Princess Marasiah informed the Mynock crew that neither she, Astraal onr the Jedi had the credits to pay them for their transport. Syn and Blue appealed to Skywalker to do something, but Skywalker simply shrugged it off and told his crew to cut their losses and prepare the ship for flight, intent on keeping his identity secret from Wolf Sazen, his former Jedi Master, who accompanied Shado.

However, Talon would ultimately defeat Shado, Sazen, and Marasiah before ripping the blasters from Blue's, Syn's, and Skywalker's hands.

Cade, however, had distanced himself too much from the Jedi, refused to return, and stormed off. He then went to talk to Blue, and asked her what she would do with the bounty she received from turning him in as a Jedi. To his surprise, Deliah took in the revelation with good humor, musing that his Force abilities would be an asset in their line of work. However, Syn thought otherwise, resulting in a confrontation between the two. After disarming him, Cade took a walk with Marasiah Fel, before Imperial Knights Antares Draco and Ganner Krieg emerged from an Imperial fighter. The Sith trap sprung and a battle began.

Cade eventually returned to the Temple he once called home to rescue Hosk Trey'lis, the Bothan Jedi they had captured earlier that year, unaware his friends were being held captive as well. When Cade himself was captured, Krayt attempted to sway him to the dark side of the Force, first by injecting him with Ixetal cilona. However, as Ixetal cilona was a prime ingredient in deathsticks, Cade's body already posed a resilience to it. This, combined with his strong healing ability, cleansed his body of the substance. Impressed, Krayt then revealed Blue and Syn to him. Maladi proceeded to torture the two with Force lightning in front of Skywalker. This caused the Yuuzhan Vong coral seeds implanted in their bodies to mutate, causing spines to shoot painfully from their bodies and eventually lose their sentience. Blue fell unconscious from the pain. Cade was the sole person to possess a special healing power that could save a person from death, but also brought them dangerously close to the dark side.

A voice in Shyriiwook replied that they could shoot him instead, as Chak and Kee approached them. The Wookiee had earlier lent his ship, the Grinning Liar to them earlier, and now wanted it back. Syn said they lost it to Rav, and offered the Mynock. Blue immediately stated that the Mynock was not theirs to give away, but was interrupted as Chak claimed he didn't want the Mynock. He told Blue to help him get his ship back, but she refused to leave Coruscant without Cade. Morrigan Corde immediately spoke up, offering her services. This startled everyone at the table, causing them to draw their blasters, but Jool verified her identity. Corde provided a dossier on each of them, revealing a skill set essential for the mission.

He feigned another moment with her, moving his hands to her cheeks and attempting to electrocute her. Talon, however, was not fooled and knocked him out. He awoke in Krayt's throne room, where he resisted the dark side in refusing to strike down Hosk Trey'lis. Krayt did so himself, and Cade, in revenge, shattered the casing around his father's lightsaber and drew it. In a fierce duel, Cade impaled his supposed lover and dismembered Nihl. As he dueled Krayt, Corde jetpacked from the Mynock and shattered the throne room's window by shooting Krayt. Skywalker proceeded to leap out the building, catching Syn's hand as his ship flew by. As the two sprinted into the cockpit to celebrate, Cade looked for Blue. Syn told him she was covering them on the guns, but she was mad at him and it probably wasn't a good idea to stop by.

Also witnessing that Genocide on Dac, Cade revealed his and his uncle's former identities as Jedi. He apologized to Rawk and Droo for putting them all in danger, and vowed to leave with Syn and Blue in the morning. In the middle of the night, Cade woke Blue as he was getting out of bed. He promised Blue he was just heading to the ship to grab something and would be right back, telling her to return to sleep.

Suddenly, the Mynock was pulled out of hyperspace by the ancient Jedi Knight Celeste Morne. Morne, who was under the influence of the spirit of Sith Lord Karness Muur for the last four thousand years via the Muur Talisman she wore around her neck, used a tractor beam to pull the Mynock onto an Imperial Star Destroyer she had captured. Once the Mynock was in the Star Destroyer hangar bay, Blue was ordered to stay with the ship while Cade, Syn, Shado, Azlyn, Draco, and Krieg explored the seemingly abandoned hangar bay. Draco and Krieg split from the group and went to explore another part of the hangar, while the rest of the group searched the only other ship in the hangar bay.

Seeing Morne take Cade and Azlyn from above, Draco told Blue that Cade was dead and the mission was over, asking her to warm up the hyperdrive. Blue berated him for wanting to leave him behind, and defied him. Vao was having difficulties cutting through the door, and so Syn asked Blue to help him fend off the rakghouls that were surrounding the pair.

The Sith Lady also used Blue as a test subject for a new Sith bioweapon, grafting the living weapon to her back."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Immediately after regaining consciousness, Cade tamed a clawbird trying to scavenge his body and used his connection with Deliah to locate her. Cutting through Vong growths with his lightsaber, Skywalker eventually stumbled across her. He tried comforting her before using his healing power to remove the growth on her spine. However, the dark-side energies involved actually further mutated the weapon, and coupled with the Force-resistant Embrace caused Blue excruciating pain. Maladi suddenly appeared and told Cade that the only way to save Deliah was to use her pain to fuel his anger, and to give in to the power of the dark side. Cade agreed to try, and Maladi removed Blue from the Embrace. He attempted healing once more, but again only caused her horrific pain. Maladi continues to tempt Skywalker, filling him with anger and hate. Cade collapsed to the brink of the dark side, but ultimately resisted her and turned on the Sith. Maladi pushed him away and activated the self-destruction mechanism of the lab before fleeing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wolf Sazen arrived with Syn and Fionah Ti, having killed Zenoc Quah. Skywalker, who was still on the edge of the dark side, threatened to kill Sazen if he intervened, but his former Master attempted to bring him back regardless. The Zabrak explained that the light brought him to Cade from across the galaxy to be with him at that moment. He asked him how he can not trust in the light over the dark, or even the power of the Force at all. Sazen succeeded in convincing Cade into using the light side with his healing power. As the others fled the lab and the timer ticked down, Cade confessed all his feelings for Blue, finally admitting how much he loves her and how he needs her by his side. Using these feelings to draw on the light side of the Force, Skywalker was able to destroy the weapon, healing Blue as the base exploded.

Upon storming the base, the team fought through waves of stormtroopers and Sith Acolytes, only to find Isen himself missing. While Cade and Sazen interrogated the final surviving Sith, Blue, Artoo, and Jariah began planting explosives. Syn noticed Cade's anger at the Sith was burning, and Deliah added that while they were now doing great, they hadn't yet had much time to talk. When the last surviving Sith yielded no information on Isen's whereabouts, Blue and the crew immediately departed, leaving him there to be killed when the base detonated moments later.

Skywalker reminded him that they were invited, but Screeger corrected him, saying only he was invited. With the press of a button, a door slammed from the ceiling, separating Cade from his companions. Blue, Syn, and Sazen turned to see security droids aiming at them. As Blue and Syn prepared to engage, the Jedi Master stopped them, saying that if the Hutts wanted them dead, they already would be.

After some discussion, Admiral Gar Stazi himself appeared to negotiate. Informed by Cade that Isen had sent assassins after Stazi, Blue and Syn kept their eyes open. Nevertheless, the crew did need some extra credits, and the deal continued seriously, with Blue attempting to use her Zeltron ways to seduce the Admiral. Jariah suddenly noticed a guard raise his blaster towards the Duros, and immediately slashed him with the amphistaff he had acquired on Wayland as Blue tackled Stazi out of harm's way. He was grateful in their help for saving his life and that of his staff, but told them he did not intend on softening the deal.

As a crashing Sith ship spiraled towards the building, Rawk used the Force to save his nephew one final time, and defenestrated him into the lake. Focusing their energy, Rawk and Saa sent a beam of light skyward, creating a gap in the Sith blockade for a speedy evacuation to commence. Deliah found Cade in the lake, and descended to pick him up. As he leaped on board, one of Darth Krayt's Sith troopers boarded as well, although with the help of Morrigan Corde, the Sith was quickly knocked unconscious and taken captive.

Her wardrobe contained a wide range of tight and revealing attire for everyday use, swimwear, armor, and various other occasions. Additionally, her usual clothing was fashionable, flashy, and bright, often in neon colors similar to her own natural tones. The group often took advantage of her appearance, such as coercing guards to let them pass, evident in their entrance of Brogar's Safe House. Additionally, her species could generate pheromones to enhance their attractiveness, and had the empathic ability to read and feel the emotions of others. This made her very persuasive, and she even tried to seduce Gar Stazi, leader of the Galactic Alliance Remnant, for a better deal on the weapons she was selling.

After being captured by the Empire and facing torture, Blue refused to give up Cade's location, despite the fact that he had ditched them on Bastion. She would give her life for him, and challenged his decision to exchange his life to the Sith for hers and Jariah's. After being freed, she refused to leave the planet without him.
