Ships of this class were intended to compete with the Corellian Engineering Corporation's YT-series of light freighter, however they did not sell well, being overpriced for their cargo capacity. Some ships were used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each ship was 28.4 meters long, and boasted a crew complement of one pilot, as well as having provision for an optional copilot. Vessels of this sort could carry six passengers, eighty metric tons of cargo, and two months' worth of consumables. The craft was built with a class 2 hyperdrive, and a backup class 10 hyperdrive, and possessed an atmospheric speed of eight hundred kilometers per hour. Defenses included shields and a laser cannon turret."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Corona first appeared in the Supernova adventure collection, where it was depicted as resembling a smaller version of an Imperial Escort Carrier. However, the same ship appears later in the book, where it is implied that it is a Ghtroc transport, resulting in a great deal of uncertainty about the Supernova ship's actual identity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Corona's only other appearance is as a thumbnail silhouette in the Pirates and Privateers sourcebook, where it has an entirely different appearance.
