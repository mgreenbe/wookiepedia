Located in the wealthy neighborhoods of the Upper City, the interior of the Horizon Hotel was decorated with polished wood and expensive upholstery. The hotel bar was furnished with several tables and a number of stools along the bar's counter for patrons to sit at; napkins were also provided for the guests' convenience. The Horizon Hotel's menu featured offerings that included mugs of Tarisian ale and deep-fried coin-crabs, and the hotel bar had a formal dress code that disallowed helmets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 40 ABY, the Horizon Hotel's bar was staffed by a middle-aged Human male, who dressed in an expensive, high-collared uniform while he worked. That year, the veteran Mandalorian soldier Goran Beviin met with reigning Mand'alor Boba Fett at the hotel bar. Though the two men stood out from the rest of the Horizon's lavishly dressed patrons, the barman declined to press the issue of the establishment's dress code with either of the armored mercenaries. Beviin ordered a large glass of Tarisian ale and a bowl of fried coin-crabs while at the bar, which he enjoyed while delivering news of Fett's estranged daughter's whereabouts to the Mandalorian leader. When it came time for him to depart the Horizon Hotel, Beviin scooped what remained of his order of coin-crabs into a napkin and took them with him to finish at a later time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Horizon Hotel was first introduced to the Star Wars universe in the Star Wars: Legacy of the Force novel Bloodlines, written by author Karen Traviss and published August 29, 2006."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
