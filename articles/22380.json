Common job functions included taking dictation, organizing files, scheduling, and making calls. It was modeled after the Stacchati species. It had a preloaded number of languages, and it knew all modern and old business regulations and tax codes for thousands of governments. It had a vast data storage capacity protected by an almost-impossible-to-crack firewall. Slicers had developed ways to work around those firewalls, but, providing the owners regularly changed the codes, there was no trouble."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It had sophisticated programming that allowed the droid to act as a switchboard for all incoming audio comlink communications, text and data messages from planetary networks, and holographic messages from the HoloNet.
