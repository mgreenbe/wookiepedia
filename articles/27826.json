Two of the ARC troopers go after the nearest two, while the rest follow Fordo to the third reading; the transport is flown skywards to open fire on the approaching battle droids. As the troopers exit a tunnel, they encounter General Grievous, who is in the midst of a vicious lightsaber duel with Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi. Just as he disarms Mundi and prepares to finish him off, they both notice the clones, who unleash a barrage of blaster fire at the cyborg. Grievous flees the attack, climbing up the wall and onto the ceiling. As Grievous leaps down and quickly kills four of the troopers using two of his lightsabers, the commander calls for backup. The hovering LAAT/i breaks into the area and opens fire on the General with its blasters and missiles, which he evades."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fordo orders his men to retreat, despite Ki-Adi-Mundi's initial insistence that they pursue Grievous.

Since the Jedi numbers are spread so thinly, the Council decide to promote Anakin Skywalker to full Jedi Knight status at Obi-Wan Kenobi's request, despite protests from Master Oppo Rancisis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker walks through crowds amid the lower levels of Coruscant, surveying the surrounding people with suspicion. He thinks a hooded figure is following him, so he races off. At the entrance to an alleyway, he grabs the mysterious figure and ignites his lightsaber before realizing his pursuer is his beloved wife, Padm\u00e9 Amidala. They share a kiss and, thinking they have been seen by a passerby, Skywalker rants that they should not have to hide their love. Amidala reminds him of his duty to the Jedi Order and that she'll always love him.

When C-3PO reveals his new golden plating to Anakin, a musical cue of \"stripper music\" can be heard. In the same scene, Anakin's line \"Impressive. Most impressive.\" mimics the same line he says (as Darth Vader) over two decades later to his son Luke (in The Empire Strikes Back )."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Genndy Tartakovsky and team began working on this episode, George Lucas's first instruction to the crew was to resolve the Hypori storyline which the crew had begun in \"Chapter 20.\" He specified this because his son Jett was eager to find out how that particular story ends, as there were originally no plans to continue the series beyond \"Chapter 20.\" The unique designs on the front of the clones' LAATs were inspired by nose art seen on military aircraft. According to Paul Rudish on the Volume Two DVD commentary, the front of the LAAT featured at the beginning of this episode was meant to look like the face of a rancor. The clones' customizations of their helmets in this episode and in the rest of Volume Two is based on real-life actions done by soldiers during World War II and the Vietnam War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to the commentary for \"Chapter 3,\" the creators had studied how special forces teams acted in real combat situations, to ensure the ARC troopers acted very much like a crack special forces team would. They apparently reapplied their knowledge for this episode (Captain Fordo used hand signals instead of actually speaking, and as they approach Ki-Adi-Mundi and General Grievous he directed members to perform what appear to be flanking maneuvers). According to the episode commentary, Ki-Adi-Mundi's concern for Shaak Ti was intended to hint at a possible relationship between the two. Most of the sentient species in the Mos Eisley Cantina scenes in A New Hope appear in the underlevels of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the series, Anakin is depicted as being knighted very early on (while his hair is still short) as a response to a shortage of Jedi Knights, and believing that Anakin was long overdue for knighthood. This seemingly conflicts with the novel Jedi Trial by David Sherman and Dan Cragg, in which Anakin, only a few months prior to Revenge of the Sith, is sent on a mission to earn his knighthood. However, Leland Chee did confirm that there is in fact a jump in time between the conclusion of the Hypori battle and the Jedi Council scenes leading up to Anakin's knighting, claiming Anakin's hair was in a top-knot that he merely let down after being knighted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although K'Kruhk appears to have been killed by Grievous in \"Chapter 20,\" and is not rescued with the other Jedi, he is actually known to have survived this battle and is in a state of hibernation when Grievous takes his lightsaber. Although Eeth Koth remained canonically dead after the First Battle of Geonosis, a Zabrak Jedi High Council member that appears in the Council scene, officially credited as Agen Kolar, was animated instead with the likeness of Eeth Koth. It is unknown if the character was originally intended to be Eeth Koth (in ignorance of his canonical death) and then retroactively credited as Agen Kolar to avoid a continuity problem, or if the Zabrak was always intended to be Kolar and the animators accidentally used the wrong reference photographs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
