Within the topmost chamber of the Tower was the meeting place of the Council of Reconciliation, one of the four Jedi Councils of the Jedi Order during the reign of the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tower of Reconciliation was added to the Temple post 4000 BBY and served the Order for a brief time before it collapsed during the Sacking of Coruscant in 3653 BBY. While reconstruction was postponed for several centuries, the Tower was eventually finished during the expansion of 1019 BBY. Serving the Order throughout its next millennia, the Council worked closely with the Galactic Senate in order to find the most diplomatic solution to the crises that plagued the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Surviving the Clone Wars, the Tower was ruined when the Grand Army of the Republic invaded per Operation: Knightfall. Led by Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, the 501st Legion laid waste to the complex blasting the Tower from the inside and out, reducing many of its interior chambers to rubble and destroying the polished facade. It was here, in 19 ABY ex-Jedi Ferus Olin entered the Temple for the first time since his self-imposed exile from the Order. Entering through a large gash above the gardens of Jedi Master Yoland Fee, Olin climbed through the rubble and made his way down out of the Tower and into a droid repair center."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Standing abandoned for the next several decades, the Tower eventually crumbled during the disaster involving the Lusankya after the New Republic conquered Coruscant. The rest of the Temple would eventually crumble during the Yuuzhan Vong War, but eventually saw reconstruction under the leadership of the Galactic Alliance. Using blueprints salvaged from the ruined Jedi Archives, the Reconstruction Authority rebuilt the Ziggurat, towers and all, although they were now concealed behind a transparisteel-and-stone exterior. Whether the Council of Reconciliation was reconvened within the reformed Jedi Order by this point is unknown."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, in 43 ABY one of the Tower's gardens was used as a meeting place between Grand Master Kenth Hamner and Chief of State Natasi Daala. Also in attendance were Jedi Leia Organa Solo and Jaina Solo, Captain Han Solo, and Daala's assistant, Wynn Dorvan. With gentle music playing from somewhere in the garden, the group met over a small table arranged with treats and beverages that went untouched by the Order's guests as she made demands for the release of rogue Knight Seff Hellin and for the Council to reveal the members of the covert organization Darkmeld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Layout"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located on the southeast corner of the Temple, the Tower of Reconciliation was designed to symbolize unity and the steps to enlightenment each Jedi must take. The masonry of the spire was supported by a highly-tensile substance known as magnate, which aided in the support of the thin frame of the tower. The tower was crowned by a Council Chamber, like to that in each of the other three Council towers of the Temple. Atop the spire were a series of reception/transmission antennas which, along with a constant connection to the HoloNet, tapped into the cosmic energy fields of the galaxy itself in order to stay in contact with Jedi on far-flung planets. The central topmast of this unique array of antennas was a powerful multi-frequency eradicator/scrambler that when coupled with the eradicators incorporated into the tower's frame scrambled all communications in and out of the Temple. Communication bundles in the wall cavities fed data from these masts, through the columns within the Council chambers, to the Operations Planning Center. Receiver vanes within the walls of the spire converted signals from hyperspace locations into real-space coordinates before displaying them on the map."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ascending from the base of the tower was a dedicated turbolift crafted by great Jedi architects to incorporate Force-inspired, internal dynamics, allowing for the different sizes and shapes of the Order's members to ascend the narrow spire. At the base of tower was a reception and entrance hall leading from the roof of the Temple Ziggurat into the center of the tower. Two large bronzium statues flanked the entrance; their lightsabers crossed over the entry, lifting to allow access to the Tower. The hall beyond was dotted with six bronzium statues of long dead Jedi, with two doors to either side, leading to curved halls. A large memorial statue was held in the cavernous center shaft of the Tower, held by repulsorpads. A bridge spanned the lofty shaft of the tower, passing around the chest of the statue and into a chamber on the other side. Near the top of the tower, three Contemplation Stations were spaced evenly from each other to provide a meditative retreat for Jedi preparing to go before the Council.Master Yoland Fee maintained a garden in the tower which supplied the refectories with herbs and vegetables. This chamber, located high in the tower, was unofficially off-limits to most Jedi as Master Fee disliked when students took herbs and spice from his garden."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each spire was also equipped with a hangar; though they would be completely refurbished just before the Clone Wars began. A landing platform extended from the hangar mouth, allowing for ships to land and depart away from the Tower's structure. Located fifteen stories below the council chambers, the hangars were connected with a small garage that serviced the space craft. Also within the Tower were the chambers and offices of Jedi Council members."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
