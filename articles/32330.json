The implant increased the speed of the user's neural impulses and the distance that the impulses traveled, which in turn improved the user's reaction time and aided his or her fine motor control. The user of a cyber reaction system required a large amount of training with implants before being able to handle the implant's effects. The implant was colored blue over most of its surface, with touches of white around the edges."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cyber reaction systems were in use during the years surrounding the Jedi Civil War.
