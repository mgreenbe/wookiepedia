Making its way past the army of B2 super battle droids that surrounded the assault ship, the gunship dropped remote thermal detonators over the droids, before blasting its way into the Acclamator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After debarking from the LAAT, the Muunilinst-10 were met a wounded Ki-Adi-Mundi dueling General Grievous. Fordo and his men wasted no time in opening fire on the cyborg general, but Grievous was able to evade their shots. The captain reacted by having his gunship pilot blast his way into the area, and open fire on Grievous with the ship's weapons. While the cyborg fled the site, Fordo's men recovered the other surviving Jedi; Aayla Secura and Shaak Ti. When the captain ordered his men back onboard the gunship, Ki-Adi-Mundi protested, insisting that they pursue Grievous, but Fordo pointed out that the survivors would surely perish if they lingered on Hypori. The general relented, and boarded the craft. As they flew away from the Acclamator, Fordo activated the remote bombs, wiping out a large number of enemy troops and clearing a path for the gunship to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
