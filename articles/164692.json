The Wookiee Trade Guild was taxed by the Trade Federation in 28 BBY, but resisted the taxation, much to the aggravation of the Federation. Under the leadership of Count Dooku, an army of 200 battle droids\u2014B1-Series battle droids, droidekas, Vulture droids, and the newly manufactured B2 super battle droids\u2014were sent to Kashyyyk. The Wookiee Trade Guild deployed their army of 200 Wookiees they had amassed to fight off the droids. As a result, a battle began between the Guild's army and the Federation's droid forces.
