The crew of the Ghost ran a 22 pickup during their mission to rescue Wookiee prisoners in the Spice Mines of Kessel. While Kanan Jarrus held off Imperial troops with a lightsaber, Garazeb Orrelios and Sabine Wren led the Wookiee prisoners into a cargo container. That container was then picked up by the Ghost, piloted by Hera Syndulla, on which the crew and the prisoners successfully escaped Kessel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
