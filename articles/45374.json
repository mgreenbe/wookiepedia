The Pilgrims built Kalikori village between the Jedi Temple and the Tythos Ridge mountain range, in defiance of the Galactic Senate's refusal of settlement rights, and worked to survive on Tython despite attacks by the native Flesh Raiders. In 3643 BBY, the Flesh Raiders began moving against both the villagers and the Jedi Order in an organized fashion, leading the Jedi to reach out to the villagers and work to halt the Flesh Raider threat.

However, the Dark Jedi Bengel Morr\u2014the man responsible for the Flesh Raiders' recent activities\u2014approached the villagers with an offer: In return for helping him capture Orgus Din, his former teacher, Morr would spare Kalikori from further attacks.

When the apprentice recovered from the dart, Moorint explained that Morr had changed their deal, but the Padawan reached out with the Force and convinced the trio to leave the building peacefully.
