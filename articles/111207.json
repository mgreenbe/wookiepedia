Shaped similar to the Star Forge like most Rakatan vehicles, Annihilators walked on two legs with a central sphere between them; the sphere featured two smaller lasers that complemented the large destructive beam that could be generated from its underside. A thin red viewport spanned the sphere. Annihilators were deployed on the planet Shikaakwa in 25,792 BBY during the invasion of the Tython system, though they were destroyed by Je'daii starfighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
