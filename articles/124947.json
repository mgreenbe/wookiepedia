Zeen Mrala, a Force-sensitive girl taken in by the Jedi, had come to the moon in search of her former friend Krix Kamerat, who had been taken by the pirates during their attack on Trymant IV. When Padawans Lula Talisola, Farzala Tarabal and Qort followed Mrala to Quantxi, they found the Nihil attempting to massacre the local Junk Mavens, and Tarabal and Qort stopped to help them while Talisola followed Mrala. Jedi Masters Yoda, Torban Buck and Kantam Sy, who had just fought a space battle against more Nihil forces, followed the Padawans to the moon and assisted in the fight, although Yoda disappeared on another mission partway through. With the pirates antagonizing the Junk Mavens defeated by the Mavens, the Padawans, and a Mantellian Savrip allied with them, Talisola, Mrala, Sy and Buck attempted to prevent Kamerat from escaping with Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro. However, the Spider Cruiser Squall Spider was able to assist in the pirates' escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
