A celebrated fighter, Fisto served the Republic as a general for the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, a galaxy-wide conflict between the Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems. Fisto fought in various campaigns and over the course of the war was accepted as a member of the Jedi High Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fisto took part in several battles during the early stages of the war, first serving in the opening conflict of the war on Geonosis and shortly thereafter in a covert operation on the planet Hissrich. Following the escape of Separatist leader Nute Gunray from Republic custody, Fisto and his former padawan Nahdar Vebb were tasked with tracking down the fugitive. Their mission went awry, however, as they instead ended up facing the notorious Jedi hunter and Separatist General Grievous in his lair. While Vebb perished at the hands of the General, Fisto very nearly bested him in combat and escaped with his life but without Gunray, ultimately making the mission a failure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a schism between the Mon Calamari and Quarren peoples on Mon Cala, Fisto was sent to aid the Mon Calamari against the Separatist-backed Quarren.

With a Separatist victory looming, Fisto and several others escaped into hiding, though he was eventually captured and tortured. The Mon Calamari and Quarren later rekindled their alliance and repelled the Separatists, aided by the freed Fisto. Following the Mon Cala campaign, Fisto took a more active role on the High Council. As the end of the war drew near, Anakin Skywalker revealed to Mace Windu that Chancellor Palpatine was a Sith Lord. Windu took Fisto and fellow Masters Agen Kolar and Saesee Tiin to Palpatine's office to arrest him.

He eventually discovered it was bounty hunter Jango Fett, and subsequently followed him to the barren world of Geonosis. There, he discovered that the Separatists had been developing their own droid army, and contacted the Jedi Temple about his findings moments before he was discovered, and captured.

With thousands of droids in front of them, Fisto and the other Jedi ignited their lightsabers, running toward them and began cutting them down one by one. At one point during the battle, Fisto encountered a malfunctioning droid with the head of C-3PO, Amidala's protocol droid which took several potshots at him whilst apologizing for doing so.

The two tasked him with tracking Gunray's stolen ship down, and bringing him back so that he should face trial after the attempted kidnapping of Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala on Rodia. Kit Fisto tracked the location of the stolen ship to the Vassek system. Upon arriving, he contacted the two female Jedi to let them know of his progress, to which they let him know that his former Padawan, Nahdar Vebb, had already trailed the stolen ship, and had landed on the surface of Vassek's third moon. Upon landing on the moon's surface, Fisto reunited with Vebb, congratulating him on his promotion to the rank of Jedi Knight, and expressed his sorrow that he could have not seen the last of his trials. Fisto, Vebb, and several clone troopers then continued to trace the tracking beacon to the entrance of a large fortress, which appeared to be sealed shut. Vebb suggested cutting open the door, while Clone Commander Fil expressed that they should blow it up. Assessing the situation, Master Fisto simply pressed a specific part of the door, and it opened, allowing them to walk inside as he remarked that a second look usually paid off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the group roamed the dimly lit corridors of the fortress, Kit Fisto noted that he sensed something. Moments later, they heard a screeching noise before finally discovering a hall in which they could see and hear what they thought to be Gunray addressing orders to his battle droids. The two Jedi then simply strolled in, and with ease cut down the droids. Thinking they had caught the Viceroy, Nahdar Vebb used the Force to swerve his chair to face them, only to find a hologram of the cowardly Neimoidian. Gunray exclaimed that they were fools and welcomed them to their supposed doom. Moments later, a hologram of Count Dooku appeared, who apologized for the deception, and offered them an alternative prize, before flickering off, leaving the Jedi stumped. The group then continued walking through the corridors in an attempt to find out why they had been lured there. Fisto noticed several statues, all depicting the same strange warrior but in different stages of apparent cybernetic augmentation, and grew more and more uneasy until they found themselves in a room containing multiple copies of a familiar mask, causing him to realize with horror that they were in the lair of General Grievous. Fisto was left utterly confused as to why Count Dooku would lure them there as a trap for his own ally. While he discussed the matter with Nahdar, examining the general's macabre collection of items taken from murdered Jedi, they received a transmission that there was an incoming ship, and that it matched that of Grievous' ship. Master Fisto, Vebb, and Fil then debated what they should do. Vebb noted that killing Grievous could turn the tide of the war, but Fisto warned him that they should not underestimate the cyborg warrior."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Grievous entered his lair, the Jedi and the clones quickly sprung to surprise attack him. Fisto welcomed him back into his home, and requested he surrender so that the senate would be more merciful. The cyborg responded that Fisto would be the one begging for mercy, as he ignited his four lightsabers. They briefly dueled, while the clone troopers used the cables attached to their weapons to tug on his legs. Fisto was then able to slice off his legs, leaving him only able to crawl and climb using his upper limbs. The general still managed to kill several clone troopers, before escaping to his control room. Vebb angrily claimed that he would have been able to finish him off, had the clones not gotten away, before Fisto suggested they take care of the wounded. Upon examining the dead, Vebb expressed that he could take Grievous, but Kit Fisto once again reminded him that he was not ready to. The group then attempted to leave the castle, but before they could, they were locked in. Grievous then ordered his magna guards to destroy their shuttle outside. Before they were able to also destroy Fisto's starfighter, his astromech droid, R6-H5, piloted it away, narrowly escaping."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grievous then appeared on a hologram, and proceeded to taunt the remaining group. Fisto fired back asking Grievous to come out of hiding, to which he replied that while they wait they should experience all his home had to offer. As his hologram flickered off, the floor beneath them disappeared. Fisto and Vebb were able to easily jump back onto the floor still remaining, however one clone trooper fell to his death. Clone Commander Fil dispersed his cable, and was pulled back up by the Jedi. A short while after recovering from what had just happened, Grievous deployed his pet roggwart Gor, in an attempt to finally finish them off. After Fil began firing his blaster at the beast, Gor grabbed him, then repeatedly smacking him against the ground using its tail, ultimately leading to the clone commander's death. Master Fisto was then able to chop Gor's front limbs off, as Vebb stabbed it in the back. The beast then fell to the ground, as the Nautolan Jedi stabbed it in the neck, finishing it off. Fueled with anger and rage after the death of Fil, Vebb vowed that he would take revenge for what Grievous had done. Fisto then reminded him that it was not the Jedi way, and that he must always remember his teachings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The duo eventually witnessed Grievous leaving his control room and watched him as he entered a sequence to lock the security door. After Grievous had gone, Fisto went to re-enter the sequence, but as he did, they heard his medical droid alert him that they were trying to enter. The door then opened, and Fisto walked in, but Nahdar did not and protested that they should make an attempt to finish off the cyborg warrior instead. The medical droid then shut the door from his control panel, separating them. With no other options, Fisto made his way up to the control room, and killed the medical droid. Through the security cameras, he watched helplessly as Grievous mercilessly killed his old Padawan. With the chance of killing Grievous gone, Fisto instructed R6 to meet him at the castle's landing platform, so that he may finally leave. Just as he was about to board his starfighter, Grievous suddenly appeared, and the two engaged in a lightsaber duel. Clearly the better swordsman, Fisto was able to sever one of the cyborg's hands, and reclaimed Vebb's lightsaber. He then made use of the Force to push Grievous over, but was then met with several of his magna guards. Fisto briefly fought with them, but was outnumbered. Grievous, acknowledging Fisto as a truly worthy opponent, promised him a swift death if he surrendered to which the Nautolan apparently complied. In the nick of time, R6 flew the starfighter directly behind the Jedi Master, who merely delivered his signature little smile before leaping up and onto the ship, flying away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving back on Coruscant, Fisto reported to Jedi council members Yoda and Mace Windu on the events that had occurred.

Fisto sternly replied that she must bring the ship in, so that they may be able to contain and analyze them. Fisto reassured her that they would take precautions. The Togruta still expressed that she had a bad feeling about it, but agreed to follow his instructions. Briefly after speaking with Master Fisto, Barriss Offee was surprise attacked by the clones, and was subsequently infected with the parasites too. Upon learning of the situation, Anakin Skywalker interrogated their prisoner from Geonosis, Poggle the Lesser on how they could kill the worms, and was eventually told that the worms were heavily effected by the cold.

After the king of Mon Cala, Yos Kolina was mysteriously murdered, his young and inexperienced son, Lee-Char was left alone to reunite his people. In an attempt to avoid civil war, the Republic dispatched Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and a Jedi escort, Anakin Skywalker to resolve the matter. After a debate turned stale, the Quarren\u2014led by the Karkarodon Separatist Commander Riff Tamson\u2014refused to support the coronation of Lee-Char as the new Mon Cala king, leading Skywalker, Amidala and the Mon Calamari captain Gial Ackbar to come to the conclusion that a civil war was inevitable. The trio then contacted Windu and Yoda, who thought it best to deploy Master Fisto, as well as Padawan Tano with a battalion of Clone SCUBA troopers under Commander Monnk. Windu then informed Ackbar that he should assemble the Mon Cala troops and prepare for an attack from the Quarren."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As predicted, shortly later the Quarren plunged into an attack on the Mon Calamari, fully backed by the Separatist droid army.

Due to being Nautolan, a race from the aquatic planet of Glee Anselm, Fisto was able to swim through the deep sea with ease and shot down many battle droids and hostile Quarren alike. He then met up with Skywalker and Ackbar, and used electrobinoculars to watch the enemy return to their ships.

Fisto then commanded all troops to their battle stations, to which Ackbar added that they should not fire until Lee-Char gave the command. The group waited in silence until the prince finally gave the orders, to which the clones and the Mon Calamari began concentrating their fire on the robotic menace. As they fought off the jellyfish, Separatist droids came in from behind, and so their forces were left fighting on both sides. Thinking of the safety of the prince, Captain Ackbar decided it was best for them to retreat to the caves, and so the Mon Calamari forces with Skywalker and Tano retreated, while Fisto fought off the remaining cyborgs. Fisto then drove his mini sub into one of them, causing it to explode to which he grinned with a great sense of achievement.

Despite Fisto's best efforts to regain communication, it was no use, with the hologram crackling away. With no idea whether reinforcements were to be sent or not, the group decided they should travel to the surface, and attempt to escape the planet that way. Before they were able to get there however, they were faced with the problem of getting there undetected by the enemy. In order to get past them, Kit Fisto offered to create a diversion to which the rest of the group agreed. He swam upwards towards three Quarren who were taking two clone troopers as prisoners, and surprised them from behind. The Nautolan grabbed one from behind, and in the confusion was able to force push another away.

Fisto then remarked that he could quite obviously see that all around them, referring to the submerging debris of the ship. The survivors then split up, with Fisto, Tano, Lee-Char and the remaining clones going together in one group, while Skywalker, Ackbar, and Amidala went together in another. Fisto's group eventually reached a cave, in which they took refuge in. Fisto noted that he did not think they had been followed and so asked his clone commander, Monnk, to post a lookout. In total despair, Lee-Char pondered on what their options would be on what to do. Tano replied that they simply had to stay in the cave, as there was nothing else they could do.

Before Tano could finish her warning, a Separatist AQ-series battle droid began propelling blaster fire towards the prince. As Fisto fought it off, they looked upwards to see hundreds of Gungan warriors swimming towards them. Knowing that they had been sent by the Jedi Council, Kit Fisto rejoiced, and exclaimed that the tide of the battle had changed.

Brought before Tamson himself, the three prisoners were subjected to electric eel torture and shackle droids; Fisto was remarkably blas\u00e9 about it, merely stating that the eels were very dangerous. After Tamson savagely damaged Amidala's helmet with his jaws, Fisto and Skywalker saved her by creating a force bubble around her head, thus allowing her to breathe. Skywalker, to his chagrin, kept getting shocked even when he thought he had got the hang of the cages in contrast to Fisto, who advised him that \"Less talking helps.\" They were then brought to watch Lee-Char's execution, and Fisto witnessed the young prince being saved at the last moment by Nossor Ri.

The council instructed her to bring the clone back to the Jedi Temple. Some time later, Chancellor Palpatine contacted the Jedi Council to inform them that the Queen of Bardotta had requested for Senator Jar Jar Binks to come to her planet's aid after several of the ancient mystics had disappeared. Kit Fisto was present on the council at the time. Thinking it unwise to let Binks go alone, the Council decided that Mace Windu also be sent to accompany him. Later, Master Plo Koon was dispatched to investigate a distress call coming from the ship of the long dead Jedi Master, Sifo-Dyas. Upon finishing his investigation, he contacted the Jedi Council to which Kit Fisto was seated on at the time. Plo Koon showed the Jedi his discovery of Sifo-Dyas's lightsaber, which led the council to start a discussion on the Jedi Master who was so shrouded in mystery."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "A bleak vision of the future"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the Jedi Council's investigation on Sifo-Dyas, the revered Jedi Master Yoda began hearing the voice of the also long dead Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn during meditation. The severed voice explained to the elder Jedi that he was speaking to him through the living force before swiftly disappearing. At a Jedi Council meeting, subsequently after in which Master Fisto was present, the Jedi discussed about the revelation that Count Dooku was not actually the Sith Lord they had been looking for, and was in fact merely the apprentice. During the meeting, Yoda was unusually quiet, and when asked on his opinion, Yoda had been in deep thought, and had not been listening. Confused as to what could be troubling him, the Jedi looked around and glanced at each other, with Kit Fisto turning to look at fellow Jedi Shaak Ti."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, Yoda called a Jedi Council meeting again, to inform his fellow Jedi about what had been so troubling him. Standing in the center of the Jedi Council Chamber, he questioned them if he was alone in hearing the voice of Qui-Gon Jinn, or if any of them had began hearing it too. In order to see if they were able to hear it too, all the Jedi present in the meeting, including Kit Fisto, joined Yoda in the center of the room in meditation, which they carried on doing for an entire day.

Yoda then ventured into a cave where he began receiving a vision of a dark and twisted future for the Jedi. He watched in pure horror as he saw countless of his Jedi comrades being cut down by gunfire and slain by lightsabers.

The Nautolan Jedi managed to hold off the Sith for a few seconds before he was killed by a slice to the abdomen as Master Yoda had foreseen.

He was also studious, making use of the holocrons open to a Jedi of his rank, and insistent on docking with the brain worm-infested ship TB-73 in order to analyze the parasites, though he was also careful enough to order hazard teams and cautious approaches to doing so, in case the parasites were still dangerous after being deep-frozen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kit Fisto was regarded by fellow Jedi Master Mace Windu as one of the greatest lightsaber duelists in the Jedi Order.

Indeed, had the fight been a fair one without the intervention of Grievous' MagnaGuards, Fisto might well have prevailed and defeated the cyborg. Fisto's preferred Lightsaber style was Form I, though he was capable with Form IV as well. Fisto's mastery of Form I, Shii-Cho, permitted him to hold off numerous opponents with ease and was what enabled him to survive the First Battle of Geonosis that claimed so many of his colleagues as well as survive the Clone Wars.

This design was discarded after Christopher Lee was cast as Count Dooku, though it would later be re-used as the character design for Asajj Ventress.
