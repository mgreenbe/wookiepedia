Some time after the Battle of Yavin, Sidious sent the body double into the Arrth-Eno Prison Complex on Coruscant, where a group of Rebel spies intended to assassinate the Emperor. The body double was killed by Eneb Ray but Sidious himself survived, and his true plan was revealed: the elimination of the Rebel spies on Coruscant, the death of former senators, and a propaganda victory against the Rebellion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
