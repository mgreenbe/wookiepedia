It was mutated by dark side energy and was roughly ten meters long. The Corrupted Snake's main form of attack was its bite, which delivered a poison that drove the victim closer to the dark side. Milking the snake was also very dangerous, as it liked to grapple its opponents, and the creature had to be subdued and milking sacks placed on its fangs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
