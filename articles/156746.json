The Imperial Knights were a Force-using order that had pledged loyalty to Emperor Roan Fel of the Galactic Empire, and in that year, the brown-haired male was involved in a deception orchestrated by Fel against the Sith Lord Darth Krayt. Following the conclusion of the Sith\u2013Imperial War, Fel was informed by Nyna Calixte, the Director of Imperial Intelligence, that his Sith allies who had helped his Empire win the war against the Galactic Alliance were planning to betray him. Darth Krayt intended to kill Fel and seize the Imperial throne at an upcoming meeting of the Imperial Council of Moffs. Fel fled from the Imperial throneworld of Coruscant, but felt that it was necessary for his double to meet with Krayt in the New Imperial Palace in order to buy him time to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fel's cousin, the Imperial Knight Mohrgan Fel, volunteered to lead three other Knights against Krayt in order to further the deception.

When Krayt arrived with three of his fellow Sith Lords, he demanded Fel's life. Mohrgan called on his contingent to protect the Emperor, but Krayt drew two lightsabers and struck them all down, severing the brown-haired male's weapon arm before taking his life.
