Victor Flight acted as a last line of defense for Naboo against invaders or pirates. They most frequently ran across smugglers attempting to get off-planet with full cargo holds, Gungan activists and other planetside threats."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Victor Flight served the RSF as an orbital 'coast guard', patrolling the upper atmosphere and close orbit space lanes around Naboo, occasionally venturing further out on escort runs to the colony on Ohma'Dun. Unlike the Starfighter Corps more famous squadrons, like Bravo Flight and Echo Flight, Victor Flight's pilots had a reputation in the Naboo Security Forces as troublesome mavericks and problem cases."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This poor perception of the Victors reached back to a point before the Trade Federation embargo of Naboo, when the then-current flight leader of the squadron was arrested for collusion with pirates, after supplying the raiders with transit patterns for incoming freighters. Although it was never proven, the then-current head of Royal Security, Captain Magneta, made no secret that he suspected the involvement of other Victor Flight pilots in the crime."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Regarded as something of a backwater posting on Naboo, Victor had already been used as a placement for pilots with 'difficult' natures and the arrest of the commander tarnished their repute even further.
