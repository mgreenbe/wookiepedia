The battle occurred between the Wookiee colonists and the Trade Federation and was the deciding battle of the conflict between the two sides over the rights for the moon Alaris Prime. The Wookiee leader Chewbacca had been targeting Trade Federation settlements and targeted the Trade Federation's main base as a final push to remove the enemy presence. Chewbacca's Jedi advisor Qui-Gon Jinn told the Wookiees that they would need to destroy the Trade Federation's fortress to solidify their victory. At a base established near the Federation's, Chewbacca and the Wookiees, including his cousin Shoran and father Attichitcuk, worked on upgrading their defenses and technology while the Trade Federation commander SRAM-13 initiated the battle by sending attacks on Wookiee sentry posts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the Wookiees built their own fortress, Jinn arrived on Alaris Prime to participate in the battle. SRAM-13 sent light droid starfighters to scout the Wookiee base, prompting them to build up their air defenses. The Wookiees eventually built up their forces, including starfighters and energy pummels, breaking into the Trade Federation base and destroying their fortress. The company's Trandoshan ally Pekt escaped from the ruined fortress, and the Wookiees were finally able to continue their colonization of Alaris Prime, turning the moon into a successful hub for the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Between 39 BBY and 36 BBY, the moon Alaris Prime was engulfed in a war between the competing colonies of the Trade Federation and the Wookiee colonists. The Wookiee Chewbacca had taken leadership of the colonists following a near-fatal ambush by the Trade Federation against the previous leader, his father Attichitcuk. With the help of an advisor appointed by the Jedi Order, Master Qui-Gon Jinn, Chewbacca led attacks on Trade Federation settlements, including an outpost and a listening array. Noting the success of his strategies, Chewbacca decided to stage an assault on the Trade Federation's main base on Alaris Prime, which Wookiee scouts had uncovered."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wookiees established a base to the south of the Federation settlement, with Chewbacca's cousin Shoran building some of the defensive walls. Jinn stated that the Wookiees could win the upcoming battle by destroying the Trade Federation's fortress. The Jedi also requested permission from the Jedi High Council to personally participate in the battle, which was granted on the condition that the Wookiees build a fortress of their own. The base was initially defended by several Wookiees, including a recovered Attichitcuk, Chewbacca, Shoran, seven bowcaster troopers, two HummBike speeder scouts, and two dragon troopers. The Wookiee workers at the base began filling in gaps left in the walls and gathering the resources available to them, including muja fruit, carbon from the dense forests, nova crystals, and ore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Battle"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Trade Federation offensives"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Droid Army commander SRAM-13 commenced the first strike of the battle by sending a force of battle droids\u2014five beetle droids and a droideka\u2014to attack the Wookiee sentry posts, which had been built to warn them of the Trade Federation's movements. Jinn recommended that the Wookiees build turrets to fortify their defenses and a War Center to research upgrades to weapons and armor. After gaining the required resources, the Wookiees upgraded their level of technology to allow them to build their own fortress. SRAM-13 sent a trio of light droid starfighters to scout the Wookiee base. Although Jinn warned the Wookiees to brace themselves, the fighters only performed a reconnaissance mission and did not attack the base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To prepare for a potential air attack, Jinn recommended the Wookiees create their own aerial defenses before the fighters returned, including building an airbase in which to build their own aircraft, and anti-air turrets. Four droid starfighters then attacked another sentry post, and another fighter flew over the Wookiee base. After the fortress was completed, Jinn began heading for the Wookiee base aboard a Naboo Royal Lifter. Upon his entry, Jinn observed several Trade Federation ships, which he correctly suspected belonged to the Federation's Trandoshan allies, who were plotting to enslave the Wookiees."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The storming of the base"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Studies of a Jedi holocron previously found by Shoran on Alaris Prime revealed the location of an ancient grove, which the Wookiees uncovered after finding a hidden path through a treeline near their base. Jinn traveled to the grove and uncovered the ancient knowledge of Jedi concentration, which allowed him to convert enemy buildings to the Wookiee side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wookiees built additional military buildings in their base, including factories to build mechs and heavy weapons. Eventually, they prepared a force of ten Agr starfighters, three Heavy Blade bombers, three energy pummels, five sentinel strike mechs, and five heavy bowcaster troopers, before the Wookiee leaders and Jinn headed for the Trade Federation base. After destroying the turrets outside of the base, they used the bombers to destroy the base's outer walls and turrets while the fighters picked off the droids inside it. With a path clear, the Wookiee ground troops marched into the base and used the pummels, which had armor that could resist the fortress's turret-fire, to destroy the building and end the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinn celebrated the Wookiee victory, but noticed two Neimoidian transports flying from the ruins of the fortress; the same ships he had seen earlier. Inside one of them, the Trandoshan leader Pekt swore the Wookiees had not seen the last of him. The Battle for Alaris Prime ended the Trade Federation's colony on Alaris Prime for good. While still present on Alaris Prime, Jinn reflected that he had taught Chewbacca successfully and that the Wookiee was ready to explore the wider galaxy. Under Wookiee control, Alaris Prime became a thriving technological hub within the Galactic Republic and enjoyed economic success under Chewbacca's leadership."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, battle droids would return to the moon in multiple incursions during the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, in which the Trade Federation joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems, fighting against the Republic. Pekt's words came to pass with the rise of the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, which allowed him to participate in the mass enslavement of the Wookiees of Kashyyyk. However, he was ultimately stopped by Chewbacca in the Liberation of Kashyyyk in 4 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle for Alaris Prime was first mentioned in the Prima Games' strategy guide,\u2014released on November 7, 2001\u2014for the LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, released on November 11, 2001. The battle features as the seventh and final level, titled \"The Battle for Alaris Prime,\" of the Wookiee tutorial campaign. Steven L. Kent, author of the Prima guide, wrote that the Battle was a perfect conclusion to the tutorial campaign, giving the player a full range of technology and units while remaining in a relatively safe level.  In the level, the player controls the Wookiees and must destroy the Trade Federation fortress to achieve victory. The battle is lost immediately if the player loses any of the unique hero units: Chewbacca, Shoran, Attichitcuk, or Jinn. The Trade Federation may create additional forces if given enough time to gather the necessary resources, including a bio cannon and additional battle droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the player finds the ancient grove, they can use Jinn to gain the ability of Jedi concentration, which can be researched by some civilizations in the standard game mode but is otherwise inaccessible in the level, as the player cannot build a Jedi Temple to research it. Audio from Jinn in the game files suggests that the player would originally have access to Jedi in the battle, but the player would be unable to create any more unlike in a standard game format. Jinn states that Jedi law prevents too many Jedi from being assigned on a single mission to justify the restriction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
