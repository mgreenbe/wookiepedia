The droid was abandoned on planet Tatooine, but later recovered by Jawas in Chief Nebit's tribe, who stowed R1-G4 aboard their sandcrawler, after incapacitating it. There it was rebuilt, to be sold to Tatooine colonists. R1-G4 was part of the line-up assembled at the Lars homestead as a prospective purchase for Owen Lars. Lars eventually chose C-3PO and R2-D2, and the Desert Sands sandtrooper unit destroyed the sandcrawler while searching for those very droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R1's cold box contained stolen transponder data."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
