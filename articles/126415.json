Hence, Skakoan scientists created the pressure suit, enabling the natives to travel offworld. This was particularly useful for members of the Techno Union; Foreman Wat Tambor always wore his pressure suit (which he had designed himself) while visiting Union foundry worlds or on business for the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skakoan pressure suits were equipped with synthesized vocalizers that distorted the wearer's speech patterns, making them sound more like a battle droid than a sentient being. This, coupled with the fact that few non-Skakoans ever saw a member of the species without a pressure suit, gave the Skakoans an air of mystery. Many in the galaxy saw the Skakoans as heartless automatons, little different from the droids they constructed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although highly useful for the space-faring members of the species, Skakoan pressure suits had their downsides. For one, they were very expensive, so only a limited number of Skakoans ever left their homeworld. Most distressing, however, was the effect of a breach or failure in the pressure suit while on a low-atmosphere world. If the Skakoan was ever exposed to low-pressure environments, they would explosively decompress. This horrific trait was occasionally used as a weapon; the mercenary Durge caused a huge explosion in a factory on Queyta by firing upon pressure-suited Skakoan workers, and a pair of Skakoan mercenaries breached their own pressure suits to cause an explosion during the rescue of Wat Tambor from a Republic prison."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Also, toward the climax of the Clone Wars, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker used the Force to kill Skakoans during the Battle of Nelvaan, without making their bodies explode. He used a similar technique when he pierced the suit of Wat Tambor during Skywalker's execution of the Separatist Council on Mustafar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
