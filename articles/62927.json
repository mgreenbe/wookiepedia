Berethron e Solo ruled the Corellian Empire during the Golden Age of the Old Republic, and introduced democratic reforms that ended the era of monarchy in the Corellian system.

When the Clone Wars broke out, Dalla changed his family name to \"Suul.\" He became a notorious criminal kingpin and pirate, and had a son of his own, Jonash Suul."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Han Solo, an alleged member of the House who was born in poverty to Jonash Solo in 29 BBY, became a celebrated hero of the Rebel Alliance. According to his birth records, he could trace his paternal ancestry to King Berethron through Korol Solo. Further research, however, corroborated by the Coruscant city computer, revealed that Korol Solo was really a pretender to the Corellian throne who was hanged for his crimes. Despite C-3PO's last-minute failure to prove that Han Solo was not of noble lineage, and therefore unsuitable to marry Princess Leia, the head of House of Organa, the wedding went through. Apart from the noble Organas, Solo married into the Skywalker family. As a result of its members' already-legendary accomplishments, the Solo-Skywalker clan was considered one of the most influential famous groupings in history."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 138 ABY, Ania Solo, a descendant of the House of Solo, was working as a junkyard owner in the Carreras system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Other possible or putative members"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jarik Solo claimed to have been a long-lost cousin of Han Solo.
