Around 21 BBY, the Tarasin was targeted by the Wyrd, a coven of Tarasin Force witches, and placed within the Hand artifact, an ancient dark side artifact situated in a cavern on the dormant Cularin volcano Cloud Mountain. The Hand artifact allowed its users to enhance their own strength by drawing on the life force of a victim placed within; the Tarasin was subjected to this rite and killed, transforming her into a dark side spirit. The Tarasin Force Adept's ghost subsequently lingered at the Wyrd enclave on Cloud Mountain, serving the witches as a guard to the dark side relic that had taken her life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the establishment of the Wookiee colony Kiirloor close to Cloud Mountain, the Wyrd schemed to use the Hand artifact to trigger a volcanic eruption from Cloud Mountain and wipe the settlement away. A group of freelance agents arrived at the Wyrd enclave to challenge the witches and the Tarasin spirit determined to prevent the operatives from interfering with the Wyrd's plans to activate the volcano."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the agents conversed with Risstenni, a Wookiee turned into a Force ghost by the Hand artifact, the Tarasin spirit manifested nearby. In an attempt to lure the operatives to the dark side of the Force, the Tarasin proclaimed her lamentation of the fate that had befallen her and the other victims of the Hand artifact and dared the agents to attack the Wyrd witches. A fight soon broke out between the Tarasin spirit and the freelance operatives and the Tarasin attempted to possess one of the agents. After some time, Risstenni joined the fracas and pounced upon the spirit, allowing the agents to pass and confront the Wyrd witches.
