Gangs of pirates, scavengers, and outlaw techs created a droid series designed to take advantage of the debris and refuse left in the wake of battles during the Galactic Civil War. Using large arms and tractor beam projectors, the Scavenger Series drew debris and material into its internal break-down chute where it was compacted by beam cutters. If the droid encountered debris too big to handle, it would mark the location with marker transponders for future pickup by its operators. One such droid, Bruthus, worked for the Svivreni pirate Torsteen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
