Grabow trained as a healer among his clansmen on Kashyyyk, and after Kashyyyk was attacked by the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars, Grabow tended to Wookiees and Republic clone troopers who were injured during the fighting. Following the rise of the Galactic Empire, Grabow was enslaved, along with the majority of the populace of his homeworld. However, he later escaped and regained his freedom, and the Empire subsequently placed a bounty for his capture and return. Grabow was later among a group of agents who were hired by the Pyke Syndicate to track down the Nikto bounty hunter Kaa'to Leeachos in the depths of the planet Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
