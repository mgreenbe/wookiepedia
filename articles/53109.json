However, he was also very arrogant and disliked by many people because of his boastfulness, although due to his skill he was still frequently hired. At some point after the rise of the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, Emperor Palpatine contracted V'Droz to construct a massive labyrinth. V'Droz designed the plans for a maze inside of Mount Tantiss on Wayland, one of Palpatine's treasure vaults. As V'Droz was showing off the maze to the Emperor after its completion, Palpatine killed him to ensure that no one else would know of the labyrinth and how to navigate it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Garrbo V'Droz was a green-haired male with a reputation as the galaxy's best architect.

It was to be located at the bottom of Mount Tantiss on the planet Wayland, one of Palpatine's storehouses and treasure vaults. V'Droz created blueprints for an extremely complicated maze per his employer's orders, and also placed trac-reflective material on the walls, preventing a sensor map from showing a correct way out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Palpatine was extremely pleased with V'Droz's design, and after it was finished, he traveled to Wayland to view the labyrinth. V'Droz explained its features to him, after which Palpatine told the architect that he wanted to see the maze. Though apprehensive, V'Droz agreed, and the two took a concealed stairway down to the lowest level. There, V'Droz saw many of the Emperor's treasures, such as a collection of old lightsabers. He also saw, much to his shock, the body of his brother in a tomb. V'Droz furiously questioned his employer, who replied that with V'Droz's brother\u2014the construction foreman on the Mount Tantiss project\u2014dead, only the two of them knew a way through the maze, and soon, only Palpatine would know of the escape.
