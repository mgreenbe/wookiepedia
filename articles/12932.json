The race began within a city and headed out of the city, over a bridge, and into a set of ruins. From there the course would continue into Baroonda's jungles before entering another set of ruins that led back into another city, where the end of the course was located. The pilot \"Bullseye\" Navior was favored on this course, and other racers could compete against him in one-on-one races."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The course first appeared, unnamed, in the 1999 Gameboy Color video game Star Wars Episode I: Racer.
