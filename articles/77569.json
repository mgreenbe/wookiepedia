They possessed eight short and stubby but powerful legs, ending in clawed feet and allowing them to move incredibly quickly both and lands and when climbing trees. Covered in pebbly scales, a korrak's body was long and sinuous and allowed them to be relatively agile. To attack the creatures either attempted to wrap themselves around a target and crush it or used the deadly neurotoxin in their bite.
