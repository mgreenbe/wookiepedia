The arm primarily acted as a replacement for lost limbs, but also provided increased dexterity to the user. Amputees were the target audience for the product; which was compatible with hundreds of different species, but due to the dexterity boost it was not uncommon for others to replace their perfectly healthy limbs with Model VIs. The model was available in the period following the Battle of Yavin during the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Cyberarm Model VI was first mentioned in the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2013 and written by Sterling Hershey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
