While engaging several B1-Series battle droids, B2 super battle droids, and crab droids, the troopers managed to reconnect the electrical wiring of several consoles and restore the station's energy. Before they could repair the final consoles, however, Flak and the others were attacked by a Vulture droid and spider droids. After defeating the enemy droids with a rocket launcher, the Republic clones repaired the last two consoles and informed Windu of their success. Sometime later, the clones found two lightsabers drifting in space and reported this as well.
