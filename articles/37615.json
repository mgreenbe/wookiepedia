They had a thin ring shape, and were small enough to be hand-held. The rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Aphra painted several detonite rings in order to claim they were Lengilese life-fasting bracelets, offering one as tribute to the crime boss Lady Proxima in return for information on the Path engine that had passed through Corellia. Aphra used another detonite ring against General Vukorah of the Unbroken Clan to steal the datapad of the smuggler Remy, which contained information on the Path engine's origins. As Aphra escaped with the smuggler Sana Starros, she threw several more detonite rings behind them at the pursuing Unbroken Clan operatives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
