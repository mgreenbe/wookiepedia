After the assassination of the Separatist Council at the end of the war by Darth Vader, Dellso, in the possession of stolen Imperial starfighter plans, fled to Mustafar where he discovered the remains of his former master, Poggle the Lesser, and the other Separatist Leaders in the control room of the Klegger Corp Mining Facility . Dellso took refuge in a nearby secret bunker where he discovered an entire droid factory sitting dormant. He instantly fired up the factory, and in the short time it took the Empire to find him he had built his own droid army and fleet, which did not respond to Darth Vader's deactivation of the droids. Dellso also planned to use the hidden facility on the planet to create a new type of superior battle droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Space battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The members of the 501st Legion, were transported to Mustafar by an Imperial I-class Star Destroyer to destroy Gizor Dellso's uprising. However, the ship's hangar was immediately invaded by one of the HMPs from Gizor Dellso's navy, which dispatched OOM pilot battle droids and Droid marines onto the ship. Although one of the pilots panicked when the Empire failed to launch their starfighters, the Imperial Officer sent troops out, which held the droids back. To destroy the gunship, Imperial Marines used their rocket launchers and thermal detonators, while the TIE pilots deployed time bombs. After the gunship was destroyed, the marines and pilots then used their blasters to eliminate the remaining invaders and manned their starfighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After destroying a small number of Dellso's fighters, successfully knocking out the shields on the Providence-class destroyer.

Many had just stepped foot on the platform when droids shot them dead from the open windows of the entrance corridor. As B2 super battle droids scurried out onto the landing platform, the 501st was able to repel them. They managed to secure their landing zone, then taking losses flooded the corridors and stormed the lava observatory room, which gave them access to an outside walkway. Despite battle droid snipers firing at them, the stormtroopers were able to capture the walkway.\nEven with remnants of the feared IG-100 MagnaGuards striking at their ranks, the 501st Legion managed to take command over an overlook station from the droid forces. Then, the regrouped stormtroopers rushed into the factory control center, where they were able to destroy both of the droid prototype schematics of a new, unfinished battle droid prototype, ruining Dellso's plans of gaining the upper hand in possible future battles."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ending the battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A stormtrooper carrying an orbital strike beacon had been shot, and once retrieved, the beacon was set on the overlook to signal for the orbiting Star Destroyer to bombard the base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Gizor Dellso and his Geonosian bodyguards arrived to destroy the remaining stormtroopers, a wild firefight began.
