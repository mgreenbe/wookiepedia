During the Galactic Empire's Iron Blockade, the criminal Trade Spine League wanted to quietly move a shipment of crystals from the planet Burnin Konn to Delphon, but had to first deal with the Black Hole Gang. At another point during the blockade, an anonymous party hired a young smuggler to break into Delphon's senatorial compound and convince one of the aides to secretly work against the Empire. One notable settlement on Delphon was Delphon City, which housed at least one cantina, at least one docking bay, and Cage's Tech Emporium."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Had Delphon actually appeared in Star Wars: Uprising, it would have been depicted as a planet covered in windswept grasslands and picturesque plateaus, with a large human-centric main city and many outlying settlements of various sizes. Because of its location away of the sector's main trade routes, it would have been depicted as a mostly self-sufficient world frequently used as a base of operations for pirates. Conceptual drawings of Delphon were made by Cullen Brown. The Delphon in-game map would have featured buildings inspired by the Niima Bazaar from Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
