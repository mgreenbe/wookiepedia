The blast impacted the atmosphere of a nearby planet during the month of Stolivea in that world's calendar. Its effects on the planet were expected to be the spreading of a phenomenon known as talking fogs into hollows and low valleys, as well as generating irrational echoes, heavy rain and eruption of snow in lower elevations.
