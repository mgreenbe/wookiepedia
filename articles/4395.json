In the CoCo Town district of the planet Coruscant, the eatery known as Dex's Diner, which was run by the Besalisk chef Dexter Jettster, served Ahto City cheese as a topping on the Manaan slider, which Jettster enjoyed the taste of. The slider cost 6.7 credits and was inspired by the ocean planet Manaan, the capital of which was named Ahto City. The cheese was served on a grilled firaxan shark fillet along with Selkathian seaweed and relish between two trans-shipped, medium-density foodboards. The slider was served at Dex's at some point prior to the eatery's destruction during the first two years of the Galactic Empire's rule."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ahto City cheese was featured in the 2009 StarWars.com Hyperspace exclusive article, \"Dining at Dex's,\" which was written by Gregory Walker in the form of an in-universe menu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
