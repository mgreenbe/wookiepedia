It was an outmoded rim-shaped design with numerous perimetral space docks jutting out from its central hull. About five years after the end of the Clone Wars, whilst commanded by a colonel, the station came under attack from Berch Teller's insurgent cell, which had hijacked the Carrion Spike, the personal vessel of Wilhuff Tarkin. After being relieved by Tarkin and Darth Vader, the colonel assisted the two in calculating possible hyperspace egress points for the stolen vessel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
