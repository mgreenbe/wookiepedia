The resource pad mined and processed raw materials with a high rate of loss and was usually used at resource-rich locations that could be strip-mined. Both the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire used resource pads to quickly mine raw materials to sell off for credits, giving a share of the profits to the Corellia Mining Corporation in return for its use."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
