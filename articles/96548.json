Such product lines, however, were not as prominent as the company's more mainstream electronics and communications devices, imaging systems, medical bio-technology, and military encryption systems. Some of the company's designs were so cutting-edge that they were actually illegal in many star systems, increasing their value on the black market. The company also produced a number of components used across the galaxy in anything from ground vehicles to capital ships and space stations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the final years of the Galactic Republic, Neuro-Saav entered into partnership with the Tagge Company, resulting in the formation of an experimental cybernetics company called BioTech Industries, which produced such devices as the Borg Construct Aj^6. Its links with TaggeCo also ensured Neuro-Saav remained in good graces with the Galactic Empire throughout the Galactic Civil War. This gave the company a degree of freedom it had not enjoyed under the Republic, since Neuro-Saav was relatively free of Imperial policies and regulations. With the fall of the Empire, the New Republic began monitoring cybernetic experimentation, though Neuro-Saav managed to avoid official investigations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Neuro-Saav also created a subsidiary company, Neuro-Saav Technologies, concerned with the manufacture of weapons sighting accessories."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
