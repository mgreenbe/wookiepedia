However, seven members of the organization were planning an attack, and ambushed the diplomats while they were on their way to meet the Lannik High Court. Luckily, Jedi Master Even Piell was with them and managed to defeat them all, at the cost of his left eye. However, he chose not to undergo bacta treatment, and let the wound heal on its own. To him, the scar was a mark of honor and bravery. Because of this, the diplomat's daughter, Adi Gallia, was inspired to become a Jedi.
