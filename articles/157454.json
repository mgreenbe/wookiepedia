The sparring droid was activated by Jedi Padawan Reath Silas, who wished to train against it to take his mind off of the recent death of his Jedi Master, Jora Malli, and the apparent death of Jedi Knight Dez Rydan. After parrying and deflecting several blasts from the droid, Silas slashed at it with his lightsaber; however, the intensity of his strike nearly sliced its head off.
