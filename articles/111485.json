It was named after Queen Rana Mas Trehalt but came to be known as the City of Ashes or Royal City by offworld Duros. Once a beautiful city, it grew filthy with the industrialization on Duro. Underneath the city were the tombs of many past monarchs. The Duros Dustini Spa Ronii hired some adventures to go down to the city to spy on individuals he believed were smuggling artifacts offworld. It also came to be inhabited by giant fefze beetles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
