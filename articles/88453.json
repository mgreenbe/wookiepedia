A Bothan called Betrek Moy'nast worked in the cantina as a bartender and he would listen in on the Thaereians' conversations and send any information that he learned to the Cularin Militia. However, he was eventually arrested by the Thaereians and they had another Bothan work in the bar and pose as Moy'nast, in the hope that they might be able to identify more Militia agents. The Heroes of Cularin traveled to the bar to meet with Moy'nast, but soon realized that the bartender was not him and left."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
