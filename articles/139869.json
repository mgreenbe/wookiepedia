It was situated between the city of Uhrar in the north and Point Defiance in Garrow's Neck on the far south-west of Alanciar. As of 2975 BBY, Tandry was known to have a corral which was home to muntoks, a mounted reptilian beast of burden, which could be rented to travelers. Prior to the Lost Tribe of Sith's invasion of Alanciar, the wardmaster Quarra Thayn rented a muntok from Tandry before continuing her journey to Point Defiance, which was where her secret lover Jogan Halder was stationed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
