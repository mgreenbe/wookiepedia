Bondara trained many students in lightsaber combat when he became a Jedi instructor. He was also the Jedi Watchman for the Ryloth system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Force-sensitive, Anoon Bondara was instructed in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, eventually ascending to the rank of Jedi Knight. A contemporary of Qui-Gon Jinn, Jedi Bondara was well respected by his peers and a noted warrior. Over the years of studying the ways of the Jedi Guardian, Bondara developed such skill with a lightsaber that he was regarded by many as the premiere practitioner of the weapon in the Order. Achieving the rank of Jedi Master, Bondara accepted the position of Watchman of the Ryloth system, living amongst the Twi'leks of Ryloth and keeping order within the system. Eventually stepping down from this position, Bondara was nominated by the acting Temple Battlemaster to become an instructor at the Coruscant Jedi Temple. Along with his duties at the academy, Bondara managed to train three Padawans of his own, each one ascending to the rank of Knight to a success. Educating the likes of Obi-Wan Kenobi as an initiate, Bondara not only studied the lightsaber, but became a Weapon Master upon his mastery of the Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si martial arts form."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Master Bondara's fourth and final Padawan was Darsha Assant, who was trained at the Temple on Coruscant as the old Twi'lek continued to teach classes there. By 32 BBY, Padawan Assant had reached a point where the Jedi High Council believed she could learn no more from Bondara and was ready to face the Trials of Knighthood. Instead of facing the traditional Trials at the Temple, the High Council assigned Assant to descend into Coruscant's Crimson Corridor and escort the Fondorian informant Oolth back to the Temple for questioning. While Bondara did not agree with the Council's decision he was compelled to allow her to go; and was on call in his quarters when a distressed Assant returned without the informant. When she detailed the Fondorian's fall into the Coruscant underworld, Master Bondora agreed to accompany his student in search of the body. As the pair recovered the man's body they were witness to a tattooed Zabrak pursuing one Lorn Pavan and I-5YQ. Rescuing the fleeing Human and droid in the Jedi's airspeeder, the Jedi quickly questioned the pair as to why they were hunted. Realizing that the Zabrak was giving chase, Master Bondara left Assant at the speeder controls and leaped out the window and onto the front of the Zabrak's speeder bike."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Activating his lightsaber, Bondara forced the assassin to crash onto a pedwalk and engaged the tattooed Zabrak in a lightsaber duel. Despite Bondara's mastery of lightsaber combat, it became clear that this was a fight he was not going to win. Seeing no other option, Bondara sacrificed his own life by blowing up a speeder bike in an attempt to destroy his opponent in the blast. Though Bondara was killed in the explosion, the assassin, in reality the secret Sith apprentice Darth Maul, managed to escape the blast, suffering only minor damage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Jedi Guardian, Anoon Bondara's skill with a lightsaber was so advanced, he had obtained the rank of Weapons Master. Along with his mastery of Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si, the Twi'lek's preferred form was Juyo. As he was ambidextrous, he had some aptitude with Jar'Kai. In spite of all his martial prowess, he found himself to be no match for Darth Maul, who was himself a Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si practitioner."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Apart from his swordsmanship, Bondara had some proficiency in the Force. He could apply the mind trick, telekinesis, battlemind, Force empathy, Force sight, and serenity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bondara was also skilled in the use of languages: his native Twi'leki and Lekku, Basic, and Huttese."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In both of Bondara's appearances he is described as having lightsaber skills second to none. This has led some to hypothesize that Anoon Bondara was the Jedi Battlemaster prior to Cin Drallig. The information mentioned above, the fact that he was the lightsaber instructor to Jedi Initiates and Padawans such as Obi-Wan Kenobi, and that he died in 32 BBY, the same year Cin Drallig became Battlemaster, are cited by some to support this theory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A lightsaber crystal bearing his name, Bondara's Folly, is available to players in Star Wars Galaxies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
