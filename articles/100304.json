In response, the Onderonion rebellion was formed from a loose group of insurgents hoping to reclaim control of their world. They received training as soldiers from Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, and Clone Captain CT-7567. They attacked small groups of droids in the city of Iziz, and destroyed the city's power station in an attempt to put all of the droids off-line. The rebels saved their true king, Ramsis Dendup from execution, after which he joined their cause. In their last battle with the separatists, many rebel lives were lost due to the droid gunships. Steela Gerrera also lost her life after she fell off of a cliff to save Dendup from the same fate. Shortly after, Onderon was free again and under Dendup's rule once more."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
