One of the first actions in this campaign resulted in a short but brutal skirmish in the Koornacht Cluster of the Core Worlds. After Carrick and his companion Jarael attempted to rescue eighty slaves from the Sungrazer cooperative, Crucible captain Dace Golliard intercepted and engaged them. After a pitched battle between Golliard's flagship, the Gladiator, and Carrick's motley Hot Prospect, the Jedi was able to escape with a number of the now-freed slaves in tow."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
