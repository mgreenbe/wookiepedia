A Rebel officer attempted to delay Strike force Alpha, but the unit took control of the base and constructed its own military camp within the remains of Ghost Base using ASP-7 labor droids. However, Utric Sandov had evacuated himself and the base staff to a nearby island called Le'Roche. Strike force Alpha's base was subsequently destroyed by a Rebel army led by the exiled Jedi Echuu Shen-Jon and Princess Leia Organa, rendering the Imperial strike force extant. They had their wills twisted by Palpatine's dark powers, driving them to suicide if a Jedi tried to convert them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Strike force Alpha was first mentioned in the strategy guide for the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds.
