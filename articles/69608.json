After Jula and Silya Darklighter's skiff was boarded by stormtroopers as it carried Leia Organa Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and the Squibs Sligh, Grees, and Emala across Tatooine from the Lars homestead in search of the missing Han Solo, the group of travelers found that the vidmap previously placed on Solo's swoop was removed, leading to Sligh to speculate that their missing friend had gone to the Jawa Raceway. Silya Darklighter then said that they were situated north of the Raceway, and the group decided to search for Han Solo at the Bantha Burrows after the locations Sarlacc Gardens and Monk's Well were proposed as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
