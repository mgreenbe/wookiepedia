The report discussed the rumored Mass Shadow Generator, and although the prospect of the generator worried Delto, it seemed to him that the Empire had not made any breakthroughs in development.

While reviewing The Rebel Files, Resistance Major Caluan Ematt left a handwritten note stating that the superweapon information should be passed on to Resistance Intelligence, as some of those listed had since entered the history logs while others could have been restarted by the First Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mass Shadow Generator first appeared in the new Star Wars canon in the boxed set and reference book Star Wars: The Rebel Files, which was authored by Daniel Wallace and released on November 21, 2017.
