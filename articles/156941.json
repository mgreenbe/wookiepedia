During the Imperial Era, the overlord was angered by the villagers' inability to feed him due to the fact that he had eaten all the village's food and left them to starve. The overlord threatened the villagers, but was interrupted by Sergeant Kreel of the Galactic Empire's Task Force 99, who was searching for a outpost of the Rebel Alliance elsewhere in the system. The overlord demanded that the Imperials leave, but the stormtroopers beat and killed the overlord to protect the villagers, in return asking for the location of the rebel outpost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
