The business was the sister company of Shankti Drive Works and as such was based in the same city of D'larah on the planet Demophon. During the height of the Galactic Empire, Tumleh Navigation was involved in the NGW Hyperdrive Jump Program, a program to discover a method to allow starships to navigate through hyperspace around gravity wells. Unfortunately for the company, the star Demophon went supernova during this period, causing widespread devastation to the Demophon system. The destruction wiped out most, if not all of Tumleh Navigations research, although Tumleh maintained records of the data already gathered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
