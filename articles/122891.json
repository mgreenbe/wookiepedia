The Nightmare had its name painted in aurebesh on the both sides of its nose, along with a clone trooper's helmet painted to look like a Human skull. In 22 BBY, when the Republic launched a full-scale attack on the Separatist stronghold world of Geonosis, the Nightmare served as a troop transport during the battle. The Nightmare carried Jedi General Ki-Adi-Mundi, as well as several clone troopers, during a large aerial assault on the Separatists' main droid factory. However, the Nightmare and several other gunships were shot down by Separatist flak guns before it could reach the Republic's planned landing point, forcing it to crash-land. The gunship was utterly ruined by the landing, but Mundi and a few of his troopers were able to survive and pull themselves out of the Nightmare's wreckage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Separatist Nightmare was a Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunship, manufactured by Rothana Heavy Engineering, that was used by the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars between the Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Nightmare had customized nose art on either of its sides, with a clone trooper's helmet painted to look like a skull, as well as its name written in aurebesh next to the helmet. The gunship had a cockpit large enough to hold a clone pilot, two anti-personnel laser turrets at the front of the vessel, two rear engines, and four composite-beam laser turrets, two of which were at either side of the Nightmare and the other two built-into both of the gunship's wings. The Nightmare had a passenger compartment in the center of the ship that was large enough to hold several grown clone troopers and a Cerean.
