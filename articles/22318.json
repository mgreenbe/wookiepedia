He then boarded the Pelta-class frigate, TB-73, and went into the barracks, releasing more Geonosian Brain worms infecting the remaining clones. Scythe then took Ox and CT-9538 to the bridge to kill the clone pilots. Then under the orders of Scythe, Ox and Edge went to the mess hall to get rid of their Jedi Commanders, Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee. Later he, along with Edge, pinned down an uninfected clone trooper while the infected Havoc used one of the Brain worms to infect the final clone on the ship. After Offee tried to reach the bridge but was stopped, Scythe took another Brain worm and infected her. Eventually, Scythe and the rest of the crew were freed from the infection when Ahsoka ruptured the cooling tanks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Scythe carried a DC-15S carbine, and was featured wearing a back pack.
