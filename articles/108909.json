The towers possessed considerable strength, range, and precision, and were capable of capturing most ships, including CR90 corvettes, with an effective range of up to 120 kilometers. This projector, like most other tractor beams, required considerable amounts of space, power, and crewmembers to operate effectively. The Empire also installed them on their Executor-class Star Dreadnoughts, with the Executor having 40 of them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
