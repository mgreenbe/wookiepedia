In X-Wing the K-wing's surprising acceleration, heavy armor plating, and devastating ordnance make it an outstanding ship for hit-and-run operations. Its four shields and five hull make it one of the game's most durable small-base fighters, and it pairs this durability with a primary turret weapon that boasts an attack value of \u201c2.\u201d On top of this, the ship comes with the new SLAM action, which allows it to race across the battlefield and deploy its bombs at an unprecedented speed. In addition to its pre-painted K-wing miniature, sculpted at 1/270 scale, the K-wing Expansion Pack comes with four ship cards and nine upgrades that dramatically improve the efficiency of your ordnance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Contents"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The K-wing Expansion Pack contains one miniature, plus a maneuver dial and action tokens, as well as pilot and upgrade cards."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ship components"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cards"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Pilot cards"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Upgrade cards"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Twin Laser Turret (2)"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Extra Munitions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plasma Torpedos"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Adv.
