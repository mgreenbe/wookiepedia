Located on a massive cliff, the monastery was protected by a variety of Confederacy forces. Determined to complete their mission, Torrent Company\u2014including Zeer\u2014began the ascent up the cliff face, led by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker. They took heavy casualties in the process, including one of their AT-TEs, but they were able to take control of the monastery.

When Rex received a transmission from Skywalker, the clones used the distraction to turn on their captors, destroying a number of the droids and taking their weapons. The survivors took cover upon the destroyed AT-TE as more battle droids responded to their escape and moved to intercept the last members of Torrent Company. Zeer put his skills as a combat engineer to use, rigging a super battle droid with explosives, and programming it to return to its fellow droids, allowing Zeer to detonate it. The detonation inflicted heavy casualties, but the Separatist forces relentlessly assaulted the clone's position. As the droids continued to encroach upon the clones' position, a squadron of V-19 Torrent starfighters, led by Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi, opened fire on the attacking battle droids, destroying the ones nearest to Torrent Company's position.
