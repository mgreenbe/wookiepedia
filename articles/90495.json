It was used during the Clone Wars on clone troopers and during the Galactic Civil War on stormtroopers who were injured in battle and were not near a medical station. Miniature bacta tanks could have been installed on walls so that a clone trooper or a stormtrooper could use it quickly and move on. That way it was quick and the next trooper could use it. Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles found and used miniature bacta tanks during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Miniature bacta tanks serve as health packs in various LucasArts video games.
