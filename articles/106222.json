His tendency to see things in the stark terms of simple right and wrong served him well over the years. Joined with his heightened extrasensory abilities, it lent him a clarity of vision superior to some of the other Jedi. This clarity extended to his piloting; he was a straightforward warrior who was often seen at the head of a bombing run or diving charge. He was, however, unprepared for the subtlety of the Sith, and was blown out of the sky of Cato Neimoidia by his clone wingman, Captain Jag, after the issuance of Order 66."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Earlier during the Clone Wars, Plo Koon was gifted a Delta-7B that was named the Blade of Dorin.
