Dating back to the Blood Moon Uprising, by the High Republic Era the staff was in the possession of the Jedi Order. It was sent to Valo to be displayed in the Starlight Pavilion as part of the Secrets of the Jedi exhibit for the Valo Republic Fair. When the Nihil pirates attacked the Fair, Tempest Runner Lourna Dee briefly seized and used the staff while fighting Jedi archivist OrbaLin. However, OrbaLin was able to take the staff back and telekinetically hurl Dee through the roof of the building."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
