Taken as the Padawan of Jedi Master Jook-jook H'broozin, Potts was close friends with fellow apprentice Blendri, who described him as simple while she was bored with meditation and the strictures of the Order. When Blendri ascended to the rank of Jedi Knight, Potts remained a Padawan and struggled to keep up with the training, despite his dedication to the Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Jedi named Xendor rebelled against the Order and formed the Legions of Lettow, Blendri deserted, leaving Ossus with Master H'broozin and a new apprentice to join Xendor's forces. Not tempted by the dark side of the Force and comfortable in the Order's structure, Potts joined the fight to destroy the rebels and end the Great Schism before it destroyed the Order. Having slain his former master on Corulag, Potts was later stationed on the planet Columus where he and a group of Jedi were pitted against a group of thirty members of the Legion. Almost evenly matched, Potts fought long and hard, coming up against Blendri and her apprentice before killing them both. The lone survivor and gravely wounded, Potts received word that Xendor had been slain and the war was over. Pleased with Xendor's death, Potts recorded his final thoughts on a data card, recording what had happened and his thoughts on the Force and the Jedi Order, leaving it to whatever Jedi would find it. Among his thoughts was the need for the Jedi Order to have a common enemy, to keep themselves from turning against each other. The data card was found incomplete and was later the basis for three separate operas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
