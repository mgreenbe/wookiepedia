These coordinates also inspired the planet's military designation, \"triple zero\" or \"Zero Zero Zero,\" though the actual galactic center was located in the Deep Core.

As the Human population soared, they were forced to develop the first atmospheric scrubbers, delivery pipelines, recycling plants, and hydroponic farms, and instead of burying unrecyclable garbage, Coruscant's inhabitants built cannons that launched canisters of waste into orbit where garbage scows could tow them out of the star system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 30,000 BBY, the Rakata species discovered Coruscant and incorporated it into their Infinite Empire.

The development of hyperspace cannons linked Coruscant to Alderaan, Duro, Corellia, and other worlds, but it was not until Corellian scientists succeeded in reverse-engineering the Rakatan hyperdrive around 25,000 BBY that starships could travel between the worlds of the Republic in a matter of days.

Around 24,000 BBY, the Tionese War broke out with the Honorable Union of Desevro & Tion as the Tionese began a march of conquest along the Perlemian Trade Route.

The Spin was the original lifeline of the Republic, and because the Perlemian only intersected with the Spin at Coruscant, Alsakan and its dependents were largely independent from the rest of the Republic. The aristocratic Alsakani, who called the Perlemian the Axis, sought to supplant Coruscant as the seat of Republic power, and in 17,018 BBY, Alsakan led the Axis worlds in claiming a number of resource-rich systems to block the Grand Companies, the major trading conglomerates of the Spin. Coruscant and the Republic backed the Spin merchants, sending a fleet to the planet Virujansi and capturing it. Thus began the First Alsakan Conflict, a series of seventeen wars between the Coruscant-dominated Republic and Alsakan that spanned fourteen thousand years. The First Conflict was ended by the Bureau of Ships and Services in 16,700 BBY, though both Coruscant and Alsakan would be raided during the early conflicts, neither side ever achieved true victory over the other, and Corellia developed into a third galactic player as it excused itself from the conflicts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 15,500 BBY, Republic scouts encountered the enormous, fire-breathing reptilian species known as the Duinuogwuin on a planet in the Outer Rim Territories.

Many senators expected the Jedi to construct a fortress to defend the planet in the event of a future invasion, but while the Jedi Council eagerly accepted the land, it held to the belief that the Jedi were not by nature a military force. Instead, the Council authorized the construction of meditative centers and training centers, some of which helped preserve Coruscant's disappearing natural environment.

Millions of citizens were displaced by the urban renewal, most of them impoverished, members of alien species loyal to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, or both.

Notable incidents included the raid of Ziro's palace after the Republic discovered the Hutt's affiliation with Count Dooku; the holding of Senator Meena Tills hostage by Korunnai terrorists which was actually cover for an attempt to turn the Corporate Sector against the Republic; and the Senate hostage crisis at the Republic Executive Building that was carried out by bounty hunter Cad Bane to free Ziro the Hutt.

COMPOR pressured Tannon Praji into deporting from the capital all members of species whose homeworld had joined the Confederacy.\nFollowing the Star of Iskin incident, the Senate approved the Enhanced Security and Enforcement Act, which allowed Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to strip civil liberties in the name of civil security. Coruscant fell under particularly heavy government supervision, with security becoming gradually tighter as one traveled deeper into the levels of the Galactic City. The planet's lower levels, which had once been a haven for crime and an unregulated market, became heavily subdued, such that illicit goods and services became difficult to find. While most Coruscanti were content with surrendering these and other liberties for security, the changes did not sit well with the galactic capital's alien population, particularly those that were associated with the leadership of the Confederacy. Many Geonosians, Muuns, Neimoidians, and Gossams suffered ostracization on Coruscant, while many others were forced to flee the world altogether.
