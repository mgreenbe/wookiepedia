Accessible by a tunnel in the cliffs near Kaleth's entrance, the meditation shrine was built in a small wooded valley. The valley was largely open grass and trees except for the shrine itself, which was small and was largely in ruins by the time of the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the uprising by the native Flesh Raiders of Tython, a group of Force-sensitive Flesh Raiders began camping in the shrine. The apprentice of Jedi Master Orgus Din was sent to investigate the Flesh Raider activity in the area, and was surprised to learn that the natives could in fact speak and use the Force. The Padawan fought and defeated the Flesh Raiders, however, and at the behest of Master Bela Kiwiiks installed security cameras in the area to make sure that the natives did not return."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ancient shrine appears in the 2011 BioWare massively-multiplayer online role-playing video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, as a class-restricted map for the Jedi Knight quest \"Enemy Force.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
