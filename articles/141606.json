When the loop reset, most of the victim's memories were reset, yet sometimes the victim would become aware of the loop through deja vu. Dash Rendar thought he was trapped in a temporal loop in 2 BBY, when he looked over his shoulder in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina to spy Han Solo in the same booth he'd found him days before. He closed his eyes, feeling a sense of deja vu or ceno-ka as the Equani referred to it. He thought this might be happening, or that he could no longer hold his liquor, or that he had slipped into a temporal loop, destined to live the rest of his life in Chalmun's."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Also years earlier, when Darth Tenebrous met his end at the hands of his apprentice, he planned to latch his consciousness insidiously onto Plagueis through the use of his Maxi-chlorians. However, the plan backfired and Tenebrous was forced to abort. Aborting, however, trapped him in a loop, in which he was forced to live out his final moments over and over again for all eternity. He only became aware of the loop at the very end when witnessing the sight of his decomposing corpse, showing him that time must have passed since the first time he actually \"died.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
