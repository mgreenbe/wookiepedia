Grott often kidnapped children from Batuu in order to enslave them. After Grott kidnapped the siblings of a girl named Anya, she sneaked into Grott's home and confronted him at night. Grott was unable to see Anya clearly in the darkness, and believed that the wooden dagger she held to his neck was real. Anya claimed to be an assassin sent to kill him, but would let him live if he freed her siblings and left Batuu. Grott, terrified for his life, followed Anya's orders, releasing her siblings from slavery. The slaver disappeared from Batuu, and rumors in Black Spire Outpost claimed that he had escaped into the depths of Wild Space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
