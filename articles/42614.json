The master and apprentice team joined Master Windu's task force formed to rescue Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala from Geonosis. Landing on the planet with over two hundred Jedi, Master Shen-Jon and Padawan Reath did not enter the Petranaki arena with the others; instead they were were assigned the task of destroying several Trade Federation core ships. They succeeded, and were then ordered to pursue Separatist leader Count Dooku as he attempted to reach his escape craft. Along the way they were intercepted by the Confederacy of Independent Systems General Sev'rance Tann, who quickly slew Padawan Reath before Master Shen-Jon's eyes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Escaping the battle, Master Shen-Jon slipped into depression.

As the weight of war grew heavier, Master Shen-Jon and his new apprentice sank deeper into the lull of the dark side of the Force, each wanting revenge for the death of Stam Reath.

Contacting his current Padawan, Shen-Jon admitted he could not return to the Order until he had meditated on his crimes against the Jedi Code. He told Reath that she would make a fine Jedi Knight one day, and bade her return to the Temple for reassignment.

His exile would be the very thing which spared his life from the likes of the Empire's forces. During this time period, he had lost his old green lightsaber, but acquired a new blue one, which he from then on used as his weapon of choice. In 0.5 ABY, some time after the destruction of the first Death Star, Shen-Jon finally reemerged for his exile when Princess Leia Organa had crash-landed on the world of Krant. There he aided her in her struggle against the Empire, defending the cities of Krant with his lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, when Organa met with Utric Sandov, Shen-Jon was surprised to hear that the Imperials had found the ancient Jedi artifact Vor'Na'Tu. He accompanied her to Geddes and together they obtained the artifact, but upon returning to their shuttle they found Darth Vader awaiting their arrival. Vader demanded that they hand over the relic to him, but Shen-Jon refused to surrender and destroyed it instead. Engaging the Dark Lord in a duel, Shen-Jon's skills were no match for the Sith Lord's and eventually Echuu Shen-Jon was killed.
