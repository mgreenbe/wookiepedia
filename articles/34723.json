Jedi Master Mace Windu contacts Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, to inform him that Darth Maul was behind the battle. Windu suspects that the Galactic Republic can use this information to capture Maul and Dooku, and use their capture to end the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi continue their investigation in Ord Mantell City. Along with Windu are Obi-Wan Kenobi, Tiplee, and Aayla Secura. They discover a Death Watch helmet, confirming their intelligence that Mandalore had allied with Darth Maul. Fearing that Mandalore could fall to the Separatists, Kenobi and Tiplee launched an investigation of Vizsla Keep 09 where the Jedi suspected Maul was hiding."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the outpost, Maul contacts Darth Sidious via hologram and informs him that Dooku and Grievous have been captured. Sidious tells Maul to kill them, for the Dark Lord of the Sith has no use for what he sees as failures. Rather than kill them outright, Maul orders Grievous to be taken to the brig. Meanwhile, the Jedi begin their approach towards the outpost, and Tiplee fears that Kenobi will be unable to keep his emotions under control; Maul killed Satine Kryze, the Duchess of Mandalore and a close personal friend of Kenobi's. Kenobi assures his fellow Jedi that he will not fail."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Republic approaches, Maul offers Dooku a choice: join Maul or die. They were both betrayed by Sidious, so Maul believes they can be allies. Mother Talzin appears in a cloud of magick smoke, and reveals that she too was once betrayed by Darth Sidious\u2014and that Darth Maul is her son. As Talzin explains, Sidious always betrays his allies, and even now is working to find a new apprentice. As they speak, the Republic assault on the outpost begins, and the Republic ships make their way through Gauntlet fighter fire towards the base. Grievous uses the chaos to make it to an escape pod, while Dooku agrees to join Maul and fight against Kenobi's boarding party."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Kenobi and his team make it on board, he and Tiplee are quickly confronted by Maul and Dooku. They engage in a lightsaber duel, which is soon joined by Windu and Secura. The duel was fairly long, but it soon ends when Dooku kills Tiplee, and when Gar Saxon shoots a small missile into the lightsaber duel to incapacitate the Jedi. With the Jedi knocked out, Maul and Dooku escape aboard a Gauntlet fighter. In the aftermath of the battle, Windu contacts Palpatine and informs him of the battle's outcome. The Jedi Master also surmises that the battle proves Dooku is the Sith Master, an incorrect assessment that Palpatine, the true Dark Lord, allows the Jedi to believe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Son of Dathomir, Part Three was adapted from \"Proxy War,\" an episode that A\u00efda Mashaka Croal and Matt Michnovetz scripted for what would have been the sixth season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
