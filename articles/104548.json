In around 9 ABY, Pershing worked with an individual known as \"the Client\" to attempt to acquire a Force-sensitive Child. The Client placed a bounty on the infant with the Bounty Hunters' Guild, who sent many hunters to accept the contract. One of these hunters was Din Djarin who met with the Client and four stormtrooper guards face to face."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Client greeted Djarin, Pershing joined the meeting unannounced, causing Djarin to quickly draw his weapons. The doctor cowered and apologized for surprising the bounty hunter while the four stormtroopers kept their weapons aimed at Djarin. The Client then defused the situation and had the stormtroopers lower their weapons, after which Djarin took a seat and listened to the Client's description of the job. When the Client stated that the hunter could provide proof of termination instead of bringing the infant in alive, Pershing interrupted and complained that termination was not what they had previously agreed, but the Client dismissed the complaint and claimed he was \"simply being pragmatic.\""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A scientist spared"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Din Djarin successfully recovered the infant and delivered it directly to the Client and Pershing. Upon seeing the infant the pair rushed up, the Client first verifying its identity with a fob while Pershing scanned it to check that it was in good health. Pleased with the infant, the Client paid Djarin while Pershing escorted it from the room. Once Djarin was gone, the Client and Pershing argued about the infant, with the Client demanding he simply remove the material they needed from the Child even if it killed it. Pershing refused, reminding the Client that they had orders to deliver it alive, after which the Client warned Pershing they could no longer assure his safety and left.

After fighting his way through a number of stormtrooper guards, Djarin blasted open the door to the room where Pershing was working. A stormtrooper inside shot the bounty hunter, only for the bolt to rebound off his beskar armor. Din Djarin then killed the trooper and shot an IT-O Interrogation Unit while Pershing begged for his and the child's lives.

In the Imperial base on Nevarro, he worked on volunteers, injecting Grogu's blood into their bodies. After seeing promising results for two weeks, the bodies rejected the blood and did not survive. Pershing was unable to continue his work because he exhausted the supply of blood. Knowing it would be difficult to obtain any more blood with such a high M-count, referring to the midi-chlorians, he recorded a hologram message for Gideon revealing his failure but promised that he would ultimately succeed. Three days later, Din Djarin returned to Nevarro, he would come across the base where he saw Pershing's recording before helping to destroy the base."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Capture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the abduction of Grogu by Moff Gideon, Pershing was being transported aboard Shuttle 2743 when the ship came under attack from Boba Fett in Slave I, and was disabled by Fett's ion cannon. Thinking the shuttle was under attack by pirates, Pershing suggested they fight back, but the co-pilot said he didn't have a death wish and refused. When Din Djarin and Carasynthia Dune boarded the shuttle, the co-pilot held a blaster to Pershing's head, stressing the clone engineer's importance to Gideon and the New Republic, although Pershing confirmed to Djarin that Grogu was alive aboard Gideon's light cruiser. After goading Dune about the destruction of Alderaan, she shot and killed the pilot. Pershing's ear was grazed by the blaster bolt, leaving a partial hole."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Djarin obtained the help of the Mandalorians Bo-Katan Kryze and Koska Reeves, Pershing gave them valuable intel for their raid on Gideon's cruiser, including Grogu's location, and the presence and power-up time of a platoon of third-generation dark troopers.
