She was trained in the dark side and became a prominent Sith Lady in Krayt's One Sith Order. Maladi specialized in the ways of inquisition, torture, and mental manipulation, all skills which she implemented in her service as the head of Sith Intelligence and Assassination. She was also a talented scientist who experimented with ways to pervert science to serve the Sith cause.

When Krayt usurped the Imperial throne from Roan Fel in the aftermath, Darth Maladi served in the new empire as the head of Sith Intelligence and Assassination. Ten years later, Krayt ordered Darth Maladi to find and dispose of the former Emperor Roan Fel, and to capture Cade Skywalker, the last remaining member of the Skywalker family. Though she failed at the former task, the Sith were able to capture Skywalker, whom Maladi tortured to find his limits.

Developing her own plans, Maladi returned to Wayland, the planet where she originally created the Ossus sabotage, where she began to bioengineer a new means by which the next ruler of the One Sith would be able to ensure the loyalty of the masses. A meeting with Darth Nihl resulted in Maladi sending him to Korriban to discover the truth about Darth Krayt's demise. She then lured Cade Skywalker to her laboratory, and forced him to serve as her test subject for a new weapon, only for her experiment to result in utter calamity: he escaped, leaving Maladi's laboratory in shambles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith Lady later eventually regained consciousness on Bastion and in the custody of exiled Imperial forces where, feigning insanity, she offered the deposed Emperor Roan Fel her services in return for the head of Cade Skywalker, a petition which was rejected by Fel.

She later presented him with the completed form of the Omega Red biotoxin, which was\u2014unbeknownst to the former emperor\u2014engineered to eradicate all non-Sith within the blast radius. Fel failed to unleash the weapon however, and Darth Krayt was subsequently slain by Cade Skywalker, at which time Darth Nihl assumed leadership as Dark Lord of the Sith.

Her foremost patient was Darth Krayt himself, whom Maladi sought to cure from a Yuuzhan Vong slave seed infestation that left his body in decay. Aside from her scientific practices, Darth Maladi became an expert in espionage and secret activity.

This project had been championed by the Yuuzhan Vong Master Shaper Nei Rin and Kol Skywalker, a descendant of Grand Master Luke Skywalker and a senior member of the Jedi Council.

Maladi went to Wayland and mutated the Yorik-Kul coral seeds that the Yuuzhan Vong used to grow vegetation on the wasted worlds, and sentients on these planets soon found themselves with bony growths on their skin that could potentially kill them.

The alliance that Maladi had created with Veed and the impatient Moff Council, which was desperate to win the war, gave Fel no choice but to ally with the Sith.

The attack effectively tore apart the New Jedi Order, though Imperial statistics showed that half of the Jedi had survived the Sith's wrath, much to the chagrin of Veed, who believed that they should have waited for the entire Order to gather on Ossus so that all the Jedi died at once.

Maladi pondered whether she should learn the truth of Calixte's plans and intentions by dissecting her mind using the Force, but decided to work with her instead.

Although he was now the ruler of the Empire, Krayt believed that while Fel lived, his power would be threatened. Tired of searching endlessly for the former Emperor, Krayt tried to threaten Fel's daughter Marasiah with the hope that a frightened Princess would run to her father's hiding place.

Members of the Skywalker family were known to be exceptionally strong in the Force, and, judging from the decisions of the former Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who had fallen to the Dark side over 150 years earlier, Krayt assumed that Skywalker could be tempted to use the dark side as well. Krayt knew if he could turn Skywalker, the Jedi would be a strong acquisition to his Empire. Additionally, Skywalker's powerful healing abilities had been brought to Krayt's attention, which made him even more precious to Krayt, since his body was failing due to Yorik-kul implants.

Trey'lis could not resist the ruthless interrogation and torture methods of Maladi, and eventually told her everything he knew about young Skywalker, such as his ability in the Force, and that his companions were Jariah Syn and Deliah Blue. With the information she gleaned from the captured Jedi, Maladi ordered Calixte to personally take command of the search, and to bring Skywalker alive.

Calixte had already learned that Skywalker was on The Wheel, a neutral space station in the Mid Rim. However, one of Maladi's dispatched agents, Jor Torlin, also discovered that Skywalker was on The Wheel through his associate, Haako. Upon traveling to the Wheel, the two agents found that Skywalker had left the station. Torlin suggested to Calixte, now disguised as Corde, that Skywalker may have gone to Ossus, where he had trained as a Jedi. However, upon arriving on Ossus, the disguised Calixte killed Torlin.

The plan was to allow Sith Lord Darth Kruhl, who was also secretly aboard the Dauntless, to infiltrate Bastion and personally assassinate the deposed Emperor. That plan would turn out to be a ploy made by Maladi to lower Fel's personal defenses for a future assassination attempt on him.

Maladi displayed considerable dexterity when her lightsaber skills were called into action; while dueling, she focused on strong Force attacks supported by her blade work, making her twice as formidable in battle. This was evidenced when she engaged the Twi'lek Jedi Shado Vao in personal combat on Had Abaddon, and attacked him with Force lightning. Vao defended against the lightning with his own weapon, but it held him at bay, and neither Jedi nor Sith was able to gain an advantage. Maladi was confident in her detection skills and was complementary that Vao, Skywalker, and the Imperial Knights were able to completely conceal their Force presences even from her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maladi specialized in the ways of torture and assassination. Through relentless use of specialized torture droids, she was able to successfully extract the information about Cade Skywalker out of Hosk Trey'lis, a Jedi Master of the New Jedi Order. Maladi was a master of espionage, assassination and interrogation, extremely skilled in both Sith alchemy and Yuuzhan Vong bioengineering. She knew the Memory Walk technique, using it to attack Cade Skywalker's mind on Wayland."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maladi's skill with Force applications was also on par with her fellow Sith; she was proficient with Force lightning, having successfully attacked both Jariah Syn and Deliah Blue with it while torturing Cade Skywalker. Maladi also had a mastery over Sith alchemy, using it to mutate Yuuzhan Vong coral seeds into fatal, painful sores on sentients. She used her abilities to sabotage the Ossus Project, which started the Sith\u2013Imperial War, and created Omega Red, what she considered the perfected form of the extremely-lethal Alpha Red."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like other Sith, Darth Maladi possessed a red-bladed lightsaber, which she used while in combat on Had Abbadon.

The redesigned Darth Maladi was meant to look more tightly wound; a design inspired by one of Dermot Power's original sketches, that would later become the character Asajj Ventress. In an online interview on TheForce.Net, Duursema jokingly agreed that Maladi was supposed to be a bit \"emo.\" Another thing to note is Maladi's different skin color and fur quantities. It was established in The Essential Guide to Alien Species that female Devaronians had large fur quantities that had a white pigmentation, while Maladi has red skin and no fur. Duursema resolved this continuity issue by stating that she thought that Maladi looked different because she did not want all Devaronians to look the same."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While she was born on Devaron and was conscious of the stigma that surrounded members of the One Sith who were not born on Korriban, the Legacy Era Campaign Guide stated incorrectly that the opposite was true.
