Tano was assigned to Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker by Jedi Grand Master Yoda, and she demonstrated an eagerness to prove herself worthy to be his apprentice. Tano was involved in the defeat of the Separatist army on the planet Christophsis and was important to Republic efforts during the Battle of Teth. Along with Skywalker, Tano was instrumental in acquiring the Republic's safe passage through Hutt Space, due to her part in rescuing the son of Jabba the Hutt, which ensured an alliance between the Republic and the Hutt clans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Tano and her master achieved many things during the war including stopping the Blue Shadow Virus, freeing Togruta slaves from Kiros, saving her Master and many others on multiple occasions, and even halting a plot masterminded by Darth Sidious himself. She also engaged some of most deadly people in the galaxy, most notably Asajj Ventress, General Grievous, and Cad Bane several times, always surviving without any serious injury. Tano had a brief brush with the dark side on Mortis after being infected with it by the Son and even died, but she was resurrected by the Daughter. Tano formed close bonds with many members of the Order, which included Plo Koon, Barriss Offee, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Luminara Unduli as well as people outside the Order such as Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Lux Bonteri, to whom she developed a romantic attraction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 20 BBY, Tano's friend Barriss Offee, who believed the Jedi Order to be evil, and corrupt, and overly belligerent, orchestrated the bombing of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, killed the bomber, Letta Turmond, and caused the deaths of clone troopers while framing Tano for these crimes. While running away from Republic authorities and Skywalker, who still believed her to be innocent, Tano met her longtime nemesis Asajj Ventress and briefly allied with her, since both were on the run from their masters. Tano was led by Offee, the only Jedi whom she still saw as an ally, into a trap at an abandoned Coruscant warehouse in Coruscant's Undercity, where she was captured by Skywalker's forces. The Jedi High Council then expelled Tano from the Jedi Order and turned her over to the Republic for trial. Tano came very close to a conviction and death sentence, but she was acquitted at the last minute by the forced confession of a captured Offee. While the Council pardoned Tano and offered to bring her back into the Order, Tano refused, and she left the Jedi Temple."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Togruta from the planet Shili, Ahsoka Tano was discovered by Jedi Master Plo Koon at the age of threewhile he was on a mission to Shili, and was raised in the Jedi Temple. Tano considered Master Koon to be among her oldest and dearest friends by 22 BBY and felt a large amount of gratitude to him for discovering her Force sensitivity and ensuring that she would be given a home at the Jedi Temple.

Tano was intent on fighting, but Skywalker insisted on running. He told her to stop, allowing the chance to slash at the rolling droid as it passed them. When they reached the generator, Tano accidentally tripped a number of sensors, alerting retail droids to their presence.

En route, Tano gave the troops an account of how she \"saved\" Skywalker from the retail droids. Upon arriving on Teth, it proved impossible to land at the B'omarr Monastery where the Huttlet was being held, which forced the Republic forces to land at the base of the mesa. The only way to reach the monastery was by scaling the vertical cliff walls. Master and apprentice treated it like a race and began their climb to the top."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tano got aboard an AT-TE walker, and defended it from dwarf spider droid fire when its gunner was shot.

Unfortunately, while trying to load the Huttlet, whom Tano had nicknamed \"Stinky,\" into a pack, a recording of their actions was taken by 4A-7, who was actually the servant of Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress.

The two Jedi spotted another landing platform. Tano had a brief duel with Ventress before her Master picked her up on the back of a Can-cell, followed by astromech droid R2-D2. They discovered a ship, with 4A-7 at the foot of the ramp. When battle droids descended from the ship, it became obvious to Tano that 4A-7 was a spy. She destroyed the battle droids and beheaded 4A-7."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi commandeered the ship and attempted to land on the Venator-class Star Destroyer Spirit of the Republic, but its hangar was destroyed before they could land.

However, Jabba believed the Jedi were still using him and ordered them killed. Luckily, at the last moment, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo appeared via hologram with testimony that Jabba's own uncle, Ziro Desilijic Tiure, was responsible for Rotta's kidnapping. Once the truth was made known, Jabba promised the Republic safe passage through his territory in the Outer Rim, provided they promise to bring Dooku to justice for his crimes. Ziro would be punished severely by the Hutts.

Master Kenobi suggested a surgical strike on the InterGalactic Banking Clan warship building factories. It soon became clear that the Gwori system was the prime target, yet due to the Republic forces being too splintered, it would be impossible to launch an all-out attack. Further complicating a possible strike team's sabotage attempt was a gigantic bio-scan-irradiator-incinerator that would kill any organics on ships that pass through it. Skywalker concocted a plan that would successfully bypass that complication; the strike team would freeze themselves in carbonite, which would resist the radiation produced by the incinerator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker ordered Tano to not participate in the mission; however, after he and the strike team were frozen, she manipulated Admiral Wullf Yularen into believing that Skywalker had decided to reverse his order and to allow Tano to be frozen and accompany the team on world.

B2 super battle droids equipped with jetpacks trailed Tano and her strike team into a cave, where she was forced to kill a large reptilian carnivore. Kenobi and Skywalker soon learned that the Separatists were using organic slaves to build warships; quite surprising due to it being far less productive than the use of droids. Later, the remnants of the strike team\u2014Tano, Skywalker, Kenobi and Captain Rex\u2014were captured.

Afterward he led them to the city's central communication tower, where the Jedi were able to patch a message to their Star Destroyer, Resolute. Without the element of surprise Canteval's Munificent was unable to overpower the Venator on its own.

Facing a dead-end, magister Denache committed suicide by stepping off the edge of the city and falling into the care of the gas giant.

She often talked down to others in battle, behaving as if she was superior to them, mirroring the attitude of her master.

Tano was also known to become too focused on one task or aspect of a mission, thus disregarding the safety of the clones under her command.

Moments after forcibly being extracted, the Separatist reinforcements that Skywalker and Kenobi warned her of arrived and overran her position; within seconds they had destroyed her vehicles, which would have resulted in the death of all her troops and herself if not for her masters' intervention.
