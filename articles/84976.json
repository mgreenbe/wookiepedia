It was unique among Jedi as it produced an amethyst blade when activated, rather than the more common green or blue. Windu wielded his lightsaber in many skirmishes and battles across the galaxy during notable events such as the Yinchorri Uprising and the Clone Wars. Those conflicts saw the blade used on battlefronts such as Yinchorr, Ryloth, Dantooine, Boz Pity, Coruscant, Malastare and others."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, the lightsaber was lost when it was dropped out of the window of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's office prior to his death. In 18 BBY, Duros salvagers recovered it and gave it to Senator Sano Sauro."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "First lightsaber"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Jedi initiate, Windu was able to see shatterpoints in the Force, allowing him to glimpse the future in brief visions. During these visions, Windu was able to see the lightsaber he would eventually build. This was a cause for concern within the Jedi Council, as Windu was unable to construct a weapon resembling the lightsaber he saw in his visions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the age of fourteen, Windu requested a true challenge, so that he would be able to find the parts necessary to build the lightsaber.

At one point, he caused one of the natives to shatter, but was able to painstakingly reconstruct the individual. As a result, the natives presented him with an amethyst-colored lightsaber crystal, which he used to finally construct the lightsaber he had seen in his visions of the future."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Second lightsaber"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime before 22 BBY, Windu created a second lightsaber, in recognition of his position as a senior Jedi Council member. It was built to the highest standards, emphasizing precision and quality. The weapon incorporated an electrum finish reserved only for the most senior of council members, as well as the signature amethyst crystal of his earlier weapon. His second lightsaber served him throughout the galaxy-spanning Clone Wars, until his death at the hands of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine in 19 BBY - who was the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious. The lightsaber plummeted out of the shattered window of the Chancellor's office after Windu's hand was severed by Anakin Skywalker, with its owner soon following."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The following year, a Duros sold a broken lightsaber, which he claimed once belonged to Master Windu, to Senator Sano Sauro.
