A painting created by Falber, along with the sculpture An Empire's Grace, made by Covik, was acquired by Ronen Tagge of the Tagge family, who enjoyed purchasing artifacts to destroy them. Tagge had the two artists decide which work was superior, and both Falber and Covik attempted to persuade him to choose the other's creation. Ultimately, Tagge destroyed both, and Falber and Covik were both distraught at the destruction of their works."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
