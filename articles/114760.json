While most Tunroth realized that the Imperial effort to bring the Purge to an end was made primarily out of self-interest, the Tunroth were somewhat grateful to the Empire for coming to their aid and reluctantly accepted Imperial rule, with many Tunroth becoming supporters of the New Order. Tunroth leaders who forbade blasters in favor of traditional hunting weapons changed their views after the Reslian Purge, and the Tunroth would later stockpile blasters and other modern weapons for the express purpose of defending their communes. Kiran Tatch was one of the few Tunroth Hunters who survived the Purge, and it was believed that the trauma he experienced during the Purge transformed him a bitter being with little interest in anything other than the hunt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "X-wing Rogue Squadron 25: The Making of Baron Fel incorrectly spelled this as the \"Resalian Purge,\" despite its name deriving from the planet Jiroch-Reslia.
