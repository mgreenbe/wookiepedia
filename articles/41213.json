Leneer, who was seeking to kill Malgus for his murder of her former Master, Ven Zallow, traveled to the occupied Coruscant to hunt down the Sith. The two eventually found one another at the ruins of the recently destroyed Jedi Temple and engaged in a short but fierce duel. With her use of Ven Zallow's lightsaber, Leneer offered Malgus a potent challenge, surprising even Malgus with the power she wielded. The Jedi Knight boasted that she was more than a match for this Sith, after meeting his hatred head on and overpowering him; impaling his side with Master Zallow's lightsaber. She chose to retreat in an Armin speeder piloted by her friend Zeerid Korr. Instead of finishing him off, she let the anger in her heart overrule her judgment. She retreated; not out of fear, as even Malgus admitted, but for revenge. It wouldn't be enough to kill him. She wanted to make him feel the same pain he placed upon her. After what he did to her former Master she would target Malgus by attacking Eleena Daru, Malgus' secret love. In doing so she had taught Malgus the true definition of fear."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
