It could run at fairly quick speeds and employed a pair of dual blasters as weapons. These offensive weapons were built directly into its hands. The droid was very accurate with its weapons but fragile in its armor; though it used this to its advantage with a powerful self-destruction system when disabled. However, when fighting alongside fellow Imperials, this could be more of a hindrance than a help when a disabled droid exploded next to the group."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These droids were utilized by Prince Xizor to protect his palace.
