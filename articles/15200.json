Flight leader Wilkins started an attack run on the Vehemence's bridge and fired the ion cannons. The explosions blinded Wilkins, and a TIE/sa bomber accidentally rammed his BTL Y-wing starfighter, sending them both spinning through space. Wilkins and his gunner were both knocked unconscious in the impact, so Wilkins' astromech droid BXET-R2 took control and flied out of the bombers counterattack path. BX fired a proton torpedo at the bomber, which distracted it giving time for the Y-wing to escape into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
