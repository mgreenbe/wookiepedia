The average length of the netcaster would often be 75 centimeters. They would spin webs among the tall trees of their native environment which would trap their usual prey, namely the daubirds. When attacked or confronted by dangerous predators, the netcaster would use its highly venomous bite to protect itself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
