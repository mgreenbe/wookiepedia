They could be round or elongated. Those fruits were normally covered with tiny reflective crystals that protected them from excessive solar exposure. The gourd's interior was filled with tough, stringy fibers that contained a sour fluid. During their growing season, hubba gourds were colored green, and they would eventually take a yellowish hue. When ripe, those fruits also exhaled a distinctive smell. The seeds of the hubba gourd were pale and transparent."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hubba gourd was prime food for Tusken Raiders and Jawas; the latter species found it particularly delicious when roasted.
