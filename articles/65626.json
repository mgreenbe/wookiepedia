In addition to its role as the central hub of all Jedi activities throughout the galaxy, the Temple functioned as a monastery for Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters as well as a school for the training of Padawans and initiates. As the headquarters of the Order, the Temple was the location of several key areas such as the Holocron Vault, which housed the Order's closely guarded secrets; the Jedi Archives, the largest repository of information; and the Jedi Council Chamber, where the ruling Jedi High Council convened to ponder galactic events and determine the will of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Constructed by the Four Masters millennia before the proclamation of the New Order, the Temple was rebuilt and expanded several times over the centuries.

In 19 BBY, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine\u2014the alter ego of Darth Sidious\u2014initiated the Great Jedi Purge through Order 66, which declared all Jedi enemies of the state. His Sith apprentice, the newly-anointed Sith Lord Darth Vader, marched on the Temple at the head of the elite 501st Legion. The siege of the Jedi Temple resulted in the deaths of many Jedi, including the younglings.

In the final days of the Galactic Civil War, Amedda was placed under virtual house arrest in the Palace by soldiers who were loyal to Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, the self-proclaimed Counselor to the Empire.

Dotted by statues and small parks, the Precinct was bisected by the Processional Way, a long road which terminated at a ceremonial staircase that led into the Temple's entrance hall. Crowned by four statues, two Warrior Masters and two Sage Masters, the main entrance was decorated with twelve massive pylons adorned with the depictions of the Temple's founding Four Masters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Constructed around and within a natural mountain spire, the Jedi Temple was an agglomeration of a series of shrines, temples, academies, and holy places which had dotted the site for millennia. A sacred place to numerous Force traditions, the Temple preserved some of these ancient structures for their architectural and historical merits, re-purposing them as museums or art galleries. The peak of the mountain spire at the facility's core was surrounded by ancient meditation balconies and access points to the mountain's interior, which was burrowed through with cave chapels and buried shrines. One of the earliest Jedi libraries at the site was eventually converted into a formal banquet hall. As the Jedi cemented their hold on the facility, they began to add their architectural flair to the building, forming a massive ziggurat around the mountain spire that completely encompassed it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The base of the ziggurat was a series of pillared halls that supported the weight of the structure above; additional rooms such as the Room of a Thousand Fountains and a rotunda chapel converted into a meditation hall made up the base of the ziggurat. Higher in the main body of the Temple complex was a medical center staffed by the Medical Corps, a transformation chamber where a Jedi could be disguised as another individual, containment cells for hostile Force-users, and a series of workshops, and maintenance facilities. The Temple was also the home of the Jedi Archives, a wellspring of knowledge said to house the collective wisdom of the galaxy's scholars and historians. Aside from its collections of holobooks and artifacts, the Archives housed the secured Holocron Vault, in which the Jedi stored their precious holocrons which was accessible only to Jedi Masters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One level of the temple was dedicated to storage. One of its stores was for linen products, while another was for training equipment. The Temple's interior was cluttered with dormitories and classrooms to house and educate the youngest initiates and Padawans. Holographic training suites used sophisticated technology to create realistic combat scenarios for Jedi-in-training to use and better their skill with a lightsaber. A lightsaber crafting facility allowed Jedi to construct or upgrade their weapons between missions. More advanced classes were taught in facilities built after the Temple's initial construction and could be found throughout the Temple Precinct. The surface level of the ziggurat base was dotted with ancient temples and shrines from the Temple's earliest days. The Chamber of Conclave could be found among the shrines, where Jedi from across the galaxy gathered to hear an annual report from the High Council. Modern facilities were erected here too, such as the Temple's main vehicle garage and other facilities to house surface and ground vehicles. Throughout the Temple, visitors could find statues and tapestries that detailed the history of the Jedi Order. One of the Temple's mosaic floors was salvaged from the ancient Jedi Temple at Ossus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stained-glass arcades and ancient tablets depicting battles and the Jedi Code preserved the Order's greatest heroes and most time-honored stories. The site which contained the most art and history was perhaps the central spire of the Temple. Erupting from the center of the ziggurat's flat roof, the central spire soared above the four peripheral towers which crowned the facility. Within its hollowed interior, the central spire contained massive memorial statues suspended on repulsorlift pads. At its peak, the central spire was adorned with three decorative fins, inside which was housed the Hall of Knighthood, wherein the status of Knight or Master was bestowed upon members of the Order. The pinnacle room of the central tower was home to the oldest known texts that the Order possessed. Members of the Jedi High Council would occasionally meet within this chamber to discuss the future of the Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The roof of the Temple's ziggurat was accessible to Jedi and was often used for outdoor sparring sessions by younglings and Padawans alike. A gnarled, ancient tree stood in the shadow of the Temple's five crowning spires, and was a place many Jedi came to find solace. Each of the four lesser towers of the Temple were crowned by an array of powerful reception and transmission antennas which tapped into hyperspace itself so that the Temple could be appraised of information in real-time. A pyramid system of holomaps worked furiously within the towers, starting with twelve teams at the base that monitored disturbances in the Force, before pushing potential threats all the way up to the large galaxy holomap situated below the pinnacle Council Chamber of each tower. Contemplation stations ringed the holomap level of each tower, allowing Jedi waiting to visit the Council to find peace before standing before the leaders of the Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within the Tower of Reassignment, the Chamber of Judgment was situated where Jedi could be judged when charged with violating one of the Order's strictures or galactic law. Each tower was equipped with a hangar and extendable landing platform where Jedi and visiting dignitaries alike could land and store their ships. These tower hangars, equipped with a carbon-freezing facility where cargo could be frozen for transport, housed Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptors, Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry, and Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptors during the Clone Wars.

All that remained of the original temple was its quincunx of skyscraping spires, which crowned an amalgam of blockish edifices with sloping fa\u00e7ades. The Temple Precinct, renamed as the Palace Precinct, housed a courtyard landing field that was large enough to accommodate Star Destroyers of the Victory and Venator classes. From that courtyard, the Palace's interior could be accessed through elaborate doors. Along with the Naval Intelligence headquarters and the COMPNOR arcology, the Imperial Palace made up the supreme triangle of Imperial City's Federal District.

After falling under the control of the ancient Sith, the Jedi Order's enemies erected a shrine on the mountain from which they dominated Coruscant. When the Jedi reclaimed the mountain during a war around 5000 BBY, the Jedi reduced the Sith facility to its foundations and stripped away all remnants of their fallen foe. Unbeknownst to the Jedi, a hidden portion of the shrine endured in the foundations of the mountain, forgotten yet still active. As the Order erected the Jedi Temple over the mountain, the shrine's malevolent energies continued to permeate the site, slowly clouding the Jedi's collective use of the Force with the power of the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one time, the Temple housed an artifact known as the darksaber\u2014a black-colored lightsaber constructed by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian inducted into the Jedi ranks.

Learning how to use the Force, the martial arts, diplomacy, and meditation, the Jedi thrived within their home as the Republic became increasingly corrupt.

As public sentiment turned against the war, protests were staged on the front steps of the Temple, while one of its hangars was bombed by Padawan Barriss Offee, who believed the Jedi only cared about violence. Her actions resulted in the deaths of civilians, clone troopers, and several Jedi who were caught in the explosion. Although the attack occurred on Jedi property, and the Jedi therefore regarded it as an internal affair, the Republic government claimed jurisdiction due to the deaths of clones and Republic citizens."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack on the Temple fueled the Republic citizenry's anti-war sentiment. A crowd of civilians formed along the Processional Way, protesting against the Jedi, the military, and the Clone Wars.
