Stephens. In the adventure, the player characters travel to the planet Varl to shutdown production of the spice Tempest on the world. If the players alert the Hutt Mika Anjiliac Chiera\u2014who was secretly the mastermind behind the development of Tempest\u2014about their mission, Mika hires the Unrepentant via a blind contract to patrol near the planet Rhilithan and attempt to thwart the players efforts to capture the Varl-bound freighter Barabi Run. The adventure also advised that the Unrepentant use similar roleplaying statistics to Barabi Run, which was a Mobquet medium transport, but did not confirm whether the Unrepentant was itself a Mobquet transport. In 2012, the novel Scourge, an adaptation of Tempest Feud was published, and it established the canon series of role-playing outcomes for the Tempest Feud. The book makes no mention of the Unrepentant and establishes that Mika was not warned of the mission to strike against Varl, so this article therefore assumes that the hire of the Unrepentant by Mika is non-canon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
