Due to the rodent's close connection to the Force, the noise had the ability to shatter the precious Adegan Crystals, requiring the Jedi to develop this ability to diminish the sound by manipulating the Force around them. In doing so, they could domesticate the creature with little trouble, and explore the cave network without hindrance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
