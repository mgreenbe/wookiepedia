In 0.5 ABY, the ship was moved to the Imperial Star Destroyer Reprisal as part of the ISB force being transported by Captain Kendal Ozzel to points unknown."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The freighter's engines, armament, and internal systems had all been highly upgraded, though its exterior belied these improvements. The ship also carried several sets of stormtrooper, scout trooper and spacetrooper armor, a large arsenal of weapons, two speeder bikes, a speeder truck, and a cache of roughly half a million credits. There were also machines that allowed the ship and its crew to rapidly switch identities, both with personal identity tags and multiple transponder codes. Presumably these were to be used in anti-Rebel operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the accidental death of ISB Major Drelfin, the five stormtroopers who would become informally known as the Hand of Judgment led by Daric LaRone, stole the Melnor Spear from the Reprisal and used it as their mobile base in their private quest to bring justice to the Shelsha sector. Its aliases during the journey included Ville Brok and Gillia, although the stormtroopers would simply refer to it as \"the Suwantek.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the conclusion of their final mission on Poln Major, the Hand were abruptly spirited onto the Imperial Star Destroyer Admonitor, and forced to leave the Melnor Spear behind. Mara Jade, the Emperor's Hand, searched the ship's computer for clues as to where they had gone, but found none. She knew that she was technically required to return the stolen ship to the ISB, but privately debated whether it would be better for her to keep it for her own use."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
