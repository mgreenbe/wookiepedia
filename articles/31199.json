All of its crewmembers were either devoured by native sand burrowers or killed during the crash. Jaden Korr, who was sent to rescue them, but had been forced to crash-land as well, successfully scavenged the merchant vessel for parts that could be used to repair Korr's own ship. These parts were a power converter, an energy cell for the cooling unit, a power coupling for the acceleration compensator, and a damper."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
