An old and worn establishment, the cantina's black-colored doors were the only parts of the building's exterior that appeared well-maintained by the time of the Clone Wars, a galactic conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Inside, tables and chairs were spread about for patrons to sit at, and both food and drink could be ordered from the cantina's long bar. As Enceri was a small town, the cantina's patrons were largely well-acquainted regulars. The cantina was staffed by an elderly female bartender, and served mugs of black ne'tra gal ale, in addition to bowls of soup\u2014either gi dumpling, or red gourd."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 19 BBY, the Mandalorian couple Parja Bralor and Fi Skirata traveled to Enceri as part of the latter's rehabilitation from a head injury. After Bralor helped the wounded former clone commando navigate Enceri's streets, the two stopped in at the cantina for a meal and drinks. Skirata's attempts at ordering from the bar in Basic earned him odd looks from the elderly bartender\u2014Enceri residents primarily spoke the Mandalorian language, Mando'a\u2014until the older woman saw the sigils denoting disability on Skirata's Mandalorian armor, after which she spoke to him in a gentler and more helpful tone. Skirata ordered two mugs of ne'tra gal and two bowls of red gourd soup for Bralor and himself, and they enjoyed a table together in a corner of the cantina. Their time together was interrupted, however, by the arrival of fellow Mandalorian Fenn Shysa, who introduced himself to Skirata and attempted to enlist him in acting as Mand'alor in the interim until one could be truly chosen, a proposition he would later elaborate upon at a second meeting in the Oyu'baat tapcaf in Keldabe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Enceri cantina first appeared in Star Wars canon in the 2008 novel Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel, by author Karen Traviss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
