It orbited the primary star Kuras, between the worlds of Kuras III and Kuras IV. The presence of an asteroid belt made travel to and from the Kuras system difficult. It was believed that the first probe sent to the area by the Galactic Republic was destroyed within this asteroid field, thus keeping the system out of most star charts, leaving its planets undiscovered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
