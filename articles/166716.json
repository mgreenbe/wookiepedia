Male and female members of the species were roughly the same height and build with adults standing between 1.5 to 2.5 meters. They were noted as being a mammalian species with a thin, bony humanoid form. They were described as being so gaunt as to seem skeletal due to their pallid gray skin and lithe builds. Their alien physiognomy was noted for being close enough to a humanoid to the point that it was possible to determine their body language due to the similarities. These tall gaunt humanoids had wide set and large black gray eyes. Their black eyes were said to be as expressionless as stones. The backs and necks were both scaled, which was an evolutionary vestige of natural body armor once possessed by the race. Thus, their skin incorporated this vestigial form of armor that went down from their backs to their necks and down their spines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amongst the males of the species, there were scarlet facials crests that ran along cheeks, jaws and the tops of their heads. This larger crest ran across the top and down the back of their heads. A male's facial crests swelled when they were spurred to violenceor combat. The primary head crest became engorged when a male was ready to mate. Female members of the species did not exhibit such features. Yevetha brains were located in their thoraxes where they were protected by thick bone that served as brain cages. They also possessed fine hair cells that ran as indentations along their temples which provided auditory senses. The race possessed six fingered hands that had retractable dew claws. Each one was located on the inside of the wrist above their six-fingered hands. Their dewclaws shot from a sheath of a skin from their cadaverous hands and were capable of being retracted. When extended fully, the wrist blades were equal to the length of a vibroblade. These blades extended to about a foot in length, and were used in close combat and blood sacrifices. The Yevetha also appeared to possess a greater tolerance for g-forces when compared to Human pilots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Young Yevetha were born when the females reproduced by laying eggs that were known as \"birth casks\". The detachable external birth casks were known to the Yevetha as a mara-nas. These were external wombs that were placed in special chambers and the unborn child was fed blood that was absorbed through the shell of the eggs. Should the child remain within the cask past birth then they were referred to as \"nestings\". Normally, unborn children were fed a diet of blood that was preferably from the mother. However, the blood of any Yevetha was capable of nourishing the young, and the species' biological need for blood became an important factor that shaped their society. In rare cases, birth casks were capable of giving birth to twins that were generally identical except for their age."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yevetha were known to suffer from a disease called gray death, but the symptoms were unknown. Though it was extremely rare, some Yevetha were born genderless. These genetic curiosities were white and pale in appearance, with their gender indicating them to be neither male or female. Although unsubstantiated, some in the New Republic speculated about a possible relation between the Yevetha and Twi'leks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a Yevethan lifespan, a child was considered to be between the ages of 1-5 and they became an adult between 6-11 years of age. An adult was between 12-44 and they were in their middle age between 45-66. Yevetha were considered old between 67-80 and those older than 81 were considered venerable amongst their race."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yevethan culture was organized into a strict hierarchical system headed by the Darama. Politically, Yevethan society was led by a Viceroy, who also operated as the chief of state for the Duskhan League. The Darama and Viceroy were linked positions, connecting Yevethan spirituality and politics. Departments of governance, commerce, science, and culture were led by Proctors, and supported by various guilds. This structure was mirrored in the Yevethan military and shipboard staffs led by Primates. Their technical capabilities meant that they were quite capable of simply studying mechanical readouts and not only duplicating technology but even improving upon it. This meant that their guildsmen were excellent workers and quite capable starship designers. This uncanny knack for technology was just another reason for the Yevetha to think so highly of themselves. As a result, it was known that the Yevetha were considered quick studies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within their society, blood was an important aspect of their culture and was a central focus of their religious belief system. This had resulted in them becoming a particularly violent species. For the Yevetha, death was not to be feared. They were described as being dutiful, attentive, cautious but also fatalistic in their view of the universe. When fighting against other foes, Yevetha were notable for being ruthless fighters who never surrendered even in the face of certain defeat.> Due to the brutal nature of their society, the Yevetha did not possess a single jail, penitentiary or stockade as they believed there was no need for such facilities. In fact, they did not possess a word in their language for either convict or incarcerate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yevetha possessed a highly stratified society that consisted of a number of different castes. Those of low-ranking castes were never able to ascend to the higher ranking ones though it was known that a higher caste individual was capable of being \"demoted\" to a lower caste. Despite the status of these subordinate castes, it was considered a better alternative to being classed as an alien. This was because of the xenophobia of the species as even a lower caste member was considered to be still a Yevethan while aliens were considered little more than vermin. Another element within their society that stemmed from the caste system was the concept of dominance killings, where murder was only recognized to occur if a higher-ranking Yevetha was killed by one of a lower status. The killing of a low-ranking Yevetha was considered perfectly acceptable by the higher castes. This strict hierarchy dominated their lives, meaning that many young male Yevetha lived with the knowledge that at any moment, their superior was justified in slaughtering them simply for their blood."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sacrifice, particularly to provide blood for a birth cask of an important Yevetha, was considered an honor to the family of the sacrificed Yevetha. Birth casks were often placed in breederies which were considered to be private locations. On certain occasions, a Yevetha was known to meet with visitors by the alcoves. In support of high-ranking Yevetha, there was typically a breeding assistant who administered the arrival of sacrificial Yevetha for the birthing casks in order to feed them. The Yevetha considered twins lucky and it was believed in their tradition that such individuals also passed on their blessing at will by simple breath, touch and even blood. It was common for nitakka to spar, embedding young Yevetha with a unique set of fighting instincts: \"the closest threat is the greatest threat\u2014in a fight of unequal numbers, dispatch your weakest opponent first to discourage others from joining a fight against you, charge a newcomer immediately\u2014hold nothing back when you go to kill.\" These instincts were difficult to suppress, producing erratic battlefield results for inexperienced military crews."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the lower classes were treated with nothing but contempt, the reaction of the race to other non-Yevetha was even more severe. The Yevetha were considered one of the most xenophobic and bigoted species within the galaxy. In fact, they considered non-Yevetha to be little more than vermin. As a result, the Yevetha tended to consider other species to be hardly worth their attention. This was partly attributed to the relative youth of their homeworld and its location where stars of the greater galaxy were masked with the brightness of the Koornacht Cluster. As a result, the Yevetha originally believed themselves to be the only intelligent beings in existence. Following contact and their initial enslavement, this attitude was only slightly altered as the race now believed that they were the only worthy species in existence and that all other races were to be exterminated. This xenophobia extended to such a level that they refused to learn alien languages such as Basic, as they found it being repulsive. In order to communicate with \"vermin\", many high-ranking Yevetha made those of the lower castes learn the language in order to serve as translators. While this was the case, there were certain cadres of high-ranking Yevetha that deigned to learn alien languages as they believed there were certain things not meant to be heard by the subordinate castes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This conceited belief in their status as being the only intelligent life in existence stemmed from even ancient times on their homeworld. In fact, it was known that not even a single member of their greatest thinkers had even considered the concept of there being the presence of other forms of sentient life on other worlds. Ultimately, it was held that while they had rapidly advanced on a technological basis, their culture was still in an adolescent stage of development."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early existence"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A relatively young species, the ancient Yevethans had only evolved on their home planet of N'zoth around 50,000 years ago. Since that time, they had quickly advanced on their homeworld and in isolation to any other form of sentient life. The position of their planet meant that the race never knew there were other stars in the galaxy. This along with a combination of their rapid evolution, isolation and harsh environment produced a culture that was highly xenophobic. This also established an internal concept of superiority. In fact, the Yevetha believed themselves to had been the only intelligent species in existence. Eventually, their race perfected space travel and their expansion into space led them to colonize eleven other nearby worlds. This came shortly after they had developed a planetary wide governing hierarchical system. This in turn led to the establishment of the Yevethan Protectorate that consisted of the original daughter worlds settled by real space ships that operated without hyperdrive and became collectively known as \"The Twelve\". On such worlds, the Yevetha only encountered animal forms of life which preserved their concept of being the only intelligent species in the universe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At this point in their history, the species was well within the information age and at the cusp of the space age on a technological level. Despite maintaining their isolation, at least a single Yevetha was present on Coruscant in 18.8 BBY; this individual seemingly managed his xenophobic impulses and played Shronker in the Zi-Kree Sector. Nick Rostu encountered this individual and wound up in a fight with him after the Yevetha lost the game. Over the millennia, the Yevetha continued to live in relative peace, and their beliefs remained unchallenged until the arrival of the Galactic Empire. The Koornacht Cluster was swiftly defeated during the early years of Imperial expansion. Under Emperor Palpatine's reign, the planet N'zoth was seized and made the site of an Imperial shipyard. An Imperial government enslaved the Yevethans and placed them at work in newly constructed shipyards where they served as technical and maintenance personnel. With amazing speed, they mastered shipbuilding and weapons technology. The Yevethans were known to have taken to the technology with astonishing speed and aptitude."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was duly noted by the Empire that the Yevetha had a rapid ability to learn new skills. After subjugating N'zoth and its nearby star systems, Imperial forces built the Black Fifteen shipyards, and put the Yevetha to work as skilled slave labor for building, repairing, and modifying vessels of the Imperial Starfleet. Despite their enslavement, the Yevetha made nominal attempts at resistance, which led to a number of sabotage attempts at the shipyards. Even with this being the case, the Black Fleet shipyards were noted for their excellence, with the facility's reputation resulting in its prestige as the finest conscript facility within the Empire. The Imperial Governor of the Cluster took several females as pleasure slaves for his staff, and gave the males to his stormtroopers for target practice. The mutilated bodies were then put on display at schools and sacred sites. They were also broadcast on public information channels that all Yevetha were forced to watch twice a day. When subjugation was not working as desired, children were taken from their parents. Initially, the Yevetha decided to submit to Imperial rule and waited until the time came that the Empire became lax in their control."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Yevethan Uprising"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around eight months after the Battle of Endor, Ysanne Isard recalled many Star Destroyers to defend the Core Worlds. Amongst the Imperial armadas that received this order was the Black Sword Command; upon receiving the order, the Command prepared to depart the central shipbuilding facilities at N'zoth. Before the Imperial garrison was able to destroy the shipyards, an uprising emerged amongst the Yevethan dockworkers. This prevented the Imperials from initiating the mass killing of the slaves and the destruction of the repair yards. The shocking uprising was led by ground commando Nil Spaar, who moved to counter the mass slave executions. He took advantage of the Empire's view of the Yevetha as a brainwashed, mindless species and seized control of the yards. Spaar murdered thousands of Imperials and hundreds more were captured whilst every Star Destroyer in the Black Fleet was overtaken. When the Imperial garrison finally reached the shipyards they found seven thousand freed Yevethan prisoners, as well as the remains of over fifteen thousand dead Imperial soldiers. Fearing the same fate, the Imperial garrison never returned. Amongst the Yevetha's conquests included the capture of the Super Star Destroyer Intimidator, with the Yevetha covering up the entire incident. This led to the New Republic never hearing of the incident and Isard believing that the fleet was destroyed on Cal-Seti based on inaccurate intelligence. Afterwards, the Koornacht Cluster remained a closed-border curiosity to the rest of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next decade and a half, the Yevetha developed their technical capabilities. They created new starship shielding, gravity bombs, Aramadia-class thrustships, and D-type fighters. They also established the Duskhan League, which grew to encompass thirteen worlds. The Yevethan fleet was dubbed the Black Fleet, in a twisted version of its predecessor, the Galactic Empire Black Sword Command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 16 ABY, the Dushkan League came out of isolation and engaged the New Republic. A delegation, led by Viceroy Nil Spaar, arrived at Coruscant to seek a peaceful co-existence. Nil Spaar used the New Republic's lack of intelligence on the Duskhan League as well as their senatorial political conflict to his advantage. Spaar extended his negotiations with Chief of State Leia Organa Solo over a period of weeks and played into her empathy towards a species subjugated by the Empire. This allowed him to cultivate assets on Coruscant, and set off a series of political machinations, sowing confusion amongst the members of the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nil Spaar returned to his people and, with the New Republic in disarray, the Yevetha launched a campaign of brutal expansion and colonization. The Yevethan Purge saw the elimination of entire species, such as the Corasgh, and communities like the Norat Sovereignty, and the Yevetha thereafter colonized many nearby star systems in the Koornacht Cluster. In the following weeks, foiled reconnaissance efforts by the New Republic prompted an armed conflict between the Duskhan League, its hidden Black Fleet, and the New Republic Defense Force's new Fifth Battle Group."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The conflict concluded with a Yevethan loss at the Battle of N'zoth as well as the reported death of Nil Spaar at the hands of Imperial officer Sil Sorannan. The victorious New Republic disarmed the Yevetha and kept them under close watch. Active Republic patrols were eventually removed by at least 25 ABY. Following their defeat, the palace of the Viceroy remained as the late Nil Spaar had left it, with many Yevetha fruitlessly holding on to the hope that their leader would return at some point in the future."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since no being had entered the N'zoth system since the Battle of N'zoth, this allowed the Yevetha to build an even larger force than before. It consisted of more than ten thousand Aramadia-class thrustships. Once the new Yevethan fleet had been built, the Galantos Guard encountered the Yuuzhan Vong. In exchange for what the Fia believed to be protection from the extragalactic invaders, they informed the Yuuzhan Vong of the brutal Yevetha and their eminent threat. Taking heed, the Yuuzhan Vong invaded the N'zoth system. In the subsequent battle, the Yuuzhan Vong emerged victorious. The Yuuzhan Vong proceeded to orbitally bombard N'zoth, rendering the planet a molten wasteland."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The besieged Yevetha continued to refuse outside help, and were eventually rendered nearly extinct. While many believed the species had been destroyed, it was speculated by some that their expansionist tendencies might have resulted in some colonies that escaped the notice of the Yuuzhan Vong. In fact, after the fall of N'zoth, it was estimated that fewer than ten thousand Yevetha were still alive in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
