The Geonosians would fight on the side of the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars, defending their planet on multiple occasions. After contributing to the construction of the Death Star, they were nearly exterminated by the Galactic Empire. Only a single Geonosian, nicknamed Klik-Klak, survived the Imperial sterilization of their planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A caste-based species separated by positions of drones and warriors, Geonosians were born into hives with each led by a queen. The queen laid eggs for the hive, and provided orders to the public leaders of Geonosis. One such queen, Karina the Great, was even able to control sentient beings, including her own kind, via the use of brain worms. It was believed by some that \"Karina the Great\" was the name assigned to every reigning queen, instead of being the name of one specific individual, but one queen only called herself \"Karina\" because of her own insanity. No matter the case, Geonosian queens resided underground in the catacombs of Geonosis. From here, they commanded an army's worth of Geonosian drones. Queens took no more than two years to grow from a small egg to a considerable size."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Drones were capable of becoming warriors if they proved themselves worthy by successfully defeating other drones in an arena. Geonosians of the warrior caste were known as Geonosian warriors. They had wings and a thick exoskeleton, and they were dedicated to warfare. Among Geonosian broods, the alpha was known as the Geonosian Brood Alpha. Geonosians also had two sets of mandibles, outer and inner, which they used to gesture. For example, clicking the outer mandibles twice meant \"Work Harder,\" and clicking both sets meant \"Die.\" Geonosians also celebrated Meckgin, a day in which they celebrated the virtues of industry. Geonosians would get drunk by eating a special fungus which reacted with their stomach fluids to create a body odor which created euphoria."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Naturally industrious and barbaric, they were also known to take upon construction projects from outside parties, as was the case when Baktoid Armor Workshop approached them to design factories for the Trade Federation. Productivity was key to Geonosian society, and if not kept in check with enough tasks, hives could devolve into civil war and result in the deaths of thousands of Geonosians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Pre-Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Long ago, the Geonosians inhabited Geonosis' surface.

During the reign of Poggle, Geonosis became a member of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Separatists used the Geonosians to help create the Separatist Droid Army after the Separatist Head of State, Count Dooku, personally arrived to negotiate the agreement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This eventually led to a large battle between the Galactic Republic and the Separatists on Geonosis, marking the official outbreak of the Clone Wars. The Geonosians were the ones responsible for creating the plans for the Death Star. Later in the Clone Wars, Geonosis was the site of another major battle, which saw Poggle the Lesser captured and the Geonosis primary droid foundry destroyed. Sometime after this second battle, the Republic's Strategic Advisory Cell began to build the battle station that would one day be known as the Death Star, with Lieutenant Commander Orson Callan Krennic enlisting Poggle the Lesser to make the Geonosians serve as the Republic's workforce. Poggle appeared to agree, but, sometime after he returned to Geonosis, he arranged a Geonosian riot and escaped the Republic flotilla to return to the Confederacy."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Imperial Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Clone Wars, the Geonosians were forced by the Galactic Empire to assist in the construction of the Death Star. Though a new archduke was appointed to lead the Stalgasin hive, the Geonosians became a servant species to the Empire and were forbidden from freely breeding. When the Geonosians were unable to work out how to refine the superweapon's superlaser, the Empire brought in Galen Walton Erso to finish the job."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Death Star's hyperdrive was operational, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin ordered the Imperial Weapons division to sterilize Geonosis using Imperial gas canisters, destroying all but one of the planet's population of approximately 100 billion\u2014the largest genocide ever committed by the Empire to keep the weapon a secret."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Post-sterilization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 BBY, Saw Gerrera, the Spectres, and Captain Rex uncovered evidence that the Empire had perpetrated genocide against the Geonosian species. They also helped Klik-Klak, the sole survivor of the sterilization, escape with the last Geonosian queen egg into the depths of Geonosis. The rebels informed Senator Bail Organa and Commander Jun Sato who believed that news of the Empire's atrocities on Geonosis would sway more worlds to the rebellion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unfortunately for Klik-Klak, his plan didn't last. Although the egg did eventually hatch into a queen who called herself Karina, the last known Geonosian Queen was rendered sterile. Karina used the vast technological resources of Geonosis to attach herself to a portable droid factory. From this, she generated specially modified B1-series battle droids, which were made to resemble her people. Although they were artificial mockeries of the Geonosians, Karina considered them to be her children."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Karina ultimately lost this womb and many of her children when Darth Vader, accompanied by Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra, assassin droid 0-0-0, and BT-1 assassin droid BT-1, arrived and stole it from her in order to build his own droid army shortly after the destruction of the first Death Star. Even so, Karina survived the encounter and proclaimed that this set back would not be the end of her empire.

The basic design of the Geonosians originated from early designs of the Neimoidians which resembled B1 battle droids.
