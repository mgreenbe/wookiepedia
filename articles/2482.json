Based on an AT-AT frame, this vehicle was supported by two sturdy legs which angled down from either side of the cockpit. These flat boom-like spars terminated in a pontoon that allowed the waveskimmer to float on the water's surface. They also featured servomotors that could ensure the craft's pilot could position the pontoons in the same plane as the cockpit and react to the craft's acceleration lifting it off the surface to gain speed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The waveskimmers could carry seatroopers, stormtroopers, and cargo, and had a weapons-load consisting of two concussion missiles, two medium blaster cannons, and two light blaster cannons.
