Jesse was spared by his fellow clones, however, while Krell was revealed as a traitor to the Republic.

He served with the former Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano during the Siege of Mandalore, but then turned against her as a result of his secret programming which compelled him to comply with Order 66\u2014the command to exterminate the Jedi Order for treason. In the ensuing skirmish aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tribunal, Jesse took command of the division and demoted Commander Rex for refusing to execute Tano. Despite the lieutenant's efforts to carry out the will of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, Tano and Rex both survived by escaping from the Star Destroyer as it crashed on a moon, resulting in the deaths of Jesse and the other clones.

After they landed and overtook the Umbaran's initial position, command of the 501st was given to Jedi General Pong Krell when Anakin Skywalker was called back to Coruscant by order of the Jedi High Council.

Their advance ended in disaster, and the advancing squads retreated after suffering heavy losses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When they were ordered to take an Umbaran airbase, Krell commanded the troops to advance down a narrow gorge straight to the capital. This time a large portion of the men disagreed with the plan, with Jesse saying that Krell was crazy for telling them to advance without recon or air support, expressing that without knowing what they were up against, the casualties would be high. However, the clones were instructed by Rex to trust their leadership. Jesse held his ground against the Umbaran Militia's mobile heavy cannons while the clones took more heavy losses until Fives and Hardcase formed their own plan and were able to destroy them with commandeered Zenuas 33 Umbaran starfighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After establishing camp at the airbase, Krell sent Jesse to stack ordnance while Fives and Hardcase worked on the Umbaran starfighters, breaking the Umbarans' codes. By the time Jesse joined them, Krell had ordered a reckless attack on the capital in an attempt to quickly aid Kenobi and his forces. When the clones learned about the long-range missiles that were standing in their way, Jesse agreed with Fives that instead they could use the Umbaran starfighters to blow up the Separatist supply ship that was causing the problems instead of follow one of Krell's \"suicide missions\" through the missiles. However, when Krell refused to agree their plan, Jesse continued to work on the starfighters with Fives and Hardcase. However, Krell stopped them and insisted that they concentrate on their attack. Thus, Jesse, Fives, and Hardcase decided to attack the supply ship themselves, without Krell's support.

Fives was reluctant, but Jesse convinced him to leave by telling him that he knew Hardcase, and there wasn't any point in staying. Jesse and Fives made a narrow escape while Hardcase stayed behind to blow up the ship, sacrificing himself in the process. When Jesse and Fives got back, they were taken to General Krell, where he had them punished and sent to the brig."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rex unsuccessfully argued with Krell to release Jesse and Fives, resulting in Krell ordering their execution.

Jesse and Fives were held in the brig when the rest of the clones were sent out for battle, who had unknowingly been set up by Krell so that they would attack a platoon under \"Waxer\" and fire on their own men. When Rex and the 501st and 212th returned to arrest Krell, they freed Jesse and Fives along the way and gave them back their armor and weapons. Jesse, Rex, and the other clones then stormed the command center to arrest Krell for treason. However, Krell escaped into the jungle. Jesse, Rex, Fives and the other clones were then able to capture Krell, who revealed that he was a Separatist agent. Jesse then agreed with Fives and Rex that he should be executed.

The two were sitting at the bar when they were spotted by Fives, who was wanted for the attempted murder of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. Fives followed Kix into the refresher to give him coordinates to a location where he wanted to meet with Rex and Skywalker. Kix informed Rex and Skywalker of this, and they met Fives there, during which he was killed by the Coruscant Guard.

For the mission, Cody called for the help of Clone Force 99, nicknamed \"The Bad Batch,\" an elite group of clones with desirable genetic mutations. Rex and Cody then gathered Jesse and Kix to walk with them and greet the mutated clones for themselves.

Jesse then helped Rex and the Bad Batch invade the Anaxes Separatist Security Outpost before they abandoned it to break into a Separatist Cyber Center.

Jesse, along with several other clones, were on their way to reinforce the entry point on C-deck in the undercity of Sundari before Maul's forces attempted a counterattack against them. During the attack, Maul easily tore through their forces, asking about Tano as he did so.

Knowing this, Maul took Jesse alive to get information from him about Tano."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Being taken deeper in the undercity, Maul took Jesse to where his forces were hiding from the Mandalorian resistance and Grand Army of the Republic. Jesse was placed in stuncuffs and held in place by one of Maul's leaders, Rook Kast, and struggled while telling Maul that he wouldn't tell him anything. As Maul began to mention the plan laid out by Darth Sidious, Jesse began to ask what plan he was referring to. With this, Maul explained that the plan had a grand design which he had had a part to play in but was cast aside when he had fulfilled his purpose. After explaining this, Maul turned back towards Jesse and said that he needed some information from him, but Jesse, not knowing of Maul's capabilities with the Force, refused to tell him anything. As Maul fully turned towards him, Maul explained that his mind would speak to him or it would break, reaching his hand out and using the Force to probe his mind for information on Tano. As the interrogation continued, Jesse began to cry out in pain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the interrogation, Maul brought Jesse to the Sundari Royal Palace where he awaited the arrival of Tano, Kryze, and Rex. As they entered, Kryze rushed towards Maul and fired her blasters at him, but Maul effortlessly used the Force to push the blaster bolts aside before lifting Kryze into the air and dropping her. After this feeble attack, Maul used the Force to free Jesse of his stuncuffs and allowed him to return to his allies as a show of good faith towards them. Once he returned, he apologized for giving Maul information during his earlier interrogation.

However, during the voyage back to Coruscant to deliver the captive Maul to the Jedi Council in order to stand trial, Darth Sidious, whom Maul had been growing increasingly paranoid of, initiated Order 66, activating all the clones' inhibitor chips, including Jesse's. The clones immediately turned on Tano, led by Rex. Jesse entered the command room alongside a group of other troopers, opening fire on Tano, who was able to escape in the smoky haze caused by the firefight. Seeing Tano had escaped, Rex ordered Jesse and the other troopers to hunt Tano down, reminding them of the directive of Order 66."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly afterwards, Tano managed to capture Rex and remove his inhibitor chip. Free of his programming to kill Tano, he began aiding her in her escape and cut all contact with the other clones, leaving Jesse to organize the clone forces hunting her. After Tano and Rex's escape from the medical bay, Jesse was informed that \"Target 1\" was on the move and asked after Rex's whereabouts, a conversation overheard by Maul, who had been released by Tano as a diversion for the clones, on a stolen wrist comm. When told that he was still missing, Jesse asked if Rex had assisted in Tano's escape, but no one was certain if this had indeed occurred. Maul later destroyed the Tribunal's hyperdrive, setting it on a collision course with a moon. After Tano and Rex took over the hangar control room, Jesse was informed that the clones had lost contact. This led Jesse to order several units to meet him in the main hangar to cut off anyone trying to escape, as the ship's escape pods had been destroyed earlier.

Jesse told his men that anyone trying to escape would have to go through them. He was shortly informed that Maul was on his way to the hangar just before Rex entered, having apparently taken Tano prisoner and ordering the clones to hold their fire. Jesse ordered all other forces on the ship to converge on his position, before reminding Rex that he was under orders to execute Tano. Rex claimed he had the situation under control, and attempted to persuade Jesse that as Tano was no longer a Jedi, she was not technically a target of Order 66. Jesse reiterated that Rex himself had earlier said they were under special orders from Sidious to execute her.

Jesse himself was Force-pushed by Tano into the hole, but survived the fall and, after waking up, began shooting at Tano, who had herself been Force-pushed into the hole by Maul and been caught by a cable from RG-G1. Jesse ordered the attack to be redirected at the droids when he realized the elevator controls were locked. Tano and Rex were eventually forced to retreat to the repair level after Jesse's reinforcements arrived and Maul escaped, leading to the droids' destruction after they had launched the lifts back up to clear the level. He led one last assault on the two targets, but he was pushed back by Tano with the Force. At that point, lateral control of the ship was lost after the command bridge exploded, causing a chain reaction of destruction through the ship.
