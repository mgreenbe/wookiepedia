They contained a series of secondary focusing crystals that, when used, could catch an opponent off guard. This weapon type allowed a wielder to rotate the crystals into a new alignment with the push of a button to change the length of the lightsaber's blade. This generally caused an opponent's guard to falter momentarily as they adjusted to the new blade length, allowing the wielder to press the advantage while their opponent was confused."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
