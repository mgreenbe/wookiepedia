The planet was home to a primitive species and was hidden by a planetary cloaking device, established years ago by Jedi Master Broden Kel Verdox. After learning that others were possibly aware of the planet, the New Jedi Order sent Jaden Korr to either disable it for future use, or destroy it rather than let it fall into the wrong hands. Master Luke Skywalker heavily opinionated that it would be better to destroy the device."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving at the massive generator complex for the cloaking device, Korr was unexpectedly ambushed by Noghri Death Commandos, whom he defeated. As he explored further, he discovered that the Imperial Remnant and the Disciples of Ragnos forces were present as well, and they too were fighting the Noghri for the cloaking device. Korr decided it was better to destroy the device. Defeating both sides, Korr made his way up the complex by riding the air currents of the complex's ventilation fans. Once at the top, Korr dueled more New Reborn and Noghri before destroying the cloaking device by setting explosive charges."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After returning to the Jedi Academy, Skywalker suspected that Darth Vader, who enslaved many of the Noghri species and employed them as assassins and bodyguards, had ordered his Noghri Commandos to exterminate the Yalarans and guard the cloaking device. The remaining Noghri on Yalara were returned to their homeworld Honoghr."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
