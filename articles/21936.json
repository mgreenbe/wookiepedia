The Millennium Falcon, a YT-1300 light freighter owned by Han Solo, was equipped with two C5 emitters within the forward mandibles of the starship. Although the emitters were only capable of lifting 900kg at a range of 30 meters, Solo's co-pilot Chewbacca was skilled enough at the controls to capture falling bodies with the tractor beams."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
