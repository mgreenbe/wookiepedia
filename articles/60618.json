By 5 ABY, he served on the planet Dybbron III, which had split from the Empire's loyalists after the death of the Galactic Emperor in 4 ABY. That year, however, the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing, a unit serving under Colonel Soran Keize as part of the loyalist forces, sought to devastate the planet for going rogue. The fighter wing offered to accept willing recruits before the attack, and Heirorius willingly joined the unit to escape the destruction of civilization at Dybbron III."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Holding the rank of Lieutenant by that point, Heirorius was assigned to a comscan station at the bridge of the 204th's flagship, the bulk freighter Yadeez. The fighter wing soon traveled to the planet Fedovoi End, which had also split off from the Imperial loyalists under the rule of the breakaway faction Yomo Council. After the Yadeez and its escorts arrived before the world, Keize broadcast an announcement to Fedovoi End and Heirorius frequently looked over to Captain Oratio Nenvez."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the colonel asked if there was any reply from the planet, the lieutenant reported no reply, but added that there were energy spikes, which he suspected were ion cannons being powered up.

When the 204th attacked the planet, it sheltered under Chadawa's cage of mechanical planetary rings, sabotaging satellites which channeled radiation while Deliverance's wing attacked the unit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the fighting, Heirorius was at his station when Starfighter Commander Wyl Lark of the Deliverance's wing contacted the 204th.

The colonel and Lark then spoke, agreeing to have a one on one duel while their fighter wings held back.
