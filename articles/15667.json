Originally a shuttle pilot, he was brought into Twin Suns Squadron to pilot the B-wing that served as mobile command base for Sharr Latt to control the Goddess missile on the recommendation of Jagged Fel. Said missile was used to lure several Yuuzhan Vong pilots to their death, including formation leader Charat Kraal. He was selected over Zekk. Shortly before his tenure in Twin Suns Squadron at the Battle of Borleias, Beelyath helped rescue civilians that had been launched into space by the Yuuzhan Vong before they suffocated or burned up in Borleias' atmosphere."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
