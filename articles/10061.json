However, until the actual thick of combat, the fact that the armor of an AT-AT walker was too strong for the snowspeeders' laser cannons was unknown."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tactic consisted of a formation of snowspeeders approaching the enemy walkers in a single-file formation to give the enemy a single target. When the speeders reached optimal firing range, the lead speeder would fire before peeling off in one direction. While an AT-AT could only track a single speeder, the rest of the squadron would be able to approach relatively safely, each with a clear shot before parting in different directions. This tactic was used to great effect against the AT-ATs during the Battle of Hoth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 24 ABY it was also used by the New Republic in the Battle of the Emperor's Plague Storehouse."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
