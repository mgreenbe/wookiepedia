In the aftermath of the Battle on Had Abbadon, the acolyte was looking after Darth Krayt's Hands, Darth Stryfe and Darth Talon, who were being healed in bacta tanks located in the Healing Chambers of the Korriban Sith Temple. He witnessed Lord Stryfe breaking out of the tank when the latter became aware that he no longer sensed the constant presence of Darth Krayt through the Force. Stryfe wrathfully grabbed the acolyte by the robe, demanding to know where Krayt was. In answer, the terrified acolyte pointed in the direction of the chamber holding the Dark Lord in stasis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
