Each player picks a piece and uses the character that the piece represents. Another player draws a card and asks a question if the piece is on a regular square. If the person answers it correctly, then they get to go again. Once they get an answer wrong, play passes to the next player. Like classic Trival Pursuit, when a player lands on a pie square, another player asks a question from the color. If they answer it wrong, they do not get the pie. If they get it right, they place the corresponding color pie into the small slot on their piece's base. Once the player collects all six pies, they travel to the center, where they started, and answer a final question. If they answer correctly, they win."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Classic trilogy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The four pieces that come with the game are Leia Organa Solo, Han Solo, Darth Vader, and Luke Skywalker.
