However, when the two became Force Hounds, Xesh defeated Trill in battle, and he refused to kill his former brood mate\u2014instead, he proposed that she be given to Tul'kar's rival and superior, Skal'nas. Believing this to be a betrayal on Xesh's part, Trill grew to hate her former brood mate, and she maintains a fierce rivalry with Xesh. Trill is sent to the Tython system by Skal'nas to locate the Devourer, and she uses her bond with Xesh to follow him to the system. Trill rescues the Je'daii Journeyer Sek'nos Rath from death on Krev Coeur, and proceeds to pose as a simple ship thief while aiding the Je'daii in pursuing Xesh. Trill's true purpose in the Tython system is to confirm that Xesh does not remember Trill thanks to Skal'nas's manipulations, and she sends word to her Predor that the Tython system is ready for the taking in the days after Daegen Lok's capture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trill continues spying for Skal'nas during the year-long invasion.

At Celebration V in August 2010, John Ostrander and Jan Duursema, longtime collaborators and the author-artist pair behind Legacy, announced that they were working on a new comic that was different from anything they had written for Star Wars before.

At Comic Con, it was announced that like Legacy, Dawn of the Jedi would feature a large cast of species-diverse characters, but would primarily focus on the Tython system instead of the larger galaxy. A preview issue 0, serving as an official guide for readers much like Star Wars: Legacy 0, was announced with a release date of February 1 at Comic Con, and the first issue's release date was set for February 15.

John Ostrander and Jan Duursema wrote the story for the series, while Ostrander penned the script and Duursema pencilled the artwork. Dan Parsons was the inker, Michael Heisler was the letterer, and Wes Dzioba handled coloring duties.

The series is set in an era that was largely unexplored\u2014Dawn of the Jedi necessitated the creation of an entirely new publishing era, \"Before the Republic\"\u2014and builds off what little information existed before hand: namely, the fact that the Jedi Order was established on the planet Tython in the Deep Core, the conflicts known as the Force Wars began in the year 25,793 BBY and the early Jedi left Tython after the Force Wars and migrated to Ossus. Dawn of the Jedi also expands on the Rakata, a species that ruled the galaxy before the Republic and was introduced in the 2003 Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic video game. Dawn of the Jedi has encountered relatively few contradictions in continuity, but there are elements in the Star Wars: The Old Republic video game, which was released shortly before Dawn of the Jedi, that contradict the series."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Old Republic gives a loose summary of the Force Wars, claiming that they were a conflict between the followers of Rajivari, one of the four members of the first Jedi Council, and the rest of the Jedi Order. Dawn of the Jedi initially did not reference any of the characters or elements introduced in The Old Republic, but The Prisoner of Bogan saw the appearance of both Rajivari and Ters Sendon, another member of the Jedi Council in the game. However, another contradiction that has not been addressed is the issue of the Mother Machine, which is a Rakatan computer that claims to be responsible for the creation of a number of Force-sensitive species in its efforts to restore the Force-sensitivity of the Rakata species during the Rakatan Civil War. Among those species it claims responsibility for are the Twi'leks and the Zabrak, but Dawn of the Jedi depicts a relatively advanced Twi'lek society on Ryloth as well as numerous Zabrak in 36,453 BBY, thousands of years before the collapse of the Infinite Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When developing the ships, characters, and environments for the series, Jan Duursema was forced to virtually work from scratch, as very little of Before the Republic had been depicted previously. Duursema purposely differentiated the Je'daii from the Jedi in their appearance, exchanging lightsabers for the swords they were known to use at the time and replacing the traditional robes with more individualized armor and clothing. Unlike her work on Star Wars: Legacy, Duursema was unable to build on existing designs for ships and technology, and instead she worked from a \"retrofitting\" mindset, developing ships and technology that would eventually give rise to the technology of the modern Star Wars era. Duursema and Ostrander also created the worlds of the Tython system from scratch, choosing to focus only on the Tython system instead of using pre-existing locations from across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dawn of the Jedi has also received a tie-in novel entitled Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void, which was written by Tim Lebbon and begins just days before the events of Force Storm 2.
