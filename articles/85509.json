After Maizor lost a confrontation with Jabba, the Hutt had the B'omarr Monks\u2014who shared his palace with him\u2014place Maizor's brain into the nutrient jar of a BT-16 perimeter droid, where he remained as a joke to the denizens of Jabba's Palace. It took over a year for Maizor to adjust enough to experience sensory input again. After the death of Jabba, Maizor remained at the palace, learning solace from the Monks. Due to his hatred of the Hutts, he later told Han Solo and Luke Skywalker of the Besadii search for Jabba's old Imperial records."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
