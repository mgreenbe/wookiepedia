It harboured many Imperial luxury transports for the higher ups in the Empire. In 3 ABY, the Rebel Alliances 61st Mobile Infantry carried out Operation Ringbreaker where they attacked many Imperial places including Mardona III, Xagobah and Sullust. The Dockyards of Najan-Rovi were one of the early targets and the Sixty-First came with their CR90 corvette Thunderstrike, its escort the Braha'tok-class gunship Apailana's Promise and two X-wing starfighters. The dockyards lacked a stormtrooper battalion and relied on Imperial Navy troopers and TIE fighters and it fell in less than a day. The Sixty-First left what was left of it with almost a hundred burning luxury transports."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
