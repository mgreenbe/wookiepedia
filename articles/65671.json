The protocol overrode all previous directives given to a droid and established a new priority protocol. In 0 BBY, it was invoked by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin to order the MSE-6 series repair droid designated MSE-6-G735Y to shunt instructions and subroutines to his personal ephemeradata-neurocloud rather than conducting routine uplinks or geosyncing with the Imperial network. After carrying out instructions, the droid was required to expunge all associated records from its memory. The droid thus experienced memory gaps regarding the stormtrooper TK-421's visits with Tarkin in the officer's quarters located in Sector GM1-A of the Death Star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
