Ingey had a playful demeanor and once caused a ruckus by scurrying across the shoulders of the protocol droid, C-3PO. The animal's presence caused the droid to topple backwards, upsetting a tray full of food. When Coby was nine years old, he was enrolled in the Imperial Academy. Pilot Jann Tosh escorted the boy to a space port on Chuzalla. A group of brigands known as the Starhunter's Intergalactic Menagerie abducted the rare and valuable Ingey, and brought him to Dandelo. Coby and Tosh, along with C-3PO and R2-D2, followed the Starhunters and rescued Ingey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
