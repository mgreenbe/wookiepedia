Amador lay at the junction of a hyperlane that connected the Coth Fuuras system and the planet Nessem and a second route that linked it to the Drearia system. Sometime between 3665 and 3653 BBY, a battle was fought on Amador during the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, where the Chagrian soldier Fideltin Rusk defended the entrance of a fortress on Amador from a much larger force of Imperial soldiers. Over three thousand years later, a group of Human colonists on Mayvitch 7 were wiped out by the Yinchorri species during the Yinchorri Uprising of 33 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amador was first mentioned in the 2000 comic Jedi Council: Acts of War 1, where the world's moon Mayvitch 7 is attacked by the Yinchorri.
