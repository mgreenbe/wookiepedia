He left his Imperial headquarters on Naboo to make a brief stop on Talus. Coincidentally, just as he arrived, the Rebel forces were launching a counterattack on Imperial forces. The Imperial forces were forced to retreat after an unsuccessful assault on the Talus Rebel base, and were now being relentlessly retaliated against by the Rebellion. Sinkko's insights and immediate grasp of the situation were impressive. At the first sound of alarm, he immediately jumped into the fray of the battle and began organizing the defenses.
