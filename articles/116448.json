While providing little protection, they were the most common form of clothing among the Worker caste, the Shamed Ones, and Familiars. They essentially appeared to be a thick, jelly-like cloth. They could be ripped into shreds but would continue to grow, which allowed other items of clothing to be woven from them. Robeskins fed on the sweat and oils released by the wearer, and could also help the healing process if their wearer was injured, by feeding on necrotic flesh, and pathogens. Jacen Solo loved the Robeskin, Vergere had packed for him, as it was self cleaning and even made himself some makeshift socks from the skin that also never wore out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
