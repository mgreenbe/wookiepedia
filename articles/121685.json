They crash landed into the lava covering the planet. The Rebels finally dug their way out of the hardened lava only to be captured by Major Wil'm Grau and his men. The Imperials were without a ship, and Grau agreed to search the planet together under a banner of truce. The team finally found a destroyed Rebel archaeologist camp which had been working on an underground tunnel. The entire team decided to search the tunnel.

There, Leia found strange markings on the walls of the city. She felt like she was familiar with them, but didn't know how. Leia, walking alone on a bridge, was attacked by the Sentinel creature. Luke rescued her by pushing Leia off the bridge, causing the both of them to fall off of the bridge. They were soon reunited with the group. After a hunt in which the Sentinel almost killed the team, Leia Organa found the source of the Sentinel's power in the Alashan control center. Upon destroying the structure, they were able to destroy the Sentinel. After digging out of the rubble, the team boarded the Staraker and Organa offers Grau a place in the Rebellion. However, he declined, leaving the ship in a scoutboat. As the Humans left the planet, the destroyed underground city came to life and a cryptic laughing resounded through the complex."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grau and Anarine then left the world in the Staraker with the Rebels, where Organa offered Grau a position in the Rebel Alliance.
