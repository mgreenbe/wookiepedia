After the military personal consisting of officers, pilots, and soldiers were rained dry from the squabbling of Imperial warlords, Thrawn set out to find new ways to regain the military strength the Empire once had. After discovering a secret storehouse on the planet Wayland established by Emperor Palpatine, Thrawn was able to add thousands of Spaarti cloning cylinders to remake new personal. Thrawn was able to select several templates, from the legendary Baron Soontir Fel, Lieutenant Creb the commanding officer of Black Wing Squadron, the ruthless Corporal Terkuss, and famed Imperial hero General Maximilian Veers. Thrawn also attempted to create a super-commando based project, selecting Grodin Tierce as a perfect subject. Thrawn desired a soldier, with his tactical brilliance and a well trained physical trooper. But, Thrawn left the project after losing hope."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Templates"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
