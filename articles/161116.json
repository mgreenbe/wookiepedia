After they had returned to base, his comrade Grondorn Muse discovered that he had forgotten his kloo horn out in the wildness. Dunker went back to retrieve it but got lost in the wild because of his poor sense of direction and had to call Muse for help. Muse hired a spacer to find Dunker and escort him back to the city."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vincol Dunker was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. Due to the nature of many older quests in Star Wars Galaxies, the species and appearance of Vincol Dunker changed each time a player performed this quest. Therefore, it is impossible to verify the canonical species of Dunker. However, the quest dialogue given by Muse indicated that Vincol Dunker was a male. Although not mentioned in the quest dialogue, examining Dunker consistently identified him as an assassin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
