Led by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and his subordinate, Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex,\" Torrent Company fought to reclaim the planet from the Separatist Droid Army. During the campaign, they served alongside the troopers of the 212th Attack Battalion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Christophsis, Torrent Company sustained heavy casualties as they fought to defend the AV-7 Anti-vehicle Artillery Cannons from the Separatist forces protected by a deflector shield. Their strategy enabled Skywalker and his new apprentice, Ahsoka Tano, to infiltrate enemy lines and disable the shield generator. Without the shield, the Armored Assault Tanks were destroyed by the heavy cannons. The subsequent arrival of Republic reinforcements, led by Grand Master Yoda of the Jedi Order, resulted in the surrender of the remaining Separatist forces on Christophsis."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Teth"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the Republic victory on Christophsis, Yoda ordered Skywalker and his mentor, General Obi-Wan Kenobi to investigate the abduction of Rotta, son of the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. The search for the Huttlet led Skywalker and Torrent Company to Teth, a planet located in the Wild Space territory. They launched a direct assault on the B'omarr Order Monastery, but were overwhelmed by two Separatist battalions led by the assassin Asajj Ventress. However, Rex and the remaining soldiers of Torrent Company continued to fight the battle droids while Skywalker and Tano rescued Rotta. Although neither Skywalker or his apprentice were able to assist the clones due to the importance of the mission, the arrival of Kenobi and the 212th turned the tide of battle in the Republic's favor."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Horain"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the Clone Wars by the time Phase II clone trooper armor was implemented, Torrent Company participated in the Battle of Horain against the Separatists. During the battle, Captain Rex and Torrent Company encountered a group of Horian children in a crater, but although he helped them escape, Rex was separated from the rest of his forces and was alone. After attempting to contact General Skywalker, Rex was aided by General Kenobi who came to his rescue while both were being surrounded by B1-series battle droids. In the ensuing firefight, the Separatist droid B1-0516 received damage to its central processing unit, causing it to lose base programming. As a result, it began to aid Rex and Kenobi, and after being briefly captured, all returned to Republic forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
