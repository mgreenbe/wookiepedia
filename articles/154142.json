After a recent attack on the Coruscant power generator, Confederacy Head of State, Count Dooku contacted the Senate and angrily informed them of a Republic attack that took the lives of many. As a result, he pulled back the peace proposal which Padm\u00e9 Amidala had recently erected with the help of her Separatist friend, Mina Bonteri, who according to Dooku, had been among the victims of the Republic attack. After Dooku ended contact, the Nikto senator shouted that the Republic must remain strong and not show any weakness which was backed up by numerous other senators."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
