Katarn then activated a laser turret and used it to blast the sealed entrance open. Upon successfully infiltrating the base, Ors remained in the control room to search the computer database for useful information. In the meantime, Katarn explored all three sections of the base and wiped out all the Imperial forces he encountered. At one point, when he called Ors over to another section to help him crack a code, she was attacked and pinned down by Imperial forces until he returned in the nick of time to save her.
