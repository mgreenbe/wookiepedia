It was traveling from Corsin with approximately ten thousand beings aboard when it was pulled out of hyperspace in the Obroa-skai system by an Imperial flotilla commanded by Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, who had ordered the hyperspace interdiction as part of his effort to recapture his personal starship, the Carrion Spike, that had been stolen by rebels. The Stellar Vista, unable to maneuver or check its position, subsequently collided with the flotilla's Detainer CC-2200 interdictor. The Imperial vessel's sharp bow pierced the stern of the luxury liner, causing heavy damage, which prompted the ship's evacuation using its complement of lifeboats and escape pods, while the captain frantically requested assistance from the Imperial ships present."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the collision, which was estimated to have claimed around 1,100 lives, the wreck of the Stellar Vista was towed to the planet of Obroa-skai for repairs.
