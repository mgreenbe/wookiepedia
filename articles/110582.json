However, Wroth, who harbored a deep desire for the Sith to focus on leaving Kesh, took the opportunity to put into action a secret plan\u2014in order to create the appearance of a deadly virus that would hopefully cause the Sith to withdraw from Keshiri society, Wroth decided to poison the water supply of the village of Tetsubal and kill the whole Keshiri population there. While Wroth effected the deadly deed on Tetsubal, Rabolow was visited by members of Wroth's retinue. After the disaster at Tetsubal, Yaru Korsin's wife Seelah discovered that Wroth's complicity in the deaths. Hoping to rid Kesh of Wroth and his like, Seelah decided to frame Wroth for similar deaths in other towns visited by his people.
