The poster protested the Galactic Empire's use of forced conscription into their military on some worlds. The piece used the Sith Lord Darth Vader as a central element as he had overseen the subjugation of Riosa and the impressment of its population into labor camps. The poster, aside from Vader's presence, also featured silhouettes of Stormtroopers rounding up several aliens, and had text stating \"Conscripted to the Service of the Empire\" up top, with \"the Empire\" being enlarged, and \"What Will You Do When It Happens Here?\" on the bottom, with \"You\" being highlighted red."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
