It was a seedy place which made the roughest cantina on Tolea Biqua look nice. It had a circular bar in the middle staffed by the bartender Garnt, and had a perpetually hazy atmosphere. Gambling was popular within, with games being run at most of the tables, be it sabacc or other forms such as the chip-shuffling game run by Luco. Vel Pastar could typically be found seated in the deepest, darkest table in the cantina, with his daughter Kor doing recon for him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
