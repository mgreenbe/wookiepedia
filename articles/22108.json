An example of the CLL-8 was QT-QC."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Binary load lifters were infamous for their grievous stupidity, but this limitation was more than matched by their extreme strength. One CLL-8 ignored the fact that the floor it was piling boxes on was creaking, and even after the whole corner crashed to the next level, it continued to pile on more boxes. CLL-8's were very easy to program and were completely obedient, but they lacked the intelligence to anticipate and react to different situations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These droids communicated in a simple binary language; as a result, they could only understand the simplest of verbal commands from their masters. Translator droids such as the 3PO-series (also designed by Cybot Galactica) were often employed to program the CLL-8's for the owners."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Design"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even though artificial intelligence had increased impressively since the creation of the CLL-8, Cybot Galactica saw no reason to alter the original design as the droid remained reliable and efficient. The droids were a low-cost, automated replacement for more traditional methods of cargo transportation and quickly became successful in spaceports, factories and other such industrial workplaces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The CLL-8 resembled a biped walker similar to the Imperial AT-ST, and at 3 meters tall, they were significantly taller than most other two-legged droids. Its limbs were reinforced with durasteel and were powered by hydraulic mechanisms which allowed it to transport heavy loads with ease. The droid couldn't discern its center of gravity when working with particularly heavy loads so gyro-stabilizers helped it to keep its balance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Its wide \"hands\" could carry up to several tons without straining their hydraulic pivots. A primitive photoreceptor scanner was placed upon the CLL-8's head which allowed the droid to see and identify its cargo. A hard armor covered the droid, ensuring that it would last for a long time by protecting the droid from the inevitable scratches and dents associated with hard labor and also by preventing it from doing too much damage to itself because of its inherent stupidity. The fact that CLL-8's had managed to stay relatively intact and were still going about their tasks undaunted said a lot about the foresight of Cybot Galactica."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The series was used aboard the Death Star I."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Yavin, CLL-8 binary load lifters were used by the Valarian criminals in their smuggling depot on Tatooine; and by the Talusian Smugglers in their base on Talus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
