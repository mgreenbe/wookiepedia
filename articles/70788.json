Jesters frequently wore outlandish costumes while performing. The Alanciari, Keshiri inhabitants of the continent Alanciar on the planet Kesh, used jesters in their decennial Observance Day celebrations. The Serps of the planet Serphidi employed jesters in the castle of the King. The Yuuzhan Vong also had jesters composed of those of low class, a notable example being Onimi, who was secretly the mastermind behind the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion. A similar occupation to a jester is a clown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
