Geri served the rebels as a mech-tech, and he constructed the droid Candy to aid the resistance group, by combining the head of an RX-Series pilot droid with the body of a P2-series astromech droid. In about 18 BBY, Geri encountered the Sullustan Den Dhur and the droid I-5YQ\u2014agents of the Whiplash resistance group\u2014after they arrived at Cor's resistance base on business with the Toprawan rebels. Geri helped to repair several droids for use by I-5YQ, to replace the Whiplash agent's original 5YQ-series chassis, which had became irreparably damaged during an encounter with Imperial forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
