Solo was still living in the hut by 28 ABY. He was still very young at that point, neither a child nor an adult, and torn between the light within himself and the temptation of the dark side. Having grown to suspect the dark side's influence over his nephew, Skywalker decided to enter Solo's hut while he was asleep. He used the Force to look inside Solo's mind, and foresaw that Solo would destroy everything that he cared about. Skywalker believed that what he saw would come to pass, aware of Solo's potential as a scion of the Skywalker bloodline. Driven by pure instinct, he ignited his lightsaber to strike down Solo, only to hesitate and realize that he could not kill the son of his twin sister, Princess Leia Organa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Skywalker felt shame for contemplating this action, it was an unforgiveable act of betrayal to Solo, who was surprised and alarmed to see that his master had come into his chambers, at night, armed with a lightsaber. Through the Force, Solo sensed that he was in danger, and while he saw the expression of regret on Skywalker's face, he believed that his uncle had gone too far to hesitate or falter in striking down his nephew. Solo summoned his own lightsaber, which had been resting beside his calligraphy set, out of desperation, attempting to block what he saw as a killing blow from his master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using the brief reprieve he gained from their blades locking, Solo telekinetically pulled the ceiling down, causing the stones to come crashing down on his uncle. Solo was the first to emerge from the wreckage of his hut; filled with rage, he inadvertently created a powerful lightning storm above the temple, resulting in the facility's destruction along with the apprentices inside. Skywalker also survived, but by the time he emerged from the ruins of his nephew's hut, Solo had disappeared and the the temple was in flames."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
