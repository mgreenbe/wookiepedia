In 4 ABY, the ship was part of the Imperial fleet over the moon of Endor, defending the Empire's battle station, the second Death Star. At that time, the Death Star and its fleet were attacked by the Rebel Alliance, who intended to destroy the station. During the battle, TIE fighter pilots inadvertently allowed a rebel to inflict damage on Subjugator, causing Imperial Commander Ciena Ree to angrily order her fellow pilots to cover the vessel's engines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle was later lost after the rebels destroyed the space station, although the Subjugator survived. Following the battle, the TIE pilot Nash Windrider was posted aboard the ship, where he rarely heard from his friend Ciena Ree. Windrider had left the craft before the Battle of Jakku of 5 ABY, to serve as the flight commander on Ree's Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Inflictor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Subjugator was mentioned in the 2015 young-adult novel Lost Stars, by Claudia Gray."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
