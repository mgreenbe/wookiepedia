However, Maul's takeover of the Mandalorian warrior group Death Watch led one of the splinter group's lieutenants, Bo-Katan Kryze, to form the Mandalore resistance, a rebel group that opposed Maul's leadership.

For their part, Jedi Generals like Kenobi and Mace Windu were determined not to let Mandalore fall to the Confederacy of Independent Systems. To that end, Kenobi and Windu led a Republic offensive against Maul and his Shadow Collective; however, Maul remained at large.

In his absence, Skywalker split the 501st Legion and allocated his former apprentice a division which included the 332nd Company of clone troopers, who had repainted their helmets to match her facial markings, showing their loyalty and appreciation towards her. To get around the fact that Tano, having left the Jedi Order, was no longer part of the Republic Military and thus could not officially be placed in command of the unit, Skywalker promoted Clone Captain Rex, an old friend of Tano's, to Commander and officially designated her as an advisor.

In Skywalker's case, Maul wished him dead in order to take revenge on Sidious, as his visions had revealed to him that the Dark Lord was grooming Skywalker to be his next apprentice.

Kryze retorted that she did not care and that she was coming for him since he was a puppet of Maul.

When Tano asked if Skywalker could reinforce her, Kenobi asked to speak to Tano alone. After Rex and Kryze had stepped away, Kenobi told Tano that Skywalker had been assigned to, effectively, spy on the Supreme Chancellor as the Jedi were suspicious of his motives, since the Galactic Senate had allowed him to stay in power long beyond his allotted term. Tano pointed out that Skywalker could not be happy with this mission as the Chancellor was an old friend and mentor of his, and Kenobi said that that was why it would be a good idea for her to speak with her former master.

Tano considered the offer as the windows on one side of the room were shattered in by the fighting outside, and agreed, on the condition that Maul answer one question: what did he want with Skywalker?
