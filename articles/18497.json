Originating on the Core World Alderaan, a small branch of the family, consisting of Ottoh and Erika Blythe and their children Ronn and Bailen, relocated to the Outer Rim planet Elphrona to live a simpler life. However, they were then targeted for kidnapping by members of the Nihil pirates so they could be ransomed to their wealthy relatives. The true purpose of the raid, however, was to capture a Jedi, as Elphrona was known to host an outpost of the Jedi Order. Erika, Ronn and Bailen were rescued by the Jedi Porter Engle, Indeera Stokes and Bell Zettifar, but Jedi Master Loden Greatstorm was captured while attempting to rescue Ottoh. Subsequently, Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro killed Ottoh, as Ro had the Jedi prisoner he had wanted. Erika and her children moved back to live with their relatives on Alderaan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
