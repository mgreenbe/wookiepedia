The Confederacy was established by the former Jedi Count Dooku of Serenno, who served as its Head of State. The Confederacy was founded on the grounds of excessive taxation and corruption within the Republic Senate and general feeling of dissatisfaction towards and neglect by the Republic-centric Core Worlds. In addition, the Confederacy was secretly supported by several corporations, including the Trade Federation, headed by Viceroy Nute Gunray; the InterGalactic Banking Clan, headed by Chairman San Hill; the Techno Union, headed by Foreman Wat Tambor; the Geonosians, headed by Prime Leader Poggle the Lesser; the Commerce Guild, headed by Presidente Shu Mai; the Corporate Alliance, headed by Magistrate Passel Argente; and the Retail Caucus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Separatist Crisis that began in 24 BBY led to a political crisis in which tensions escalated between the newly-formed Confederacy and the reigning Republic. Many in the Confederacy, such as the Separatist Senate did not wish to fight, as they simply wanted to be free of what they saw as the corruption of the Republic. However in 22 BBY, the Confederacy and the Republic went to war using their respective military forces\u2014the droid army and the Republic clone army\u2014resulting in a pan-galactic conflict for the first time in a millennium."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The following three years saw the Clone Wars raging across the galaxy with the Separatists rapidly attempting to bring the Republic to its knees. Unknown to the majority of the galaxy, however, the war was merely a ploy\u2014Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, the leader of the Republic, was a Sith Lord called Darth Sidious, who controlled the Separatists as Dooku's Sith Master, and therefore influenced both sides in the war. By 19 BBY, the Confederacy suffered several major defeats in the Outer Rim Sieges as the end of the war approached, on top of losing a third of their fleet in the decisive and devastating Battle of Coruscant. After Dooku's death, and Supreme Commander General Grievous's subsequent defeat on Utapau, the Executive Separatist Council was executed on Mustafar. With the subsequent shutdown of the droid army, the Confederacy rapidly collapsed as the war came to an end. Following the end of hostilities, trade groups that had supported the cause were nationalized, and its remaining star systems reabsorbed into the Republic's successor state, the Galactic Empire, ruled by Emperor Sheev Palpatine, while some elements of the droid army fragmented into several holdouts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early foundations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For one thousand years, the galaxy had been governed through the Galactic Republic. A democratic union centered on the capital world of Coruscant, the Republic was governed by the Galactic Senate led by an elected Supreme Chancellor. With the assistance of the Jedi Order acting as peacekeepers, the Republic enjoyed a millennium without large-scale war. However, as time went on, the government of the Republic became weak and corrupt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this era of peace, heightening political tensions arose within the Republic a decade before the Clone Wars, such as when a group of usurpers on the planet Halcyon became discontent with the world's membership and wanted their world to be able to manage its own affairs. They kidnapped several members of Halcyon's planetary leadership and held them in a remote fortress where they prepared for assault while attempting negotiation with their hostages. Internal negotiations failed and led the Senate to eventually authorize the Jedi Order to intervene on Halcyon as mediators and enforcers if necessary."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Invasion of Naboo by the Trade Federation exposed the unwillingness and inability of the Senate to resolve the crisis, which ended only after the Gungans and Royal House of Naboo united and forcibly ended the occupation. This lack of action was a result of years of corrupt and ineffectual governance by the Republic that had became mired in bureaucracy and layers upon layers of increasingly complex legal precedents, treaties, and obligations. The commerce guilds and trading corporations had also become disillusioned after laws were passed that would introduce taxes affecting all significant trade routes, implemented such that they would have the greatest impact on the poorer outlying star systems. These worlds were often forced into accepting one-sided deals and refused military protection, as the Republic continued to prioritize honoring centuries old agreements predating the admission of outlying planets. Compounding this, the outlying systems and Rimward trade routes were plagued by pirates, hijackers and slavers. Due to the refusal of the Republic to create a military to police those sectors, the Judicial Department was completely overwhelmed, and could not adequately protect either the worlds along those trade routes, or the cargo vessels that traversed them. This forced outlying systems to begin creating their own militias to deal with the pirates, with the Outland Regions Security Force being foremost among them. Gridlock in the senate grew, as the number of votes needed to pass any type of legislation turned it increasingly into a place where senators bartered favors, earmarks, and votes for personal power without regard for their constituencies or the greater good of the Republic. Some began to believe that any attempt at change would require radical thinking and extreme actions, leading to discussions of secession from the Republic."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Secession from the Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first declaration of secession could be traced back to Count Dooku's Raxus Address, when the count denounced the Galactic Republic as a futile enterprise that was hopelessly burdened by corruption and favoritism toward the Core Worlds. Following the address, Dooku founded the Confederacy of Independent Systems and began the Separatist Crisis, to do this he had commandeered a HoloNet relay station in the Raxus system, after which some believed he was merely one step ahead of Republic assassins. The fallen Jedi Master's words of inflammatory rhetoric would find receptive audiences among young intellectuals in Mid and Inner Rim universities. Both charismatic and exuding confidence, Dooku's message rallied thousands of individuals by recounting decades of experience within the Republic government and publicizing its hypocrisies, corruption and ineffectiveness. Dooku's rebellious message mesmerized young psyches and spurred them into political activism. As the galactic crisis grew more and more heated, Dooku's appearances grew rarer and were announced with much shorter notice, with his message often spurning violence on polarized worlds. Thousands of disgruntled star systems ultimately seceded from the Republic and fully embraced the newly created Confederacy of Independent Systems fiery message of resistance. The idea that the Republic was distant, dispassionate, corrupt, and unworthy of membership ultimately marshaled disgruntled systems into a new galactic government. The agrarian world of Ukio found itself questioning what value it reciprocated for being the breadbasket of the Core Worlds, and after citing a litany of neglect, senatorial representatives of the Abrion sector tendered their articles of secession along with other worlds in the galaxy's hinterlands. The Confederacy also sought to gain prosperous Outer Rim world of Eriadu. With its location at the confluence of the Hydian Way and Rimma Trade Route, Dooku needed Eriadu's allegiance to control the Greater Seswenna and effectively collapse the core back onto itself, undoing millennia of galactic exploration, conquest and colonization. After negotiations and attending dinners with Eriadu's then Governor Wilhuff Tarkin, the attempt to claim Eriadu's loyalty would fail, as Tarkin refused, believing that an ineffective yet unified galaxy was better than a fractured one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Separatist Crisis intensifying as more systems pledged loyalty to the Dooku separatist government across the galaxy, caused uncertainty and fears that the Republic would be split into two, the Senate of the Republic moved towards the passage of the Military Creation Act, which would establish centralized armed forces to protect the thousand-year-old democracy for the first time. Meanwhile, Dooku had promised the Viceroy Nute Gunray that he would assassinate Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo if he signed Dooku's treaty. The Viceroy accepted the offer and Dooku dispatched Jango Fett to carry out Amidala's assassination. Despite the failure of Fett's mission, Dooku was able to persuade the Trade Federation, the InterGalactic Banking Clan, the Techno Union, the Commerce Guild and the Corporate Alliance all sign a treaty on Geonosis and joined together as the Executive Separatist Council. After pursuing Fett to Geonosis, Kenobi discovered Dooku's plot and also learned that it was Gunray who ordered the assassination of Amidala. He was captured shortly thereafter and imprisoned by Dooku, but not before sending a message to the Jedi Council relating what he had discovered. Meanwhile tensions between the Republic and Separatist movement peaked after the Republic learned of the size and significance of its army of battle droids, motivating the Senate to grant emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic\u2014a position that was then occupied by Sheev Palpatine, the alter ego of Darth Sidious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the attempted execution of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, a team of two hundred Jedi were sent to the arena to rescue the trio. The Jedi were attacked by a host of battle droids during the attempt and were corralled into the arena. With the battle turning against the Jedi, Dooku gave the remaining Jedi forces a chance to lay down their arms, a choice which Mace Windu declined. In the next few moments, several Acclamator-class assault ships arrived over the arena and engaged droid forces on the planet's surface, starting the deadly three-year Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Attacking the Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The arrival of the clones sparked a full-scale battle on Geonosis, with both sides taking heavy losses.

As the battle raged on, Kenobi and Skywalker caught up to Dooku and tried to prevent his escape by engaging in a lightsaber duel, however they were defeated by Dooku with relative ease. Grand Master Yoda came to their rescue and engaged Dooku in a lightsaber battle. After realizing that he was outmatched by Yoda, Dooku fled Geonosis and the Separatist leadership retreated. Though they had suffered a defeat in battle, the goal of the Sith had been fulfilled; the Clone Wars had begun.

Some of the neutral worlds banded together into a loose alliance, The Council of Neutral Systems, for mutual negotiation and defense; this was officially merely an advisory group, not a breakaway government. Both sides negotiated with the neutral worlds, with the Republic trying to bring worlds back into the fold willingly if they had not declared for the Separatists due to fears that taking action against ostensibly non-hostile worlds would only increase sympathy for the separatist cause."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The war proceeded on many fronts. A force led by Asajj Ventress and General Whorm Loathsom succeeded in capturing Christophsis. After taking the planet, they targeted a small relief force led by Senator Bail Organa, but the Confederate occupation was eventually defeated by Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Skywalker's Padawan, Commander Ahsoka Tano, and their clone troopers. Later on Teth in Wild Space, the Separatists hatched a plot to deny the Jedi the alliance with the Hutt Clan that they so desperately needed and to establish an alliance with the Hutts themselves. Republic forces attempted to save Rotta, the infant son of crime lord Jabba the Hutt, from the Confederacy, who planned to kill the Huttlet and lay the blame on the Jedi Order. However, Skywalker and Tano, effected a rescue of the Huttlet from Teth and return him to Tatooine, thus gaining the support of the Hutts for the Republic. After the annihilation of the Republic garrison, Ryloth was occupied and blockaded by the Separatist Droid Army. The army was led by Emir Wat Tambor who oversaw the occupation from the city of Lessu. During the occupation, much of Ryloth was pillaged by the droid army on orders from the Emir. CIS forces were repeatedly attacked by a group of Twi'lek freedom fighters led by Cham Syndulla, but suffered minimal losses. Eventually, the Republic Army assembled a force to liberate the planet, a goal they accomplished after heavy fighting.

The ship gained the attention of the Republic after destroying the fleet of Jedi General Plo Koon in the Battle of Abregado. Koon was marooned in an escape pod and rescued by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker. Separatist Head of State then ordered Grievous to use the ship to attack an unarmed Republic medical center near the Ryndellia system.

Due to the low number of military forces on the planet, the Republic forces were quickly overwhelmed and, in the face of certain defeat, authorized the use of an experimental Electro-proton bomb. In the ensuing blast, the droid army was shut down and the battle won for the Republic. The leaders of Malastare then proceeded to sign the treaty with the Republic. However, a setback occurred when the plan by the InterGalactic Banking Clan and the Separatists to build massive new droid foundries on Geonosis was discovered by the Galactic Republic who launched a second major planetary invasion of Geonosis to shut down the foundries that Archduke Poggle the Lesser had built there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After their discovery on Cato Neimoidia, the Republic dispatched a massive detachment of Clones to retake Geonosis and stop the production of battle droids.

As Poggle attempted to retake Point Rain, the main droid foundry was targeted by the Jedi, who launched a major offensive against the factory. Unknown to the Separatists, the main assault was actually a distraction that would enable Padawans Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee to infiltrate the foundry and destroy the reactor core, thus blowing the factory up from the inside. Following this victory, the Jedi proceeded to destroy the remaining droid foundries on Geonosis, stopping the Separatist plans.

Mandalorian commandos performed sabotage missions for the Separatists against Republic targets. One such mission involved a commando attempting to sabotage a Republic cruiser; the Death Watch commando was captured, but rather than surrender and submit to questioning, he committed suicide. His actions, in addition to false rumors, led many in the Republic to believe that Duchess Satine Kryze, the leader of the New Mandalorian government and head of the Council of Neutral Systems, was training a Mandalorian army for the Separatists. The Jedi Council dispatched Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to Mandalore to meet with Satine and investigate the rumors. At first, the Duchess and her advisers discounted any Mandalorian involvement until Kenobi showed holographic recordings of the Death Watch saboteur. Having no other choice, she reluctantly revealed rumors of the Death Watch's return. The rumors were later proven when a Death Watch commando bombed the memorial shrine in the New Mandalorian capital of Sundari before committing suicide when Kenobi attempted to apprehend him. Left at the bomb site was a holographic representation of the Death Watch symbol, further highlighting the group's return. During these events the leader of death watch\u2014Pre Vizsla\u2014communicated with Count Dooku who revealed his strategy. He would force the Republic into sending peacekeeping forces to Mandalore.

A New Mandalorian scout reported this development to Prime Minster Almec; however, the Prime Minister wasn't concerned because he believed that the Death Watch would never be able to take Mandalore without the support of the public. Meanwhile, the Republic Senate had decided to send peacekeeping forces to Mandalore after being shown forged evidence of a senior Mandalorian minister begging the Republic to send help. With the help of Kenobi, the Duchess was able to uncover the unedited version of the holorecording.

After Anakin Skywalker and Jar Jar Binks removed the necklace, Rish Loo attempted to kill Lyonie. Believing him dead, Loo went to the assembled Gungan Grand Army and told them that Lyonie was dead, ordering them to attack Theed immediately. Jar-Jar however, arrived at the event, posing as Lyonie. He denounced Rish Loo and cancelled the order to invade Theed. Rish Loo then fled to his laboratory. Anakin followed Loo, fighting the probe droids sent to stop him. Meanwhile, Grievous and his army landed on Naboo and contacted Jar-Jar (who they believed to be Lyonie) to ask why the attack on Theed had been cancelled. Jar-Jar entered Grievous's lander and attempted to stall the General. Eventually, Grievous figured out that Jar-Jar was not Lyonie, and chased the Gungan outside, where he found his entire army deactivated. The Gungan army surrounded Grievous and told him to surrender. Grievous replied by drawing two lightsabers and killing several Gungan warriors. His rampage was stopped however when General Roos Tarpals stabbed him with an electric spear, the cyborg stabbed Tarpals through the heart and killed him.

The Battle of Ringo Vinda took place outside a Separatist-controlled space station that surrounded the planet of Ringo Vinda. Initially the battle was moving in the favor of the Republic. However, the battle turned in the Separatists favor when a clone trooper, CT-5385 Tup, malfunctioned and executed Order 66 early, killing Jedi General Tiplar. With their momentum lost, the Republic had no option other than to withdraw. The unusual behavior of the Republic was noticed by Separatist Admiral Trench who reported it to Dooku, who then reported it to Darth Sidious.
