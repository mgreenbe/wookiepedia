Deployed as independent broadcast centers, an II-xC lacked weapons in favor of powerful broadband receivers and transceivers, and were used to quickly move in and out of a system to either relay messages to a subspace relay stations, or to eavesdrop on enemy communications. The II-xC measured thirty meters in length, and normally had a command crew of four with ten communications technicians. The ship could operate however on a skeleton crew of two however, one for communications, and the other for piloting. As the ships were unarmed, Imperial protocol required them to hide within the defenses of subspace relay stations if attacked, so that any imperial frequencies or command codes could not be salvaged."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
