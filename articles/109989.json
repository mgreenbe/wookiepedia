Oli\u00e9 was a pilot who served in the Bravo Flight group of the Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps, a wing of the Royal Naboo Security Forces whose job it was to protect the Monarch of Naboo. While he left Naboo to accompany Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala to the galactic capital Coruscant, R2-A6 remained behind in the Theed Royal Palace's hangar docked into an N-1 starfighter. When Oli\u00e9 returned as part of an effort to liberate Naboo, he boarded the starfighter carrying R2-A6 and launched out of the palace, joining his squadmates in attacking the Lucrehulk-class Battleship Vuutun Palaa.
