There, after a stint as a spy, he became a historian under Master Historian Arhul Hextrophon, tasked with compiling the histories of the Heroes of Yavin. Na'al traveled to Tatooine and Galvoni III to acquire information and context on the events preceding the battle, and conducted interviews with the participants, submitting the information in a report to Hextrophon. Subsequent reports included an attempt to discover the truth behind Han Solo and Chewbacca's adventures on Aduba-3, a 168,000-DSU report on the Rebel Alliance for Mon Mothma, an account of the events surrounding the Battle of Hoth and the tribulations of the Heroes of Yavin afterward, a report on the Battle of Endor, and a piece on the Battle of Turak IV."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the dawn of the New Republic, Na'al's historical works led him to continued advancement.

Na'al lost grandparents, aunts, and uncles in that conflict that he never had the opportunity to meet. As a result, he carried some prejudice regarding the idea of cloning into adulthood. Even as a boy, he was interested in the causes of galactic events. History and journalism became hobbies of his, nurtured by his journalism teacher, Arhul Hextrophon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His hobbies soon blossomed into a fledgling career, as Na'al became a stringer for the Galactic News Service. On the planet Corsin in the Greater Plooriod Cluster, Na'al was first exposed to the depredations of the Galactic Empire. Na'al was fortunate to get an assignment covering the prestigious swoop races there. While covering the opening matches, a platoon of stormtroopers burst into the press area and placed everyone under arrest. Na'al was kept in a detention cell for three weeks, visited only occasionally by an interrogation droid that asked no questions. No reasons were ever given for his incarceration, but later, Na'al discovered that the Galactic Empire had deposed the government of the world and replaced it with one dedicated to the New Order, dispensing with civil rights and placing the entire population under a police state. The imprisonment of the journalists had been a method of keeping them silent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Na'al was disturbed by this event, and realized he had two options: quit reporting and ignore the growing tyranny of the Empire, or go all-out and show the galaxy what the Empire was becoming. Before he had the opportunity to pursue the more reckless path, he had a chance encounter with his old teacher, Arhul Hextrophon. Hextrophon had been with the Alliance to Restore the Republic since its inception, and convinced Na'al that the young reporter could make a difference in the Galactic Civil War by joining the Rebellion."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Historian for the Rebellion and the Battle of Yavin"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Na'al was initially made a spy, but was soon placed in the Historian Corp, a special Rebel squad under Major Hextrophon, the Alliance's Master Historian. While still freshly recruited, Na'al made the acquaintance of a Rebel-sympathizing Imperial cadet named Biggs Darklighter. When Darklighter discovered that Rivoche Tarkin, the niece of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, was quite willing to spy for the Alliance, he put her in contact with Na'al. Rivoche's precarious position as a deep-cover spy meant that Na'al was one of the few Rebels who knew of her existence, and also one of the most vocal advocates for extracting her before the Empire realized her role."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within a few years of joining the Rebellion, Na'al had earned the rank of Lieutenant. In 0 BBY, he and Hextrophon were at Massassi Outpost on Yavin 4 following the Alliance's victory over the Empire's Death Star battlestation at the Battle of Yavin. After the battle, they participated in the ceremony awarding the Medal of Bravery to Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Chewbacca. Na'al was responsible for bearing one of the medals, which General Jan Dodonna handed to Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, who awarded it to Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hextrophon assigned Na'al to write an account of the Battle of Yavin and the events surrounding it, for inclusion into the Official History of the Rebellion, Volume One. Starting from the Rebel base at Thila, Na'al took a circuitous route via Yuga 2 and the Kuari Princess to Tatooine to begin his research, under the guise of being a reporter for the Imperial News Bureau. On Tatooine, he encountered the Squib trader Macemillian-winduart\u00e9 and his business partner, the Jawa Aguilae, trying to peddle two droids, which Na'al succumbed to purchasing. By chance, these droids happened to be R5-D4 and an EG-6 power droid, both of which had been present when Jawas had captured and subsequently sold the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO to Skywalker's family. After thoroughly cleaning the two droids and interviewing them for all relevant information, he gave the power droid to a needy moisture farmer, and sold R5-D4 to Tour Aryon's assistant administrator, where the droid spied for the Alliance. While in Mos Eisley, he sought out Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, and interviewed several of the patrons therein."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He then traveled to the Imperial bureaucratic hub of Galvoni III, where he sliced into restricted computer files at the Imperial Records Office to acquire an overview of the first Death Star and its crew, only narrowly escaping capture. Upon his return to Thila, Na'al conducted interviews with the Heroes of Yavin themselves, including an interview with Luke Skywalker conducted from the gunner's seat of Skywalker's airspeeder during a patrol of the planet. All the information he acquired on his journey was compiled in a report to Hextrophon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point following the Battle of Yavin, individuals on Tatooine were accused of being Na'al and his companions, and subsequently wanted for questioning by the planet's Imperial authorities. Imperial Prefect Eugene Talmont was investigating a datatape left by Na'al on a prior journey to Tatooine, and hoped to interrogate the suspects so he would not have to spend time decoding the tapes. Encouraged to bribe Imperial government agent Beeyon Nace for information at Chalmun's Cantina, the suspects learned that the Prefect placed a 1000 bounty on Na'al. Learning Talmont kept the tapes within the planet's Regional Government Offices, the suspects subsequently broke into the building in order to tamper with them. The tapes were decoded, and Talmont found their apparent contents\u2014a result of the individuals' tampering\u2014to be completely worthless, and the suspects were let go in what was considered a case of mistaken identity."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aduba-3 Assignment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 ABY, Na'al was tasked by Hextrophon to ascertain the truth of Han Solo and Chewbacca's adventures on Aduba-3.

On Aduba-3, Na'al compiled information on the planet from official planetary records and his own observations. He made contact with the Verpine Sacred Way priest known as Pera, who agreed to an interview after Na'al gave a sizable donation to the Sacred Way, and confirmed that Solo and Chewbacca had been in Tun Aduban spaceport. He also located the Wroonian Azoora in Locru's Central Saloon, and briefly interviewed her regarding the local swoop gang; however, her boyfriend cut the interview short by threatening Na'al with a non-consensual tracheotomy, forcing the historian to concur with graffiti in the saloon 'fresher that \"blue lady is trouble.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Attempts to interview any of the surviving so-called \"Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3\" came to naught.

Unfortunately, a death threat from the bounty hunter Valance made him unwilling to talk, and though Na'al interviewed his wife Merri, he found her to be unhelpfully credulous, repeating elements from Eight for Aduba-3 that strained Na'al's belief. As his transport was about to depart, he cut the interview short, leaving him despairing of ever knowing what happened on Aduba-3. He struggled with the report until his deadline had come and gone, ruled out requesting an extension due to budgetary constraints, and ultimately accepted the need to submit his partial reports to the BRT supercomputer Mistress Mnemos and send Hextrophon an apologetic missive."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Battle of Hoth and its aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Generally impressed with his work, Hextrophon tasked Na'al with generating an executive summary of a 168,000-DSU report on the growth, organization, equipment, activities and objectives of the Alliance for Mon Mothma.

He accompanied Major Bren Derlin to Bervin's post, only to find the sentry gone, with a blood trail leading through a caved-in wall into the Hoth night. Further attacks on sentries occurred, followed by the actual assault: a pack of Wampas bursting through the snowy walls of the base, driven into berserk rages by the high-pitched acoustic signaling of the base's astromech droids. The beasts outside Echo Base were driven off by the determination and weaponry of the Rebel forces, while the ones that had made it into the base were rounded up with recordings of the droids, stunned to incapacitation, and penned in non-vital areas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Na'al was again in the command center when General Solo brought in the remains of the self-destructed Viper probe droid, and aided Echo Base technicians in reconstructing some of the droids memory circuits. As a noncombatant, Na'al was supposed to evacuate aboard the Rebel transport Quantum Storm, the first transport off the icy world. Instead, he remained behind, assisting the evacuation efforts of the other transports and gathering holo-recordings of the Battle of Hoth from the trenches, though before long he discarded his holorecorder and datapad for the comfort of a blaster rifle. In the course of the battle, he broke his ankle in a cave-in, but successfully made it to the Thon's Orchard, one of the final transports to escape. He waited patiently at the rendezvous point for the Heroes of Yavin, who eventually arrived, allowing him to continue his research and write a detailed account of their travails. For his part in the Battle of Hoth, he was awarded the Mantooine medal of bravery, and his recordings helped Rebel tacticians analyze the battle."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Battle of Endor and the Alliance of Free Planets"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, Na'al was present with the Alliance fleet mustering at Sullust in preparation for the attack on the second Death Star when the Heroes of Yavin returned from their successful rescue of Han Solo. Na'al regarded this event as one of the most inspiring events as his life. Na'al was a participant in the Battle of Endor and the subsequent celebration held by the Rebels and Ewoks at Bright Tree Village, where he became somewhat inebriated on a fermented grava berry brew, and was coaxed into dancing to the Starfarer's Return with several Ewoks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The day after the celebration (following the subsidence of his hangover), Na'al departed for Tatooine. His journey was interrupted when an Imperial Customs Frigate stopped his starship, but his cover identity as a stringer for the Galactic News Service, a role he was quite experienced in, went unchallenged by the officious Imperial Customs official. In Mos Eisley, Na'al found the city in the midst of a gang war as various factions vied to take control of the criminal empire of Jabba the Hutt, whom the Heroes of Yavin had killed in the rescue of Han Solo. While in the city, he brought news of the death of Emperor Palpatine to a small celebration being held in honor of the rescue of Diew Rejeff, a merchant and close associate of Chalmun. Na'al soon left Mos Eisley, hiring a repulsorcraft to take him to Obi-Wan Kenobi's hut, and then on to Jabba's Palace. There, he spent three days posing as a spice dealer, agreeing to supply Bib Fortuna with spice, to aid Ephant Mon in overthrowing Fortuna, to aid Ree-Yees in killing both Fortuna and Mon, avoiding being poisoned, and killing a Gamorrean guard in self defense, all while collecting information on the events surrounding the rescue of Han Solo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After returning from Tatooine, Na'al was briefly stationed on Endor, where he interviewed General Solo's strike team and the Ewoks who had participated in the ground battle, retraced their steps through the Endorian forest, and reviewed the efforts of Wicket and other Ewoks to reclaim the Endor shield generator bunker. However, his furlough on Endor was short-lived, as Mon Mothma gave him orders to take the first transport to the Imperial data storage facilities on Halowan and gather information on the Imperial command structure at Endor. With the assistance of Alliance Intelligence and the disruption of Imperial security procedures caused by the Battle of Endor, Na'al was able to capitalize on his cover as an agent of Fakir sector's Moff Lorin to get full access to everything he was looking for, despite the security code Intelligence had given him being out of date.

During both phases of his life, however, he held great enthusiasm for the personalities he reported on; this occasionally led to a nearly unprofessional zeal in his writings, a trait which he was self-conscious of and for which he sometimes felt the need to apologize. His critics also found his writing to be overly focused on individual personalities. Nonetheless, his work was quoted by author Dr. Milanda Vorgan in her seminal work The Written Word: A Brief Introduction to the Writing Systems of Galactic Basic.
