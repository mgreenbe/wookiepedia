It resembled a similar craft, the Scimitar, that was built by RSS for Darth Maul and was possibly of the same design. However, unlike that craft, it had no cloaking technology. Ezzar used it in the Destruction of the Almas Academy, when he attacked the Almas Academy. He then flew it to Coruscant afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
