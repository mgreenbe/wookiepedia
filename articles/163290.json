Two Hassarians severely injured in the Emergence were brought to the medcenter of the Starlight Beacon space station for care, whereupon Ambassador Ceeril, a member of the Skembo species who were long-time rivals of the Hassarians, attempted to frame them for an assassination attempt against him using stolen hair and DNA. The injuries the Hassarians had sustained in the Emergence were brought up as potential cover for having carried out the attempt, but Administrator Velko Jahen managed to uncover Ceeril's deception."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
