He often drank daranu, becoming intoxicated, though this affected his ability to drive properly. He was driving with his friends when they gave Toob Ancher a lift to the Laughing Bantha cantina, though he had dropped and smashed a bottle of daranu in the process; it was swiftly replaced by another, but this was smashed over Nio's head by Saylor Marjan after the Rodian almost lost control of his vehicle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
