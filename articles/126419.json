The symbol set for their written language, Skakoform, that was current as of the Galactic Civil War resembled circuitry. Most Skakoans did not learn Galactic Basic Standard because few ventured off of their homeworld Skako, meaning that those that did travel abroad tended to rely upon translation modules attached to their pressure suits. However, due to the complexity of Skakoverbal, they often spat out junk sounds while compressing down to simpler languages. While meeting with the Separatist Council on the planet Geonosis in the year 22 BBY, Techno Union Foreman Wat Tambor spoke in Skakoverbal before activating his suit's translation module to convert his speech into Basic. In 34 ABY, the scavenger Hobin Carsamba spoke the language while standing in line for junk boss Unkar Plutt's Concession Stand in Niima Outpost, a settlement on the planet Jakku."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skakoverbal first appeared in the 2002 film Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones.
