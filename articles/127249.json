Normally non-toxic, slabin could become harmful if an improper concentration was ingested, leading to severe illness. During the Clone Wars, several New Mandalorian children on Mandalore suffered the ill effects of a slabin overdosing after drinking slabin-laced tea that had been illegally imported by Moogan smugglers. Their case would prove non-lethal, however, when New Mandalorian leader Duchess Satine Kryze was able to obtain a viable antidote."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Moogan smugglers transported containers of tea from the Ardees Beverage Company to the New Mandalorian capital city, Sundari, on the Outer Rim world of Mandalore. Desiring an increase in their profits, the smugglers and their captain, Tee Va, added slabin to the illegally imported tea, diluting it. However, because the slabin concentration was incorrect, it made the tea a debilitating toxin for any unknowing consumer. The bottles were distributed among the Sundari's school children and as a result, several hundred became sick from ingesting the contaminated beverage and had to be hospitalized. Thankfully for the children, New Mandalorian doctor Zak Zaz was able to correct diagnose the source of their illness, and the leader of the New Mandalorians, Duchess Satine Kryze, managed to secure an antidote."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
