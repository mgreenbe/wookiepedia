It was a reward for Japanese players of the game to celebrate the first year anniversary of the release of the game in Japan. When the game was shut down in Japan, players in that region were given the opportunity to migrate their characters to servers in Europe and the United States, leading to a select few of these paintings becoming available on western servers and becoming highly valuable. With the addition of the \"rare loot system\" in Hotfix 17.10 on October 7, 2010, which allowed players to loot rare items from any enemy, the painting became less scarce as it was one of the items available through this system. The player could use the painting in their house as decoration."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
