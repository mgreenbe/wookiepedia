Whenever a Zeltron became angry, his or her skin turned a deeper red. A Zeltron boy served as a youngling in the Jedi Order during the last decades of the Galactic Republic's reign and often sparred with the human youngling Caleb Dume. Lorica Demaris, who joined the Resistance, was a female Zeltron. Allegedly, the Zeltrons gave off pheromones that made people like them and had a calming effect. Although Demaris was unsure of the veracity of that belief, she did manage to calm down an angry Gigoran by petting her. At any rate, due to their unique nature, Zeltrons experienced amplified versions of the feelings of those around them, especially those they cared about. On their very first day of grade school, young Zeltrons were taught that they should not let themselves be led around by their emotions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zeltrons were first created by Mary Jo Duffy, Kerry Gammill and Tom Palmer for the 1983 Star Wars Legends comic book Star Wars 70.
