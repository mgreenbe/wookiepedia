The gang established itself as a menace to the Refugee Sector and even irked the Exchange. The Jedi Exile, Meetra Surik, approached the gang's leader and negotiated with him. Ultimately, the Exile was able to persuade him to halt his gang's harassment of the refugees."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Serocco wear the same light or medium armor, giving them a uniform appearance, and possess an array of laser and melee weapons.

While this is the dark side option, there is also the choice to provoke them; they strike first, so the Exile kills them without dark side points as this is self-defense."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Serroco campaign was fought between the Mandalorians and the Republic; since Mandalorian veterans of the campaign would have displayed the fierce martial identity and culture of that people, it can be safely assumed the gang's members are all Republic veterans. This makes their antagonism toward the general run of refugees especially ironic, as more than one has dialogue that indicates they are Republic war veterans themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Exile can speak to the gang's leader about a plan to drive the Exchange out of the Refugee Sector. He will initially be intrigued, but no matter which of the possible plans of attack the Exile proposes, he will reject it and the entire gang will turn hostile to the Exile in response."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
