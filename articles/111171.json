The conflict was quickly ended after Rajivari failed to murder his fellow Council members and was killed instead. Despite Rajivari's death, his remaining followers barricaded themselves within his headquarters on Kaleth and put up a last stand against the Jedi Order, officially ending the conflict with the fall of Kaleth and death of all of Rajivari's followers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
