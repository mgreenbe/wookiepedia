When worn, the ring supposedly granted the wearer incredible fortune while also hastening their demise; though if worn alongside the Ring of Immortality, its adverse effects were negated. Shadow University student Detta Yao hired the rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Aphra to find the Rings of Vaale with the help of Professor Eustacia Okka, intending to take them for herself. Okka discovered the Ring of Fortune in the Architects' Mausoleum, but its counterpart was missing. Yao attempted to claim the ring, but it had been stolen by the crew's associate Just Lucky, secretly working for Ronen Tagge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
