Originally a Dathomiri Nightbrother born on Iridonia and known only as Maul, the infant Maul was given by his Nightsister mother to the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who trained him in the ways of the dark side of the Force as his secret apprentice on a secret Mustafar training facility, along with the help of a split personality droid. Maul became a master of lightsaber combat and Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si, wielding a red-bladed saberstaff against any adversary. Though well trained in the ways of the Sith and a Sith assassin rather than a full apprentice, Maul was technically a violation of the Rule of Two because his own Master was at the time apprenticed to another, the Muun Sith Lord Darth Plagueis. Plagueis, however, was fully aware of Maul's existence, and supported Sidious's decision to train him. The primary reason for Plagueis's support, despite the violation of the Rule of Two, was that Maul was trained to be expendable. As an assassin, he could perform high priority, boots-on-the-ground missions for the Sith without running the risk of exposing either Plagueis or Sidious should he fail."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 33 BBY, Sidious gave Maul his first mission: to put the criminal organization Black Sun in disarray. Maul carried out this task perfectly, dealing the group a grievous blow. Maul played an instrumental role in the invasion of the planet Naboo in 32 BBY. The crisis was engineered by Darth Sidious, who lived a double life as Senator Palpatine of Naboo, to have Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum removed from office, allowing Sidious to take his place and set the stages for a government ruled by the Sith. After Padm\u00e9 Amidala, queen of the Naboo, escaped the blockade, Maul was dispatched to follow her. He found her on Tatooine, where he had a short but intense duel with Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, revealing the existence of the Order of the Sith Lords to the Jedi, who had thought the Sith extinct. Later, Maul was sent to Naboo, where he fought Jinn and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Though he killed the Jedi Master, Maul underestimated Kenobi's skill and was severed in half at the waist by the Padawan. Sidious would quickly replace Maul with another powerful apprentice: the late Jinn's former Master, Dooku, who had fallen to the dark side, and whom Sidious dubbed Darth Tyranus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Through his intense rage, Maul was able to survive and escape to the junk fields of Lotho Minor, where he spent the next twelve years of his life with little to no memory of his former self. Maul kept himself mobile by manifesting a spider-like lower half, feeding off of rodents while his mental equilibrium slowly became undone. Although Darth Sidious and the Jedi Order were unaware of Maul's continued existence, the Nightsister Mother Talzin continued to keep an eye on Maul. In 20 BBY, three years into the Clone Wars, Talzin sent Maul's brother, Savage Opress, the ousted apprentice of Maul's Sith successor, on a quest to find the fractured man who dwelled in the depths of Lotho Minor. Savage successfully brought his brother back to Dathomir to undergo physical and mental reconstitution by Talzin's dark magic. Rehabilitated mentally and physically through prosthetic legs, Maul swore to re-establish his place in galactic history, starting with taking vengeance on Kenobi. Maul and Opress caught the attention of the Jedi Order by slaughtering innocents on the planet Raydonia in a successful attempt to lure Kenobi out. Maul tortured Kenobi, though the arrival of an unexpected ally, the Nightsister Asajj Ventress, gave Kenobi the time he needed to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maul and Opress soon cut a bloody swath across the Outer Rim, catching the attention of the Republic and the Jedi. On one occasion, Maul rallied the Moorjhoni clans against the Rim Mining Company. Maul and his brother then unsuccessfully tried to recruit a group of Weequay pirates from the Ohnaka Gang to their cause, a plan which was thwarted and nearly ended in the Nightbrothers' deaths following the arrival of Kenobi and Adi Gallia. Maul and his brother were found unconscious by the Mandalorian Death Watch leader Pre Vizsla and his lieutenant Bo-Katan after having their ship damaged by Kenobi. The two conspired to conquer Mandalore and establish a criminal empire, enlisting the aid of the Hutt Cartel, Black Sun and the Pyke Syndicate. When the New Mandalorian state on Mandalore was conquered by the new Shadow Collective, Vizsla imprisoned Maul and Opress, no longer having any use for them. Maul retaliated by dueling and finally decapitating Vizsla, declaring himself ruler of the Death Watch. Maul finished his revenge on Kenobi by killing his former lover, ousted Mandalorian Duchess Satine Kryze. However, his actions drew the attention of his former master, Darth Sidious, who killed Opress and kidnapped Maul for his own purposes. However, Maul managed to escape from Sidious with the aid of his followers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, unbeknownest to Maul, Sidious and Count Dooku had let Maul escape as they believed that Maul could lead them to Mother Talzin. Shortly after escaping Maul's Shadow Collective engaged in a series of battles against the Separatists. After several defeats, Maul with the aid of the Nightbrothers and Mother Talzin was able to capture both Count Dooku and General Grievous on Ord Mandell. After escaping from a Jedi strike Force, Maul sets off to Dathomir, where he would sacrifice Dooku to Mother Talzin, thus bringing the Dathomirian witch back to her full power. However, Dooku had released Grievous, who would bring Darth Sidious to Dathomir."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Talzin was using her magic to attack Dooku, Sidious and Grievous arrived. Talzin and Maul were overwhelmed and Maul was dragged away from the battle by his Mandolorians while Grievous stabbed Talzin with his lightsabers, killing her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time afterward, Maul appears to have died. He was supposedly resurrected in 0 BBY by three Prophets of the Dark Side for the purpose of presenting a worthier successor to Darth Sidious than his current apprentice, Darth Vader. A showdown was staged on Kalakar Six, and the two Sith Lords fought to see who would rule the galaxy alongside the Emperor. Maul came close to victory, only to be slain by Vader, whose destiny was not yet fulfilled."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some years after the Battle of Endor, Maul's remains were discovered by the Iridonian scientist Drell Kahmf, who maintained the former Sith Lord's brain within a bacta tank.

By birth, Maul was a Nightbrother; a clan of male Zabraks from Dathomir who served as warriors and slaves of the dominant Nightsisters. Like the rest of his kin, Maul was subjected, shortly after birth, to an initiation ritual during which he was immersed in a \"magic\" oily bath, and covered head to toe in black and red tattoos. Later stripped of his black Nightbrother markings, Maul was left solely red-skinned. Agonizing Sith tattoos were applied personally by Darth Sidious in an attempt to cleanse Maul's mind as well as demonstrating Maul's complete dedication to the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maul was a blood brother to Feral and Savage Opress, and Kycina wanted at least one of her sons to live free of Talzin's control. Less than a year after Maul's birth, his mother encountered Darth Sidious, the young Sith apprentice of Darth Plagueis, and implored him to save Maul from the life of a Nightbrother. Though somewhat reluctant, Sidious was persuaded to take Maul, especially given the infant's strong connection to the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maul spent the first few years of his life in the care of droids, TD-D9 in particular, in a secret location on Mustafar. A year after Maul was given over to the Sith, Sidious was granted permission from his own Master to train him as an apprentice. Plagueis, however, instructed Sidious not to give away their most treasured secrets to the Dathomirian; Maul was to be trained as a Sith assassin, not a Sith Lord like Plagueis and Sidious. During his training, Maul did not know the Human who served as his mentor; he only referred to him as \"Master Sidious.\" He had no idea that he was being taught by a Dark Lord of the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Life was hard for young Maul. Any show of hesitation or a mistake was severely punished, and any hint of mercy rewarded with cruelty. One day, after some agility exercises and a torturous session with a computer console on a number of questions, Maul had gone over to the ring, where TD-D9 wielded a wooden staff and instructed him to dodge his blows in another exercise. Maul was hit in the first two strikes, but managed to evade the next two; then, Deenine spun and threw the staff at Maul, hitting him in the face. Before Deenine could retrieve the staff, an enraged Maul unconsciously Force Pulled the weapon into his hands. Surprised, Deenine reported this discovery to Sidious. When asked by how he felt during the exercise, Maul responded that he was angry. Sidious grinned with satisfaction and ordered Deenine to prepare his cruiser for liftoff."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maul was taken to the wasteland planet of Tosste in the Atravis sector, where Sidious first taught him the ways of the Force; to test him, the Dark Lord telekinetically hurled many rocks at the boy, hurting him before he was goaded into throwing them back at the former with his anger. Impressed, Sidious explained the nature of the Force to Maul and advised to hide his talents from others who were \"not... like... us.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back on Mustafar, Sidious instructed TD-D9 to have Maul chained upside down to a winch, which he would attempt to escape from as he was being lowered into a vat of acid. The Sith Master explained to his Zabrak pupil everything there was on the history between the Jedi Order, guardians of the Galactic Republic, and the Sith, the latter of which involved mentions of Naga Sadow and the Great Hyperspace War; Freedon Nadd and his haunting of Onderon; Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma; Darths Revan and Malak; the theories on the title of Darth; Skere Kaan and the Brotherhood of Darkness, which was destroyed by their leader's own thought bomb on Ruusan; and Darth Bane, who reformed the Sith with the Rule of Two: one master, one apprentice. At the last moment, Maul had freed himself and leaped to his mentor's side. He asked if the Sith still existed. Sidious only said that it was possible. Moreover, he said that if it hadn't been for the Sith's efforts, Maul would have been found by the Jedi on Dathomir and turned into a \"mindless, obedient servant for the Republic.\" Maul's hatred for the Jedi had begun, in which he denounced them as weak. Sidious advised the boy not to underestimate the Jedi: compassion may be their greatest weakness, but they were still strong. He instructed Maul to do the exercise again; this time, with the chain lowering at a quicker pace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next time they were on Tosste, Sidious gave Maul a training lightsaber to feel its power, before exchanging it for the real thing. With ease, Maul cut down a couple of trees."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one time in Maul's childhood, he and Sidious were disguised as tourists while standing before the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Having cloaked himself and his pupil, Sidious pointed out the faces of individual Jedi as the day went on.

The young Zabrak, upon being introduced to the students, challenged the tall Abyssin Dalok to prove himself, and defeated him with such ferocity that he bit him on the nose."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a break from his early training at the Academy, Maul exercised on an ice-covered planet of Mygeeto, where Darth Plagueis had first taught Sidious the ways of the dark side in the human's early years as a Sith apprentice. He ran up a mountain and back down with \"superior balance and control.\" As he expected praise from Sidious, the Sith Lord lifted him with the Force and tossed him into a vast, icy lake. Maul struggled to get out, while his Master watched on and refused to answer any call for help. The boy feared for his life, but he learned that he must turn his fear into anger, therefore using it to swim hard to shore. Still, Sidious did not congratulate him. They just continued to walk as they had before."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nearly three years inside the Academy, Maul became friends with Trezza's Nautolan ward, Kilindi Matako, who showed him so much compassion and secretly gave him advice on how to survive an encounter with Trezza's chargrecks.

After that, he and Kilindi were instructed by Meltch Krakko, a brutish Mandalorian who worked in the Death Watch during the Mandalorian Civil War and hunted Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maul had to endure every hit he had from a blaster during training. If he dodged every hit, Kracko would have suspected he was a Force-user. Then, one day, Maul was training with the Rodians and Kracko, the latter wearing mimetic suits, in a chasm so that he could be prepared for the Academy's rite of passage known as the Gora. He believed that he could win their respect. But that was when he believed that something was wrong: they were trying to kill him. In a rage, he forgot about Sidious's orders and launched himself via the Force, taking Kracko and the Rodians by surprise. He injured both Hubnutz and Fretch and was about to take Kracko apart, when Trezza demanded that he stop, a furious look on his face."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sidious, though furious at Maul's disobedience, explained that Maul wasn't \"entirely to blame.\" The dark side could make the Sith want to unleash its power in their time of secrecy. There could have been a Jedi spying on Trezza's activities and would no doubt have sensed Maul's dark presence. When Maul asked how long it would take for him to continue without using the Force and what plans were made for him, Sidious replied that he may take him as his apprentice one day. Then, he passed a lightsaber to Maul, activated his own, and sparred with the Zabrak, resulting in wounding the latter. Maul later wondered whether Sidious and Trezza\u2014if they ever met before in the first place\u2014used Kracko to see if Maul would expose his power under pressure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a week of recuperating, Maul was mostly back in health, ready for the Gora. At the academy's barracks, Kilindi and another cadet, Daleen, told him that Kracko was looking for him and was now on Orsis Orbital Station. Kilindi asked if Maul would like some tips for the Gora, but he felt he could manage without them, causing the Nautolan to show him recent scars on her arms and shoulders from the last Gora. Daleen wished him luck and admonished that she and Kilindi were \"cooking up a surprise\" for him when he got back.

The pilot droid remarked that Sidious would be most displeased, and said it would undertake a memory wipe of the past minute."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a month's time on Hypori, Sidious returned and challenged his apprentice to a lightsaber duel, one which the weak, wounded and famished Maul quickly lost. Sidious then tossed Maul's lightsaber aside and told Maul that he had failed, and revealed that he had been secretly training another apprentice to replace Maul the entire time. Rage and hatred overwhelmed Maul and, in one final act of defiance, he lunged forward and sunk his teeth into his master's hand. As he spat the blood back into his master's face in contempt, Maul realized he was no match for the Dark Lord, and when Maul's emotions were finally spent, he prepared himself for death. Sidious struck his lightsaber down on Maul, but without killing him since it had only been a training lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sidious then laughed and revealed to him the truth: by wanting to kill his own master, Maul had in fact passed the final test.

Thinking that he could easily kill the meditating Manka, he was caught off guard by the Jedi Master's sudden attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wielding a wooden staff, Manka displayed incredible speed, batting Maul across the face with his simple weapon. Maul quickly countered with a quick overhand slash, but Manka managed to dodge. As the Jedi Master pivoted to face him, Maul extended his lightsaber out.

Manka allowed Maul to flee."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rather than accept death, the punishment for failure, Maul resolved to best Manka. Knowing that Manka was much faster than himself, Maul determined to outsmart the Jedi Master, get in close and attack. He proceeded to create a new lightsaber, based upon Sith schematics which he had originally received from Darth Sidious and inspired by the Zhaboka, a traditional weapon of his species.

He waited in the slums of Coruscant for Grahrk atop a small building. Below, the smuggler arrived at the location and Maul jumped down to meet him from behind. The Zabrak's entrance startled Grahrk so much that he soiled his trousers. Grahrk asked if Maul was the one who wanted to hire him.

Extending his awareness, he heard the word \"sabotage\" coming from his right and then eavesdropped on a conversation between three of Lommite Limited's security personnel about a sabotaged ore shuttle: Patch Bruit, LL's chief of field operations, had a list of suspects and executive officer Jurnel Arrant was looking for retribution for the sabotage. While listening in, Maul then noticed a listening device disguised as a flitter on the wall over the men's booth.

Maul jumped over the fence and landed right where the some of the stones rested to avoid detection. He sped toward one of the primary building's outer walls, making him a blur to whatever hovercams were in the area. After discovering that every single door and window were locked, the Zabrak checked the roof for motion and pressure sensors before going up.

Furthermore, both men were somehow involved in the murder of Naboo's former king while they helped Queen Amidala ascend to the throne in his stead, just prior to the Federation's blockade of the planet. The extent and weight of this new information confused and troubled Maul. For a moment, he wondered if this Damask was, in fact, a Sith Lord, controlling Sidious behind the Zabrak's back.

Maul's hatred of the Jedi notwithstanding, his master cautioned him to guard against his pride. According to Sidious, Maul was a formidable warrior, but not a \"one-being army.\" Maul was heavily prone to acts of gloating, despite his master's disapproval.

As apprentice to the Dark Lord of the Sith, Maul viewed himself as the eventual successor of Darth Sidious. However, he was also aware of his own inability to carry the Sith legacy forward, mostly because he had been trained only as a Sith assassin. Unlike Sidious, who hid behind the facade of Senator Palpatine, Maul did not have the advantage of a secret identity. Despite this, he realized how his own physical appearance made it virtually impossible for him to be seen in public without drawing unwanted attention. In spite of all his efforts to understand the galaxy around him\u2014mainly by learning about politics and criminal businesses\u2014Maul held little knowledge of how the real world worked.

As he fought the Togorian pirates above Tatooine, he believed them to be completely stupid, sloppy, and lazy, due to their greed.

At times, he wondered why Sidious would work with sniveling cowards like Viceroy Nute Gunray and the other Neimoidians.

By the time Savage Opress found him on Lotho Minor, Maul had been trapped in a state of madness for roughly a decade. After being repaired by Mother Talzin in both mind and body, a bitter and enraged Maul targeted Kenobi for revenge. A scheming mastermind and uncompromising killer, not unlike his former master, much of Maul's personality\u2014as shaped by his Sith training\u2014remained intact. He spared no feelings of hesitation or remorse for killing civilians, believing that the murder of innocent lives was the quickest method for gaining the Jedi's notice; nor was he a silent opponent who focused primarily on achieving victory through martial prowess any longer. During his duel with Kenobi, Maul utilized Dun M\u00f6ch by taunting the Jedi Master for his inability to prevent his mentor Qui-Gon Jinn's death. Years of living in agony and exile also caused Maul to develop a new-found sense of patience, something that he never truly learned under Sidious's tutelage.

At age seventeen, he come incredibly close to besting Sidious during his test on Hypori despite a long month of starvation, fatigue and pain, while Sidious was in peak condition upon arrival. By 32 BBY, Sidious sincerely viewed his apprentice's combat skills as being unmatched by any Jedi.

However, while he was already very proficient in Juyo and being a lightsaber specialist good at utilizing his Force powers together with his acrobatic fighting style to allow for a more free flowing fight, his use of the style was hampered by his great devotion to Form VII's physical focus, desiring a purely physical victory over his opponents, rather than using the \"higher\" Sith tradition of the Dun M\u00f6ch tactic.

After being rehabilitated on Dathomir, Maul employed Dun M\u00f6ch during his rematch with Kenobi above Raydonia; he later taunted Master Judd on Moorjhone, making him choose between facing Maul and saving the Moorjhoni from imminent destruction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to grasp Juyo, Maul would naturally have had to have mastered many forms of lightsaber combat. He had superb skills in Niman, allowing him to skillfully incorporate his Force powers into his dueling style. Whereas Jedi Battlemaster Cin Drallig believed that at least a decade of study was required to achieve mastery of Form VI, Maul did not seriously begin his lightsaber training until he was fifteen, which would suggest that he had wielded Niman as well as Juyo at an astonishing rate. He had also shown proficiency in Ataru, as shown when dispatching a Trandoshan under Jabba's employ in his escape from Cog Hive Seven, and his specialization of acrobatics may come from Form IV training. This fighting style, along with Niman, would enable him to overcome multiple opponents, as displayed many times. Maul apparently had received a level of training in Makashi that was sufficient enough for Sidious to note the superb elegance and precision in the Zabrak's dueling ability; even Darsha Assant could not help but notice the precision of his movements. He was capable of employing some one-handed strikes with the single blade his saberstaff was left with throughout the Clone Wars, a function of Form II."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite aggression and offense being his prominent trait, Maul was also highly capable at applying defensive measures in combat. He would have been considerably adept at Soresu and Shien, displaying the ability to skillfully defect and/or redirect incoming blasterfire with ease, whether with a saberstaff or a single lightsaber. He was even strong and skilled enough to defend himself off the laser blasts of a Jedi starfighter. In one instance, Maul utilized a reverse Shien grip effectively to block and then counterattack Obi-Wan Kenobi. He later assumed a Soresu opening stance to begin his and Savage Opress's duel with Sidious, likely anticipating an attack from the reigning Dark Lord."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When fighting multiple opponents, Maul extended the second blade of his lightsaber to form a saberstaff, displaying superb skill with the weapon. As most of the era's Jedi had never faced such a weapon, or a practitioner skilled in its use, Maul sometimes used the relative novelty of his weapon's second blade to catch his opponents by surprise. Maul constructed the weapon himself, using ancient plans stored within one of the holocrons that the Sith still possessed. He had based his lightsaber design upon that of Darth Zannah's weapon, which in turn had been a development on Exar Kun's original design. It is likely that this choice also came from his species' penchant for the zhaboka, a similar weapon. His mastery of the saberstaff was so complete, he could spin it with just one hand without injuring himself, a trick he may well have learned from Sidious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maul was also equally capable of adapting his dueling style with his tactical know-how, which allowed him to outmaneuver opponents he could not defeat through his martial prowess alone and beat such enemies to submission.

He then decided to lure the Jedi to this location, separate them and use the laser gates to further secure his victory. This would imply an unusual display of Sokan, using the terrain to one's advantage in lightsaber combat. Maul showed a fair amount of skill at applying mounted lightsaber combat, though he very rarely employed it. All of the known examples involved him riding a speeder against one or more opponents: two Black Sun sentries, a lone Bartokk assassin, Anoon Bondara, CSF officers, and portions of Boss Ganne's Gungan army, at which he was able to often win or at least engage for a fair share of time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maul had received extensive training in Jar'Kai, and quickly developed sufficient skill that even Darth Plagueis openly acknowledged him as being a master of the art.

His dueling skills were displayed by how he, alongside Savage, were able to make Sidious draw both of his swords for the first time. He and his brother fought considerably well, evening much of the fight, but they were eventually separated. Even alone, Maul proved a difficult challenge to Sidious. Taking up both his lightsaber and the Darksaber of Pre Vizsla against his former master, who was also wielding dual-blades, Maul displayed such mastery over Jar'Kai that he was able to almost fight on par with Sidious, matching him blow-to-blow and kick for kick. He pressured Sidious into a bladelock which, even if only for a very brief moment, forced the elder Sith onto his back foot. However, Maul was ultimately bested by his former master, who was eventually able to overwhelm him and force Maul's lightsabers apart once the hilts were within close proximity to Sidious' blades.

He displayed outstanding skill in combining unarmed combat prowess with his lightsaber sequence, as shown repeatedly by how he managed to easily hit his opponents while engaged in close combat even if they were expert duelists.

However, while Sidious acknowledged Maul's strength, he underestimated just how strong Maul was; it was only after twelve years after Naboo that Sidious received news of Maul's remarkable survival, which was enabled by Maul's strength in the dark side, which was believed to have been strong enough to keep him alive despite his bisection due to his immense rage and hatred augmenting his power. Kenobi acknowledged that Maul's knowledge and power of the dark side was great enough to have allowed him to survive his defeat and Maul himself believed that it was the training he received under Sidious that allowed him to remain alive.

When he felt it necessary, he could telekinetically pull weapons away from multiple opponents before finishing them off with his lightsaber.

He also easily choked a Faleen without even looking and brutally twisted his head 180 degrees. Maul was able to keep Satine Kryze in a Force Choke while not even looking and pulled her to the range of his lightsaber to kill her, which was the \"Draw Closer\" maneuver, a Niman technique enabling one to use the Force to bring an opponent within saber range.

Though the Guardsman wanted to take him back to the home, Palpatine stated that Maul simply needed better guidance, and that he would re-educate the boy personally."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Hunting Obi-Wan"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Clone Wars, Maul hunted Obi-Wan Kenobi for many years, always being but a step behind him until 16 BBY when he discovered Owen Lars and a young Luke Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He attacked them while still staying in his hooded cloak, his digitigrade droid legs the only part of him visible to others. He proceeded to call out through the Force to an unseen enemy he could nevertheless sense. The evil, psychic voice claimed to have been tracking this ancient adversary for years, just missing him on his missions to Kamino, Geonosis, and Mustafar and to have killed many witnesses on Polis Massa before finally gaining crucial information in Mos Espa from an aged Toydarian junk dealer, whom he then murdered. The dark creature declared that he knew threatening Luke Skywalker would bring his adversary out into the open."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At this point, a gray-haired Ben Kenobi resolved from the sand and confronted Maul, provoking the former Sith to cast aside his cloak and reveal his identity. With his severed lower body replaced by a pair of large cybernetic legs and abdomen, and his cranial horns having grown to over three times their original length, Maul was consumed with greater hatred than ever before and clearly never resumed contact with his former master, having dedicated his new life to avenging himself on the man who had bested him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi and Maul engaged in a furious rematch. Kenobi managed to gain the upper hand when he severed Maul's right arm, cutting the darksider's weapon in two in the process, as well as breaking several of Maul's horns with his bare hand. Maul summoned the remaining half of his weapon and turned to face Kenobi, only to find himself facing the Jedi's lightsaber emitter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi hesitated to execute his helpless opponent, but had the decision taken out of his hands when the revived Owen killed Maul with his damaged rifle. Obi-Wan said he would take the body and burn it in the Dune Sea; Owen told Kenobi that Luke would be safer if Kenobi never returned. Obi-Wan departed with Maul's corpse, speaking to Luke through the Force, assuring him that he would always be present; if not in person, then in spirit."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Demolition games"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maul was somehow once more alive on Tatooine, sometime shortly after the Battle of Hoth. Before anyone had even seen him, the young Wade Vox felt his presence in the Force as a strange, prickling sense of fear as he was getting ready for combat in Jabba's demolition games; this feeling stayed with him throughout the combat, though Vox tried to shake off the feeling of impending dread after his narrow victory. It was soon after this that Jabba, floating over the Dune Sea and awaiting the next round of combat, spotted Maul's speeder bike on the horizon. Jabba lifted his arm to point at the object in the distance and his suspicions were soon confirmed by Bib Fortuna who informed his master that what he saw seemed to be a contraption favored by the Sith. Jabba let out a long, rumbling laugh and soon managed to convince Maul to take part in his demolition games so that Jabba could exploit his new \"wild card\" to gather even more ill-gotten gains. Maul fought against the other competitors on his Bloodfin, striking them down with its cannons as well as his double-bladed lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
