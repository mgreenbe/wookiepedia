At some point during the conflict, the Lindworm and two Sith Harrower-class dreadnoughts assisted with a Sith invasion of the planet Ord Radama that was led by the Sith Lord Darth Malgus. However, several weeks into the campaign, the Galactic Republic sent a force of Hammerhead-class cruisers and Thranta-class corvettes to the system, to drive the Sith off of the world. Moments after their arrival in the system, the Republic fleet opened fire on the Lindworm with their turbolasers, before the dreadnaught had a chance to launch any starfighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Malgus decided to take command of the Lindworm, and he traveled up to the vessel from the planet surface, in his personal shuttle. However, by the time that Malgus reached the dreadnaught's bridge, it was too late for him to change the outcome of the battle, and he observed as one of the Harrower's plummeted into the atmosphere of Ord Radama and crashed into the planet's capital city. Malgus screamed out in anger, and the force of his rage buckled the bridge's viewport and caused the crew's ears to bleed. Malgus then ordered the Lindworm's navigator to take the ship out of the system and depart for the heart of Sith Space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lindworm was created by Daniel Wallace and featured in the 2012 publication Book of Sith: Secrets from the Dark Side.
