In 32 BBY, Gunray used the forces under his command to blockade the planet of Naboo, as a sign of protest against the Galactic Senate's newly ratified taxation of trade routes. In short order, Gunray had his troops invade Naboo and occupy the planet. 3B3-888 was a part of the force stationed on the planet, under the command of OOM-9."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In response to the occupation, a substantial force of the planet's native Gungans assembled at the Great Grass Plains, headed by Bombad General Jar Jar Binks, and General Tobler Ceel. OOM-9 and a sizable army of droids, 3B3-888 included, were sent to meet the Gungans and engage them, resulting in the Battle of the Great Grass Plains. The Gungans were eventually routed, and as they retreated, 3B3-888, aided by several other B1s, captured both Binks and Captain Roos Tarpals. Shortly afterward, however, the Droid Control Ship orbiting Naboo and controlling all battle droids on the planet surface was destroyed, resulting in the instantaneous deactivation of 3B3-888 and the rest of the Federation force. Naboo's leader, Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, later captured Gunray and reclaimed possession of the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "3B3-888 had white plating, black photoreceptors, and, like all B1 battle droids, stood 1.91 meters tall. 3B3-888 wielded an E-5 blaster rifle in combat against the Gungans.
