The differences stem from changes made during the recording process and from alternate takes of the same cue. The actual landing of the ship in the film also contains a partial ending not heard on the album."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The album also contains alternate versions of some of the battle cues, as well as most of the unused segment \"The Elevator Scene.\" \"I Am the Senate,\" a piece drastically altered in the film, originally featured music to score the scene where Palpatine is attempting to persuade Anakin to join him while shocking Mace Windu. This music was cut from the film, but it can be heard in the video games. Another cue, \"Padm\u00e9's Ruminations,\" is different from what is heard on the album, both in its mix and in the vocal performance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Much of the film contains percussion alternates. For example, \"Moving Things Along\" (\"Enter Lord Vader\" on the album) has a percussion track in the film not present on the album. This stems from the fact that the percussion of many cues was recorded separately, to be laid onto the cue in mixing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Battle of the Heroes\" begins with strings on the album but not in the movie, and in the movie the ending is different, although this stems from the fact that the version on the album is a concert-suite representation of the cue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Williams' album \"End Credits Medley\" is much longer than the piece heard in the film. The end credits for the film mainly include the original Star Wars theme and a selection of the new cues, such as \"Battle of the Heroes\" as well as a reprisal of \"Princess Leia's Theme.\" The album medley, however, includes as well as these themes a reprise of \"The Throne Room\" suite from A New Hope."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Duel of the Fates\" also makes an appearance in the score.
