Later in the Battle of Teth, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, used it to take Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure's son back to his home planet of Tatooine, but were shot down over the planet and were forced to crash-land the ship. After they abandoned it, the ship was scavenged by Jawas, and Skywalker later returned and reclaimed it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After it had been reclaimed, the Twilight was later used by Skywalker in several missions during the coming events in the war. These included Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi's rescue of Galactic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala aboard the Confederacy warship Malevolence during the Battle of the Kaliida Nebula, as well as Skywalker and Tano's mission to destroy a Confederacy listening post. Additionally, Skywalker and Kenobi took the freighter to Florrum to confirm that Sith Lord and Confederacy Head of State Count Dooku had been captured by pirates, in order for a deal to be struck between the pirates and the Galactic Republic, and the two Jedi later used the Twilight to find an antidote for the deadly Blue Shadow Virus on the planet Iego. Later on, the Twilight would be used once again by Skywalker and Tano during their mission to Mustafar. In 20 BBY, it was discovered that Darth Maul had taken over the planet Mandalore with the help of Pre Vizsla and the Death Watch. Kenobi used the freighter as a way of sneaking in to rescue Duchess Satine Kryze, who had been imprisoned by Maul. The two attempted to escape in the Twilight but it was hit by a missile and crashed, forcing them out of the ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Twilight had one big main wing and one retractable second wing, which was placed under the main wing and was approximately half the size of the main wing. The retractable wing was called a Tal Nami Freighter Swing Wing, which gave the craft extra maneuverability. It was also equipped with one heavy blaster cannon. Another smaller retractable wing was placed above the main wing equipped with a double heavy blaster cannon. If needed the wing would go in the upright position to allow the blasters to be fired. The cockpit was positioned between the main wing and the main engine. Astromech droid R2-D2 traveled inside this cockpit with the ship's captain, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. Just next to the cockpit, the main wing housed two small, secondary engines. Despite similarities to the later Imperial Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, it was of Corellian manufacture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship was armed with three heavy blasters, located on struts around the ship, concussion missiles and also had a rotating laser cannon mounted on the main wing, with periscope controls. The Twilight had a small hangar in its rear, big enough to fit Skywalker's starfighter. The hangar was otherwise used as a cargo hold and was equipped with a magnetic field to allow outer space transfer of goods. A tow cable was placed to winch in heavy containers. The ship also had a boarding ramp underneath the vessel, which acted as the main entrance to the ship. The hangar door could also be used as an exit and entrance to the ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Spice freighter"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not designed as a starfighter, the Twilight had been used to smuggle illegal spice by Hutt crime lord Ziro Desilijic Tiure, and was an aging freighter by the time of the Clone Wars, the galaxy-wide conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

It was being loaded by B1-Series battle droids and was being prepared for departure; nevertheless, Skywalker and Tano destroyed the battle droids and attempted to take off. At first, the freighter refused to start, but R2-D2 managed to fire up the battered engines and the Jedi attempted to take it to the nearest Republic cruiser. The sky fight above Teth prevented them from landing on the cruiser, so they were forced to take the ship directly to Tatooine. With the help of a medical droid hologram and medicine, Rotta was saved from near death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving in the Tatooine system, Skywalker diverted power to the front shields instead of the rear. The Twilight was ambushed by two Rogue-class starfighters piloted by IG-100 MagnaGuards, ironically attacking from the now-unprotected rear. Astromech droid R2-D2 unlocked the weapon systems and was able to destroy both fighters, but extensive damage to the craft caused it to crash-land into the atmosphere. After the four abandoned the ship through the rear door, Jawas came by to salvage it. Skywalker later reclaimed the Twilight and modified it to update its age-induced shortcomings. These modifications included an increase in both top speed and agility."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Malevolence"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker and Tano used the Twilight to rescue Jedi Master Plo Koon after his fleet was destroyed by a \"secret\" Confederacy weapon. Skywalker and Tano came upon Koon and several clone troopers in an escape pod, the only survivors of the battle. However, the crew was forced to shut down the ship's systems, including astromech droid R2-D2, as an enormous battleship approached; alerting the warship to their presence would surely mean certain doom. However, the medical droid tending to the clones was missed.

After Shadow Squadron took the fighters back to the Venator-class Star Destroyer Resolute, Skywalker led them through the Kaliida Nebula to engage the Malevolence, which General Grievous was planning on using to destroy an Outer Rim medical center. After sustaining losses, Skywalker and what remained of his squadron were able to severely damage the battleship's ion cannons, preventing the destruction of the station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Twilight was later used to rescue Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala from the extensively damaged Malevolence after Grievous captured her during the Battle of the Kaliida Nebula, as the cyborg general sought to flee from the attacking Republic Venator cruisers. Skywalker and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi took the Twilight and docked at the emergency airlock below the bridge, seeing as the droids were \"too busy repairing the ship to notice them.\" After the Jedi rescued Amidala, the Twilight returned to the fleet, managing to evade Grievous in his fighter and several Vulture droids.

During the mission, Skywalker headed off to rescue Artoo, while Tano and the clones set explosive charges to destroy the station. However, Grievous attacked Tano and the clones, and Tano, accompanied by R3, engaged Grievous alone, while Rex and Sergeant Denal planted the rest of the charges."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker succeeded in rescuing Artoo, and returned to the hangar bay where he signaled the Twilight for the evacuation. The pilot brought the Twilight into the hangar and met with Skywalker and Artoo. However, after R3, Rex and Denal arrived, Skywalker learned of Tano's single combat against Grievous. Before they could rescue her, R3 revealed himself to be a spy and traitor, closing the hangar door and all entrances, and sealing the Republic forces inside the station. The droid also activated three Vulture droids, and several B2 super battle droids arrived, engaging Skywalker and the clones in combat.

Dooku was captured by the Weequay Hondo Ohnaka's pirate gang, and was taken to Florrum, while Skywalker and Kenobi were rescued by Tano.

The Jedi were forced to strike an uneasy alliance with Dooku, who later escaped separately. The two Jedi spared Ohnaka, showing wisdom in not arresting him in spite simply for capturing them. Skywalker and Kenobi left the planet on the Twilight with Representative Jar Jar Binks, Commander Stone and a few members of the Coruscant Guard, who had originally been sent to negotiate the deal concerning Dooku with the pirates."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Curing the Blue Shadow Virus"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Tano, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and several clones were infected with the deadly Blue Shadow Virus shortly after a raid on Confederacy-allied Dr. Nuvo Vindi's laboratory on Naboo, Skywalker and Kenobi took the Twilight to Iego to find an antidote known as Reeksa weed. There, they learned from Jaybo Hood that \"Drol\", the \"phantom ruler\" of Iego, was preventing the inhabitants from leaving the planet. After finding the Reeksa weed and attempting to leave the planet, the Jedi discovered that \"Drol\" was actually an energy field, installed by the Separatists when they invaded the system. The Jedi took a few of Hood's reprogrammed Vulture droids and were able to destroy the energy field, liberating the planet and allowing the inhabitants to leave whenever they chose.

Skywalker had earlier warned him of its then-current state when Kenobi borrowed the ship, although Kenobi figured that he could use it as long as it at least could still fly and land well.
