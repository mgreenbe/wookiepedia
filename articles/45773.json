Two stormtroopers see them approaching, and raise their hands, ordering them to stop. Instead Djarin accelerates and speeds past them, causing one of the troopers to use a comlink to warn the rest of his squad.

Grogu points at Djarin's vambrace, but Djarin shakes his head and picks Grogu up, firing on the troopers as he dives for cover behind a rock. Grogu points again, and Djarin uses the vambrace to summon IG-11, who leaps from a nearby hill, disarming and incapacitating the troopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One stormtrooper approaches IG-11 from behind, and Grogu uses the Force to pull the speeder bike and his capsule toward them, knocking the trooper out.
