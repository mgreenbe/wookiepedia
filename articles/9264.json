The activation stud on these lightsabers was concealed.

During the Battle of Sullust, she crossed blades with Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, briefly losing one of her lightsabers.

After parting ways with Tano, Ventress was ambushed by Barriss Offee, who had turned to the dark side of the Force. Offee took Ventress's lightsabers along with her mask after knocking her out, then confronted Tano in a duel at the warehouse.
