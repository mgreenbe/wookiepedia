During the early stages of the Galactic War, Sergeant Yuun worked with Havoc Squad to reassemble a black cipher from wreckage on Hoth, and the Republic Strategic Information Service tried many times to retrieve ciphers from Imperial ships but were foiled by their self-destruct mechanisms. What's more, if the Empire became aware that the black cipher was compromised, they'd recall all their capital ships to change the codes. The successful theft of the Minister of Logistics' cipher was a key part of Operation End Game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
