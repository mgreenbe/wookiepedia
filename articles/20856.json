As he landed on Cerea, he was one of the few to be granted permission to move outside the citadel. However, he used this as an opportunity to keep public appearances about the benefits of civilized life. His speeches were particularly among the younger generation of the Cerean that were deliberately against the Cerean Elder since it was revealed that he served as an agent to Jabba the Hutt. Eventually, Bron retreated from public life, though there were rumors, that he was complicit in this plot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
