One containing the testimony of an anonymous soldier of the Galactic Republic, who had been stationed Falang Minor after the end of the Tionese War, was stored in the Palace of Memnii on Caamas. A copy of the sense lattice's record survived the Caamas Firestorm of 19 BBY as it was in a traveling exhibit at the time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
