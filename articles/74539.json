Once the shuttle was disabled, Scarlet used the Firespray's grapplers to secure the shuttle to her ship in order to board it with her pirate crew. However, the Imperial forces were able to repel the pirates, forcing Scarlet to escape in her Firespray before the Imperials could give chase."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
