Shon-Ju had been exiled from the Jedi Order prior to the outbreak of the Clone Wars. When he was leaving the Jedi Temple, he met Count Dooku, a man who had left the Order; Dooku advised Shon-Ju to follow his own path. Shon-Ju then spent time in exile; he continued to hone his connection to the Force and found a tranquil balance and the ability to direct the Force through his hands. He rejected the exclusivity of the Jedi Order and established this school to teach his three students how to use the Force as he did. They all wore Jedi-style robes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Shon-Ju relocated his school to a retreat on the moon Cavamina Minor in order to put a stop to the mercenary Attuma Duum's operation.
