An explanation is provided by just-arrived Jedi Knight Dez Rydan, Jora Malli's first Padawan, who explains that their original transport broke down and a replacement had to be arranged. Reath is surprised to see him, as Dez had been on a mission on Zeitooine. The third Jedi to arrive is Orla Jareni, notorious for having recently declared herself a Wayseeker to operate independently of the Jedi High Council. Last to arrive is Master Cohmac Vitus, a noted scholar and folklorist who has written footnotes in many of the books Reath has read.

The Jedi are struck by the ship's small size, confused by its name, and confounded by Leox Gyasi, its memorably eccentric captain. Copilot Affie Hollow is confused because she thought they were picking up a group of monks. Even more baffling to most of the Jedi is the ship's navigator, Geode, a Vintian who looks like nothing so much as a large rock. After the Jedi's bunks have been set up, the Vessel departs Coruscant and jumps into hyperspace. While en route, Affie and Leox discuss their passengers, having never been into the Core Worlds before and so knowing little of the Jedi Order. Reath is envious of the older Jedi's seemingly boundless self-confidence.

A crisis ensues when the Vessel is grazed by a piece of debris, leading Affie and Reath \u2013 whose completion of a basic mechanics course makes him the only one of the Jedi with recent experience \u2013 to hurry to fix the ship's coaxium regulator back in place. Leox sets the navicomputer to find the quickest path out of hyperspace, as increasing amounts of debris block off more and more paths into realspace. When the Vessel drops out of hyperspace, it is in a location far from civilization, leading Affie to wonder to herself why the ship had those coordinates programmed.

They and their Masters, Laret Soveral and Simmix, have been assigned a mission to help two planets which had previously rejected the Jedi and Galactic Republic. Eiram and E'ronoh have been at odds for longer than anyone can remember over the hyperspace gateway in their shared system, but now, royals from both planets have been kidnapped. The mission is an opportunity for the Jedi in many ways. On the lost moon between the two worlds, Lord Isamer of the Directorate crime syndicate berates his underlings, who kidnapped Monarch Cassel of E'ronoh and Queen Thandeka of Eiram, because Thandeka is only the consort and he wanted Queen Dima, the actual ruler. Cassel, who is reputed to be somewhat unintelligent, attempts to state that Thandeka will do for leverage, finding their denigration of her as \"useless\" is rude, to her irritation. When Isamer's minions detect the approaching Jedi shuttle, the Lasat has them send a message from the communications array of Cassel's ship to lure them in. He envisions a glorious future for the Directorate, since the Hutts came to him to pull this job. When Orla and Cohmac pick up the supposed distress signal, the Umbaran immediately answers that \"The Jedi are on our way.

When Cohmac arrives in the cockpit, the group analyzes the signals they're picking up to find eleven starships in the vicinity. The ships include cargo haulers, passenger transports \u2013 one with at least two hundred people onboard \u2013 and ships crewed by Mizi and Orincans. The final ship, the one that sent the original signal, is a puzzle, with components from multiple kinds of ships. Contacting the ship, they reach a young woman named Nan who explains that it's just her and her guardian, and she's thrilled when Cohmac introduces himself as a Jedi, here to help. When Leox widens the sensor field, it's discovered there's an old space station in the system.

The sensors light up with the news that a solar flare will arrive in just four minutes, leading Reath to jump on the comms and order the other starships in the system to shelter at the station immediately. Most of the ships make it, but Nan's ship suffers engine trouble, so the Vessel heads out and snags it with a tow cable, pulling the other ship to safety just in time. Boarding the station, Reath, Dez, and Affie find that the central globe is overflowing with plant life, sustained by light from self-generating power banks and maintained by 8-T gardening droids.

The Jedi invite them to make themselves confortable on the station while they start boarding the other ships. Nan expresses curiosity about the Jedi, and Reath wonders if she's trying to flirt with him. Affie explores the station while the boarding is occurring, discovering a storage area above the central sphere with coded symbols actually handwritten on the walls, and dates ranging from thirty-two to six years ago. Among the symbols, Affie is unsettled to find the logo of the Byne Guild. Orla and Cohmac inspect the ancient statues, which Cohmac surmises represent gods. They both sense a connection between the statues and the dark side.

Not wanting to believe his senses, Cohmac heads toward the back of the ship before encountering Laret, who confirms it. Cohmac finds the body of Simmix coiled up in the wreckage, and regrets not insisting that his master mind his own safety better. In the caves, Isamer orders some guards to check for survivors at the crash site, mindful that the goal of the job, as outlined by the Hutts, was to definitively turn the people of this region against the Jedi and Republic. Cassel expresses hope that the Jedi will still win, but Thandeka is skeptical.

However, they are still trapped there. Reath has trouble with those sheltering at the station, who act ungrateful and constantly bicker, refusing to share supplies. Nan, however, backs him up, asserting that none of them know how to share. Leox also gives Reath a hand, noting that given the situation, they're lucky to be stranded there, which persuades the bickering representatives from the ships to offer assistance. Talking with Dez, Reath asks how the man whose arm he cut off is doing. Orla, who is overseeing that, orders the man and his crew to leave immediately after the medical checkup is finished.

During the hasty exit, Affie gets a scrape from a thorn on one of the vines, before shooting the roots on Reath's suggestion, which starts a fire and distracts the droids. Once they're out of the tunnel, it becomes clear that Affie has been poisoned by the vine. Dez, alerted to Affie's condition, is able to retrieve the correct antidote from the Vessel. After Affie has rested, she tells Leox about the code she found upstairs and its connection to the Byne Guild, believing it's connected to some kind of conspiracy against Scover Byne.

The Jedi confer in the Vessel's communications area, discussing what the idols are, what they may be containing, and the meaning of the warnings.

She adds that Hague used to be a brilliant commander, and she's happy to be learning from him, leading Reath to assume that she hails from a military family. They find a control panel, which they assume to have been used for system maintenance, as well as an airlock, and Nan suggests that Dez may have been launched into the vacuum of space without a ship.
