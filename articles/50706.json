They fought well, despite being outnumbered. When the pirates retreated, Fenris attributed the victory to the Aces' skill, although Doza had doubts, suspecting another factor.

Freya expressed concern that the Aces were outnumbered, but they successfully held off the First Order long enough for the salvage team to secure a canister of coaxium. The Aces were ordered to retreat, and Freya announced that they would have to come in hot, as the station was in motion while they were trying to land.

Captain Doza's solution to this problem was to add Kazuda Xiono to the Aces, and to appoint Jarek Yeager to be their Squadron Leader, as both pilots had military experience. Freya was visibly shocked by this announcement, but seemed to agree with Torra's assessment that they should give Yeager a chance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The newly expanded Ace squadron met in Yeager's hangar to discuss the plan for their training, although Freya wondered why they couldn't hold the briefing in a nicer location. Yeager announced that they would be having a skirmish on a nearby ice moon with two teams- Kaz and himself, versus all of the other Aces.

Unbeknownst to Freya and Torra, Kaz allowed Kel and Eila to sneak on board the supply shuttle. As they approached the planet, Freya observed that she was unable to contact anyone at the trade outpost. Upon landing, they discovered that the marketplace had been abandoned, and its residents had left behind warnings about some unnamed \u201cevil\u201d written on the walls. Freya was slightly unnerved, but decided they shouldn't let the abandoned supplies go to waste, and proposed they split up and meet back up in an hour."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Freya and Torra regrouped at the shuttle on time, but Kaz and CB-23 were nowhere to be seen. Adding to their worries, Freya noticed that additional ships had appeared on the shuttle's sensors, and Torra confirmed that her father hadn't sent anyone else from the Colossus. The ships turned out to be First Order Raiders, who captured Freya, Torra and their droids, and began interrogating them. When questioned, Freya lied that no one else had come to Ashas Ree with them. However, the troopers quickly discovered and captured Kaz, CB-23, and the children, who had just exited the temple near the marketplace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just as the First Order Raiders began to question Kaz, the archaeologist Mika Grey shouted from the top of the temple, revealing that she had the Sith artifact the troopers were after. They threatened to kill their hostages if she didn't hand it over, so Mika activated the artifact and threw it at them, calling out a warning which allowed Freya and the others to narrowly avoid the resulting blast by hiding in the temple. Once the coast was clear, they left the temple, and CB-23 removed the restraints from Freya and Torra's wrists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Freya raised no objection when Eila proposed that Mika should come live on the Colossus, but told Kaz she thought Mika seemed like trouble.
