These supplies were originally intended to be delivered to the surface by the Republic's prototype stealth ship, thus bypassing the blockade around the planet. Instead, the stealth ship attacked the enemy's command ship first, and was able to destroy it after several skirmishes. With the blockade broken, the ship delivered the cargo containers and their contents to the surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
