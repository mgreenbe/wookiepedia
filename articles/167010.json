According to these files, she would have been in some way involved with the 2005 expansion pack, Rage of the Wookiees. However, she is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character, despite being referenced as an upcoming character in an IGN Entertainment news article a month prior to the expansion's release.
