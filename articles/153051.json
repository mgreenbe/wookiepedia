The Iktotchi possessed two faces on his head, joined with a singular eye in the middle. When the assassin droid IG-90 attempted to enter the establishment in order to meet with several other bounty hunters, the bouncer denied him entry, claiming that droids were not welcome at the establishment. IG-90 shot and killed the bouncer, shooting the Iktotchi's body numerous times to make a point."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
