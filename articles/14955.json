In this region of Hutt Space in the previous week, the Republic had lost eighteen Republic supply transports to enemy ambushes. Finally recon drones detected Imperial fighters hiding in the Archenar asteroid field. So the Republic Command organized an ambush using the elite Coruscant Aegis squadron, supported by Thranta-class corvettes. The Republic fought very well destroying most, if not all, of the Sith forces there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Battle of the Archenar asteroid field was one of the second-tier (Level 20+) Space Missions available in the MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic.
