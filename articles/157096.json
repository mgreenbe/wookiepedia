This glass rain planet was home to a species of giant beetles which ate glass. The planet was also known to have at least one settlement in 139 ABY. Following Ania Solo's kidnapping, her former flame Ramid flew his starship there in an attempt to refuel at the planet's settlement. However, they were attacked by a mysterious masked bounty hunter who shot down Ramid's ship. Ania and Ramid were forced to work together to survive. Later, the planet was visited by Ania's friends, who had come to rescue her, and a force of stormtroopers sent to arrest her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
