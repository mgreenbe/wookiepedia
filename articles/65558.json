It was sent to senior Imperial naval officers and contained an intercepted Alliance to Restore the Republic transmission that had been sent by Princess Leia Organa, one of the Alliance's leaders, calling for Alliance forces to rally in three cities: Bestine on Tatooine, Dearic on Talus and Keren on Naboo. In the message, Isard also stated that Imperial squadrons were to be assigned to capture each of the three locations, and that Darth Vader had taken a personal interest in the matter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
