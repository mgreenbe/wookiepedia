The Rebel Alliance sent a team of soldiers which overran the facility's garrison. The team captured the listening post which was able to track fleet movements. The Imperial Military counter-attacked a few days later. The follow-up strike resulted in the destruction of the outpost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack was mentioned in 2009's The Essential Atlas, which was written by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry. There is a discrepancy surrounding the outpost. The 2004 video game Star Wars: Battlefront features the follow-up battle, and although the game says the Imperial forces were defending the outpost, The Essential Atlas says that the outpost had been captured by the Rebels before it was destroyed in the Imperial attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
