A brash, aggressive droid with a sense for adventure, MK-09 was intensely loyal to the Azzameen family and their company Twin Suns Transport Services and considered himself a member of the family. The family droid was modified to allow him to pilot multiple types of craft, including freighters and starfighters, and operate a starship's turret gun. Emkay felt that droids were superior to organic beings; disgusted by the mistreatment of droids throughout the galaxy, he developed a dislike toward the Galactic Empire due to their callous treatment of droids and often suggested that the Azzameens join the Alliance to Restore the Republic, an organization he felt held droids in better respect."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He originally served solely as a maintenance droid aboard Azzameen Home Base and the family's YT-2000 light freighter Otana, but was later able to put his piloting modifications to use when family head Tomaas Azzameen, owner of Twin Suns Transport Services and Alliance sympathizer, determined it time to train his youngest son Ace in the family trading business. Emkay, along with Ace's siblings Emon and Aeron, were assigned to instruct the new pilot.

During these visits, the droid would track Ace's successes, maintain Ace's growing collection of souvenirs from battles, and inform Ace of upcoming family missions. The droid would again accompany Ace as he flew on these family missions, many of which were intended to assist the Rebel Alliance, albeit discreetly, as the surviving Azzameens attempted to restore their business. Emkay and the rest of the Azzameen children were betrayed by Antan Azzameen, Tomaas's brother and co-owner of Twin Suns Transport Services, after Antan forged a deal with the Empire to reclaim the family business; this trap would not be successful."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "MK-09 even assisted the Alliance directly on a number of missions.

While making the delivery, an Imperial force led by Darth Vader entered the system and an intense battle erupted. Emkay was aboard the Otana undergoing minor updates to his systems when Tomaas and his eldest son Galin entered the ship and prepared to leave. The three escaped the invading Imperial forces with help from the Alliance and left with the first wave of Rebel evacuees.

Ace's sister Aeron e-mailed Emkay after the droid's reassignment and told the droid he was to accompany Ace on any family missions. She also sent him data on Azzameen trade routes, starship identification material, and information on the family's modified Corellian freighters\u2014including combat tactics and turret instructions for use aboard the ships\u2014to prepare MK-09 for his new position.

Ace piloted the craft and engaged its hyperdrive, launching both him and MK-09 into their first trip through hyperspace. Arriving at Harlequin Station, Emkay observed as Ace dropped off their cargo before retrieving the return package. However, the arrival of two Viraxo-allied Pursuer-class enforcement ships, the Enkidu and Gilgam, interrupted the training exercise. Harlequin Station, defenseless against the Viraxo raiders after the departure of its protection craft Kouerd, called upon the Azzameens for protection.

However, Emon instructed the droid not to fire the Sabra's forward lasers, as it was a training exercise for Ace, not MK-09; this disappointed the droid. As Ace practiced, MK-09 adapted his piloting to Ace's shooting. Emon concluded the lesson with a trip to the resort station of Dunari's Rest to celebrate. There, the Azzameens again encountered Viraxo presence in the form of the Enkidu and two Razor-class starfighters. Emon moved to engage the Enkidu, leaving Ace and Emkay to fight the starfighters. As Ace destroyed one with the Sabra's turret, MK-09 rammed the other, obliterating it without the Sabra sustaining damage.

Again, the Enkidu and a pair of Razor-class fighters were interfering in Azzameen affairs; upon their identification, Emkay moved to the Sabra's turret and disabled one of the Razors, forcing it to crash into a container. The Enkidu, perched atop a Class-L cargo container, exited the system after the Selu approached. With the area clear, scanning resumed, eventually resulting in MK-09's discovery of contraband spice planted in the container that the Enkidu accessed. Realizing this was an effort to sabotage the Azzameens and their company, MK-09 remarked that the containers in the affected fields would have to be moved.

Now in charge of the company while Tomaas and Galin were out on business, he reprimanded his brother's children for provoking the Viraxo. Still, Antan devised a plan to serve some retribution to the family's rivals by using the same illegal spice used in the sabotage attempt. Aeron was to deliver the spice to the Viraxo orbital station Viraxo 54 in a disguised Selu\u2014now the Venix thanks to false transponder codes\u2014and Ace, Emkay, and Emon were to subsequently cause a disturbance to attract Imperial attention; Antan hoped that the discovery of the spice Aeron left in Viraxo space would cause the rival company to fall out of favor with the Empire, effectively crippling the Viraxo. Ace, again flying the Sabra with MK-09 as copilot, and Emon, flying the Andrasta, exited Azzameen Station and flew to the Viraxo facility. The Selu and Andrasta entered the system and engaged the Razor-class starfighters emerging from the base; in the fight, MK-09 manned the turret gun on the Sabra.

In spite of this, his father recognized Ace's piloting abilities as well as MK-09's role in training. Because of Ace's skills, Tomaas enlisted him and MK-09, along with Aeron and Emon, to fly cover for the Twin Suns Transport Services' GR-75 medium transport Vasudra on a mission to collect a black market shipment of the healing substance bacta for the Alliance from a pirate group. The Azzameen flight group was escorted to the meeting grounds by the SCT Scout craft Ravenno; the Vasudra docked with the waiting Xiytiar-class transport End Run and the bacta transfer began."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Azzameen suspicions rose as problems with the pumps were reported and technicians from the End Run were dispatched.

Ace, in the Sabra, was told to engage the technicians; Emkay, not receiving targeting commands, targeted and engaged the attacking CloakShape starfighters. After the Azzameens defeated the pirate craft, the End Run surrendered and transferred the remainder of its bacta cargo. The pirates then escaped at Tomaas's insistence, much to both Emon and MK-09's chagrin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When it was time to deliver some of the procured bacta, Tomaas called upon Ace and Emkay to fly as escorts for the Vasudra in the Otana\u2014the Azzameen ship the droid most wanted to pilot\u2014 and the craft flew to the Alliance outpost Hospital. However, shortly after the family's arrival, the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Corrupter entered the system; now under Alliance scrutiny due to the timing, the Azzameen escort ships were nevertheless called to assist Alliance starfighters to defend both the outpost and the Vasudra, now attempting to offload its bacta cargo. Emkay assisted Ace in the Otana by monitoring communications and targeting enemies.

Ace and Emkay, in the Otana, accompanied Aeron in the Selu to retrieve property from the family company's main base of operations, Twin Suns Station. As Ace piloted the Otana to retrieve a container of warheads intended for the Alliance, his droid copilot scanned the sector and was the first to announce the arrival of a joint Imperial and Viraxo strike force. Comprised of the Imperial Victory II-class Star Destroyer Furious, the Viraxo CR90 corvette Blast Radius, and miscellaneous escorts and shuttles, this fleet approached Twin Suns Station, intending to capture the base.

Emkay suggested a more prudent approach to the battle, which earned the droid the disabling of his communication circuits\u2014both internal and external. The pilots of two Corellian freighters met with Emon, who had been patrolling the sector. He reported that their uncle Antan, who had just flown with Emon to one of the Azzameen's cargo facilities, had been captured after an ambush by Viraxo forces. Without Antan, the Azzameen children had no plan. Emkay, still silent due to his disabled circuits, was thankful for the sudden arrival of Admiral Garreth Holtz in the Corrupter, as he realized it kept the children from formulating a plan, as the past several had failed. With the Star Destroyer ordering the Azzameens' surrender, Aeron quickly suggested that the Azzameens seek asylum with the Alliance to Restore the Republic, hopeful that the word of family friend and Alliance pilot Olin Garn would assuage any possible suspicion from the botched bacta delivery; at some point, MK-09's communication circuits were restored, and he agreed, loading the coordinates provided into the Otana's navicomputer.

Shortly after exiting hyperspace close to the probe droid pod, the Muurian transport Pelican and its escort of R-41 Starchasers entered the system with seemingly the same mission goals.

While Emkay initially feared that passing the checkpoint would be the most challenging part of Aeron's plan, a pirate force consisting of Y-wings and a pair of Marauder-class corvettes entered the sector and engaged both the Otana and the station. Due to either the pressing odds, importance of the mission, or the lack of necessity in protecting the customs station, Emkay acted somewhat against his typical nature, as he suggested more than once that they fly through the screen and into hyperspace, avoiding any sort of combat entirely. However, the suggestions were ignored and Emkay was dispatched to the turret to destroy offending starfighters and incoming warheads. Once the fight ended, Tinoon Station thanked the crew of the Otana for their support in the battle and allowed them to pass the checkpoint without incident or inspection.

Once reunited, the two craft made their way to Destreg Spaceport in orbit around the planet Destreg II, where Antan believe the Highroller would be passing through. Indeed, shortly after the brothers' arrival, the yacht, along with an escort of R-41 Starchasers, entered the system. The fighters turned to engage an oncoming Otana, but, rather than fight them, Ace piloted the craft through the fighter screen; Emkay, expecting a fight, was impressed with the Alliance pilot's tactics.

This plan worked without much hassle, though an escort of Preybird-class starfighters entered the system and began attacking the docked light freighter. MK-09 expressed a desire to enter one of the turrets to fend off this threat but was unable to as he was downloading data from the bulk freighter; instead, Ace took to the turrets to repel the attacking mercenaries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once Aeron had completed the download and reboarded the ship, the sliced coordinates were entered into the Otana's navigation computer and the trio set off. Unfortunately for the Azzameens, the flight log had altered, as noted by Emkay; rather than a mercenary base, the Azzameens found themselves in the midst of a collection of Star Destroyers firing their turbolasers. MK-09's sensors indicated that the YT-2000 had entered the Carida Training Facility instead of their intended destination. Ordered to stand down, the Imperial Star Destroyers continued their bombardment of the target\u2014now including the Otana\u2014forcing Ace into a series of evasive maneuvers to give Emkay time to create a new exit vector. In addition to finding an escape route, MK-09 managed to identify the five Star Destroyers.

Aeron decided to check through the flight logs aboard the platform, leaving Ace in the gunnery station and Emkay managing the download. With the information on the Redhawk's whereabouts collected and input into the navicomputer, the Otana left, avoiding station defenses, and entered hyperspace. Upon arrival at these new coordinates the trio was stunned to find that the mercenary base holding the Hurrim mercenaries was none other than their own former home, Azzameen Station. The station had been renamed \"Falcon's Nest\" and a scattered assortment of craft and static defenses now occupied the sector; Ace flew the Otana close enough to inspect the station, prompting several mercenary fighters to engage the freighter. Though Ace immediately attempted to engage this offensive presence\u2014feelings shared by Emkay\u2014Aeron simply wanted to return to the Liberty and inform the Rebellion so that a proper counterattack could commence.

Together with Emon in the Andrasta, the strike team left the Liberty and made the jump back to the mercenary base.

This time, the droid accompanied Ace, secretly transporting a strike team in the Sabra, to secure the Lambda-class T-4a shuttle Tydirium and Imperial codes contained within the vessel for use in future Alliance missions. MK-09 managed communications with Imperial officers as the Sabra made its way through a customs checkpoint en route to Zhar; this allowed Ace to concentrate on his piloting, as a passing patrol could identify the Sabra's mission.

Once again, Emkay managed to stall the probing Imperial officer long enough for the commandos to finish their mission. However, though the officer may not have realized the real reason for the delay, he did determine it was worth looking into. Ace didn't give the Imperials a chance as he left the hangar, TIE fighters in pursuit. As the Tydirium exited the station undetected, the Sabra hailed Rogue Squadron, which entered the system and engaged the Imperial starfighters. Once the hijacked shuttle made the jump to lightspeed, the Sabra and the Rogues broke their dogfight and exited Zhar space.

The Azzameen children and MK-09 immediately demanded answers about Antan's presence in the battle to retake the station, though the overly chatty MK-09 was later switched off at the insistence of short-tempered Emon. The droid remained off for the duration of the conversation; Antan explained that he was working with the Empire in order to restore Twin Suns Transport Services and negotiate the release of Tomaas and Galin, whom Antan revealed were alive, though imprisoned in Kessel Station. Antan insisted that the Azzameen children depart for the Kessel system at once as he had organized the captured Azzameens' release.

As the Big Score left, MK-09 was tasked with finding a new exit vector, as the Star Destroyer had successfully managed to block the previously calculated coordinates. The task was made much more difficult due to the close presence of the Maw, a multitude of black holes which made quick hyperspace calculations all but impossible. It was only the timely arrival of the Deadman's Hand and Dunari that allowed the Otana to escape; Dunari provided the Azzameen ships coordinates to exit the Kessel system and reach the relative safety of an Imperial asteroid ore processing plant.
