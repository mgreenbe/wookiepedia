In 0 BBY, she was a member of Operation Fracture Oversight which was made up of eight of the leading members of Operation Fracture, a mission conducted by the Alliance to extract the Imperial scientist Galen Erso and have him testify to the Imperial Senate about a rumored Imperial planet killer. In a report to Operation Fracture Oversight, Alliance Chancellor Mon Mothma reported that one of her contacts in the Imperial Senate had informed her that Imperial forces were evacuating the moon Jedha and that a there was a rumored energy burst in the moons orbit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mothma asked the members of the Oversight if they had any new information on Operation Fracture. Ria replied that they did not and asked if Mothma had told the contact about the rumors of a planet killer, speculating that it could be an fishing attempt by the Empire to judge the reaction to a false story. In reality, Jedha had been devastated by the rumored superweapon, the battle station Death Star.

The leadership soon gathered again to plan an attack on the Empire's amassing loyalist forces, which had been located at the desert planet Jakku. During the meeting, Ria questioned how long the Empire had been based at Jakku to gain a perspective on how entrenched their forces may be. Chief of Intelligence Airen Cracken answered that estimates suggested three to six months while reports on the Empire's fleet strength were yet to arrive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ria was first mentioned in novelization for the 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, written by Alexander Freed and released on the same day as the film.
