Renamed Corusca Rainbow, the ship and its crew were given a vital role in the siege of Coruscant. The Corusca Rainbow was to exit at the edge of the Coruscant system before the main fleet to determine if Rogue Squadron had successfully downed Coruscant's planetary shields. If it detected no shields, it would allow the fleet to exit directly above Coruscant; if the shields were intact, it would activate its gravity well generators to pull the fleet from hyperspace and avoid its defenses. Rogue Squadron brought the shields down at the last minute, allowing the Rainbow just enough time to power down the generators and join the fight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Early in the Yuuzhan Vong War, the Corusca Rainbow was assigned to the defense of Agamar.
