While he was on the planet Ruusan, the man fought during the fifth battle of the Ruusan campaign and was heavily wounded after the forces of the Army of Light defeated the Sith. The Sith Lord Darth Bane, who did not participate in the battle, found the man dying and being comforted by the native Bouncers.

Two years later, the man was promoted to the rank of Sith Lord in Skere Kaan's Brotherhood of Darkness, due to the increasing need for Sith Lords to combat the Jedi Order's Army of Light. He, along with most of the other apprentices at the Academy, was sent to the planet Ruusan, and eventually participated in the campaign's fifth battle, which resulted in a loss for the Brotherhood. During the conflict, the Sith Lord's lightsaber was destroyed and he was grievously injured in his stomach area, although he managed to support himself by resting on some rocks. Four Bouncers\u2014members of a telepathic species native to Ruusan\u2014also began projecting thoughts of peace and serenity in the injured man's mind."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The man encountered the Sith Lord Darth Bane, who had been one of his fellow students on Korriban, after the latter arrived on Ruusan near the site of the battle. Realizing that a report from Kaan stating that Bane had perished was untrue, the man expressed his delight in being able to die in what he felt was a glorious fight, a feeling with which Bane did not agree. The man tugged at Bane's heel as he turned to leave, but Bane lifted his boot and stomped the man's head in the rocks that were propping him up, revealing to the man before killing him that he had claimed the title of \"Darth,\" which had been banned by Kaan in an attempt to prevent infighting in his organization. Bane went on to manipulate Kaan into destroying the Brotherhood of Darkness, and secretly established a new order of Sith Lords, limiting the Sith to a Master and an apprentice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith Lord was a light-skinned Human male who had a red circular tattoo which covered part of his forehead.
