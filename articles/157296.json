In 2 BBY, he and two other scout troopers located the movement's leader, Twi'lek freedom fighter Cham Syndulla, and gave chase to him and his companion, the soldier Numa. Piloting 614-AvA speeder bikes and escorting a K79-S80 Imperial Troop Transport, the troopers pursued the Twi'leks and their blurrg mounts through the Ryloth deserts. The scout narrowly avoided a thermal detonator thrown by Numa that exploded in front of one of his fellow biker scouts, killing the rider. Following this act of aggression, the remaining scouts opened fire on the insurgents. The second biker was also killed after being thrown off course by Numa's blurrg, leaving only the one scout and the troop transport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Twi'leks soon reached a dead end, finding themselves at the edge of a steep cliff near the Tulara Ravine. As the trooper closed in, however, the VCX-100 light freighter Ghost descended from the north, having pushed through the Imperial blockade above the planet's surface. The ship was piloted by Cham's daughter, Hera Syndulla, who requested that her companions on the ground turn back toward the Imperials so that she might extract them. The trooper brought his speeder bike to a halt and ordered the troop transport to fire on the incoming starship. Despite their combined effort, the Imperials' firepower was not enough, and the Ghost blasted the troop transport, leaving the biker scout alone to deal with the enemies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Twi'leks rode past the trooper, gaining enough ground to guide their blurrgs up the Ghost's front boarding ramp and into its loading bay. The scout was able to drive in front of the freighter while the ramp was still down, giving him time to hit the brakes on his bike and fly into the ship before its doors closed. The trooper had successfully caught up with his quarries, a victory that swiftly turned into a defeat; once inside the freighter, the scout was immediately met with raised blasters from the Twi'leks, who were now reinforced by Syndulla's rebel cell, the Spectres. The largest of the rebels, a Lasat named Garazeb Orrelios, mocked the trooper's lack of judgement before knocking him unconscious with hearty punch."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Impersonated"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having never acquired a scout trooper's helmet before, Ezra Bridger, a Jedi Padawan who flew with the Spectres, took possession of the biker's armor. After rescuing her father, Hera planned to retrieve a priceless belonging, their family's Kalikori, from the office of Imperial Captain Slavin. In order to infiltrate the Imperial headquarters in the Tann Province, Bridger donned the trooper's uniform and escorted Hera into the base disguised as a native prisoner. Their plan was complicated by Grand Admiral Thrawn, who deduced the true identities of Syndulla and Bridger. After rigging the building to explode, the two managed to escape with their lives, though Bridger lost the trooper's helmet along the way."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The trooper was determined in his efforts to capture Syndulla, refusing to give up his pursuit of the fugitive even after each of his companions was killed. The scout's willpower saw him through in boarding the Ghost, where he excitedly exclaimed upon catching up to his enemies.
