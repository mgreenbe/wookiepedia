That year, the Human female Jori Daragon, who was imprisoned on Ronika, stole a drone ore shuttle on the planet's surface and attempted to escape the harsh world and return to Koros Major, her homeworld. However, a guard on Ronika's surface notified the security station of the escape attempt and ordered it to intercept Daragon. The security station launched two starfighters, piloted by two individuals who felt certain that no prisoner could escape Ronika, to pursue Daragon; however, due to the fighters' laser cannons being ineffective against the ore shuttle's heavy shielding, the young woman was able to escape to Koros Major."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To date, the orbital security station has only appeared in the second issue of The Fall of the Sith Empire story arc of the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi series of comic books.
