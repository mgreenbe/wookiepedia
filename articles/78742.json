At the top was a city-like structure, which was home to entertainment and recreational facilities for travelers. Below that was a platform with dozens of space docks for smaller ships. These space docks had a modular construction, and could easily be reconfigured for starships of various classes and sizes. At the bottom was a hexagonal latticework structure, which acted as a drydock for large capital ships (such as Star Destroyers). Repulsorlift tubes and corridors led from the main drydock and the smaller docking bays into the main part of the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Kwenn system was on the outer edge of the Mid Rim near a major hyperspace route, the station acted as the last major supply depot and refueling station for starships heading for the Outer Rim of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the wake of the Invasion of Naboo, a Republic arsenal ship, which had been transporting several Trade Federation battle droids for destruction at a Republic decommissioning facility, had gone missing.
