A frequent theme of the genre is that, unless the villain's body is explicitly seen in the end, they aren't assumed to be dead by the audience even if the villain in-universe is believed to be dead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a briefing in 1 BBY relating to discoveries that might link to the Celestial-Rakata War, Imperial Navy Admiral Conan Antonio Motti mockingly stated to Dr. Insmot Bowen, a researcher for pre-Republic era studies at the Obroan Institute for Archaeology giving the briefing, that he re-evaluated his expertise to be for holothrillers as well as for science fiction. Bowen would later use Motti's earlier reference to the work, specifically the aspect of a villain's body not being present to mean survival, to infer that the Celestials may have had a chance of surviving."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 6 ABY, holothrillers were also made relating to Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. Skywalker, however, cited many historical inaccuracies in two of the films: Luke Skywalker and the Dragons of Tatooine and Luke Skywalker and the Jedi's Revenge, the latter of which he took particular exception to due to its depiction of him killing Darth Vader to avenge Emperor Palpatine, expressing disgust at it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Holothrillers were first mentioned in the 2008 novel Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor by Matthew Stover.
