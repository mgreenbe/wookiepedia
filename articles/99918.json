Floatboats carrying passengers and cargo down the canals were a common sight in the district, while pedestrians were relegated to using sidewalks and bridges to get around. Smugglers, local dissidents against the Tundei Tribunal and other less-than-lawful types congregated on the outskirts of the Old Patch in places like the LoBue Cantina."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
