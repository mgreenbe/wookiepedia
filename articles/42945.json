Its keel was laid down in the Barancar shipyards, and it was destroyed during the First Battle of Vontor. The ship was replaced by the Deathknell, which met a similar fate at the Third Battle of Vontor. Its cold splinters continued to drift through space long after the battle ended."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Popularly portrayed as an enormous ship, images of the Eibon Scimitar later inspired the Galactic Republic's Invincible-class Dreadnaught Heavy Cruiser. Despite its depiction as a gargantuan vessel, military historians agreed that the Eibon Scimitar would qualify as a heavy cruiser under the Anaxes War College System."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
