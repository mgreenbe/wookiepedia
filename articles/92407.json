Nadon was a renowned botanist amongst other Ithorians and the Ithorian species was in general considered to be very skilled in this particular subject. He was therefore able to grow and sustain plants native to the tropical planet of Ithor in the dry and unforgiving climate of Tatooine. It was located in the mountains south of the Mos Eisley spaceport. Being a sympathizer of the Rebel Alliance, Nadon allowed Rebel operatives to hide there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
