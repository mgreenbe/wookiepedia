The cub was taken in by his aunt, and grew up dreaming of joining the Trianii Rangers, the elite law enforcement troops that defended the Trianii colonies he called home. Keeheen began training in preparation for his future career from an early age, and after a childhood where he excelled in both athletics and academics, he became the youngest fully commissioned Trianii Ranger in history. Not long after, he met the love of his life, when he introduced himself to a young Trianii woman named Atuarre who had caught his eye while she was watching Ranger training. Keeheen proposed marriage on the spot, and while she turned him down, they exchanged contact information and stayed in touch over the next two years. Keeheen continued to propose frequently, and eventually, Atuarre accepted and the two were wed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Keeheen and Atuarre welcomed their first cub, a boy named Pakka, soon after. At Keeheen's urging, Atuarre even joined the Rangers herself, finding that her background in dance prepared her brilliantly for training in the Trianii martial arts. Together, they were assigned to the frontier world of Fibuli, a flashpoint in the long-running conflict between the Trianii and the neighboring Corporate Sector Authority. Although the early days of their patrol on Fibuli were relatively uneventful\u2014the pair mostly spent their time busting thionarx dealers and herdbeast rustlers\u2014that all changed in 2 BBY, when the Corporate Sector Authority moved in force to annex Fibuli. Keeheen and his wife immediately took up arms as part of the local Trianii resistance, but they were overwhelmed in a matter of months, and both Keeheen and his cub were captured. Over the coming weeks, Keeheen was tortured relentlessly, but refused to give up the names of the resistance's ringleaders. Ultimately, while Atuarre managed to rescue Pakka in a daring raid on an Authority transport, Keeheen became one of many around the Corporate Sector to seemingly vanish into thin air."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unbeknownst to his family, Keeheen, along with hundreds of other prisoners, were secretly shipped to a experimental prison facility known as Stars' End, located on the desolate asteroid Mytus VII. There, he was placed in a stasis booth to ride out his prison sentence in a dreamless sleep. However, his family had not forgotten him: Atuarre and Pakka joined a group of friends and family of the recently disappeared of the Corporate Sector, in order to find and free Keeheen and the other prisoners. Over the coming months, they managed to uncover the existence and location of Stars' End, and along with infamous Corellian smuggler Han Solo, staged a jailbreak. The invaders forced a massive power plant failure which freed the prisoners from stasis, and in the rush to escape, Keeheen joyously reunited with his wife and cub. However, Solo had become separated from the rest of the group, and Keeheen\u2014fearing that his cub would volunteer if he didn't\u2014joined up with several others to go back for him. Keeheen fought his way through Security Police troops and caught up with Solo in the smoking corridors of the prison, and together made their way off the station in Solo's ship, the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the months after the liberation of Stars' End, Keeheen and Atuarre decided to settle down, taking a year off from active duty to give their traumatized cub a chance to heal.

The image of a Trianii Ranger standing up against those responsible stuck with him throughout his life and shaped his strong sense of justice, and from that moment on he dreamed of becoming a Ranger himself, to being what he saw as the only people in the Trianii colonies who stood for something. Keeheen dedicated himself completely to his dream, only to fall in love along the way: the sleek and graceful Atuarre captivated him, leading the open and forthright Trianii Ranger to propose at the first opportunity. Ultimately, it was Atuarre who rescued him from his imprisonment on Stars' End, and Keeheen was overjoyed to see his family united again, feeling incredible relief in knowing that his family was safe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Keeheen first appeared in Han Solo at Stars' End, a novel written by Brian Daley and released in 1979, and was pictured by Alfredo Alcala in the story's comic adaptation.
