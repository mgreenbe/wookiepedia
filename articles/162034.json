After coming upon a destroyed Rebel archaeological site, the team searched the area, discovering a well crafted tunnel that led deep into the planet's crust. Voss followed the team into the tunnel where they were attacked by the Guardian of Forever. Due to the combined efforts of the team, they were able to collapse the tunnel on top of it, delaying its advance. Grau decided to put Voss on watch, to signal the rest of the team, should the beast return. Unfortunately for the trooper, the beast was able to break through the rubble and attacked Voss, throwing him from the heights of one of the city's bridges."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
