During her childhood she became good friends with another Lothal-native, the street urchin Ezra Bridger, who was the same age as her. When Krai was fourteen, the Empire condemned her family's farm and took it from them, as the Imperials needed the land for an extension of their mining operation. Krai's parents then swiftly decided that it was time for them to leave Lothal, and arranged for the whole family to move to the planet Alderaan to live with Krai's grandmother."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The move happened so fast that Krai did not have time to contact Bridger, but she ran into him at Capital City spaceport as she was queuing to board a transport offworld. She explained to her friend what had happened and asked why he was at the spaceport and if he wanted to leave Lothal. The urchin explained that he was there selling tickets for a gladiatorial event and that he did not plan on leaving, then the pair said their goodbyes and Krai was called back to the ship by her father."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Krai became upset when saying goodbye to Bridger and began to cry; however, he managed to cheer her up again before she left.
