The suit provided armoring for the wearer's torso and legs, as well as a blast helmet. The armor incorporated an infrared motion tracking system, with a range of 30 meters, that could detect any object 10 kilograms or greater moving faster than one meter per second. When tripped, the system would trigger an audio alarm which, if not run through the blast helmet, could be easily heard. A common modification to the suit would be to decrease the alarm's volume or replace it with a more discreet sound."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A modified version of it was sold under the name of Cresh Luck armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
