Built in the shape of a bowl, it had at least two windows, a functioning door, and a trapdoor in the floor. Leading from the moon's surface to the fort was a crudely constructed ladder. The fort's conical roof was supported by vertical beams. As time passed, the fort became structurally weaker, developing cracks and leaks in the roof as boards began falling off."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Built by 3 ABY, the fort was constructed on the branch of a massive, hollow tree but was eventually abandoned, and several pieces of furniture, including a round table, were left behind. At some point, a Shriek named Larry, who had run away from home, took up residence in the tree upon which the fort was built; the Shriek assumed the persona of an evil forest spirit to frighten away potential intruders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the day of the Harvest Festival in 3 ABY, the Ewoks Wicket Wystri Warrick and Teebo absconded from Bright Tree Village to escape their parents' rules. They stumbled upon the old tree fort, and Warrick suggested making it their new home. However, the structure was in poor condition, so the Ewoks spent the day reattaching broken boards and preparing their new home for permanent occupation by setting up hammocks and cooking food on a makeshift stove. When fellow Ewoks Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka and Latara came to the fort and attempted to convince their friends to return home, Warrick turned them away, convinced that he and Teebo would be fine on their own. As the weather turned rainy, Warrick sent Teebo to find dinner. Warrick continued to clean the fort until Teebo returned with three creatures known as the Kagles, who lived near the fort. Teebo\u2014having eaten at the Kagles' home and having brought nothing for Warrick\u2014sat at the table for a game of Trok with the Kagles, who told him they were surprised that the Shrieks had given the Ewoks permission to stay at the tree fort. When the Ewoks told them they had no knowledge of the Shrieks, however, the Kagles fled in fear. Teebo suggested that he and Warrick return home, but Warrick, more worried about being laughed at by his fellow Ewoks than the threat of the Shrieks, convinced Teebo that they should stay and deal with the Shrieks themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That night, the two Ewoks prepared several traps and waited by lamplight as an ominous cackling sound filled the air. When Warrick extinguished the lamp's flame, a Shriek named Larry entered the fort, now in total darkness, and a scuffle ensued. Warrick reignited the lamp, and the Ewoks briefly saw a figure fleeing through the door of the fort. However, when they attempted to follow, they were ensnared by one of their own traps, which prevented them from reaching the door and instead propelled them through the air back to where they had been assaulted. When the Ewoks landed, the fort's floor collapsed, and the Ewoks tumbled to the ground. They again saw something enter the hollow tree through its base, and they pursued and caught the figure. The Shriek introduced himself as Larry and explained that he had been haunting the area ever since he ran away from home several years earlier. When he eventually returned home, Larry continued, he found that his entire tribe had left. Warrick and Teebo, moved by Larry's story, resolved to abandon the fort and return home for the Harvest Festival; they invited Larry along with them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tree fort makes its first appearance in \"Home is Where the Shrieks Are,\" the third episode of the second season of the Ewoks television series.
