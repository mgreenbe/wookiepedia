The whole mission had been engineered by the Jedi Council, Corellian Jedi, Rostek Horn and Lorfo to convince the Seperatists they had the real information when in fact the true data was already in the hands of the Republic.The Jedi intially planned to implant fake memories into the unconscious Tendir's mind convincing him that he had succeeded in getting the data, but realised that Dooku would probe his mind to find out the truth. Instead, Lorfo convinced Tendir that he'd killed Ylenic but that Aayla was still after him and he had to escape. Aayla pretended to pursue him and Tendir escaped, delivering the false information to the Confederacy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
