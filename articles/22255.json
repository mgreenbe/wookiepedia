Ponds was bred from the genetic template of the human bounty hunter Jango Fett. During the Clone Wars, he served under the command of Jedi General Mace Windu in the Grand Army of the Republic. On Geonosis, Commander Ponds arranged for five special commando units to follow Windu's orders during the first battle of the war. Specializing in military reconnaissance, Ponds was the commander of Lightning Squadron, a division of Advanced Recon Force Scout Troopers in the 91st Mobile Reconnaissance Corps."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the conflict between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems spread across the galaxy, Ponds accompanied Windu on a Republic Military campaign to the Outer Rim planet of Ryloth in order to liberate the Twi'lek homeworld. There he fought alongside Windu with the support of Lightning Squadron, including troopers CT-6910 \"Razor\" and \"Stak.\" After joining forces with the Twi'lek Resistance, Ponds and Windu led a direct assault on the capital city of Lessu, captured Emir Wat Tambor and ultimately lifted the Separatist occupation of Ryloth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to the campaign on Ryloth, Ponds participated in the Battle of Malastare where he assisted Windu in the capture of a Zillo Beast.

After the Republic warship crashed on the surface of Vanqor\u2014having been sabotaged by Fett\u2014Ponds was taken prisoner by Fett's mercenary allies along with Admiral Kilian and a clone navigation officer. He was executed shortly afterward by Aurra Sing in an attempt to lure Windu into a trap.

By modifying Fett's genetic structure, the Kaminoans accelerated the clones' aging process so that they would reach maturity within a decade of their inception. Around the same time, the Republic was on the verge of civil war due to a growing secessionist movement that ultimately led to the creation of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. As a result, Ponds and his brethren were pressed into service as the backbone of the newly-formed Grand Army of the Republic in 22 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike many of the other Clone Commanders, Ponds did not receive ARC training, though as a part of the first batch of clone trooper officers, Ponds was trained by Jango Fett himself, as well as other senior instructors. By the end of his training, Ponds was specialized in military reconnaissance, but notably was not briefed on how to interact with Jedi high command and was also not selected to be part of the program that trained clone officers on how to work as liaisons between Jedi Generals and clone troopers.

During the battle, he provided Jedi Master Mace Windu with five special commando units when Windu requested it from him. From that point, Ponds served with General Windu as his preferred liaison and second-in-command. Although his training lacked instructions on how to interact with the Jedi like the adjutants Prime Minister Lama Su introduced to Yoda, Ponds was able to gain the trust of Windu. Ponds found himself in a role interacting with high command despite not being briefed on it, and Windu kept the trooper by his side throughout the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one point in the battle on Geonosis, Commander Ponds was on the command bridge of a SPHA-T walker, directing efforts with a Clone Captain on the walker's bridge after Yoda ordered the artillery walkers to focus their attack on the nearest Separatist core ship, successfully bringing it crashing towards the surface. Following the ship's crash and ensuing sand storm, Ponds and the other clone troopers were glad that their helmets had a respiration filter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Republic victory on Geonosis, Ponds remained at Windu's side as the Clone Wars spread across the galaxy, and when Windu took permanent command of the 91st Mobile Reconnaissance Corps, Commander Ponds would go with him.

At Windu's direction, Ponds ordered Lightning Squadron to engage the Separatists and although they succeeded in destroying the tanks, the casualties they sustained necessitated the need for reinforcements. To that end, Windu sought out Cham Syndulla to form an alliance with the Twi'lek Resistance while Ponds remained with the main force. After discovering a local village populated by women and children, Ponds intended to provide them with some of the army's rations, only to witness the village's destruction by a group of Separatist Hyena-class Droid Bombers.

Working in conjunction with the native Dug population, as well as Anakin Skywalker and Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\" of the 501st Legion, Ponds' clone troopers defended Malastare against an army of Separatist battle droids. During the battle, the Republic field-tested an experimental superweapon called the electro-proton bomb, which could release an electromagnetic pulse disabling the Separatists' droids while causing no harm to the clones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the bomb also had an adverse effect on the environment of Malastare, causing parts of the surface to break and form a large sinkhole in the center of the battlefield. Following the battle, Ponds formed a search party with Windu and clone troopers Trapper and Hawkeye and traveled into the pit to rescue survivors. In the course of their search, they encountered the Zillo Beast, a large creature that had been awoken from its slumber by the detonation of the bomb. Ponds, Trapper, and Hawkeye opened fire, but the creature's skin proved impervious to blasters and even lightsabers. After Ponds, Windu, and Trapper escaped from the sinkhole, the Republic succeeded in capturing the Zillo Beast by using several RX-200 Falchion-class assault tanks to incapacitate it."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Service aboard the Endurance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the Clone Wars, Ponds joined Windu and Skywalker aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Endurance, commanded by Admiral Kilian of the Republic Navy.

After failing to assassinate Windu, who killed Jango in single combat on Geonosis, Boba sabotaged the Endurance in order to escape the vessel.

While Windu and Skywalker conducted search and rescue, Windu commented that Ponds had been on the bridge, and when a Pelta-class frigate was ready to depart with the survivors, Windu commented that they must assume Ponds and the rest of the officers were lost. While traveling through space, Sing executed Ponds, whose death Windu and Skywalker witnessed through a holographic transmission that was sent to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.
