The station was used to care for their wounded clone troopers. In the aftermath of the Second Battle of Geonosis, Jedi Padawans Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee were sent to the station to collect medical supplies to be delivered to Jedi General Mace Windu's forces on Dantooine, but their journey was disrupted by an infestation of Geonosian brain worms onboard their starship, who infected the clones of Tango Company.
