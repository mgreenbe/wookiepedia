Nagaks required a rowing crew of about a dozen in addition to between two and four stabmen with harpoons. Because of the necessity of stealth, a nagak did not use a repulsor or propeller engine. The styanax were clever hunters and also clever prey and could sense powered watercraft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
