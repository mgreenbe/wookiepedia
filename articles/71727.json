During the Age of the Empire, she joined the Rebel Alliance. As a result, she was imprisoned by the Galactic Empire at Ashmead's Lock prison on the planet Kashyyyk. There, she was fitted with an inorganic bio-chip implant which turned her into an unwilling drone of Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax. In 5 ABY, Jonda and her fellow prisoners were liberated by a team led by Norra Wexley and Han Solo. During the Liberation Day celebrations on Chandrila, Jae-Talwar and the other prisoners involuntarily attacked New Republic politicians, officials, and military officers. Jae-Talwar attempted to attack Wexley, but was knocked unconscious in the process."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
