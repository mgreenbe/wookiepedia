According to legend, Idyth was thought to be a modest and upstanding Jedi, but only remained as such by burying his darker emotions within an amulet. The amulet's darkness consumed Idyth during the night, and he stalked the lower levels of the Coruscant Underworld, killing individuals there. Idyth was eventually killed by an assassin on the planet Ixilix, and his belongings, including the amulet, were recovered. The amulet was given to Idyth's Padawan, Sol Mogra, who eventually also became influenced by the artifact."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
