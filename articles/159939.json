Holding a higher rank than her colleague, Merven Getter, Carann felt that she did not need to do her job as long as Getter did his, often reading Jedi romances on her datapad. This attitude resulted in some animosity between them, with Getter often wishing she would do more to help him. Carann and Getter were working aboard the space station when several anomalies exited hyperspace, threatening to strike the inhabited bodies of the star system. Carann's lackadaisical attitude meant that she did not know what to do in the situation, but Getter helped her by doing the analysis of the anomalies while Carann simply tracked them. Carann and Getter sent out a system-wide alert shortly before one of the objects collided with the monitoring station, atomizing it and its crew."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
