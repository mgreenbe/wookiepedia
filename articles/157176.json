The aliens were equipped with legs and arms that were nearly twice the height of their own bodies. One well known member of the species was the criminal Fud Sang, an inmate at a maximum security prison located on the moon Oovo IV.

At least one member of the species, Fud Sang, exhibited a rather short height, deep purple skin, and eyes that were white with black irises. The species had two eyes which were placed at the end of two retractable and poseable eye-stalks which protruded from the tops of their bodies. They also had slender snouts which peaked underneath the stalks. A small mouth filled with flattened teeth sat at the end of the snout. Two nostrils existed above the mouth, on top of the snout."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition, the members of the species had four limbs, two which served as arms and two which served as legs. Each limb had four digits. The arms were considerably longer than the legs, and came from shoulders which stuck out of either side of the species' body. An elbow joint separated the upper arm from the lower arm and hand. Their short legs were bent inwards at the knee."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The species evolved somewhere in the galaxy, and by the year 32 BBY, during the final decades of the Galactic Republic, they had found themselves to be a part of the galactic community."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The species in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the year 32 BBY, the species had found their way into the galactic spotlight with the help of a male member of the species known as Fud Sang. Sang was a convicted criminal, and after being arrested by authorities, Sang was incarcerated at a maximum security prison located on the moon Oovo IV, a prison known as Desolation Alley. Sang would go on to serve four back-to-back life sentences for his crimes. However, the species' publicity was not all bad. Sang was allowed by the prison warden Fenn Booda to participate in the Podraces that Booda hosted at the Alley. Sang was talented enough to gain the favor of his fellow inmates, and he was eventually allowed to race on the ice planet of Ando Prime."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime before the Invasion of Naboo, which took place during 32 BBY, Sang was honored with a small replica of himself, which could be obtained by Podracing enthusiasts to display. One such enthusiast was the young slave boy Anakin Skywalker, who kept one of the Sang statues on his bedroom desk alongside the sculpture of a Ronto. The flag that Sang used to represent himself during races also eventually found it's way to Podracing courses located on the planet of Mon Calamari by the year 24 BBY. The flag was used to adorn a part of the Orotoru G'am course, specifically, the part of the track that led into the Hall of Heroes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The species appeared in the 1999 video game Star Wars Episode I: Racer under the guise of Fud Sang. Concept art for the species appeared on the StarWars.com Databank around 2001, appearing under the entry for Ody Mandrell. Despite the pre-production art, in the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, the species ultimately only appeared in the form of a small statue that could be seen during the scenes that took place in Anakin Skywalker's bedroom. The statue was later revealed by Pablo Hidalgo to be the species' only known member, Fud Sang."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a 2006 Star Wars: Blogs article titled Alien species concepts that became part of the SW universe written by Tim Veekhoven as a part of his Source Blog series, Fud Sang was mentioned as being a member of the Sanhueli species, hailing from Hueli IV. The blog detailed out several Podracer pilots who did not make into the final script for the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, using material that may have come form early draft material for The Phantom Menace. Due to the fact that the information was from early drafts of the film, and did not make it into the final cut, the information, including the names Sanhueli and Hueli IV, was considered non-canon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
