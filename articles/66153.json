With the approval of Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, Grand Admiral Rae Sloane contacted Chancellor Mon Mothma and Fleet Admiral Ackbar to negotiate peace. However, this was merely a ruse for Rax's planned attack on Chandrila. Before the talks could take place, Rax's agent Windom Traducier activated the former Ashmead's Lock inmates controller chips, who involuntarily attacked New Republic officials. This turned the New Republic leadership against any idea of ending the Civil War through diplomacy. Disagreeing with Rax's tactics, Sloane and the former Ashmead's Lock prisoner Brentin Lore Wexley joined forces to stop Rax, who mustered the remaining Imperial forces for a showdown at Jakku."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
