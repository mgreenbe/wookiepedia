It was primarily used for capturing those wanted as prisoners. Upon contact, the target would briefly turn a sharp blue as charged particles overloaded their nervous system, sending the receiver's biosigns wild. In less than a second, the target's nervous system would return to baseline as the electrical impulses forced the organism to mentally and physically reset due to the shock to their system. A similar process was used by medical anesthetics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon being knocked unconscious, the target would remain limp, unable to move and comprehend their surroundings. This effect usually lasted for several minutes before the organism regained consciousness; however, items such as stuncuffs could be bound to the individual while comatose, effectively capturing them. Despite widespread use across the galaxy, stunning a target was not perfect, with most victims experiencing nausea, dizziness and body aches for a short time after. While uncommon, irregular heartbeats and seizures could result from the procedure, and in rare cases, death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When used against droids with little or no armor, the target would be electrocuted and rendered inoperable for an indefinite amount of time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As opposed to traditional blaster bolts which could be reflected back at the shooter, stun shots would be dispersed when countered by a lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Blaster weaponry carried by the Canto Bight Police Department was set to stun by default, as the slightest injury to a bystander or suspect on Canto Bight could have costly legal and public-relations consequences."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
