Austin's early work in the industry included inking DC Comics' popular Batman series in the mid 1970s, but he gained even more prominence when he moved to Marvel Comics in 1977 to work with penciller John Byrne on the Uncanny X-Men just as the series was starting to earn a place as the industry's top-selling comic book. He began working on Marvel's Star Wars series when writer Archie Goodwin and penciller Carmine Infantino started their run in 1978, but Austin worked on only five issues before leaving the title. Later he worked with Byrne on another landmark series when they collaborated on the revamped Superman title in 1986. Austin also wrote and inked the Dark Horse comic adaptation of Splinter of the Mind's Eye produced in 1995."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars bibliography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Writer"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Inker"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover artist"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
