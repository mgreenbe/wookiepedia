The merchant then gave Kenobi his thermal detonator as a reward and advised him to use it on the Federation Armored Assault Tank that was blocking the way to the hangar housing the queen's ship.

There, he encountered Amidala herself, who was alive and had returned to the planet, personally leading the assault on Theed. The merchant informed Amidala of his earlier encounter with Kenobi and provided the queen with a stash of stockpiled weapons, including a proton missile launcher and ten flash-bang grenades.

The individual can first be encountered as a non-playable character in the fifth level of the game, titled \"Escape from Theed,\" in which the player controls Obi-Wan Kenobi. Since the encounter does not affect the game's storyline, the meeting with the merchant can be avoided entirely. If the merchant is encountered, the player can either leave him inside his cell or release him. In the latter scenario, it is also possible to kill the man right afterward."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unless the prisoner has been killed by Kenobi, the player\u2014this time controlling Queen Amidala\u2014can once again encounter him in the tenth level, titled \"Assault on Theed.\" If Kenobi did not encounter him previously or chose to keep him locked up, then the prisoner will still be located inside his cell. Amidala will then have the same options available to her, and she can either ignore his pleas and leave him imprisoned, can release and then kill him, or she can release him and let him live. However, if the prisoner has already been released by Kenobi, then Amidala will encounter him on a balcony outside his cell, and he will provide her with weapons. This article currently follows the latter version of events."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to a glitch in the game, if Amidala releases the merchant, lets him run to his waiting spot at the balcony, and then kills him, a new version of the merchant will respawn right next to his dead body.
