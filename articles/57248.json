The group conned targets out of their credits through rigged sabacc games, which they ran at a cantina Truuvik owned named Bovo's. Catrinna's role in the con was to lure in potential marks, either by directly inviting them to the game or by using more cunning methods if necessary. One tactic she used was appealing to their more heroic side, staging a violent argument with Grenzo, in which she pretended to owe her accomplice a large sum of credits. The act was meant to draw in potential targets who would step in a save Catrinna, promoting the Rodian to flee and the damsel in distress to spin a sob story about her debts in the hopes of being offered further aid. Catrinna would then suggest that her heroes could participate in a game of sabacc Grenzo planned to be part of, claiming they could split the profits to pay off her debt and still provide the marks with a reward."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
