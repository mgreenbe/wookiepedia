Pazda was concerned at Borga's willingness to ally with the Yuuzhan Vong, feeling that it would bring doom to Nal Hutta and the Hutts. He voiced his outrage at the deal, but seemed to be overruled by Borga since the Besadii kajidic was the most powerful among the Hutts at the time.\nSure enough, the Yuuzhan Vong proved to be better liars than Borga, launching an attack on Fondor, even though it was one of the Hutts premier spice markets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
