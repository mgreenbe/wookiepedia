Studying at the Coruscant Jedi Temple as an Initiate, Sha'Rhil ascended to the rank of Padawan after the Trade Federation's invasion of Naboo and the reemergence of the Sith. Assigned to a Jedi Master to continue training, Sha'Rhil constructed a blue-bladed lightsaber to wield throughout her career."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In response to the Sith's reappearance the Jedi High Council announced that it would open several outposts across the galaxy for supplemental group training. Assigning Padawan Sha'Rhil to Kashyyyk, the High Council placed Jedi Master Mavra Zane in command of her and a number of other students to travel to the Wookiee homeworld aboard a Consular-class cruiser. Upon the group's arrival, the students were greeted by Grand Master Yoda the Watchman of Kashyyyk, along with Masters Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Upon settling in at the new chapter house, the classes quickly began and the Padawan's continued on their path to knowledge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Sha'Rhil's time on the planet, the armies of the Commerce Guild, combined with Trandoshan slavers, attacked the planet and the Wookiee village near the chapter house. Rallying behind Masters Yoda and Zane, the apprentices were able to repel the Trandoshans with few casualties. Following Master Yoda's departure, the students were attacked again. This time, Master Zane and several students were captured while the chapter house and most of the apprentices were killed. Sha'Rhil, among the survivors, eventually found herself above Felucia on the Commerce Guild's capital ship, the Providence. After the Padawans and Zane were freed from captivity, the Jedi managed to escape aboard the Star Runner and make an emergency landing on the planet below. Joining with Mak Pra and the Felucian resistance movement, Sha'Rhil and her companions attempted to capture Commerce Guild Presidente Shu Mai and prevent her from attacking Coruscant with Trihexalon missiles. The Jedi rushed to Coruscant and smashed the Commerce Guild's fleet, ending the crisis and saving Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kasi Sha'Rhil appears in the \"Jedi Destiny\" portion of Kinect Star Wars, a 2012 Xbox-exclusive video game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
