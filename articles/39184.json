As the capital city of Kolatill, Domaz was the location of the planetary government\u2014this was usually the Kolatill Council, but Imperial Governor Tetrum ruled the planet from 0 ABY to 8 ABY in the name of both the Galactic Empire, and later, the warlord Moff Kentor Sarne. The city was divided into several districts, which included a capital district, several residential districts, and outlying neighborhoods. The heart of the city was dominated by a large park, and Domaz had at least one hospital within its limits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 ABY, Moff Kentor Sarne, Imperial ruler of the Kathol sector, appointed Governor Tetrum to oversee the planet of Kolatill. Acting on Sarne's orders, he placed the world under martial law, and turned the planet's extensive repulsorlift industry into a war machine to supply Sarne's forces with combat speeders. The Empire enforced martial law in Domaz along with all other settlements, arrested the Kolatill Council, and Tetrum used the city as his base. In 4 ABY, Moff Sarne seceded from the Empire, and established his own warlord regime that included Kolatill within its borders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 8 ABY, following news that Sarne had been ousted from the sector capital of Kal'Shebbol by New Republic forces, the population of Kolatill imprisoned their Imperial governor and declared their allegiance to the New Republic. In retaliation, the Imperial Ton-Falk-class escort carrier Kathol Protector arrived in-system and launched TIE bombers. They assaulted the city with conventional explosive weapons, leaving many areas reduced to rubble and much of the capital in flames. The Kolatill Council, having been restored to power with the incarceration of Governor Tetrum, sent out a distress call to the New Republic forces at Kal'Shebbol. The transmission was intercepted by the CR90 corvette FarStar, in orbit around the planet at the time. The corvette left for Kolatill immediately, while the newly-installed New Republic Governor Monjai promised to send medical relief ships as soon as she was able to."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the attack, the large park in the middle of the city was turned into an emergency landing field and aid station, with scores of makeshift tents for those who had been injured or made homeless during the attack. A teenager, Lon Bennor, took responsibility for organizing the recovery efforts, distributing medical aid and care to those who needed it. Another citizen named Tren oversaw the allotment of food to the survivors. Four days after the attack, the FarStar arrived in orbit, and sent shuttles with relief teams to the surface. They brought medical aid and supplies to assist in the recovery efforts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Recovery efforts around Domaz increased, with many citizens forming volunteer groups to tend to the injured, coordinate rescue efforts, and fight the many fires that burned around the city. Former Imperial soldiers who had been on the planet at the time assisted in the relief operations, discarding their weapons and joining the volunteer forces. Help arrived from other cities, as convoys ferried in food and medical supplies. However, the vehicles had to be guarded from wild animals and looters that sought to prey on the misfortune of the city. By night, wild creatures from beyond Domaz's limits came into the city to scavenge for food, forcing the citizens to post patrols and guards to safeguard the civilian refugee camps."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The city of Domaz had several notable residents, including Councilor Kause, one of the last surviving members of the Kolatill Council; Lon Bennor, a young teenager who organized medical relief efforts in the wake of the attack; and Tren, a middle-aged man who ran the food distribution service following the assault."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Domaz was created for the roleplaying adventure Omens by Bill Smith, which appeared in The DarkStryder Campaign, published by West End Games.
