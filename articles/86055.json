During the time of the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, Manari was ruled by tradition-bound leaders who had a very delicate political etiquette. In 19.5 BBY, during the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Republic forces fought in the Battle of Manari against an anti-Republic force. Jedi General Roan Shryne lost his second Padawan during the battle and as a result, the Jedi Master became disillusioned about the war and lost hope in the Jedi Council. After the end of the war, Manari was part of the Republic's successor regime, the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Manari was first mentioned in the November 2005 novel Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader.
