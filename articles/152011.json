The squad was sent to survey the astronomical object Opop Hibbedit, where the battle droid lieutenant reported to a T-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid. While the squad was in transit aboard a Multi-Troop Transport, the battle droid Q5-7070 fell out due to faulty fasteners. By the time that the squad surveyed a new area of Opop Hibbedit, Q5-7070 returned, and the lieutenant chastised him. Q5-7070 attempted to report his faulty moorings to the lieutenant, who ordered him aboard their transport. The fasteners remained unfixed, causing Q5-7070 to fall out again once the transport began moving."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
