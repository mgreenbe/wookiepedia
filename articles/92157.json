Designated as a portable self-propelled rocket delivery system, the RDP-12 could be loaded with either Type-12A anti-personnel rockets, or Type-12B gas capsule respectively; with the launcher capable of using either an internal magazine of 4 rockets or an external magazine of 20 rockets. A weapon with a moderate rate of fire, the launcher fired micro rockets; a burst fired rocket in comparison to a study burn rocket, which inflicted not only kinetic damage on impact, but also a small one meter explosion (Incendiary or gas respectively)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gundark's Fantastic Technology: Personal Gear misspells the launcher as the \"RPD-12.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
