Fast and nimble, the Z-6 model could maintain sustained flight, as well as offer the wearer short bursts of lift in order to gain a tactical advantage during combat. It had a maximum vertical height of seventy meters, and could be equipped with a top-loaded, rocket-firing missile."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the tactical advantages the Z-6 jetpack provided, the unit was vulnerable to external impact damage. A single strong blow with even a stick could conceivably ignite the jetpack, leading to a variety of performance issues, significant potential harm to the body of the wearer, and even death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
