After the Triumph lost its shields, the Mon Remonda engaged it with turbolaser and ion cannon fire, damaging it enough that assault shuttles were able to safely join in directly attacking it. The Triumph soon lost its power and started sliding back into the Coruscant atmosphere, forcing Onoma to use his tractor beams to pull it along and accelerate its orbit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some years later, the Mon Remonda served as the Solo Fleet flagship in the search for Warlord Zsinj. Mon Remonda provided enough firepower to foil Zsinj's attempt to capture a second Executor-class Star Dreadnought, the Razor's Kiss, destroying the ship and heavily damaging the warlord's flagship, Iron Fist. Mon Remonda also suffered relatively heavy damage. After repairs at the Fondor Shipyards, it played a pivotal role in the climactic Battle of Selaggis that signaled the end of the campaign."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mon Remonda carried four squadrons of starfighters.
