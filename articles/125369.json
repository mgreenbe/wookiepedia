The Frezhlix justification was the Sif'krie's opposition to the Drashtine Initiative in their sector assembly, demanding that the Bothans pay reparations for the destruction of Caamas. Up to 20% of their yearly pommwomm production was at risk of being wiped out, but the blockade was broken by New Republic forces under Wedge Antilles and Garm Bel Iblis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
