Around 1 ABY, a smuggler by the name Cal Handro came to the Bothan because he was trying to get information on who was out to kill him. Wire discovered that the pilot was wanted dead by Trussk, a slavemaster of the Blackscale Clan who considered that Handro was interfering in their business by shipping slaves for a rival Trandoshan clan. A few days after Wire talked to him, the smuggler was shot down above Naboo's moon of Rori and disappeared. Spacers recruited by both the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire quickly started to search for the missing pilot. The spacers eventually encountered Wire in the Dearic Cantina. The Bothan information broker accepted to share information about Cal Handro but first requested them to help him with a job. The spacers therefore traveled to the Corellian system and successfully defended the freighter of a smuggler working for Wire against attacks from Black Sun pirates. In exchange, the Bothan gave the location of Trussk's fortress on Naboo to the spacers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wire was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts.
