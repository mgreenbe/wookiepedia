Once there, Greedo told a Weequay to go get the prisoner. Meanwhile, one of the bounty hunters that accompanied Greedo in his kidnapping earlier was also at the bar, talking to this Quarren. The bounty hunter soon grew suspicious when he noticed Greedo with Ion and Baron Papanoida, who pretended to be agents from the Trade Federation. Seconds after, the Weequay came back to the bar with Papanoida's daughter, who immediately called him \"father\" which destroyed his cover, causing massive bar shootout to ensue. This Quarren attempted to shoot Ion Papanoida, but was knocked unconscious when Che Amanwe hit him in the head with a bottle and stole his weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This character is the only cantina patron to survive the shootout, with the exception of Greedo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
