He began his career as chief bartender officer in the reclamation cruiser Two-For-One. In this capacity, he traveled the galaxy, indulged his snit-spore habit, and learned a great deal of useless trivia. He went by the nickname Mace Windu, possibly in reference to the Human Jedi by that name who had won the Battle of Skor II in 21 BBY and become a hero to the Squib people."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Two-for-One visited Mos Eisley on Tatooine, Macemillian-winduart\u00e9 left the ship to meet with some locals. He got delayed at Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, and the cruiser left without him. Suddenly alone in an unknown place, the Squib was forced to accept odd jobs to get by."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He eventually became indebted to Aguilae, a Jawa who ran a business called Jawa Traders in the spaceport. Aguilae was having trouble managing the business, so she took Macemillian-winduart\u00e9 on as a salesman and forgave his debts in return. He mainly worked at her droid store in Mos Eisley."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While at work one day, the Squib trader acquired an accounting droid known as CZ-3. Unbeknownst to Mace, however, the criminal businessman Opun \"Black Hole\" Mcgrrrr was looking for the droid because it had information that he wanted to use to blackmail Jabba Desilijic Tiure. Aguilae made the best of the situation and sold the droid before Mcgrrrr could find it at her store. Aguilae had second thoughts, however, and soon after decided to recover the droid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "CZ-3 was by this time on a Jawa Sandcrawler run by Het Nkik's tribe. Aguilae and Macemillian-winduart\u00e9 tracked the droid there, but CZ-3 was no longer present. Instead, they found Imperial stormtroopers. The two barely escaped with their lives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The name Mace Windu dates to the earliest incarnation of Star Wars, a 13-page treatment written by George Lucas in 1973.
