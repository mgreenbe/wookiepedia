The park consisted of a large preserve made up of rock and flower gardens, rolling hills and isolated groups of trees. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, the area was some of the most undeveloped and valuable real estate on all of Estalle island. By this time a large tea house named the Greenhouse had opened within the park. Built with a view of the sea, the tea house was considered a highlight of the preserve."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ganza park was first mentioned in the campaign guide included in Lords of the Expanse, a 1997 supplement written by Paul Sudlow and Chris Doyle for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game by West End Games."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
