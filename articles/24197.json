Two types of catapults that greatly impacted galactic history were energy catapults, employed by the Gungan Grand Army to launch their energy ball ordnance at the Trade Federation Army during the Battle of Naboo in 32 BBY, and the catapults used by the Ewoks to launch their more primitive rock projectiles and burning rocks at the occupying Imperial force during the Battle of Endor. In 36 ABY during the Battle of Tenupe, the Great Swarm Killik army used catapults, magcannons and other primitive weapons to try to take down Chiss perimeter shields."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
