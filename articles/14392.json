The object of the battle for the Imperial factions was to gain control of a reconnaissance report of the Core Worlds compiled by the Black Curs. The New Republic forces sought to deliver the report to the New Republic Intelligence Service."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Six months after the Battle of Endor, forces loyal to the Imperial Advisors in the Core Worlds were pursuing the Black Curs mercenary organization, after the mercenaries were uncovered on an extensive reconnaissance mission for the New Republic. The pursuit led to the Moorja system where Dirk Harkness, leader of the Black Curs, had stashed a Y-wing that he hoped to escape in."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the two Imperial-class Star Destroyers led by Imperial Advisor Bregius Golthan were not the only force seeking the Black Curs. Moff Utoxx Prentioch, a pretender to the Imperial throne and rogue Warlord, also sought to capture the Black Curs in order to use their reconnaissance report for his own gain. As such, two Imperial-class Star Destroyers from Prentioch's forces attacked Goltan's forces in the system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the four Star Destroyers exchanged salvos and their respective TIE fighters engaged in dogfighting, the Last Chance containing the Black Curs was lit by a turbolaser blast and crash landed on the planet. At this point, a small force dispatched by General Airen Cracken arrived in the system to aid the Black Curs. Fighting off some of the Imperial forces, the operatives descended to the planet where they managed to reach the Black Curs before any of the Imperial forces. After buying the mercenaries enough time to finish repairs on their ship, they managed to escape the system together, successfully evading the warring Imperial factions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some of the contents of the reconnaissance report sought in this battle was published in Star Wars Adventure Journal 2 as Recon & Report: The Journey to Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
