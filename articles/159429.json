He and his wife had a son, Eli, who worked in the family in his youth and later entered the Imperial Academy on Myomar with aspirations of becoming a supply officer. When their son ultimately graduated from the Royal Imperial Academy, Vanto and his wife travelled to Coruscant to attend his graduation ceremony. After the ceremony, both parents joined Eli to congratulate him. When Mitth'raw'nuruodo, the Chiss Lieutenant to whom Eli was assigned as translator, approached to introduce himself, Vanto noticed and attempted to leave. The Vantos were wary of meeting their son's comrade because of the frightening myths told on their homeworld about his species, but Thrawn assured them that many of the legends were not accurate. After the encounter with Eli and Thrawn, Vanto and his wife left the Academy on Coruscant to return home."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
