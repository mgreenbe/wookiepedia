Established by the Galactic Empire, the Imperials sent several supervisors to the planet to force the populace to work shifts at the factory. There were strict penalties for anyone that missed their shifts, and the Belderonians made sure to always be on time. The All Terrain Armored Transports were produced for the purpose of invading a Rebel base on the nearby planet of Kulthis. However, the Rebels learned of the plan, and a task force was sent to investigate. After discovering the factory, the Rebels attacked the facility, eventually destroying it with a commandeered AT-AT."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
