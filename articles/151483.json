The government used a caste system that was no longer fully implemented, and developed a culture of bribery, blackmail, and other soft negotiation tactics that became more popular in galactic politics. It was aligned with the Galactic Republic, and were members since the Republic's founding. During the Clone Wars, it maintained that membership until it defected and joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Umbaran Militia was the government's defense force, and fought against the Grand Army of the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
