In addition to her Force-sensitivity, she was by the blood of her father, the niece of the Jedi Master Jaina Solo, the granddaughter of the heroes of the Rebellion, Leia and Han Solo, and the great niece of legendary Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker. As the Chume'da of the Hapes Consortium, Allana was expected to ascend to the Hapan throne in succession to her mother. She was purported to have died in 41 ABY during the Battle of Uroro Station, after the Moff Council sanctioned the use of a nanokiller, designed to target the royal Hapan bloodline, of which Allana was a direct matrilineal member."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In reality, posing as a war orphan named Amelia, Allana was placed by Tenel Ka in the custody of her grandparents who officially adopted her as \"Amelia Solo\", after her mother received a warning through the Force from Jacen to protect their daughter.

Due to this assassination attempt, the couple decided to keep the identity of the baby's father a secret, in order to protect her from angered Hapan nobles. Ben Skywalker, who was still joined to the Gorog nest, accidentally discovered Allana's paternity; all mention of Allana and the visit to Hapes was wiped from his mind by Jacen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even during the Jedi convocation at Ossus, Jacen and Tenel Ka would not reveal that Jacen was Allana's father to Han and Leia Solo, Allana's paternal grandparents.

Her paternal grandparents, still unaware of their blood ties to Allana, were propelled to act on account of their relationship with Tenel Ka."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Allana served as the primary motivation for Jacen's extreme actions, a reason owing to his love for her, which was considerably more heartfelt than his love for any other being, including Tenel Ka.

Only the personal intervention of her father Jacen saved the young Chume'da, as he kept the assassin from reaching Allana despite many personal injuries. When Sing was momentarily incapacitated, Allana injected her with a personal defense drug, knocking her out. She was later reunited with her mother on Hapes, although she again had to be hidden from the Skywalkers and Solos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a private moment, Jacen discovered he actually cared more about Allana than Tenel Ka, as he thought of his daughter's welfare on a daily basis. Shortly after becoming co-Chief of State and leaving Coruscant, Jacen visited Allana to determine if Allana and Tenel Ka were meant to be his sacrifice.

Allana was replaced by a young orphan girl, Tika, who strongly resembled Allana in her looks. Caedus told Allana that people were trying to kill her so as to prevent her from complaining about being taken away from her mother. Tenel Ka had told Allana that anyone who took care of her would first have to provide a secret phrase, that together, they made up. Caedus never provided the words, frightening her in the process. Allana woke up from unconsciousness, telling Caedus that she hated him, after she hit him with a pass out gas dart that Tenel Ka had given her; it wasn't strong enough, though."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Caedus then revealed to Allana that he was her father, calming her down, quickly forgiving him, and she embraced him, saying that she loved him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tenel Ka went to Luke Skywalker for help, and Luke agreed to rescue Allana from Caedus, leading a strike team to the Anakin Solo, where he, Ben, and Saba Sebatyne distracted Caedus, while Han and Leia rescued Allana.

Jedi Knights Natua Wan and Radd Minker tagged along for security. Allana wanted a tauntaun, but Han denied her, stating the creature's unpleasant smell. Allana decided she wanted to go to the Dangerous Animal level, and her grandparents reluctantly agreed. While viewing animals such as Nexu and a rancor, Natua Wan succumbed to Force psychosis. Natua made her way to the control room, where she locked the doors to the exhibit and disabled the forcefields and corrals holding the animals in the complex.

Her grandparents were once more reluctant, but they adopted a cub, which they named Anji."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Growing troubles"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly thereafter, Allana was left in the care of Bazel Warv while Han and Leia went to meet with Jedi Master Cilghal about the insane Jedi.

Cilghal's fears were realized later that day, although Allana had already left his presence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That night, the Solos and Anji were watching The Perre Needmo Newshour when the broadcast concerned the events occurring earlier that day, specifically the insanity of Warv and Yaqeel Saav'etu. Leia listened to the stories and the Solos' conversation, and reflected that she and Han should not try to shelter Allana, as she was the future Queen Mother of Hapes.

This vision was the catalyst for Jacen's eventual transformation into Caedus: Jacen ended his travels immediately after the vision, determined to change what he saw. The vision he had of Allana on the white throne was proof that Caedus succeeded in changing the future, but by doing so he released Abeloth, the Bringer of Chaos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two years later, Leia Organa Solo had a similar vision of the young girl standing in front of a mix of species, looking to her for guidance and peace.

However, when the Sith High Lord Sarasu Taalon also looked into the Pool of Knowledge, he was very displeased to see a Jedi queen, whom he did not know was a relative of the Skywalkers, because he believed that if a Jedi queen rose to power, the Sith could not take over the galaxy.

From an early age, her father taught her the power of Force stealth for her protection and she was able to heal herself as her grandfather noted that she was a fast healer, like her mother. Allana demonstrated the powers of Precognition and the Jedi Mind trick, and used Force bellow to escape her attacker by stunning him. Allana also exercised a natural ability for Animal friendship like her father in her relationship with her pet Nexu and received a Force vision of the Barabel nest being uncovered by the Lost Tribe of Sith on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Troy Denning (a.k.a.
