Krimsan stored the device in the Jedi library on Exis Station in the Teedio system. This library was later abandoned by the Jedi, and thousands of years later, the holocron was held in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. In the Jedi Temple, additional lessons by Jedi Masters were recorded on it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader later acquired Krimsan's holocron, keeping it in a vault in his personal quarters in Bast Castle on Vjun. The device remained there after his death until it was discovered by Jedi Knight Tionne on one of her many research missions in 22 ABY. On this particular mission she was accompanied by Jedi Master Ikrit and Jedi trainees Anakin Solo, Tahiri Veila, and Uldir Lochett. The Jedi team was confronted at the castle by the \"Mage\" Orloc, who attempted to steal Krimsan's holocron from them. The Jedi defeated him and returned the holocron to the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4. Lochett later stole the artifact when he fled the academy to seek instruction under Orloc, but it was recovered when Orloc was revealed as a charlatan aboard Exis Station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Properties"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Asli Krimsan's holocron was shaped like a cube and was small enough to be held in one hand. It stored large amounts of data within its crystal matrix. The device's exterior was pearly white, and it was capable of projecting color holograms. While the holocron usually projected smaller images, it was capable of producing an image large enough to fill a room thirty meters tall and wide. It was intended for the use of Jedi Masters, but any Force-sensitive could activate it and speak with the interactive holographic gatekeeper. Its gatekeeper was a simulation of the Jedi Master Asli Krimsan and appeared as a small humanoid woman with black hair and smoky topaz eyes, wearing a red gown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Contents"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The primary purpose of Asli Krimsan's holocron was to provide resources for the education of Jedi children. It was meant for the use of the subset of Jedi Masters that taught very young Force-sensitives. It contained both Krimsan's insights and recordings of lessons by other Jedi Masters. In addition, Krimsan's holocron included some information on historical battles of the Jedi against the Sith, Darth Andeddu, and advanced Jedi Force techniques such as Malacia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Krimsan had amassed over two hundred years of experience teaching at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant at the time that she recorded her holocron. When first activated, the device immediately began a lesson by Krimsan on Jedi meditation techniques. If interrupted with a question, the gatekeeper would provide other lessons or insights as requested. For instance, while the holocron was in the keeping of the New Jedi Order, the gatekeeper was asked of her opinion of the Potentium, a belief by many Force-users that the dark side did not exist. She firmly disavowed it, stating the Potentium approach was not the way of the Jedi. Other recordings were also stored on Krimsan's holocron. Two in particular were a lecture by Jedi High Council member Yarael Poof on the proper usage of the Jedi mind trick, and a story by Jedi Master Dooku about how he came to understand telekinesis better as a child."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi artifact"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The holocron was created by the Jedi Master Asli Krimsan, a woman who had taught young Jedi for over two hundred years. She gathered all of her lessons and placed them in the device so that they would benefit future generations of Jedi teachers and students. Krimsan stored her holocron in the Jedi library on Exis Station, which stored Jedi records saved from the destruction of the Great Jedi Library on Ossus in 3996 BBY. The station was abandoned thousands of years before the Battle of Yavin due to hazardous radiation and solar flares, and so the Jedi artifacts, including Krimsan's holocron, were transferred to Coruscant or dispersed among the Jedi of that time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the century or so prior to the Great Jedi Purge, Krimsan's holocron was part of the collection of the Jedi Archives on Coruscant. In that time period additional lessons by Jedi Masters such as Dooku and Yarael Poof were added to the holocron. The Jedi Jax Pavan once studied the holocron while he was in the Archives and encountered Anakin Skywalker while he was doing so. The holocron later featured in a dream he had of their meeting."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Discovery at Bast Castle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the reign of the Galactic Empire, Asli Krimsan's holocron came into the possession of Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader. While the device was not mentioned in any of Vader's records, he kept it in Bast Castle on Vjun. It was stored in a secret vault in his personal chambers, next to his sleeping tube. In 22 ABY, the \"Mage\" Orloc learned that Asli Krimsan's holocron was in the castle. Vader had also stored Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber in Bast Castle, and rumors of that artifact drew a Jedi team to Vjun shortly after Orloc arrived to claim the two Jedi relics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi team was led by Tionne, and consisted of Jedi Master Ikrit, Jedi trainees Anakin Solo and Tahiri Veila, the droid R2-D2, and Solo's friend Uldir Lochett. They were not expecting serious resistance as they searched the castle, but encountered a laser trap and a holographic death trap as they explored. Behind the holographic trap, Anakin Solo discovered a secret door. Beyond the door, he found a secret chamber containing Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Orloc was also searching the fortress. He had discovered plans to Bast Castle in a maintenance bay and used his knowledge of its secret doors and passages to his advantage against the Jedi, stealing Kenobi's lightsaber and causing Tionne and Ikrit to fall through a trapdoor. Solo, Veila, and Lochett chased the Mage, but split up when he evaded them. Lochett was the first to confront Orloc. They spoke while Orloc threatened him with the lightsaber. The Mage boasted of his powers to Lochett and revealed to him the presence of Krimsan's holocron in the castle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Jedi team reunited and forced Orloc to retreat, they searched Darth Vader's personal quarters for the holocron. Solo discovered the secret vault that held the holocron behind Vader's sleeping tube. The vault opened to his touch and voice command, and he was able to remove Krimsan's holocron. At Lochett's request, Tionne activated the holocron to see if it was operational. While the Jedi were examining the artifact, Orloc returned and stole it from Tionne's hands. He attempted to escape through another set of doors and opened more trapdoors in the floor in an attempt to slow down the Jedi. However, R2-D2 closed the doors via a control panel before Orloc could leave the room, and the Mage lost his balance and fell through one of the trapdoors. Before he fell, the Mage dropped Krimsan's holocron, which was caught by Lochett. The Jedi team then returned to the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4, having successfully retrieved both Krimsan's holocron and Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Theft from the Praxeum"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Tionne and her team returned to the Jedi Praxeum with Krimsan's holocron, Luke Skywalker welcomed her back, but he soon had to leave on another mission. While waiting for Skywalker to return, Tionne decided to reward Anakin Solo, Tahiri Veila, and Uldir Lochett for helping her retrieve the holocron by letting them watch while she began to explore its secrets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Activating the device, Tionne asked the gatekeeper to speak about herself. The gatekeeper told the Jedi about Asli Krimsan and the purpose the holocron had been constructed for. In doing so, she mentioned the Jedi library on Exis Station, which Tionne then asked about, and the device projected a hologram of what the ancient library used to look like. Lochett mentioned that the Mage Orloc was from Exis Station. Tionne was surprised and put down the holocron to question Lochett, deciding not to access Krimsan's holocron again until Skywalker returned, since the gatekeeper had mentioned that it was intended for the use of Jedi Masters. Instead, she placed both the holocron and Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber in Skywalker's quarters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lochett, who wished to become a Jedi but was not Force-sensitive, thought Krimsan's holocron could help him in his quest. During the night, he crept into Skywalker's empty quarters and tried to access the holocron. Unable to do so, he decided to steal both Jedi artifacts and go to Exis Station to see if the mysterious Orloc could teach him how to use the Force. To reach Exis Station, Lochett stole the Sunrider, a ship belonging to Jedi Master Ikrit. In the morning, his friends discovered that he and the Sunrider were missing. While they immediately suspected he had gone to Exis Station, the Jedi spent the rest of the day searching the grounds of the Praxeum for him. When Lochett did not turn up, Tionne, Ikrit, Solo, Veila, and R2-D2 traveled to Exis Station on Tionne's vessel, the Lore Seeker, to retrieve him."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Recovery at Exis Station"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As soon as Uldir Lochett arrived on Exis Station, he was captured by Ranats working for Orloc. They threw a sack over his head, injected him with a drug to render him unconscious, and carried him further into the station. The Ranats brought him to Orloc, who questioned him. Lochett then offered Orloc Krimsan's holocron and Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber in exchange for teaching him magic. The Mage suspected a trap by the Jedi, but accepted Lochett as his student. When Orloc was given Krimsan's holocron in return, he unsuccessfully attempted to activate it. To disguise his failure, he claimed to Lochett that his own powers were far greater than the teachings of the Jedi. He told Lochett to concentrate on light, and the lights on the station dimmed. Encouraged by his apparent success, Lochett eagerly sought further instruction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon, Lochett's friends arrived on the station to rescue him and retrieve the stolen Jedi artifacts. Anakin Solo and Tahiri Veila observed Lochett training with Orloc from an air duct grating high above the Mage and his pupil. However, their combined weight caused the pair to fall from the ceiling into the midst of Orloc and his Ranat and droid servants. Tionne and Ikrit jumped down from the ceiling to follow the children and telekinetically confiscated Krimsan's holocron and Kenobi's lightsaber. Furious, Orloc set his minions on the Jedi team, and the Jedi fled with the artifacts through a series of corridors into Orloc's control room. Orloc's forces engaged them there, and the Mage used his technological devices to unleash driving wind, steam jets, holographic enemies, and other hazards on the Jedi. During the fight, the Jedi lost possession of Krimsan's holocron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lochett joined the fight on the side of the Jedi and retrieved Krimsan's holocron from the floor. He tossed it to Veila, and it activated at her touch. The holocron projected an image of Asli Krimsan that filled the entire room. This helped Anakin Solo see past Orloc's holograms to reach the Mage. Solo then destroyed the devices on Orloc's costume that controlled most of his mechanical wonders. Using his last trick, Orloc produced a puff of smoke to distract the Jedi and escape. Krimsan's holocron was returned to the Jedi Praxeum, where it was later studied in depth by Tionne. Master Skywalker also studied the holocron for information on how Jedi could appear as spirits after death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Asli Krimsan's holocron first appeared in Junior Jedi Knights: Vader's Fortress, which was written by Rebecca Moesta. The holocron was first illustrated by Tommy Lee Edwards in Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force. Its design appears to be the same as that of a Jedi holocron model that was created for Attack of the Clones: The Visual Dictionary and similar to that of the Tedryn Holocron. Another illustration of the Visual Dictionary model appears in The New Essential Guide to Weapons and Technology."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While there are references in the Star Wars: Junior Jedi Knights books to Asli Krimsan and her holocron being contemporary to the abandoned Jedi library on Exis Station and thousands of years old, Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force implies a much more recent origin for Krimsan and names her only as the maintainer of the holocron. In particular, the gatekeeper of the holocron comments specifically on the Potentium (theorized in 132 BBY), and Dooku mentions that Asli Krimsan herself has asked him to speak. This may be a retcon of the holocron's prior history."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
