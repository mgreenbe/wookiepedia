Corellia, Selonia, Drall, Talus, and Tralus were all believed to have been transported through hyperspace to their orbits by the Celestials, utilizing the ancient Centerpoint Station, in around 100,000 BBY. All five planets contained an enormous planetary repulsor buried beneath the surface. Corellia, Selonia, and Drall orbited the system star Corell, while Talus and Tralus were in the unusual position of orbiting each other, while the dual-planet system orbited Corell. At the point where Talus and Tralus's gravity canceled out lay Centerpoint Station. The Corellian system was part of the Core Worlds of the Galaxy, and it is probable that all the Five Brothers were Core Founders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the time that the system was artificially formed, the Celestials populated the five planets with Drall, Selonians, and Humans. There had been much tension between the three species, with the Humans based on Corellia claiming lordship over the entire system. Despite this, the Drall and Selonians maintained cultural independence and numerical dominance on their homeworlds. Talus and Tralus had Human populations that claimed a degree of independence through the Federation of the Double Worlds. In the last days of the Galactic Republic, Moff Fliry Vorru governed the entire Corellian Sector from Corellia, and was known to allow smugglers to come and go as they pleased."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Second Galactic Civil War, the system was ruled by a Prime Minister, with each of the five planets having their own Head of State.
