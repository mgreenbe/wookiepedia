Dod, a manipulative being skilled at political maneuvering, held this position from as early as 33 BBY, when he fought against the taxation of the Federation-dominated Free Trade Zones. When this initiative failed, the Federation invaded the Mid Rim world Naboo in retaliation in 32 BBY. When Naboo's queen, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, came to the Republic capital Coruscant to call upon the Senate to send much-needed aid to her beleaguered people, Dod made every effort to block Amidala's pleas, claiming that there was no proof to back up her accusations. Before the Senate could do anything about the Naboo crisis, Amidala returned to the world and oversaw its liberation, disgracing the Trade Federation and its Neimoidian leaders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the scandal, Dod continued to represent the organization in the Senate, even during the Separatist Crisis that culminated with the Federation aligning with the breakaway Confederacy of Independent Systems.

Nevertheless, Dod's true allegiance was to the Federation and the Confederacy, not the Republic.

By 33 BBY, Dod had become an influential and prominent member of the Neimoidian-dominated Trade Federation, a trade conglomerate that maintained a presence in countless star systems and possessed its own private army. The Neimoidians became more interested in representing the needs of the Federation in the legislative body of the Galactic Republic rather than the needs of their own homeworld, so Dod, a scheming bureaucrat, became the senator of the trade organization, succeeding fellow Neimoidian Nute Gunray, of whom he became a staunch supporter of.Within his senatorial office in the Senate Building, which mimicked the grub-hatcheries on his homeworld, Dod possessed a mechno-chair throne and a towering hologram of the Trade Monarch. Two competing teams of Neimoidian office drones rushed to complete the work of the Neimoidian delegation, while assistants and other employees\u2014like diplomatic aides Mik Regrap and Lufa Danak\u2014attended to Dod's needs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From his Senate pod in the Grand Convocation Chamber, Dod served the Trade Federation well, using his skill in political maneuvering to benefit the conglomerate. The Neimoidian's use of filibusters and manipulation of internal strife within the Senate prevented others from uncovering the truth behind the Federation's deceptive moves throughout the galaxy, and his actions put him at odds with the small amount of honest politicians within the Senate. At the same time, however, his machinations also earned him allies, such as Gran Senator Aks Moe of Malastare and several members of Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum's office. Rumors abounded that they, too, were on the Trade Federation's payroll."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The taxation of trade routes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 33 BBY, the Trade Federation began to suffer from terrorist attacks launched by the Nebula Front, an organization that was opposed to the Federation's control over the trade routes. The Front scored a victory against the Federation above the lommite mining world of Dorvalla, where it succeeded in destroying the freighter Revenue and stealing a shipment of valuable aurodium. The Federation, fearing that the attack would be the first of many, decided to petition the Senate for assistance, as its own defense forces were insufficient to deal with the threat. Supreme Chancellor Valorum, fully aware of both the situation and the Federation's questionable dominance of the supposedly-Free Trade Zones, brought the organization's request to the Senate during a session. With other crises, such as the Yinchorri Uprising, in mind, Valorum stressed the need for diplomacy as opposed to militant expansionism, adding that conglomerates like the Federation were oppressing planets within the Free Trade Zones. Dod was quick to respond to the Chancellor's accusations, arguing that the Federation was suffering losses because the Republic refused to either establish a military force to protect the zones or allow the Federation to defend itself. Valorum attempted to dissuade Dod from continuing the argument; although the Neimoidian stopped, several other senators joined in Dod's protest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Valorum did not want to give the Federation more power, however, so he proposed that worlds within the Free Trade Zones\u2014currently represented by the Federation in the Senate\u2014should leave the Federation and instead join the Republic as full members. This move, if implemented, was expected to cause the trade routes in the area to become subject to taxation, something that the Federation did not want to deal with. Dod, unhappy with Valorum's proposal, announced his offense at what he considered to be an indirect attack against the Trade Federation, arguing that the Senate lacked the authority to tax the trade zones and was attempting to break up the Federation. Dod also stated that should the Senate refuse to intercede with the Nebula Front on the Federation's behalf, the governing body should at least give the trade consortium the appropriate means so that it could defend itself. Several other senators joined in, inserting their opinions into the debate. Finally, Valorum, on the written advice of Senator Palpatine of Naboo, proposed that some of the revenue from the taxation be used as financial assistance for outlying worlds. When this did not satisfy everyone, Palpatine suggested that a trade summit be held on the Outer Rim world of Eriadu to continue the discussion and eventually finalize the issue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dod attended the Eriadu summit alongside Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray and the other members of the Trade Federation Directorate. After arriving on the world, Dod informed Gunray of Senator Palpatine's stance as a potential ally of theirs after the Viceroy inquired after the man's identity. The two Neimoidians were flanked by their security droids as they walked with the rest of the Directorate. Dod stood by silently as Gunray and the others engaged in conversation regarding Chancellor Valorum and the impending taxation legislation. Unbeknownst to Dod, Gunray had entered into an agreement with the Sith Lord Darth Sidious\u2014the secret Sith persona of Senator Palpatine\u2014that would see the Neimoidians firmly in control of the Federation. To secure this result, Sidious had supplied Gunray with an additional battle droid, a commander that ultimately feigned a malfunction and assassinated the non-Neimoidian members of the Directorate. When the droid was added to the other security droids guarding the Neimoidians, Dod told Gunray that he thought they had only brought twelve droids, not thirteen, although he did not question the matter further. The Federation delegation entered into the summit chambers and took their seats, with Gunray making note of Dod's location."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before Valorum could begin his opening remarks, a Human page approached Gunray and informed him that a plasma leak had been detected in his shuttle's engines, a security matter that he needed to tend to immediately. Dod asked the Viceroy whether or not he should remain with the rest of the delegation, but Gunray told him to accompany him to handle any legalities that should arise. After they departed, blaster fire erupted within the chamber, prompting the remaining members of the Directorate to activate a force field that had been set up around their seats. Though successfully shielded from outside attacks, the Directorate members had trapped themselves inside, vulnerable to Sidious's thirteenth droid. When the time came, the commander and the twelve other droids unleashed a volley of blaster bolts that killed the remaining Directorate members as the other members of the summit helplessly watched in horror. When the two Neimoidians returned, security agents initially prevented them from entering the hall. After learning of the events, Dod and Gunray did not protest when technicians utilized field disruptors to deactivate the droids. Because of their diplomatic privileges, the pair left Eriadu without responding to any inquiries. The Republic launched an investigation into the incident, and when asked about the thirteenth droid, Dod said that both he and Gunray had been puzzled by its presence. The Republic also concluded that the reasons for the Neimoidians' absence from the massacre was legitimate, albeit somewhat mysterious, as whoever had contacted security about the plasma leak had disappeared by the time of Gunray's and Dod's arrival."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the end, despite all his influence, Dod was unable to prevent the passing of a bill enacting the taxation of the outlying trade routes.

His efforts to prevent the taxation having failed, Dod used his knowledge of Congressional procedure to delay any countermeasures by the Republic until it was too late to prevent Naboo from being overrun. However, the Neimoidians had not conceived the invasion. Rather, they were instructed to do so on the advice of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, their mysterious benefactor. On Coruscant, Sidious, in his alter ego of Palpatine, repeatedly tried to meet with Dod to discuss Naboo's situation, with no success. In response to the blockade, Chancellor Valorum dispatched two Jedi\u2014Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2014as his ambassadors to meet with the Federation, but before any negotiations could commence, Viceroy Gunray attempted to have them killed per Sidious's orders. The pair escaped to Naboo's surface and rescued the captive Queen Amidala and her entourage. The group fled Naboo and, after a detour to the planet Tatooine for repairs, they arrived on Coruscant, where the Queen brought news of the Federation's actions to the Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Senate session, Senator Palpatine revealed the Federation's invasion of Naboo to his senatorial colleagues but was cut off by Dod, who rushed his Senate platform to the center of the rotunda. The Neimoidian objected to Palpatine's insinuations and called for him to be silenced, but Valorum ignored him, ordering Dod and his delegation to retreat from the discussion. Palpatine continued and introduced the Queen to the governing body. As she began to divulge information of the Federation's invasion, Senator Dod again detached his platform from the wall of the chamber and rushed to cut off Amidala mid-sentence. Staying true to his filibustering ways, Dod objected to the Queen's accusations and suggested that a commission be formed and sent to Naboo to determine if Amidala's claims were valid. Valorum initially overruled him, but Dod pressed further, calling for an impartial observation in accordance with the rules for procedure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This time, the Gran Senator Aks Moe seconded the motion. Valorum consulted with his Vice Chair, the Chagrian Mas Amedda, and concluded that a commission should be established in accordance with the rules that Dod had cited. Valorum asked Amidala to defer, but she was resolute and announced that she would not suspend her plea. Having seen the bureaucratic manipulation firsthand, Amidala took Palpatine's advice and called for a Vote of No Confidence in Valorum's leadership, hoping that a new Supreme Chancellor would be able to bring order to the Senate and resolve the Naboo crisis. Following a cascade of cheers of both support and disapproval, Dod maneuvered his Senate pod close to Naboo's and briefly exchanged a glance with Palpatine before Senator Edcel Bar Gane of Roona formally seconded Amidala's motion. Dod then suggested that the motion be sent, for further analysis, to the procedures committee. Among the candidates proposed to succeed Valorum was Representative Ainlee Teem of Malastare, whom Dod had previously supported as a potential candidate for the Chancellorship. In the end, Amidala personally led the liberation of her homeworld and captured Viceroy Gunray, while Valorum was voted out of office and replaced by Palpatine. Though Gunray ultimately faced four trials before the Republic Supreme Court, he still retained his title of viceroy, and the Federation itself only faced minor setbacks in the aftermath of the Naboo incident. By 22 BBY, Gunray had pledged the Federation's support to the growing Confederacy of Independent Systems, a collection of corporations and other organizations with grievances against the Republic government."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Separatist Crisis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, during the Separatist Crisis, scientists from the University of Sanbra discovered unicellular microbial life on PDC3141-02, a Mid Rim planetoid previously believed to be devoid of life that was being used for the disposal of toxic waste produced by corporations. The University was able to get an injunction stopping further dumping on the planetoid, but news of the injunction came too late for the crew of the Spotty Conveyor, a Trade Federation scow transporting radioactive waste from Federation-owned industrial worlds. With failing rad-dampening shielding and not enough fuel to leave the system, the six-being crew was faced with a perilous situation. Dod and the Federation lobbied for the injunction to be removed, hoping to allow the scow to deposit its cargo and leave the system.

Dod was injured in the accident, and he was hospitalized at the Fobosi District Medcenter.

After a Republic courier ship was fired upon by droid starfighters in Andoan space, Senator Rasit Brun of Rintonne accused the Federation of supplying the Aqualish with military hardware.

Senator Dod denied that his organization was a member of the breakaway alliance, stating that Federation resources had been co-opted by the Confederacy without the permission of the Federation's governing board, although he also claimed that the Separatists had legitimately bought equipment from the corporation in marketplace. He further iterated that Viceroy Gunray was an \"extremist\" who did not speak for the organization as a whole, which was steadfast to the Republic and dedicated to trade throughout the galaxy, even when the galaxy was in turmoil.

The Confederacy learned of this mission, prompting Count Dooku to send Dod to Toydaria to prevent any such alliance from forming. As the Republic's representatives pleaded their case before Katuunko, Dod, accompanied by an aide, appeared before the Toydarian king and urged him to consider both sides of the issue, as the Trade Federation had an important contract with Toydaria. Organa argued that any Toydarian assistance would not violate the world's treaty with the Federation; the compassionate Katuunko was inclined to agree, until Dod stated that the Republic representatives had failed to mention the Separatist blockade of Ryloth.

Because Dod and the elite on Cato Neimoidia had suffered financially from the war, the senator was forced to turn over his assets to the Banking Clan, which used them as collateral in the construction of warships and droid armies for the Separatist cause. Because he had signed his assets over to Clovis for the construction of a new droid foundry on Geonosis, Dod would be rewarded with considerable wartime profits, hoping that any revenue generated would greatly benefit his people. Yet, the Jedi Order had begun to suspect Clovis's Separatist sympathies and decided to send Senator Amidala, the former queen of Naboo, to spy on the Banking Clan senator in hopes of uncovering his true loyalties.

Dod expressed his concern over Amidala's presence, whom he correctly believed was spying on Clovis. Faced with an increased risk, Dod and Poggle the Lesser\u2014who had emerged from the shadows\u2014attempted to negotiate a greater profit from the venture. Clovis strongly disagreed, as Dod had become too indebted to the Banking Clan to begin asking for a larger stake. The trio was forced to cut the negotiating short as Amidala approached. Poggle retreated into the shadows upon her arrival, and Dod watched silently as the two senators conversed before departing. When the pair was out of earshot, Dod and Poggle discussed the possibility of using Amidala to their advantage, as Clovis had an affection for her. The Neimoidian decided that with the Naboo senator dead, Clovis was likely to be more susceptible to agreeing to their demands, so he planned to poison Amidala.

Amidala used this opportunity to accompany Clovis on a tour of the palace and secure the hologram containing the coordinates to the new droid foundry. Before she could depart Cato Neimoidia, however, she began suffering from the poison. Clovis recognized her symptoms and confronted Dod with his knowledge. The Neimoidian told him of Amidala's true reasons for accompanying him to the world; Clovis confirmed this by finding that the data on the droid factory had been stolen. After confronting Amidala, Clovis decided to retrieve the antidote from Dod in exchange for the stolen data.

Pantoran Senator Riyo Chuchi was dispatched to Coruscant to plead before the Senate before Dod could legalize the Federation's blockade. Dod informed the Senate that the Pantoran government was in debt to the Federation, warranting a blockade until the matter could be settled. Chuchi, like others before her, accused the Federation of being a member of the Separatists; Dod was willing to admit that the Federation had done business with Dooku's Confederacy but stated that such dealings were not treasonous.

Dod later received a relatively larger role in 2001's Cloak of Deception, in addition to mentions in several online HoloNet News articles serving as lead-ins to 2002's Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. On October 16, 2009\u2014over ten years after Episode I's release\u2014Dod was featured as a major character in \"Senate Spy,\" an episode in the second season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars. He later appeared in the season three episodes \"Supply Lines,\" \"Sphere of Influence,\" and \"Heroes on Both Sides,\" and the season six episodes \"The Rise of Clovis\" and \"Crisis at the Heart.\" In these episodes, he was voiced by Gideon Emery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He was named after then-GOP Senate leader in 1997 Trent Lott, in an attempt to directly connect the Trade Federation's characterization and motives with that of the Republican Revolution that occurred in 1994."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally, for their Episode I debut, Dod and the Neimoidians were designed as organic versions of the Federation's B1 battle droids. This was done to suggest that the Neimoidians had modeled the battle droids after their own image. For this to work, the Neimoidians would have had to been produced by computer-generated imagery. During production, the Art Department opted to use animatronic masks to bring Dod and the Neimoidians to life. Consequently, the Neimoidians' appearances changed dramatically. Additionally, Dod's senatorial miter first appeared in rough sketches of the Neimoidian who later became Rune Haako."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the old StarWars.com Databank listed Neimoidia as Dod's homeworld, both the Star Wars: The Clone Wars Character Encyclopedia and the StarWars.com Encyclopedia claim Dod hailed from Cato Neimoidia. Until the discrepancy is clarified, this article assumes that the information presented in the Databank is correct."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to some early layout animation scenes released in Star Wars: The Clone Wars The Complete Season Two's Blu-ray \"Jedi Temple Archives\" feature, Dod originally corners Rush Clovis, Anakin Skywalker, and the poisoned Padm\u00e9 Amidala outside the palace and orders a B1 battle droid squad to detain them, but only gives Clovis the antidote to the poison and allows them to leave after further threats on Clovis's part. In the final version of the episode, Dod's threats are somewhat less menacing, as he does not order Amidala and Skywalker detained."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A deleted scene from \"Heroes on Both Sides\" has Dod confronting Bail Organa in the halls of the Senate Building, following the announcement about the Confederacy's offer for peace. Dod is adamant that they will not let any further talk of a treaty proceed with the Separatist \"terrorists,\" whereas Organa believed that the ongoing war itself, not entering negotiations, is the greater threat to the Republic. The scene was included in Star Wars: The Clone Wars The Complete Season Three's Blu-ray \"Jedi Temple Archives\" feature."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Possible appearance in Attack of the Clones"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2002's Attack of the Clones, a Neimoidian wearing clothing similar to that of Dod appears alongside Gunray on Geonosis, spawning a debate as to who the Neimoidian was. The end credits for the film identify the Neimoidian as Lott Dod (as portrayed by Alan Ruscoe), but the Neimoidian does not resemble Dod\u2014in voice or appearance\u2014from The Phantom Menace. The reference book Inside the Worlds of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones even identified the occupants of Poggle's box as Nute Gunray, Boba Fett, Poggle, Dooku, and Lott Dod. A series of HoloNet News articles published before Episode II's theatrical release seem to establish a speeder accident, followed by reconstructive surgery, as the reason for his altered appearance. The behind-the-scenes explanation for this is that Daultay Dofine's mask from Episode I was given to Alan Ruscoe, who actually portrayed the Neimoidian in Episode II, with a voice provided by Chris Truswell. Nonetheless, the confusion over the character did not stop there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because the Neimoidian utilized Dofine's mask, it was believed that he would be made into a new character, named Gilramos Libkath, after Gillian Libbert and Kathryn Ramos. This name was also applied for the Neimoidian in Star Wars: Attack of the Clones: The Visual Dictionary. Although Gilramos Libkath was later used as an actual Neimoidian in Boba Fett: Hunted, it was eventually established that Libkath did not appear on Geonosis. Rather, as Leland Chee revealed, Lucasfilm's official verdict is that the Neimoidian who appears alongside Gunray on Geonosis is not Dod, but Rune Haako. More recent sourcebooks, such as The Complete Visual Dictionary, also identify this character as Haako. As for Dod, the senator has since appeared in The Clone Wars series appearing much like he did in The Phantom Menace. In an interesting turn of events, several more recent publications, including The Clone Wars Comic UK 6.29, The Clone Wars Magazine 10, and The Clone Wars Comic UK 6.30, have erroneously pictured Dod when referring to Rune Haako."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
