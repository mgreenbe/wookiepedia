Under Sith Emperor Vitiate, the Empire launched the Great Galactic War on the Republic in 3681 BBY, and while the two factions negotiated a ceasfire with the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant in 3653 BBY, a Cold War persisted until around 3640 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic and the Empire returned to battle with the outbreak of the Galactic War, and while Vitiate abandoned his empire to oversee the Eternal Empire conquest of the galaxy, the Eternal Alliance defeated the Eternal Empire, allowing the Republic and the Empire to continue their struggle with a third Galactic War.
