He was assigned as the commanding officer of the 105th Stormtrooper Platoon while the unit was stationed aboard Starlyte Station. He was fanatically devoted to the Empire and his leadership kept the unit of less-than-sterling troopers from failing further. In an attempt to instill pride and creativity within his platoon, Marr broke with Stormtrooper Corps regulations by allowing the personalization of troopers' armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brezzic Marr's history was unknown prior to his assignment to the 105th Stormtrooper Platoon however there were several rumors circulating that hinted at mental instability. He was an incredibly skilled tactician, however, and his strategies were entered into the Imperial tactics manual. Fanatically loyal yet ultimately pragmatic, Marr has allowed his unit to break several rules while assigned to the space station Starlyte Station under Arissa Fawn. First he allows his unit to customize their armor, and secondly he allows his command to accept bribes from Talandro Starlyte, owner of the station and a notorious black marketeer. The 105th was well disciplined and their drills were impressive to watch which was why Marr would often have them drill in very public places, like right outside the entrance to the Falling Star Saloon"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mentally unstable yet fanatically loyal, Brezzic Marr presents a formidable obstacle to those wishing to go against the Empire in this remote part of the galaxy. Even his superior, Lieutenant Fawn was afraid of what Marr might do. He was extremely intense and slightly sadistic and he had a faraway look that was truly disturbing for others. Although Marr accepted bribes from Starlyte he made it clear that no amount of money would save the station owner if he ever went against the Emperor's will."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Highly skilled in both combat and tactics, Marr was fearsome in combat.
