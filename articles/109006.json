Cay wore them when he was murdered by his brother Ulic Qel-Droma who had fallen to the dark side. The robes were passed on to Cay and Ulic's cousin Duron Qel-Droma, but disappeared shortly after the Great Hunt along with Duron himself. Later, during the Jedi Civil War, shortly after slaying the Terentatek that killed Duron Qel-Droma, Revan and his companions found his robes in a cave on Korriban, along with Duron's skeletal remains."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was said that only those who are true to the light side of the Force could wear the robes.

However, in Knights of the Old Republic, the robe uses the same model as the generic Jedi robe, and can only be worn by a light-sided Jedi character (the player character, Bastila and Juhani). Its most recent appearance was in Shadows and Light, drawn by Dustin Weaver. In the comic, it again shares the red tint as originally depicted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
