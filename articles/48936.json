As opposed to firing projectiles or turbolaser blasts, the FlakBlaster Ten fired searing bolts of neurodium plasma at its targets. Delivered in a small metal cylinder, the heated neurodium gas was fired up one of the weapon's eight emitter nozzles which was then blasted out of the emitter nozzle at the target in plasma form. To prevent damage to the emitter nozzles, the FlakBlaster Ten was equipped with its own defensive shielding system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
