During Trasker's childhood, she was identified as Force-sensitive, causing her father to become extremely protective of her in fear of the Galactic Empire. When her father discovered a dolina ring seed in freight containing a variety of seeds purchased form a Trandoshan, he gifted the curiosity to his daughter. When the girl's abilities attracted the Inquisitorious, she hid in her father's laboratory as the Imperial agents executed her father in cold blood. Sliding the ring seed on to her finger, Trasker felt the Living Force envelope her and give her preternatural speed. Racing away, Trasker made her way in life until she was old enough to join the Alliance to Restore the Republic. An accomplished Force Adept, Trasker wore the ring seed around her neck on a chain, its incredible weight unfelt by her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
