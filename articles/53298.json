Two weeks after the Run was established, the Gastrulans were threatened by the ravenous Giant Amorphous Bantha Breakfast Biscuit, a mutated version of the snack that evolved when the preservatives in the biscuits came into contact with Gastrula's atmosphere."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gastrulans were sentient gastropods that stood slightly taller than a Sullustan of average height\u2014around 1.5 meters\u2014and possessed four short arms attached to their torsos that ended in paddle like hands with opposable thumbs.

Other beings in the galaxy were aware of the existence of the Gastrulans, and also the location of their homeworld.

Upon landing in their ship, the Chubby Gundark, 42-RST struck a deal with the native Gastrulans to sell them their cargo of a single box of the biscuits. Over a two-week period, Bung and 42-RST cleared several hundred thousand credits working the route between the planets of Sullust and Gastrula, which they named the \"Great Bantha Breakfast Biscuit Run.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, unknown to both the crew of the Chubby Gundark or the Gastrulans was the fact that the preservatives used in creating Bantha Breakfast Biscuits reacted negatively with certain environmental conditions, such as stale air and the atmosphere present on Gastrula. These conditions caused the Bantha Breakfast Biscuits to mutate into the Giant Amorphous Bantha Breakfast Biscuit, a ravenous amoeboid creature that set out to devour anything in its path. At least one of these creatures evolved on Gastrula, where it began eating everything it could find."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gastrulans were created by James Anderson for his comic strip Bungo n' Rusti Get Carry-Out, which appeared in issue 11 of the Star Wars Adventure Journal, published by West End Games in 1996."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
