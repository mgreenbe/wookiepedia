An amorphous being who resembled a cloud and was capable of generating their own lightning, Master Nubarron could only communicate telepathically with other Force-users.

They were frustrated that Rwoh had lost a Vector to the Nihil, and that she had promised to return a particular junk hauler in reasonable condition, but she instead completely destroyed the Varonchagger when she crashed during the attack on Valo.
