In his youth, he was among the best professional pazaak players in the Outer Rim Territories. Garouk traveled to planets all over the galaxy, both winning and losing fortunes, until old age began to degrade his mind's sharpness. Realizing this, he retired from gambling and instead became a patron of the Upper City Cantina on Taris. There, he spent his days drinking ale and talking to patrons, as well as teaching others how to play pazaak. When the Sith Empire invaded Taris, Garouk was mostly ignored because of his age."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3956 BBY, Garouk met Galactic Republic soldiers Revan and Carth Onasi in the Upper City Cantina. Garouk told them about his career as a gambler and about life on Taris. Unwilling to let his pazaak decks go to waste, he sold one, consisting of a main deck and a ten-card side deck\u2014two copies of each card from +1 to +5\u2014to them for fifty credits. He also uploaded the rules of the game to Revan's datapad and gave him free lessons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Garouk believed that pazaak was a young man's game. He spent his time in the Upper City, preferring to avoid the dangerous lower levels of Taris.

Garouk serves as an introduction to the pazaak mini-game. Buying the deck from Garouk initiates the side quest \"Pazaak Rules,\" which can be completed by winning any pazaak game with a wager. Throughout the conversation between Revan and Garouk, the player has several dialogue options to choose from. However, the nature of the conversation is such that it does not progress any plot, nor does it change the player's alignment. Therefore, it is undetermined whether Revan ever interacted with Garouk at all."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
