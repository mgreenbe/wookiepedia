At some point, he was on patrol in a B-wing starfighter, along with an unnamed rebel pilot. The two Rebel pilots did not detect anything on their patrol route and were preparing to return to base when the pilot detected some unusual readings on his starfighter's sensors. Hootkins, however, did not initially detect anything and the two pilots were closing their B-wings' S-foils when they came under attack. Both starfighters were destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hootkins made his only appearance in a tech demo for the LucasArts video game Star Wars: Rebel Assault II: The Hidden Empire.
