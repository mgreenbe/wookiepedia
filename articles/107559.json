They were released from 1999 to 2005. The prequel trilogy describes what had taken place 32 years up to 19 years before the events of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. It primarily focuses on a young Darth Vader, then Jedi Anakin Skywalker, and an accompanying Obi-Wan Kenobi and the story of how they went from being friends to enemies and the tragedy of Anakin's descent into the dark side, as well as the origin of how the Galactic Republic became the Galactic Empire. It also features familiar faces such as C-3PO, R2-D2, Yoda, Chewbacca, and a younger Sheev Palpatine with the story of how he became the Emperor. It was the last trilogy to be distributed by 20th Century Fox."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Phantom Menace"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The saga begins with a child Anakin Skywalker, the future Darth Vader, being discovered by legendary Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, who senses the boy's enormous potential. It is here that Skywalker first encounters the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, who himself is still but a pupil. As the first film unfolds, key characters appear, such as Padm\u00e9 Amidala, R2-D2, C-3PO, Yoda, and the villainous Sheev Palpatine, who is a mere Senator in the Galactic Republic at the time. After a debate with the Jedi Council, one which includes the possible resurface of the Sith in addition to Skywalker, it is decided that Anakin will not be trained as a Jedi. At the end of the film, the Sith, Darth Maul, leads an attack against the Jedi on Naboo, and only the tragic death of Qui-Gon at his hands persuades the Jedi to reconsider their decision. Anakin Skywalker then becomes Obi-Wan's apprentice in the ways of the Force."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Attack of the Clones"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the course of the next two films, the Clone Wars begin between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

During the course of her protection, the two become entwined in a romantic relationship, furthering Anakin's future fall from the Jedi ways. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan discovers that, for years, Kaminoans have been growing and training clones for use by the Republic. This discovery also brings Jango Fett and his son Boba out of hiding. The two escape to Geonosis, where Obi-Wan follows them and discovers the leaders of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, including fallen Jedi Master Count Dooku."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin, after his mother is brutally murdered by Tusken Raiders on Tatooine, feels the pull of the dark side growing stronger in himself and his surroundings.

Padm\u00e9, however, decides to go to Obi-Wan's aid despite the urgings of the Council, forcing Anakin to follow her. They are also captured after a brief scuffle, and the trio are nearly executed in the arena.

Upon realizing their error, the Jedi Council moves to confront the Chancellor. Master Mace Windu and three other Jedi Masters attempt to arrest Sidious. However, they are overcome, and with the help of the fallen Skywalker, the Jedi are all killed. With this act, Anakin becomes Darth Vader. His convictions that the Jedi are behind the treachery cause him to lead the destruction of the Jedi Order. Palpatine issues Order 66, whereupon many Jedi are slaughtered by the clone troopers. Darth Vader conquers the Jedi Temple and sets the Jedi beacon to call all remaining Jedi back to the temple into an ambush waiting to slaughter them. After Vader leaves for Mustafar, Yoda and Obi-Wan infiltrate the temple, where Obi-Wan alters the signal to alert all Jedi to stay away. While in the temple, Obi-Wan activates the security recording, leading him to learn the truth about Anakin. With this knowledge, Yoda and Obi-Wan agree the two Sith Lords must be defeated.
