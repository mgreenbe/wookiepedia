It cost 500 credits and was suitable for people who did not need to go to great lengths to ensure a datafile was encrypted securely. The Encryption Package's encryption algorithm used a base 10 system; however, this could be modified and improved by someone skilled in programming."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the war between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire, the Cryptology division of Alliance Intelligence modified and upgraded the AccuTronics Encryption Package 1a.44.87 so that it was suitable for encrypting datafiles with lesser security requirements. In an entry in his field guide for Rebel personnel, General Airen Cracken deemed the Encryption Package useful for securing wanted files circulated through Alliance systems but considered it insufficient for protecting information, such as the location of the Alliance's Delta Base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the New Republic, the Encryption Package was included in Gundark's Gear Datalog, a database distributed by the arms dealer who operated under the alias \"Gundark.\" The Encryption Package's entry in the datalog included a note written on the date 36:6:3 by the individual known as Chello, who considered the device's security protocols to be dated. Chello recommended improving the encryption routine by slicing into the coding algorithms and changing them to use a base 12 system rather than a base 10 system, which Chello believed would make it harder for most rookie slicers to gain access to the encrypted datafile."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Encryption Package 1a.44.87 was first mentioned in the 1996 article \"Cracken's Rebel Field Guide: Slicing Aids,\" which appeared in Star Wars Adventure Journal 10.
