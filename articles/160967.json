Typically made from transparisteel, most viewports were usually, but not always, weaker than a wall of a starship, though could be as strong as that of a building. Viewports also came in many different styles, shapes and sizes, depending on the needs of the builder, the user and the expense for either one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On worlds where high technology was still in its infancy, or if it was not economically-feasible to use transparisteel, then a form of glass made from silicate material (sand) was utilized as a substitute."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The viewport on Executor-class Star Dreadnoughts had a safety mechanism that, when broken, would reseal itself with a reinforced metal window to keep the ship pressurized.
