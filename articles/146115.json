Like the rest of the planet's inhabited zones, it was built on canals whose stagnant waters attracted insects. Thune City's narrow streets ran alongside the canals, with tall buildings made of a dirty-looking yellow stone. One of the city's points of interest was Merchant's Bridge, a large bridge that spanned a whole canal and was covered with market stalls and traders. The office of Dil Pexton was also located in Thune City."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
