Like other Banking Clan installations found outside the main galactic disk, it contained meeting spaces and hidden vaults, and boasted communication equipment used by the Banking Clan to discretely transmit account information and other data without accessing the HoloNet. On the eve of the Clone Wars, the station, like other Banking Clan facilities, was refurbished to serve as a shipyard capable of producing Munificent-class star frigates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The treasury station was one of many facilities located outside the galactic disk that was operated by the InterGalactic Banking Clan in the years leading up to the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. After joining the Confederacy prior to the outbreak of the war, the Banking Clan modified its extragalactic stations to function as shipyards, and these installations became homes to starship construction crews that produced Munificent-class frigates for the Confederate Navy. The amount of Munificent-class frigates constructed for the Separatist war effort at these refitted stations, when combined with the output of shipyards found on Banking Clan worlds, numbered in the tens of thousands. The frigate Tide of Progress XII, which participated in the Battle of Coruscant near the end of the Clone Wars, hailed from the extragalactic treasury station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Banking Clan treasury space station was first mentioned in Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross-Sections, a 2005 reference book written by Curtis Saxton that provided background information on many vehicles and vessels that appeared in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. The station was referenced in a caption identifying the Munificent-class frigate Tide of Progress XII, information that was later repeated in Star Wars: Complete Cross-Sections, published in 2007. A few years later, in 2012, the station was briefly alluded to in The Essential Guide to Warfare, which revealed the existence of other extragalactic Banking Clan installations that were converted for wartime purposes. In the endnotes for The Essential Guide to Warfare, author Jason Fry proposed that some of the Banking Clan's extragalactic facilities may have been forgotten following the end of the Clone Wars, their vaults still filled with credits and other supplies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
