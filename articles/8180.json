The entrance was a steeped archway topped with a flashing holosign, and the establishment was often packed with the tired workers of Galentro Heavy Works, who worked long hours in the planet's factories. The layout included a long hallway that was lined with several side rooms. A scaffolding stage was situated against one wall, set-up for local bands to provide music for the patrons. One such band that played in the Arcade Omicron was the Screaming Jawas. In the center of the main hallway was a holozoetroscope, one of the the only devices that existed outside of Coruscant. The side rooms were situated with scenic replicators which could transform the small rooms into a variety of different planetary locations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Operation Death-Hunter, a Rebel infiltration team formed by Colonel Dursa Conegan met up with two of its Rebel contacts, Cooper Dray and Lady Amber Comark in this cantina.
