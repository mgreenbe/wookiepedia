Rebel pilots at that time frequently tested their skills in the unofficial \"pilot proving grounds,\" competing to set the best time on a series of courses through a Rebel salvage yard hidden in an asteroid field. At some point prior to 3.5 ABY, Varga was killed in a crash while flying a course that saw pilots negotiate a figure-eight comprising a series of rings and tunnels that intersected above a frozen nitrogen lake in a cavern at the center of a large asteroid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The wreckage of Varga's Y-wing was still in the cavern when pilot Ace Azzameen undertook the same challenge in 3 ABY.
