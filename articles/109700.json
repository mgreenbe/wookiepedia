On one occasion, Vos's friendship with the Jedi Knight Desh led him to give him a merciful death after the latter had poisoned himself in an attempt to recapture Vos.

His dealings with criminals gave him an understanding of how the underworld operated, which helped him to deduce the true nature of Ziro's escape from Republic imprisonment and how the Hutt Council factored into the situation.

The director was intrigued by Vos and decided to include him in the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. The character was scripted to appear on the planet Kashyyyk, the Wookiee homeworld, during the execution of Order 66, but the scene was never photographed. An animatic featuring Vos was developed, however, that featured him with a squad of clones on a HAVw A6 Juggernaut at the time of Order 66. Another A6 approaches Vos and his squad and proceeds to fire at the Jedi's tank, resulting in the crew's demise. Ultimately, a passing reference to the character remained in the final film.
