Unknown to him, the Unbroken Clan's general Vukorah has enlisted the help of famed bounty hunting duo Zuckuss and 4-LOM to hunt him down. The two quickly reached the repair shop, and shot down the technician finishing work on Valance. After a brief brawl with the two, Valance had dismembered 4-LOM's right arm, and sliced open Zuckuss's regulator, narrowly escaping with Cadeliah once more. Zuckuss soon revealed to his compatriot, however, that he placed a tracking device on the Broken Wing. On the ship, a heavily damaged Valance and Cadeliah soon arrived on Lowik, to visit Valance's old lover, Yuralla Vega.

With this reassurance, Valance went off to retrieve Cadeliah from the bounty hunters. Meeting the duo at the Mist Hunter, Valance managed to make a deal. He traded them the rare fire ruby to buy time as the Rebellion evacuated their base, taking Cadeliah with them.

Meanwhile, an imprisoned Valance is questioned by the rebels who don't believe he's there to help them.

Arriving at the bridge, Dengar introduced Skragg to his man on the inside, Purpura, the traitor who had sabotaged the ship's hyperdrive.

Determined to find and eliminate the raiders, he left and traveled down a new path. During this time, he struggled to settle in the galaxy and was distraught about being a \"pawn\" for the Empire.

During a job from his old friend Han Solo, Valance killed Vharn, whom he was supposed to protect, after learning of his treachery, but honored the engineer's wish to free his family when he requested the Rebellion that they spend half the credits for the job to ransom the family on Sorgal 12.
