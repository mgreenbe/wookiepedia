Landing on the planet, he believed himself to be a true Yuuzhan Vong and viewed the others who had left for Zonama Sekot as traitors and heretics. He remained on that planet until 127 ABY, almost a century after he saw the war end, when he collaborated with Darth Maladi of the One Sith. Quah sabotaged the Ossus Project in order to prevent Yuuzhan Vong techniques from being used by the inhabitants of the galaxy. This act allowed the One Sith to engineer a war between the Galactic Alliance and the Fel Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the galaxy was torn apart by war, Quah remained on the Vongspawn-infested Wayland and continued to experiment on its native life on a laboratory once employed by the Ossus Project.
