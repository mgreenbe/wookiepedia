To keep a being's body temperature high even in cold weather, that process required that being to use more food. In hot weather, the body of an endothermic being had ways of cooling itself off through perspiration\u2014a process which, at least in Humans, produced a distinct smell. The opposite of endothermy was ectothermy. All mammals, including Humans and Krytollak, and most avians were warm-blooded lifeforms. While endothermic reptiles existed, they were not overly common."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
