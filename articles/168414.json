He viewed the band as a way to make money, so was always focused on getting them to play at concerts. He traveled with the band to the yacht Sleemo Poya Jeedai, where they were scheduled to play and he took on some spacers sent by Quoltus Firth as extra security during the performance, to pay off a favor he owed Firth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
