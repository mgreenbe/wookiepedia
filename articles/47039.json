The shop acted as both a showroom for new gear and a pawnshop for second hand items, which they would also buy from customers. The shop stocked a diverse range of equipment including maintenance, survival and shipboard tools as well as some non-military grade weapons such as blaster pistols and hunting rifles. Any equipment not available in the store could often be tracked down and purchased elsewhere on the Wheel by the shops owner, Nols, and his inventory droid, CZ-332. Nols avoided purchasing stolen goods to prevent getting into trouble with the Wheel Security Force, whom CZ-332 was always prepared to instantly call through the store security system at signs of theft or other trouble. New goods were sold at the store for around the common market value while second hand items were usually priced at half that."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Farlander's Outfitting and Supply first appeared in 2013 in Beyond the Rim, an adventure module written by Sterling Hershey for the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game, Star Wars: Edge of the Empire.
