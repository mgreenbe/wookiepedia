To supplement this attack group, a second and third squadron were quickly thrown together from starfighters on Milagro's surface: secondhand Y-wings, X-wings, and two new B-wings. These two squadrons were entirely composed of personnel from the hospital ship Mercy since New Republic forces so desperately lacked manpower."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circumstances being too rushed for the new squadrons to be assigned call signs, each was allowed to choose its own.

Its pilots were the first to report enemy fighters attacking the group and were the first of the group to sight the Imperial Star Destroyer itself. Ordered by Solo to focus on the Destroyer and to avoid dogfights against pursuing TIE Fighters, Medpac Squadron suffered the brunt of the initial strike, losing two X-wings near the outset and an unknown number of other starfighters over the course of the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
