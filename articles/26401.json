He met with Mytaranor leader Talas Piran. Unfortunately for them, the transaction was witnessed by Toxis and his allies, Rebel Alliance officers Alton Lochner and Derembus Sitnalta. Toxis even recognized one of the slaves as a person he liked, so he went berserk and attacked the slavers. The fight was only interrupted by the arrival of the prefect, with the Rebels escaping, but by then the slaves had escaped. Toxis regretted having lost a chance to get even with Chordak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chordak was physically average for a Rodian in most respects, except for having a snout just a bit longer and skin a shade darker than average.

Still, while more cultured than the average Rodian, Chordak had no problem in engaging in a little violence, and he was unyielding."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His personal gear included a blaster pistol, four grenades and the Oo-Ta Goo-Ta.
