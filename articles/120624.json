The Council refused, however, choosing to pursue a potential alliance with the remnants of the Galactic Alliance and the forces of deposed Emperor Roan Fel. Dun'La, along with three other Jedi, was sent to meet with the leader of the Galactic Alliance Remnant, Admiral Gar Stazi.

After Dun'La patched Stazi through to the bridge, the Admiral was able to provide Bey with the tactic needed to overcome the Sith Imperial fleet.

Dun'La was stationed at the Hidden Temple\u2014where the Jedi had fled after the One Sith massacred members of the Order on Ossus seven years prior\u2014around the time that the bounty hunter Cade Skywalker, descendant of Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker, came to the Temple in order to request the Jedi's aid in assassinating the Emperor and Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Krayt. Dun'La was present for Skywalker's arrival, as well as the arrival of a ship carrying Princess Marasiah Fel of the Empire-in-exile and a group of Imperial Knights. Skywalker and the Imperial Knights confronted each other and almost came to blows when Jedi Master Wolf Sazen, along with Dun'La and the Nikto Jedi Drok, intervened. The Jedi Council refused Skywalker's request and chose instead to pursue a potential alliance with the remnants of the Galactic Alliance and the forces of deposed Emperor Roan Fel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Skywalker apparently succeeded in his mission to kill Krayt, Dun'la, along with fellow Jedi Asaak Dan, Drok, and Te Corso, was sent by the Council to discuss the possibility of joining the Alliance and Empire-in-exile in the fight against the Sith. Traveling to the flagship of the Alliance Fleet, the Alliance, aboard their X-83 TwinTail starfighters, Dun'La and his fellow Jedi were greeted by the commander of the Alliance Remnant, Admiral Gar Stazi. Their conversation was interrupted, however, by Imperial Knight Sigel Dare\u2014representing the Empire-in-exile\u2014who wished to use one of the Alliance's shuttles to travel to the planet Dac to retrieve her former Master, Treis Sinde. Intrigued by Sinde's history, Asaak Dan offered to accompany Dare on her mission; and, after Stazi convinced the Imperial Knight to allow the Jedi to join her, the two left for Dac while Dun'La and the remaining Jedi were taken to discuss the Council's offer with the Admiral in private."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Stazi and his second-in-command, Captain Jhoram Bey, discussed the Jedi's presence on the bridge of the Alliance, Te Corso sensed a disturbance in the Force just before the Alliance fleet was attacked by the Sith Imperial First Coruscant Task Force. Just as Stazi began ordering his fleet into action, however, he was shot by one of the ship's crew, the Mon Calamari Tealart, who was quickly disarmed by Drok. Rushing to the Admiral's side, Dun'La felt Stazi's life force flickering and quickly lifted his body with the Force to carry the Admiral to the sick bay. There, the Bothan was able to stabilize Stazi's condition, though his wound was serious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Alliance Fleet fled from the Imperials through hyperspace, Dun'La and the ship's medic continued to treat Stazi. The Imperial fleet followed the Galactic Alliance, managing to track their coordinates and attack the Alliance shortly after the fleet left hyperspace. When the Admiral awoke, he refused to go into a bacta tank until he had spoken to Bey, so Dun'La patched him through to the bridge. Stazi told Bey to use their fleet's frequency vibrations to his advantage. With this knowledge, Bey was able to understand how the Imperials had managed to follow them through hyperspace by using the frequency vibrations from the Alliance's comm array like a beacon. Bey managed to outmaneuver the Sith Imperial commander by having only the Alliance waiting for the Imperial fleet when it left hyperspace for another attack, before the rest of the Galactic Alliance Fleet jumped into the area from behind to trap them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Alliance victory over the First Coruscant Task Force, Dun'La and the other Jedi were able to form a tentative pact with Stazi's command, and the Jedi Council agreed to meet with Emperor-in-exile Roan Fel on the planet Agamar to further discuss working together in the war."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Death"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 138 ABY, following the return of Lord Krayt, the Dark Lord of the Sith launched an attack on the Hidden Temple, having learned its location from a captured Imperial Knight.

With the aid of Lord Krayt's Sith troopers, the Sith gained the upper hand in the battle.

A damaged Annihilator-class starfighter set a collision course on the remains of the temple, and as it collided, Rawk helped Master Saa unleash the energy she had gathered.

Due to a surplus of characters in the story, Dun'La and the other three Jedi from the cover of Legacy 26 were not used in the actual comic itself. Originally, they were to accompany Cade Skywalker against the wishes of the Jedi Council in his hunt for Darth Krayt. Dun'La later appeared in the forty-second issue of the comic series, Legacy 42, in which he was first identified. The issue was released in November 2009 and was written by John Ostrander and penciled by Dave Ross. Dun'La returned in the fourth issue of the sequel to Legacy series, Star Wars: Legacy\u2014War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
