A member of the Imperial Navy, Donell served as first officer aboard the Immobilizer 418 cruiser Detainer. Around 7 ABY, Donell assumed command of the starship and became a concern for the New Republic by using the Detainer to pull a number of New Republic and independent starships from hyperspace and capture them. Along with the Detainer, Donell also commanded a converted Super Transport XI container ship, which had a cargo bay that had been modified to act as a starship hangar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Donell operated out of the Barpine system, which contained orbital shipyards. Once Donell had captured a ship with the Detainer, it was transported aboard the container ship to the shipyards. The crews were incarcerated in a prison facility on the planet Barpine; some of the crews were offered the chance to serve the Galactic Empire with a promise of early release. Those personnel that took Donell's offer were placed among loyal Imperial crews to prevent mutiny or desertion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Donell managed to acquire ten transports, three DP20 frigates, five CR90 corvettes, a number of starfighters, scout vessels, and freighters over the course of several months. The New Republic Intelligence Service believed that Donell was forming a fleet to conduct a personal campaign of conquest. Most were refitted for Imperial service, while some, including starfighters and freighters, were sold to pirates and Imperial-affiliated operatives. The New Republic offered a reward of 15,000 credits for Donell's capture on charges of theft and kidnapping."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lon Donell was a Human male who stood 1.75 meters tall.
