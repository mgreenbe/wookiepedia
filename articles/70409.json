It was inhabited by humans and several alien species. The planet's population was divided into two communities: a community of human valley dwellers known as the First Wavers who lived in the planet's remote valley and a second-wave of human and alien settlers who dwelled in urban centers such as Valentia. The second wavers tended to be more affluent than the valley dwellers and the two communities distrusted each other. The second wavers looked down on the valley dwellers as primitive and superstitious while the valley dwellers regarded the second wavers as avaricious and selfish. Jelucan was also home to the non-sentient muunyak species, which were commonly used to carry supplies across the rugged terrain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One known mineral from the planet was Jelucani fogstone, which was used to sculpt statues. Ridgecrawlers were also a common form of transport due to the rocky terrain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jelucan was settled relatively late in galactic history, sometime around 511 BBY. The First Wavers were exiles from another world who refused to break allegiance to their king and arrived in near total poverty, but managed to survive. About 350 years later, a second-wave of settlers arrived, who established mining operations on the planet and considered the ways of the initial settlers to be backward. The second-wave of settlers used the profits from their mining operations to become wealthy aristocrats, while the first wave settlers remained largely destitute."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Jelucan was part of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Following the CIS defeat and the end of the war, Jelucan was left independent and would in 11 BBY, be annexed by the Galactic Empire, who held a giant ceremony on the desolate world which was attended by Grand Moff Tarkin himself. During the ceremony, Tarkin befriended two local children, the second-waver noble Thane Kyrell and the valley-dweller Ciena Ree, and encouraged them to join the Imperial Navy when they reached maturity. After the ceremony, multiple Imperial ships returned to their Star Destroyers in orbit, however a few headed to newly built Imperial facilities on the southern plateaus. Due to the planet's alignment with the Separatists, the Empire only recruited a handful of Imperial cadets from Jelucan, preferring the more populous Inner Rim worlds"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Five years later, Imperial-introduced ridgecrawlers began to replace the native muunyak species as the common mode of transport. A few years before the Battle of Yavin, Thane and Ciena were accepted into the prestigious Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant; which the two regarded as part of fulfilling their lives' dream of joining the Imperial Navy. The two cadets graduated shortly before the events of the Battle of Yavin and joined the Imperial Navy during the Galactic Civil War. Disillusioned with the Empire's brutality, Thane later defected to the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Jelucan had become heavily polluted due to the excessive mining by the Empire. The people of Jelucan also began wearing the same attire, making it nearly impossible to tell the difference between first and second wavers. The planet's legislative building was also taken over by the Imperial Military."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle of Hoth, Lieutenant Commander Ciena Ree returned to her homeworld after her mother Verine Ree was falsely accused of embezzling funds at the mine she worked. Despite the doctored evidence, Verine was convicted and sentenced to six years of hard labor. During that time, Ciena reunited with her lover Thane and the two made love despite fighting on opposite sides."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the New Republic, Jelucani fogstone was used to build a statue of the rebel hero Senator Bail Organa at the New Republic senatorial complex on Hosnian Prime.
