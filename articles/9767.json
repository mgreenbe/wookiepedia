Using a sophisticated algorithm to monitor and predict the locations of the asteroids, it allowed starships to navigate the field safely. The chart was best used in a sparsely occupied field; when a field had many obstacles, the chart's computer could not keep up.[source?] Stored in a navigation computer, orbital drift charts formed a part of a ship's astrogation capabilities, allowing it to navigate an asteroid field safely."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Peragus Mining Facility's command console stored asteroid drift charts that were constantly updated, allowing the console to send out transmissions to incoming crafts to prevent them from being crushed into space dust. Prior to the transmission of orbital drift charts, the Peragus console automatically hailed incoming ships, usually freighters, to warn them to maintain distance as well as to send them docking instructions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Republic warship Harbinger arrived at the Peragus Mining Facility, where the Jedi Exile and her freighter, the Ebon Hawk, was trapped in, the exile and her companions, Atton Rand and Kreia, boarded the Harbinger and stole the drift charts to the Peragus asteroid field stored in its navicomputer, bringing them to the Ebon Hawk and making their escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
