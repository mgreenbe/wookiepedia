At some point after the Battle of Utapau, it came into the possession of the merchant Sconto, who kept it in his junk shop in Pau City. During the New Republic Era, Karr Nuq Sin, RZ-7 and Maize Raynshi visited the shop during Sin's journey around the galaxy to uncover Jedi artifacts. Whilst in the shop, Sin touched the staff and witnessed Medon's meeting with Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had arrived on Utapau in search of General Grievous."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
