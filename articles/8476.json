In 1 ABY, Temmin Wexley began to deliver food baskets to his aunt Esmelle and her wife, Shirene, each week to help care for them. The baskets usually contained bread and fruits, and occasionally arguez sausage or wyrg-jerky. The pilot Norra Wexley returned to Akiva three years after she had left her son, Temmin, on the world so that she could fight with the Rebel Alliance.
