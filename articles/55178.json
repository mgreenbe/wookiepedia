They attacked the station with TIE/In interceptors from Avenger Squadron as well as a force of TIE/sa bombers. They captured the station along with a Beta-class ETR-3 escort transport containing Rebel officers; the Imperials were then attacked by the Rebel Nebulon-B2 frigate Colada which targeted the Compellor and launched Z-95 Headhunters from Azul Squadron and Y-wings from Grez Squadron. The attack failed and, after their shields had been taken down they were given a chance to surrender. The Rebels refused and the frigate was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
