The station was home to the cryptologist Aren Bron and the 212th Attack Battalion during the Battle of Ryloth and a short time afterwards, up until the Battle of Behpour. During their stay, the station was attacked by Separatist forces under the command of Kul Teska. After Plo Koon and Obi-Wan Kenobi went missing, Masters Kit Fisto and Mace Windu went in and found Private Switch. Ponds then later found Cody and three other troopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
