Most notably, he was rejected by Darth Vader's screening crew in 3 ABY to become part of the hunt for the passengers of the Millennium Falcon. Nevertheless, Snibit made a plea to the infamous Boba Fett while still aboard the Executor to help the hunter in any way he could. Boba Fett apparently hired Snibit to send the rival Trandoshan hunter Bossk off in a direction away from Han Solo and Chewbacca. As part of this plan, Snibit in turn introduced the hunters Tinian I'att and Chenlambec to Bossk for 210 Imperial credits, a small reward compared to what he would be making from Fett."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
