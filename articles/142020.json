Circa 18 BBY, the Galactic Empire began the Listehol Campaign, an offensive against former Separatists, pirates, and slavers. The Imperial forces were led by Admiral Wullf Yularen and Captain Bannidge Holt. Though the Imperials were victorious on all other fronts, and made continuous assaults against Tervissis, they continued to resist Imperial control.
