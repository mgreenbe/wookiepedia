The death of his children drove him to despair and desperation, setting him on a course that would lead him to join the Odionate, a Sith death cult founded by Sith Lord Odion, who ruled a section of the Grumani sector. Due to his military skills, Yulan rapidly rose through the ranks of the Odionate military and quickly developed a notoriety for pursuing suicide wave tactics which contributed to heavy attritional losses among the ranks of Odion's forces. Yulan led several of Odion's military campaigns including the Battle of Gazzari, the Skarpos campaign, and the Invasion of Sarrassia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to Yulan's faithful devotion to Odion's nihilistic philosophy, he became a personal favorite of the Sith Lord.

In the process, Yulan became acquainted with the Jedi Knight Kerra Holt who had infiltrated the Novitiates under the pseudonym \"Mercy\".

After Odion planned to use the Helm to harness the negative emotions of the child captives within the cloister on Vanahame\u2014a planet-size mega orphanage\u2014 to unleashed a galactic apocalypse, Kerra managed to successfully convince Yulan to abandon his Sith ways and to save the lives of other sentient beings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the eleventh hour, Yulan personally thwarted Odion's death ritual by freeing the child captives from their bubble prisons, causing the Helm to overload and explode, killing Lord Odion.

During that period in galactic history, large areas of the galaxy were controlled by various Sith warlords while the Galactic Republic had been reduced to a rump state around the Galactic Core. In his adult life, Yulan worked as a mercenary for various different parties including the Sith Lords Odion and Mandragall. Yulan was also influenced by Mandragall, who had an extensive knowledge of ancient Sith history and used this knowledge to devise a new military model. Citing Elcho Kressh's historic precedent of recruiting armies by absorbing individuals with different skills from outside cultures, Mandragall forged a polyglot army consisting of pirates, mercenaries, and alien species that held a grudge against the Republic and his Sith rivals. By the height of his rule, more than three-fourths of Mandragall's armed forces consisted of independent operators, who had fled enslavement by other Sith Lords. Most of these were willing to fight under Mandragall's banner in exchange for autonomy and getting access to recruits and resources."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1052 BBY, the female Sith Lord Xelian\u2014the mother of Lords Odion and Daiman\u2014conspired against Mandragall by seducing him and then killing him.

Yulan lived during the Mandragall era and was greatly influence by Mandragall's military strategies and tactics. He became a good artilleryman, cultivated an interest in military history among the recruits who served under him, and acted as a mentor to the Human mercenary Jarrow Rusher. However, Yulan's children died on the world Fostin IX as a result of plague, causing Yulan to succumb to depression. He sent squads to increasingly dangerous assignments with more soldiers being left behind each time. At an unknown point, Yulan planned on turning over command of his unit to his second in command, and then committing suicide."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, he encountered an unidentified female Claimer from the Odionate who succeeded in converting him to Sith Lord Odion's nihilistic beliefs.

When he finally became a member of an Odionite death cult that was dedicated to the Sith Lord Odion and accepted an assignment from the Sith Lord, Jarrow Rusher left him and began working for Daiman, Odion's brother. Meanwhile, Rusher established his own mercenary group called Rusher's Brigade, which would be employed by several different Sith warlords in the Grumani sector. By the time of the Chelloan affair in 1032 BBY, Rusher's Brigade had grown to approximately three thousand personnel and operated from the modified starliner Diligence.

His favored position led other subordinates to speculate that Yulan was one of those few sentients whom Odion bothered to keep alive because of their usefulness. During the Battle of Skarpos, he commanded an invasion force of Force-wielding Novitiates and members of the Thunder Guard. These forces included the Jedi Knight Kerra Holt, who had infiltrated the Novitiates disguised as a Sith recruit named Mercy. Yulan's forces clashed with Lord Malakite, who commanded an army of Mutates, sentient beings who had been physically and mentally twisted into Sithspawn.

Wayman countered that Yulan's suicide tactics were culling Odion's ranks at an unsustainable rate and were causing widespread inexperience within the Odionate's forces. Wayman also defended Mercy by claiming he had high hopes for her. Yulan responded derisively that she called herself \"Mercy\" and that had gone into her head.

Later, Yulan was present at the briefing session where Lord Odion outlined his plans to restart Project Pandemonium to locate the Sith relic the Helm of Ieldis and to invade Sarrassia, the last known location of Project Pandemonium. Yulan announced to his master that his forces were rearmed and replenished and commented that the Sarrassians would not know what hit them. Later, he and Odion attended a fight at the nearby arena pitting some of Ayanos Bactra's former accountants against a gundark, armed only with their datapads.

Yulan's cannons opened fire on the combatants, killing and wounding several of his own troops in friendly fire. He encountered Mercy whom he reprimanded for her soft-heartedness and unwillingness to die in combat. Mercy countered that Yulan's cannons nearly vaporized his own troops and countered that Odion would be greatly displeased if his mission to find the Helm of Ieldis was hampered by the death of its members. Yulan grumbled that Odion would merely find more Novitiates and then went to inspect the situation on the ground. He quickly discovered that several Sith troopers had been killed and wounded by his friendly fire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of his officers reported that his Sith troopers had cleared the cave entrance and killed the defending priests who were making a last stand. Yulan speculated there was something inside and ordered Mercy and her comrades to explore the caves, commenting that he wanted to be back in Vanahame while he was still young enough to remember its location. While in the cave, Kerra was separated from her fellow Novitiates and discovered a secret entrance that was accessed by the symbol on her mother's pendant. She discovered a temple separated by an underwater river and met the alien Hierophant Aunt Zoojoo who revealed the last known whereabouts of her parents and that the Helm of Ieldis was actually located on Skarpos. Meanwhile, Yulan sensed that there was a chamber beneath the cave based on gravimetric analysis. He rejoined the other Sith Lords who entered the chamber by using explosives to create a hole.

Yulan replied that they did not but admitted this case looked particularly worthless. At that point, Mercy surfaced and inquired why she was talking with that woman. Mercy quickly revealed that the Helm was located on Skarpos and ordered Yulan to take them there since he was responsible for their transportation.

Feigning boredom and devotion to Odion's quest to find the Helm, Mercy followed Yulan into the underground basement and stumbled across the Cloister. She met Yulan who revealed the existence of the Cloister network and his conversion to Odion's death cult. For Yulan, his regular visitors to the Cloister at Vanhame was to reflect on the deaths of his children who had succumbed to the Candorian plague."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his war record as a Mandalorian warrior, the meaningless nature of their deaths drove him to despair and he came to embrace Odion's nihilistic ideology following a meeting with a Claimer, an Odionate recruitment agent. He justified war and bloodshed as a tool of speeding up the killing on both sides. When Mercy suggested that all life was sacred regardless of who they were, Yulan countered that Mercy's objection was an odd view for a Novitiate and commented that the only sacred lives were his deceased children. He likened all sentient beings to droids who were ready to power down. Before leaving to continue the mission to locate the Helm of Ieldis, Yulan ordered Mercy to switch off the lights. Mercy was so shaken by her discovery that she took the cargo elevator with Yulan back upstairs to the spaceport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beld Yulan and his Sith team subsequently arrived at Skarpos, and established a garrison at the Morbollon Mesa. The encampment was attacked by Lord Malakite's forces who wanted to retake the planet. His army included a phalanx of winged Night-Soarers who were used to ferry his troops. Yulan ordered his artillery to open fire on the invaders and spotted the arrival of an Odionate transport landing at the top of the mesa.

Yulan expressed his anger and shock at the presence of an enemy agent among the Novitiates, Odion's most trusted followers. The Odionate encampment was struck by enemy bombardment and Mercy saved Yulan from a fiery death by pushing him out of harm's way. Motivated by both Odion's mission and gratitude towards the young woman, Yulan ordered Mercy and her fellow Sith to evacuate the battlefield on a skiff and find the Helm within the Mesa while he and his own troops and artillery kept Malakite and Daiman's forces at bay."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mercy succeeded in reaching the Grumani temple chamber within the Mesa. However, Odion had already beat her to the Helm and struck her with Force lightning. Odion disarmed Kerra and took her captive, binding her in restraints and taking her back to the top of the Mesa. Later, Odion would reveal to Yulan and the Novitiates that all that time he had been aware about the presence of a Jedi infiltrator within their ranks. However, Odion allowed her to remain undetected because she would lead him directly to the Helm.

They reported that they found some camping supplies and two human skeletons, which had been crushed during an explosion. Yulan also discovered a heirloom which was revealed to belong to Aron and Mercia; confirming the deaths of Kerra's parents. Kerra immediately descended into a state of grief and anguish, which activated the Helm of Ieldis. Odion then used the revitalized Helm of Ieldis to amplify his own Dark Side powers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that moment, a pair of Malakite's Mutate warriors riding dragon steeds stumbled upon Odion and his entourage, intending to slay him themselves and take back his hide as a trophy to their Master.

Following that successful test demonstration, Odion commented that the Helm of Ieldis had forcibly brainwashed them into accepting his own nihilistic rationale that the only way to end their own pain was through bloodshed and death. Odion then ordered Yulan to start evacuating his best companions aboard their shuttle since he was going to deploy the Helm against the three massed armies beneath the mesa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Helm of Ieldis had an immediate effect on the three massed armies, driving all the combatants into a homicidal frenzy. By forcing his opponents to kill each other and therefore embrace death and nothingness, Odion hoped to become the sole owner of the Universe. Within minutes, the combatants descended into a murderous rampage, killing both their comrades and opponents indiscriminately.

While Odion succeeded in testing the Helm of Ieldis on the armies of his rivals Daiman and Malakite with devastating results, the Helm also annihilated his entire army with the exception of General Yulan and a small contingent troops, the Novitiates, and a captive Kerra Holt. When Yulan expressed concerns about sacrificing his entire force on Skarpos, Odion merely rebuffed the General's concerns by telling him that their deaths were inevitable, and that the Helm merely hastened the process. A jubilant Odion then set his cruiser on course for Vanahame, intending to harness the anguish and misery of the captive orphans within the cloister there.

An exhausted Kerra replied that she was not feeling at her best right now and was very tired since she had been running so hard for so long.

Following their capture by Lord Odion, the couple had been forcibly impressed into Project Pandemonium, a secret Odionate project to recover the Helm. The Holts had intended to bring the Helm to the Jedi and the Galactic Republic for safekeeping but were unable to since the planet was besieged by warring Sith factions. By that stage, the Holts had run out of food and there was a permanent Sith presence outside the Morbollon Mesa.
