The celestial body occupied the primary orbit around the planet. Its orbit around its primary was such that Ulbasca was always situated in the light of the Cularin system's two suns. Light reflected by Genarius meant that even a side of Ulbasca facing away from the suns never experienced a true night."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ulbasca had a type II atmosphere. Trace amounts of poisonous gases required a breath mask for visits of more than a few hours. The only major life forms on Ulbasca were lizards and snakes. Some of the snakes had short limbs to help with climbing, and the larger snakes could grow up to 40 meters. The reptiles subsisted on the moon's sulfurous plants and each other. Ulbasca's surface was mostly flat but was occasionally broken by mountains and canyons. The reptiles' preferred terrain was in those canyons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ulbasca had no mineral wealth of note but was claimed by two corporations, SoroSuub and Naescorcom.
