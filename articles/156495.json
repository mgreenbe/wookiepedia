In 3 ABY, the captain and his ship were stationed in the Rebel Alliance's Echo Base on the planet Hoth. While repairing his light freighter, he encountered First Sergeant Hazram Namir of the 61st Mobile Infantry in the hangar. Noticing the sergeant's broken nose, he asked what had happened to Namir, who had been punished for getting into a fight with Kryndal, a soldier from the Alliance's special forces, and was given the task of carrying shipping crates to the base's interior as a result. After Namir remarked that the special forces \"took the Rebellion seriously,\" the captain smiled and resumed repairs to his freighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later on, the captain met Namir again, who was hauling parts to the freighter.

After finishing the repairs, the captain sat down on the freighter's boarding ramp and began drinking a bottle of Corellian whiskey, with Namir joining him. While the two drank the whiskey, the captain told a story of how his ship had taken damage, while Namir explained the full reason for why he had been punished. Hearing the sergeant's story, the captain stated that the rebels should not be told they were destined to fail, as he believed that he would outlive his purpose if the rebels were to grow stronger."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Chatting with a fellow soldier"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the two conversed, Namir stated that the captain would have also wanted to start a brawl with the rebels. The captain explained that he never started a fight he had no chance of winning, and asked how Namir began service with the Rebel Alliance. He also explained that the Alliance's victory at the Battle of Yavin, which ended in the destruction of the Death Star superweapon, led him to believe that the war against the Empire could be won.

When meeting Namir for the first time, the captain eyed him with a look that the sergeant considered unhappy. Upon their second meeting, the captain began casually questioning Namir about his punishment while repairing the freighter. During their conversation, the captain uttered several profanities while explaining how his ship had received damage. He also stated that his service to the Rebel Alliance was similar in nature to a mercenary. When Namir told the captain that he would've also wanted to fight the rebels at the base, the captain replied he avoided confrontations he felt he had no could not win.

Before boarding his ship and parting ways with the sergeant, the captain stated that Namir should walk away from the war if he could not understand why the rebels were fighting, and that the sergeant should focus on himself if he was only fighting for the Rebel Alliance as a hired soldier."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The captain was able to repair his light freighter with the parts Namir provided without any assistance from the sergeant.

The character had many similarities to the smuggler Han Solo, such as possessing a light freighter, and having light skin and brown hair. This led to speculation that the two characters were the same individual. When questioned about whether or not this was Solo, Freed stated that it was his intention have the smuggler in the novel, but added that others were free to interpret the freighter captain differently."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
