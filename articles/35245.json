Taking the place of the more primitive book, a datapad could store textual, graphic, and holographic data. They were commonly used as notebooks, day planners, calculators, and sketchpads. Some models could interface with and download information from larger computer networks. Most datapads came standard equipped with a touch-sensitive color screen, audio pickups, headphone ports, and power packs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description and usage"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Datapads varied in size, from palm-sized devices to larger units designed for two hands.
