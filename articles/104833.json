It replaced the team's original VCX-series auxiliary starfighter Phantom, which was lost during the mission to Reklam Station. The Spectres acquired the Phantom II during a mission to the planet Agamar, where they encountered a Separatist holdout. Ambushed by the forces of the droid general Kalani, the rebel away team was forced to engage in a live wargame with the droid army until both were attacked by an Imperial strike force. The Spectres kept the shuttle, modifying it for their own needs and repainting it.

The shuttle was also capable of traveling through hyperspace. After the Spectres rebel cell acquired the ship, they gave it a new paint job and upgraded it to include hull reinforcements, port and starboard forward cannons, ventral-mounted turrets, and an astromech socket located on the port side of the shuttle. The Phantom II was also modified to dock with the VCX-100 light freighter Ghost and served as the mother ship's shuttle. Despite its armaments and maneuverability, the Phantom II was still vulnerable to small-arms fire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Phantom II was originally an unnamed and unarmed transport part of the Confederacy navy, marshaled by the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars.

The droid Chopper found and restarted the shuttle while spying on several battle droids. Chopper informed Ezra Bridger of the vessel, and Bridger had the droid prepare the ship for departure. After realizing that the rebels and the droids were not each other's enemies, both parties joined together to successfully escape an Imperial assault. Kanan Jarrus realized the ship's potential and decided the commandeered vessel would serve as a replacement for the original Phantom, which was lost at Reklam Station. The new ship was christened Phantom II."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Spectres returned to Phoenix Cell with the ship, the vessel underwent extensive modifications and upgrades. The shuttle was given a new paint job and upgraded to include hull reinforcements and an astromech socket located on the port side of the shuttle's now-shortened dorsal fin. The ship would be outfitted with port and starboard forward cannons, ventral-mounted turrets located adjacent to the boarding ramp, and would also modified to dock with the Ghost like the original Phantom. This potentially allowed the ship to serve as the freighter's new rear gun but this was never observed in practice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After communication with the Protectors of Concord Dawn was lost, Sabine led a recon mission with Ezra, Fenn Rau, and Chopper to Concord Dawn's third moon to investigate the situation. Rau overpowered Sabine and Ezra and took the shuttle to a ridge overlooking the Protector encampment, where he discovered his men had all been killed by the Imperial Mandalorians led by Gar Saxon. While Sabine attempted to rescue Ezra from the Mandalorians, Rau stole the Phantom II and started to flee but returned and saved the Spectres after realizing that Sabine was an honorable fighter who risked her life to save others, and that she had not forgotten the Mandalorian ways."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Phantom II later took part during the Phoenix rebels' evacuation of rebel sympathizers on Mykapo. Kanan Jarrus and Garazeb Orrelios used the ship to land on the planet to help with the evacuation before returning the ship to its port on the Ghost. After evacuating the rebel sympathizers, Hera Syndulla, Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper used the shuttle to travel to the Iron Squadron YT-2400 light freighter Sato's Hammer in an attempt to convince the Squadron to leave Mykapo before Imperial forces returned to the planet. Hera allowed Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper to stay behind and repair the hyperdrive of the YT-2400 and convince the Iron Squadron to evacuate. When Imperial forces under Admiral Kassius Konstantine returned to the system, Ezra and Sabine managed to convince Gooti Terez, Jonner Jin, and R3-A3 to escape on the Phantom II. They were forced to leave Mart Mattin behind after his ship was damaged by Imperial fire. After docking the Phantom with the Ghost, the Spectres and Iron Squadron took part in a joint mission to rescue Mart."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Kanan and Sabine used the Phantom II to follow the former Sith Lord Maul's ship Nightbrother to the planet Dathomir. Maul had coerced Ezra to come along. Prior to Maul's appearance at Chopper Base, Kanan foresaw an issue with Ezra's behavior and had Sabine install a tracker on Ezra's wrist comm, which was used to track Maul. The rebels landed the ship outside the Nightsister lair and ventured inside the cave to rescue Ezra only to be attacked by the spirits of the Nightsisters. After defeating the spirits, Ezra and his fellow rebels resolved to stop Maul from reaching the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who held the key to destroying the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Spectres and the Captain Rex's second mission to Geonosis, the Phantom II remained docked aboard the Ghost.
