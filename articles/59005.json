A combination of war shrine and mausoleum, the halls contained homages to the members of the Melida and Daan populations who were killed during the civil war on Melida/Daan. Most contained holograms of dead persons, who left a holographic memory and propaganda speech that served to incite further violence between the two groups, in a cycle of endless warfare and hate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A faction known as the Young, made up of the younger generation on both sides, eventually rose to power, overthrowing the Elders. Led by Nield, his government formed a new history squad that began to tear down the Halls of Evidence, and many of the Halls were destroyed because they were thought to inspire hate. However, this action itself precipitated another bout of violence when the Elders and Nield's followers, both armed, converged on the halls. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Cerasi, a former leader of the Young, arrived to try and prevent the violence, but Cerasi, who was unarmed, was shot and killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
