Sometime following the Battle of Yavin, Nalskel's political career began to flourish. However, his political views were not well liked by his opponents, particularly those in Borvo the Hutt's Nal Raka Criminal Empire. In order to halt the Gungan politician's rising success, they commissioned a Nikto bounty hunter named Soris with killing Nalskel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Nalskel's ambitions could not be stopped so easily. The infamous Mandalorian bounty hunter Boba Fett became aware of Nalskel's plight and sent a novice bounty hunter to help resolve the politician's dilemma. Thrilled that Fett had sent him help, Nalskel quickly put the novice bounty hunter to work. Thanks to Naskel's associates, the bounty hunter learned that Soris was away on business. To take advantage of Soris' absence, Nalskel sent the bounty hunter to the Nikto's camp outside of Naboo's oceanside city of Kaadara. Searching for clues, the bounty hunter succeeded in locating Soris' datapad, which contained detailed information regarding Soris' allegiance with the Nal Raka Criminal Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To teach Borvo a lesson, Nalskel sent the bounty hunter to another camp outside of Kaadara, occupied not only by Borvo's henchmen, but Soris himself. The bounty hunter first started by killing at least fifteen of Borvo's underlings, before turning toward Soris. Deducing that Soris had no friends left, Nalskel ordered the bounty hunter via comlink to approach Soris, hand him his death mark, and kill him. Motivated by the promise of compensation, the bounty hunter cornered Soris and handed over the death mark given to him by Nalskel\u2014a tombstone inscribed in Aurebesh with the words, \"Rest in Peace. In Loving Memory.\" The bounty hunter then executed Soris, much to Nalskel's delight, who now felt that his political career could blossom unhindered.

As evidenced by his cooperation with the bounty hunter sent by Boba Fett, Nalskel had no qualms with killing Soris and enacting revenge against Borvo's criminal empire. Nalskel also insisted on the macabre gesture of handing Soris a death mark in the form of a tombstone before having him killed. Still, Nalskel exhibited a cheerful demeanor.
