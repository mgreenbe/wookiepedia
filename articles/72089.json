Jowdrrl's mother once advised her young daughter that dropping a Wroshyr louse on any male Wookiee she desired and then offering to groom his fur would betroth him to her forever. In her youth, Jowdrrl was close friends with Mallatobuck, a female who pined after Chewbacca and hoped to one day marry him. Mallatobuck was frustrated that Chewbacca was seemingly more interested in mechanics than in her, and was additionally too shy to express her true feelings to her love interest.

Mallatobuck's dropped louse landed on Dryanta's head, however; after the giggling girls rushed deeper into the forest, Mallatobuck found herself ensnared by a net. As Trandoshan slavers emerged from the forest depths, Jowdrrl quickly ran back the way she had come on Mallatobuck's advice. Jowdrrl's dropped basket of lice caused one of the pursuing slavers to slip and fall, and she was able to alert Chewbacca and Dryanta to Mallatobuck's peril.

Jowdrrl worked with Katarra to undermine the Imperial presence on her homeworld. Chewbacca had meanwhile sworn a life debt to the Human smuggler Han Solo and was traveling the galaxy with him, but in that year, the two came to Kashyyyk with explosive bowcaster quarrels to sell to the resistance movement.

The ship and its adventures were famous throughout the galaxy, and Jowdrrl and Dryanta were both honored to leave their homes and live aboard it for the duration of Chewbacca's stay. Streams of tourists from across the planet came to see the Millennium Falcon and have holograms of themselves taken beside it, but Chewbacca's two cousins kept the freighter sealed and arranged for the landing platform to be watched around the chronometer. In the morning and afternoon, when visitors were permitted, either Jowdrrl or Dryanta stood watch to ensure that the tourists remained more than an arm's length away from the ship's hull. During the several weeks that the Millennium Falcon was in their care, Jowdrrl studied the freighter closely and discovered what she believed to be several weaknesses. Dryanta, a pilot, helped her devise improvements, and the two made several modifications to the ship's systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the cockpits of YT-1300 freighters were offset to starboard and allowed very little visibility to aft and to port, Jowdrrl covered the viewports of the Millennium Falcon's loading hatches and quad laser cannon turrets with custom-fitted optical transducer panels. The nearly transparent sensors routed their output to flatscreen displays in the cockpit, which eliminated most of the ship's blind spots. One day before the final test of Lumpawarrump's hrrtayyk, Jowdrrl and Dryanta worked through the night to finish their modifications, and they had less than an hour of work left to do the next day when Mallatobuck informed them that Chewbacca was returning to the Millennium Falcon for a rush departure from the planet. He had just learned that Solo had been taken prisoner in the Koornacht Cluster by the Duskhan League\u2014the Yevethan government that had recently come into conflict with the New Republic, the Rebel Alliance's successor state\u2014and he had cut his son's hrrtayyk short to honor his life debt and mount a rescue attempt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jowdrrl and Dryanta worked to complete their task and render the ship spaceworthy, but Chewbacca arrived sooner than they anticipated.

As Chewbacca's wife and son left to prepare his things, Jowdrrl showed her cousin the modifications she had made, and he grudgingly approved of them. She wished to join him as a partner on his rescue mission, but he refused and initiated the ship's preflight procedure. However, Dryanta and Shoran were standing on the landing platform and wearing hunting bandoleers, and when Chewbacca left the ship and demanded to know what was going on, Jowdrrl continued the Millennium Falcon's preflight procedure. Mallatobuck presented to Chewbacca the rest of his crew, and when Shoran and Dryanta assured him that all three of his cousins were willing to risk their lives to help him, Chewbacca relented. After Jowdrrl was joined by Dryanta and Shoran inside the Millennium Falcon, Lumpawarrump arrived and also wanted to come along, in hopes that he could prove his worth to Chewbacca and pass his hrrtayyk at his father's side.

The information broker Formayj required several days to gather information on the Koornacht Cluster, and while the Wookiees waited, they tested and installed a firecracker mine launcher and a hull-cutting ring in place of the Millennium Falcon's escape pods. Jowdrrl also installed auto-tracking fire controllers for the quad turrets in the ship's cockpit and helped Lumpawarrump practice his fighting skills. After they had been at the ridge for a week, Formayj acquired and sold to Chewbacca a navigational map of the Koornacht Cluster, a recording of an address made to the New Republic Senate by the Yevethan Viceroy Nil Spaar, and several other intelligence documents that provided data on the Yevetha. The information had come from the clandestine New Republic Intelligence agency Alpha Blue, who had become aware of the Wookiees' mission and were covertly working to support it. Inside the Millennium Falcon, Jowdrrl and the others watched a forty-hour-old recording of Spaar addressing members of the New Republic on the HoloNet's Channel 81. The planet N'zoth was visible in the recording's background, and it became the Wookiees' destination as they lifted off from Tholatin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jowdrrl sat in the Millennium Falcon's upper quad turret, with Lumpawarrump below her in the lower turret, as the freighter reached the outskirts of the N'zoth system. Chewbacca soon called everyone into the cockpit to study new data that had just been sent to him by Formayj: a New Republic Fleet Intelligence assault plan for an Executor-class Star Dreadnought that included marked locations of cell blocks and points on the hull that could effectively be breached. The Executor-class Star Dreadnought Pride of Yevetha, which Chewbacca recognized from the earlier recording, was one of many ships orbiting N'zoth, and he calculated the orbital data required to micro-jump to within one thousand meters of the Star Destroyer. Jowdrrl then returned to the quad batteries, now with Dryanta at her side, and Shoran launched a string of firecracker mines as the Millennium Falcon executed its micro-jump. It emerged from hyperspace off the Star Destroyer's starboard bow, and the cronau radiation produced by its jump was masked by light and radiation from the exploding mines. The sensors of the Yevethan defense grid were overwhelmed by the explosions, which allowed Chewbacca to pilot the Millennium Falcon inside the Pride of Yevetha's shields and launch more mines. Yevethan starfighters pursued them, but Jowdrrl and Dryanta opened fire from the quad batteries. At least one fighter was destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Chewbacca landed the freighter on the Star Destroyer's hull, Jowdrrl was surprised to see the Yevethan fighters stop firing on them. Chewbacca instructed her to cease firing herself and, after the hull-cutting ring burned through the side of the Star Destroyer, he charged inside the Pride of Yevetha with Shoran at his side. Lumpawarrump relieved Jowdrrl in the quad turret, and she took up guard position of the Millennium Falcon's hatch. She was bewildered when nine Yevethan guards walked by her location and did not notice her, and when she contacted Lumpawarrump and Dryanta on her comlink, they reported that dozens of Yevethan starfighters had similarly ignored the Millennium Falcon. The Wookiees were ignorant of the fact that their presence had been disguised in the Force by Enara, a Fallanassi adept of the White Current who was one of Solo's fellow prisoners. Shoran was soon killed by Yevethan guards, and Chewbacca contacted Dryanta for assistance. Lumpawarrump raced out of the ship first, however, and insisted on accompanying Dryanta. Jowdrrl saw the determination in his eyes and did not argue; Dryanta and Lumpawarrump then left her alone with the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jowdrrl received no further trouble.

The Millennium Falcon then blasted off under the cover of more firecracker mines, and Chewbacca piloted it toward the nearby New Republic Fifth Battle Group. They were permitted to board the starship Intrepid after Chewbacca's Shyriiwook hails were recognized by Luke Skywalker, a Human friend of Solo's who was aboard the fleet carrier. Solo was taken to a bacta tank and Shoran to the ship's morgue; Skywalker and the surviving Wookiees visited Solo in the medical ward as he rested in between bacta sessions. Their presence there drew considerable attention.

Six months later, a memorial service was held for the fallen warrior outside Rwookrrorro, and Jowdrrl was among the several dozen friends and family members who came to mourn. The Wookiee Ralrracheen eulogized as the group stood around a circular wooden table. After the services were completed, the table was covered with foodstuffs, and the guests ate, drank, and recalled memories of Chewbacca. Jowdrrl and several other members of her family approached Solo, who sat alone and devastated, and the Human was presented with gifts by Mallatobuck and Lumpawaroo. Lumpawaroo and his cousin Lowbacca had been selected to assume Chewbacca's life debt, and Jowdrrl and Dryanta intended to arrange a farewell feast for them before Solo and his family left Kashyyyk.
