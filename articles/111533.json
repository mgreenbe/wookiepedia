Often the first real challenge for swoopchasers, the Rancor Pit consisted of three barriers usually made of transparisteel scaffolding or plasteel concrete. Fences one and three were standard Verticals, while the middle Fence was hung from an inverted section of the track. This required the rider to jump the first Fence, duck under the second, then jump the third in maneuver known as a \"bounce.\" A variation of this obstacle was the Dianoga Swamp Trap."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
