The Trade Federation scow Spotty Conveyor, which transported radioactive waste from Federation industrial worlds to the Mid Rim planetoid PDC3141-02, possessed this kind of shielding. However, during a dumping run to PDC3141-02 in 22 BBY, the scow's rad-dampening shielding began to fail after the Conveyor was prevented from depositing its cargo on the planetoid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
