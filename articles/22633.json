He was trained by the Republic Intelligence operative Berch Teller and joined the loyalist resistance against the Separatist occupiers. Following the transformation of the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire, Imperial forces under Moff Wilhuff Tarkin initiated a violent purge known as the Antar Atrocity in 18 BBY, which led to the arrests and indiscriminate killings of many Koorivar and Gotals on Antar 4 including Republic loyalists."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Joining Berch Teller's rebel cell"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cala along with the Gotal starship pilot Salikk were among the loyalists that Teller managed to rescue from the Antar Atrocity. Cala subsequently joined Berch Teller's rebel cell, which included several Gotals, Koorivar, and individuals of other species who had survived or witnessed the Antar Atrocity. Other key members of Teller's rebel cell included the former Republic journalist Anora Fair, the Zygerrian film-maker Hask Taff, the Mon Calamari starship engineer Dr. Artoz, and the information broker Knotts. The dissidents opposed the Galactic Empire and harbored a special animus for Moff Tarkin, the architect of the Antar Atrocity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the years leading up to 14 BBY, Teller's insurgents accumulated a substantial arsenal of Clone Wars\u2013era droid starfighters, warships, and communications equipment and jammers. They were helped by the Imperial Vice Admiral and Naval Intelligence Agency Director Dodd Rancit, who used his intelligence and underworld connections to provide the insurgents with equipment and weapons. Rancit was a rival of Tarkin who wanted to improve his standing in the Imperial Ruling Council.

The rebels wanted to use the Carrion Spike to attack Imperial targets across the galaxy and broadcast holovids of their attacks in order to inspire rebellion. With the help of Vice Admiral Rancit, the insurgents managed to lure Tarkin and Darth Vader to the wartorn world of Murkhana to investigate a communications cache. While the Imperials were investigating the cache, Cala along with Teller, Salikk, Anora, Hask, and Artoz stormed and stole the corvette, escaping offworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the heist, Cala joined Teller, Salikk and Artoz in the Carrion Spike's cockpit while Artoz listed the ship's communications equipment. Cala commented that the ship had state of the art technology that would easily exceed a Star Destroyer. When Teller talked about how Tarkin had designed ships with swivel cannons, Cala responded that they should come in handy. When Hask asked why the Emperor would sent Lord Vader to escort Tarkin, Cala explained that Vader had visited Murkhana after the end of the Clone Wars and executed a Black Sun racketeer. He added that the Emperor would not be happy about losing his two top henchmen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cala, who was manning the ship's sensors, then warned that a ship was approaching. It turned out that Tarkin and Lord Vader had commandeered the Sugi crime lord Faazah's ship Parsec Predator and were in hot pursuit. Salikk reported that the second ship was matching their movements, prompting Salikk to take evasive action. Cala then warned his fellow rebels that the pursuing ship was not scanning them. The rebels quickly realized that their Imperial pursuers were still tracking them despite the Carrion Spike being in stealth mode. After discussing whether the Imperials had a sort of tracking device, Cala remarked that they should have launched sooner.

However, the rebels used the Carrion Spike's pintle cannons to disable their Imperial pursuers' ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their successful raid, the Carrion Spike sustained significant damage. Under Teller's orders, Cala checked the aft maintenance bay. He found the hyperdrive generator to be working but noticed it was making strange noises. Cala was unsure when the Carrion Spike could jump again. When Teller asked, Cala estimated that it would take between ten and fifteen minutes. He remarked that the Imperials knew where to hit them. Teller responded that Tarkin knew his stolen ship's weak points."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the hyperdrive generator completed its self-test, Cala relayed the news to Teller. Before leaving the Galidraan system, the rebels jettisoned Darth Vader's meditation chamber, which the Sith Lord had been using to track them down.

When Teller asked Cala about his duties with the hyperdriver, he confirmed it was done but added that he had to spend extra time in decontamination."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Teller remarked that Cala looked ruddier than usual, Cala quipped that the stint could cost him two years of his life. Teller reassured hi that it would be a higher cost for the Imperials.

Cala identified the ship as the escort carrier Goliath, which carried a wing of starfighters and was armed with ten Taim & Bak H-eights and a Krupx missile delivery system. Tarkin and Vader were commanding the Goliath. After the Imperial ship deployed starfighters, Teller asked Cala how much time it would take for them to jump into hyperspace. Cala responded that it would take 15 minutes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the dogfight, the Carrion Spike flew rings around the Phindian tanker to prevent the Imperials from targeting them. The insurgents also engaged Darth Vader's Yellow Squadron and the tanker's ARC-170 starfighters. This bought the insurgents enough time to jump into hyperspace. Before leaving, Cala also remotely detonated a concealed explosive inside a used fuel cell aboard the Phindian tanker in an attempt to take out Tarkin and Lord Vader. However, there was a delay in the explosion. While the explosion destroyed the tanker and several fighters, Tarkin and Lord Vader's starfighters as well as the Goliath survived the skirmish."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Covering their trail"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After escaping Phindar, Cala and his fellow insurgents nursed their wounds in the Expansion Region system designated as LCC-4-4-7, which lay between the planets Aquaris and Thustra.

Salikk responded that they were lucky to escape. Cala and his comrades listened as Teller recounted Tarkin's ruthless career in the Outland Regions Security Force.

At Teller's prompting, Cala donned a hazmat suit and entered the fuel bay to run tests on the Wiborg Jenssen fuel cells they had obtained from the tanker above Phindar.

After removing the fuel cell, he discovered that it carried a concealed paralight tracker, a type of Imperial homing beacon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Cala asked if they should disable the paralight tracker, Teller instead decided to mislead Tarkin by transmitting coordinates claiming that the rebels were planning to travel on the Carrion Spike to Obroa-skai.

As a reward for discovering the paralight tracker, Teller gave Cala the privilege of destroying the Imperial tracking device."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As planned, the Imperials were tricked into believing that the Carrion Spike was heading to the Obroa-skai system. Tarkin assembled a sizable force including three interdictor vessels to intercept the stolen corvette.

Despite the chaos, Vader and Tarkin managed to capture and interrogate the crew of the Reticent, who revealed that they had been hired by Knotts to travel to Obroa-skai to deliver Sephi flyers.

They decided to abandon the Carrion Spike but not before setting the abandoned ship on an autopilot journey to Carida. Rancit had given Teller the green light to attack the Imperial Academy on Carida. However, Teller rightfully suspected that Rancit was setting a trap for them. In an attempt to cover his collusion with Teller's rebels, Rancit attempted to destroy the Carrion Spike.
