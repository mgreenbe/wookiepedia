Kashyyyk is different from the previous ten planets: rather than being 16 square kilometers of openly navigable area, it is divided into a small central area with several instanced \"dungeon\" areas. A new space zone was also added. Other content added in this expansion included the ability to add cybernetic limbs to a player character, quests for three new creature mounts and two new starships. A substantial portion of the content for this expansion was adapted from the film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, which was released to theaters at approximately the same time as the expansion release."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Customers who purchased the expansion also received a limited-edition Varactyl player mount from the digital download or a BARC speeder if they purchased the box set."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Boxed Set"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rage of the Wookiees is also available in the Star Wars Galaxies: The Total Experience and Star Wars Galaxies: The Complete Online Adventures compilation packs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
