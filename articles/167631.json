Zak was known as a risk-taker, due to his love of going \"vert\" on his skimboard. Zak and his sister were on a field trip off-planet when the Death Star destroyed Alderaan. Both children were later adopted by their Shi'ido uncle, anthropologist Mammon Hoole, who was only related to them because his brother married the Arrandas' Aunt Beryl.

As Smada ordered his Gank killers to vaporize the Arrandas, he was stopped by the intervention of the Heroes of Yavin. The children were Force-sensitive, and briefly encountered Jedi Master Yoda shortly before the Battle of Hoth. However, they were upset to find out their uncle had once worked for their worst enemy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Later life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Both of the Arrandas received university training after the threat of the Empire had lessened and became anthropologists themselves.
