Its length and volume would normally have put it in the battlecruiser-scale of the Anaxes War College System, specifically under Star Cruiser, and it was even given the alternate designation of Secutor-class battlecruiser because of this, but it was lightly armed for its size, and had extensive carrier-capability and was instead designated as a Star Destroyer. The carrier was one of the largest dedicated craft in the Navy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was crewed by 40,000 personnel, and had enough consumables to last for two years in voyage."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Offensive and defensive systems"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Compared to other Imperial Navy vessels of its size (e.g., the Allegiance-class battlecruiser), this Star Destroyer class was very light in terms of weapons output, merely possessing 15 heavy turbolaser batteries, 15 light turbolasers, 15 battleship-class ion cannon batteries, 16 medium ion cannons, and 12 tractor beam projectors, several of which lined the dorsal superstructure, on a diagonal ridge in front of the command tower. The light weapons screen, as well as the carrier role it serves, was the primary reason for it being officially considered a Star Destroyer instead of a battlecruiser despite its size being closer to the latter scale."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Complement"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Owing to its primarily being a carrier, the Secutor-class carried 144 TIE Series starfighters, as well as various other small craft, various walkers and over 14,000 troops: enough military forces to subjugate a planet.

During the Galactic Civil War, the Secutors were relatively rare, although they often appeared when least expected with their battlegroup to attack Rebel bases or support other battlegroups.
