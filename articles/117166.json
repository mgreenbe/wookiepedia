During her infancy, Page was discovered to be Force-sensitive, information that was eventually revealed to the Jedi Order. The Order entered Page's name into a database of all known Force-sensitive children known as the Kyber crystal, which would later be stolen by bounty hunter Cad Bane on behalf of the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious during the Clone Wars. Sidious and Bane planned to kidnap the children on the crystal, but the Jedi High Council anticipated the plan and dispatched Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, to Naboo after determining that Page would be one of the targets. Page was taken to safety while the Jedi set up a trap for Bane with the assistance of Page's mother. The bounty hunter arrived shortly afterward and was quickly subdued by the Jedi and taken into Republic custody."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Roo-Roo Page was a Gungan female born on the Outer Rim world of Naboo around the beginning of the Clone Wars. Living in the waterfall-surrounded Jan-gwa city with her mother, Page was at some point discovered to be sensitive to the Force. Learning this, the Jedi Order entered her identity into the Kyber crystal, a database that retained a list of all known Force-sensitive younglings in the galaxy. This list was used to recruit the future members of the Order, and was therefore entrusted to the Rodian Jedi Master Bolla Ropal for protection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the Dark Lord of the Sith Order, Darth Sidious, learned of the information held on the Kyber crystal. Planning to use the children to create an army of dark side\u2013talented spies enslaved to his will, Sidious hired the notorious Duros bounty hunter Cad Bane to steal the crystal from the Jedi Order. After killing Ropal, Bane provided Sidious with the crystal's information. Bane was then directed to begin abducting children from the crystal's memory and deliver them to the Dark Lord's secret facility on the volcanic world of Mustafar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having kidnapped children on Glee Anselm and Rodia, Bane turned his sights toward Naboo, where he hoped to capture Roo-Roo Page. However, the Jedi High Council had anticipated Bane's intentions through the Force, having foreseen Page's abduction during a meditation session. Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker was dispatched to Naboo alongside his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano. Led by the Gungan Captain Lunker to Jan-gwa city, the Jedi prepared a trap for the bounty hunter with the assistance of Page's mother. Bane arrived in Jan-gwa shortly after, infiltrating the city and spying on Page's mother as she pretended to put her daughter to rest in her nursery. Once the Gungan mother left the room, Bane sneaked in through an open window and approached the infant's bassinet, only to find a tooka doll resting beneath the crib's blanket. After a short struggle with Skywalker and Tano, Bane was apprehended and taken into Republic custody. Once the Duros was safely constrained within binders, Page's mother brought her daughter out of hiding, and the cheerful infant was playfully greeted by Tano."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Roo-Roo Page was created for the third episode of the second season of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series, titled \"Children of the Force.\" While series director Dave Filoni indicates in the \"Children of the Force\" episode commentary that the two other featured infants, Wee Dunn and Zinn Toa, are taken into the Jedi Order in the aftermath of the episode, Filoni specifically states that Page remains with her mother for some time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
