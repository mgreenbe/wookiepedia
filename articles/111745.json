During the Rebellion on Akiva against the New Republic, Rapace was stationed with four stormtroopers in a communication station in the city of Myrra. During the battle, several allies of the New Republic based within the city formulated a plan to use the communications tower to instate rebellion amongst the local population against the Empire. In order to gain control of the tower, the group sent the former Imperial Sinjir Rath Velus to approach the tower and pretend to still work as an Imperial loyalty officer. Upon reaching the station's entrance, Velus demanded that the two stormtroopers guarding the entrance sent for their commanding officer, Rapace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rapace quickly made his way down to the entrance and greeted the stranger, querying who he was. When Velus claimed to be a loyalty officer Rapace flinched in fear and then scanned the man to verify his story. The officer's scanner confirmed Velus' identity but also listed him as having been killed during the Battle of Endor, which the loyalty officer explained away as a clerical error. When Rapace also questioned Velus' lack of uniform, he explained that he had been off-duty but was now reporting in to help with the arising issues the local Imperials were facing. Velus then complimented the officer for locking down the station and then asked to inspect the insides. Satisfied with the former Imperial's answers, Rapace led him into the facility with the two stormtroopers following on Velus' orders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once inside, the group were surprised to hear a knocking on the door they had just come through.

Drawn by the noise of blaster fire, the two remaining stormtroopers that Rapace had had under his command descended from the top of the station, but were both shot by Velus. The New Republic allies then successfully triggered a local uprising against the Empire using the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rapace was a prig-nosed human male with a dowdy beard.
