As the Republic collapsed at the conclusion of the Clone Wars, it was transformed into the Galactic Empire with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine declaring himself Galactic Emperor. In the post-war stand-down, despite being stripped of support, the Hammers remained a unit with a professional mindset and remained ready for deployment. With the rise of the Empire, the Hammers became the core of the Imperial Army's armor units, and the model on which other units were based. In service to the Empire, the Hammers were assigned to the Outer Rim Territories, where the unit was originally deployed to eliminate resistance to the New Order. Their targets were often planets in the midst of an uprising or revolt, and the opposition was usually well-equipped planetary defense forces. The Hammers successes led to the unit regaining its support, and it was brought up to full regimental strength as a vanguard armor regiment in the Order of Battle. The regiment was deployed to a world in either the first or second landing wave, and were utilized to eliminate elite resistance or local armor units. The Hammers would then be withdrawn and redeployed elsewhere. As a result, the Hammers were credited with the highest number of combat landings and engagements of any armor unit within the Imperial Military."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Alliance to Restore the Republic began to make their presence known and the Galactic Civil War erupted, the Hammers found themselves assigned to assaulting Alliance outposts, subjugating Alliance-sympathetic planets, and forcibly inducting worlds into the Empire. Working in concert with stormtroopers and regular Imperial Army soldiers, the Hammers were employed to assault the defensive perimeter of Alliance outposts, eliminating soldiers, fixed weapon emplacements, airspeeders and starfighters. With the defenses cleared, stormtroopers or Imperial Army soldiers disembarked from armored transports and were then able to breach the base. The Hammers were also deployed in traditional armor engagements; equipped with the most powerful repulsortanks in the Imperial Military, the Hammers were used to spearhead assaults into enemy-held territory, destroying and overrunning most opposition they encountered. Under the command of Colonel Zel Johans, the Hammers were a fast-moving, hard hitting assault force with a reputation for getting the job done, no matter the cost. On several occasions, the Hammers were deployed without adequate support. Despite superior opposition numbers, the Hammers always managed to achieve their objectives before being forced to withdraw as the lack of support\u2014such as the absence of infantry to hold captured territory\u2014made their position untenable. The Hammers successes ensured that armor units were not removed from the Imperial Order of Battle, despite the rise in popularity of the All Terrain Armored Transport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Kwymar Suppressions, the Hammers were deployed to the planet Protazk. Landing on the Spuma Flats, Colonel Johans led the Hammers in an assault on an entrenched Alliance base. Previously hidden gun towers shot at the Hammers as they raced across the plain, prompting return fire from the unit's tanks. A formation of Alliance airspeeders targeted the Hammers, and Johans detailed squad three to deal with the threat. Four tanks, including Hammer 3:2 under the command of Sergeant Arbmab and driven by Gortz, peeled off from the main assault and targeted the incoming speeders, destroying them all in return for no losses. With the airspeeders neutralized, squad three rejoined the main assault, overrunning the first of the Alliance's defensive trenches. One tank from squad three was destroyed by an Alliance laser tower, which was promptly destroyed by the squad's remaining tanks. As the Alliance troops began to withdraw, armored transports arrived and disgorged infantry and stormtrooper units for a direct assault on the base."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Turak IV"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eighteen months after the Battle of Yavin, the war in the Parmel sector reached its peak. After successful Alliance victories on the planets Aris V and Vohai, Imperial scouts discovered the Alliance Sector Command base on the planet Turak IV. Rather than evacuate, Parmel Sector Command decided to take advantage of the situation and engage the Imperial force that would inevitably be sent to the world with the intention of destroying them and advancing the cause of the Alliance. Imperial Moff Tallis, governor of the Parmel sector, authorized General Maltaz to command Battle Group Turak, an Imperial assault regiment, to attack the Alliance on Turak IV. Tallis also petitioned for two battalions of the Imperial Hammers to be transferred to Battle Group Turak. While the Alliance was confident that they could take advantage of the incompetence of General Maltaz, they did not factor in facing the Hammers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alliance base was located under the Hitak mountains on the edge of the Uratai basin, built in an abandoned mining complex. The only visible facility was a refurbished mineral processing installation at the base of the mountains, but a network of mining tunnels were located underground around the base. Base defenses included a planetary shield generator, power generator, artillery emplacements and fortifications. There were two accessible approaches to the base; the large Uratai basin to the south, and a narrow western approach. The Alliance mined the western corridor and set their defenses to focus on the southern lava plains. The forces defending the base were known as the Hitak Harriers; two thousand and two hundred troops, supported by over three hundred vehicles\u2014including Kelliak Arms and Armor Company Freerunners, Rothana Heavy Engineering TX-130S and TX-130T fighter tanks, modified groundcars, landspeeders, combat-modified tramp shuttles, and armored repulsorcraft\u2014defended the main base. In the tunnels surrounding the basin, a further four thousand six hundred soldiers, backed by mobile artillery, nine squadrons of combat airspeeders, and three squadrons of short range attack ships were secreted away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "General Maltaz landed the regiment\u2014consisting of two battalions of stormtroopers and army infantry, and two battalions of the Imperial Hammers\u2014on the Uratai basin.

During the initial assault, tank Hammer 4:3\u2014an S-1 FireHawke from 4th Squadron, Armor Troop Zerek\u2014was on the right flank. During the advance, it took damage to its repulsorlift units and crashed into a lava column in Sector 5-7. The crew debarked and took cover while the rest of the Hammers moved on. The Alliance troops fell back to the base, and waited for Imperial reinforcements to assist the Hammers. Instead, Maltaz took six of the eight companies from the reinforcing infantry battalions of the regiment to the western corridor in an effort to flank the Alliance base. Maltaz's move allowed the Alliance to encircle the Hammers' position from the secret tunnels around the Uratai basin. The Alliance launched multiple waves against the Hammers from the hidden tunnels surrounding the Uratai basin, destroying the remaining reinforcing companies and cutting off the Hammers from the rest of Maltaz's command. During the Alliance advance, Alliance Operations HQ noted the predicament of Hammer 4:3 and sent reserve squads led by Commander Torv Keist to scout the situation and recover the vehicle if possible. The Hammers Regimental Command also dispatched a retrieval team of two army squads\u2014Squad 5-Aurek and Squad 5-Cresh under the command of Imperial Commander 343.245/H5\u2014cross-attached from Battle Group Turak to secure the area and recover the vehicle with a repulsorlift barge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unprepared for the size of the Alliance force arrayed against him, Maltaz ordered the Hammers to hold their position while he attempted to take the Alliance base.

Surviving Imperial forces rallied with the Hammers; outnumbered, they suffered heavy losses but inflicted four times as many casualties on the enemy. By the end of the battle, the Alliance had been reduced to a one-to-one parity with the Imperials from a five-to-one superiority at the beginning of the engagement. The evacuation of the base was ordered, with Alliance naval forces arriving to provide screening cover from the orbiting Imperial capital ship and starfighter escort."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Only three Imperial Hammers tanks survived the engagement, along with whatever Imperial forces had managed to rally with the unit. Aerial overflights by TIE/LN starfighter patrols reported large numbers of destroyed Alliance vehicles and starfighters spread out in front of the Hammers' position. Turak IV was considered to be the Hammers only major defeat, but it proved to be a source of great pride to the unit. The Empire used Turak IV as a propaganda victory, and the success devastated years of Alliance gains in the Parmel sector. Despite effectively winning the battle, the Alliance considered Turak IV to be a strategic defeat due to the staggering amount of men and equipment lost."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Later service"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Turak IV, the Hammers operated understrength as a battalion for two years. Although reduced in their combat ability, unit morale was high and the Hammers gained a reputation for surviving engagements and long odds. Once considered to be an expendable unit, the Hammers were placed at the forefront of Imperial High Command's strategy for the Outer Rim Territories. The Hammers were given first-class priority for fire-support requests, new personnel and war materiel. As far as Colonel Johans was concerned, however, Imperial Command's edicts were too little, too late. He never again placed trust in his superiors. The Hammers' experiences on Turak IV led them to adopt an independent mindset, prefering to plan and execute their own missions without the need for the logistical concerns of Imperial Command. While such an attitude was against Imperial doctrine, the success rate enjoyed by the Hammers led Imperial Command to ignore their actions in favor of the current state of affairs. After successfully subjugating the Alliance-sympathetic Yatir on their homeworld of Absit, Johans convinced Imperial Command that the Hammers would be more effective if restored to regimental strength. Johans was promoted to the rank of High Colonel, and the Hammers were directed to the planet Brintooin for training and reconstitution as a regiment. Despite being above the command rank for a regiment, Johans continued to personally command the unit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At Brintooin Base, transfer requests were evaluated and weeks of training were conducted to select the elite of the Imperial tank corps. The surviving Hammers battalion was reduced by ten percent as Johans even put his own men under scrutiny. Johans had a goal; to create an armored battlegroup with the Hammers regiment at the core. The proposed battlegroup would be able to support the Hammers without the need to rely on rear-echelon command decisions. The battlegroup's other three regiments would be outfitted with the mobility, firepower, and logistics to effectively support the Hammers. Prospective Hammers candidates that scored ninety-nine percent in their qualification tryout\u2014with one hundred percent being the qualifying score for the regiment itself\u2014were transferred to the nascent battlegroup. Brintooin Base became an armored warfare training center, and other tank crews were rotated to the planet for training under the Hammers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this training period, the Hammers missed out on participating in the Battle of Hoth. The victory was claimed by General Maximilian Veers, one of Johans' rivals. Reviewing the after-action reports, Johans declared that if he had led the assault with the Hammers, the result would have been the shattering of the Alliance. Veers had used All Terrain Armored Transports, which were slower than the Imperial repulsortanks employed by the Hammers. While victory had been achieved, several transports had escaped Echo Base with high-ranking personnel, material, and starfighters. If the Hammers had been utilized, their tanks would have been unaffected by the Alliance harpoon and tow cable tactics, were armored enough to resist enemy firepower, and would have reached and disabled the planetary shield generator in a third of the time it took Veers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Hammers returned to active service, the Emperor was killed at the Battle of Endor. In the crackdowns that followed as the Empire began to fragment, the Hammers were deployed off-world, and the support regiments were transferred to other theatres of combat. The battlegroup that Johans envisioned never materialized on the battlefield, and the Hammers were treated as disposable assets once more. As the Empire fractured, the Hammers continued to win victories but they were outstripped by the campaigns being lost. Eventually, they found themselves fighting against other Imperial warlord factions. Finally, the Hammers found themselves squaring off against one of their own former support regiments. Johans made a decision he had been avoiding; he ordered the support unit to form up with his unit, then withdrew from the battlefield. Returning to Brintooin, he recalled all Hammer affiliated units, and put out a general call to any Imperial commanders interested in joining him; an invitation many accepted. The Hammers rested and repaired their tanks and equipment, and began training. Johans intended to wait out the Imperial infighting and rejoin a faction with a legitimate claim to the Empire. As he waited, the Alliance became the New Republic and took Coruscant. Johans aided other Imperial factions by loaning his forces to them, but was careful who he lent his support to. Warlord Zsinj attempted to bully and bribe Johans into bringing the Hammers under his command, but the colonel resisted his overtures."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Seclusion on Brintooin"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hammers remained on Brintooin until Grand Admiral Thrawn returned from the Unknown Regions and embarked upon a campaign against the New Republic. After demonstrating great strategic and tactical ability, Johans allied the Hammers with Thrawn. Thrawn's campaign was primarily naval in nature, and the Hammers only participated in one operation for the Grand Admiral before his assassination in the Bilbringi system. After Thrawn, the resurrected Emperor emerged from the Deep Core. Johans did not jump at the opportunity to serve, but remained attentive for orders which never came. Johans and the Hammers continued to occupy Brintooin. The planet was administrated by Governor Thalkuss, but ultimate power rested with Johans. The population of the planet credited the Hammers as the reason Brintooin remained out of the fighting, and was not the target of either a New Republic or Imperial military assault.

Zgorth'sth recommended allowing Johans and the Hammers to remain on Brintooin and that a diplomatic solution was viable as a military confrontation was likely to be disastrous.

The surviving Hammers operated without a reserve, forcing the unit to rely on the talents and abilities of its crews to achieve their mission objectives in a timely fashion. Despite the decreased fighting capacity of the Hammers, their ability to survive engagements in the face of superior opposition led to high morale through the unit. The unit's self-reliance, coupled with the increased autonomy granted to the Hammers by Imperial Command, ensured that unit morale remained high. Instead of looking to other Imperial units for support, the Hammers placed their faith in each other and Colonel Johans. As the unit was reconstituted on Brintooin, the standing battalion was reduced by ten percent as Johans placed his own forces under heavy scrutiny.

While he used the Hammers' success in the field to increase his own standing within the Imperial Army, he was distrustful of his superiors after the near-destruction of the unit at Turak IV. Devoted to the Hammers, he intended to craft a dedicated battlegroup around the unit to reduce their need to rely on outside Imperial support for them to operate. Johans was the driving force behind the design of the Imperial-class repulsortank, consulting on the design.

Comprised of three battalions and a regimental command group, the Hammers deployed two battalions to assault objectives, with the third operating as a reserve. Combat losses incurred at Turak IV reduced the Hammers' effective strength to a single battalion which consisted of the battalion command, three companies known as armor troops, and a reconnaissance troop. Each armor troop was commanded by a captain, and contained four platoons referred to as squadrons. Each squadron was headed by a lieutenant and was comprised of four repulsortanks.

Recon squadrons operated independently of each other to cover a wider area during operations, and were expected to retreat if confronted by the enemy. Recon troops were deployed to explore areas ahead of the main armor formation, reporting on terrain difficulty, and enemy positions, strengths and weaknesses. As the armor formations advanced, recon troops were positioned to the flank and to the rear of the advance to keep watch on the enemy movement in case they attempted to outflank the armor columns and cut them off.

The battery provided fire support and air defense for the battalion, and each gun was repulsorlift-mounted so it could be moved into position to support assaults or cover enemy counter-attacks.
