The scientist was one of the Empire's finest and was the only non-Sith to ever set foot aboard the space station, though he died not long afterwards when his Pythar-class Imperial shuttlecraft Deference was shot down in the Hoth system amidst the Battle of Hoth in 3665 BBY. The scientist's shuttle would crash in the Highmount Ridge on the planet Hoth, where it lay for over two decades until the White Maw pirates discovered the ship and removed its databank. Not long afterwards, the Jedi Knights Leeha Narezz and the Hero of Tython located the Deference in their search for the space station's plans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The scientist was first mentioned in the BioWare video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, as the owner of the shuttle that players search for in the Jedi Knight mission \"Sub-Zero Showdown\" on Hoth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
