After the Clone Wars, Alderaanian weapons were placed onboard the war frigate Another Chance, which was later sent on a random voyage throughout the galaxy, until the Council activated the ships' recall beacon in a time of emergency. But the Council never had the chance. The council was destroyed when the first Death Star wiped out Alderaan; however, the beacon would survive to be used. Orinn Tathis was the last surviving member of the Council, having been off-world at the time of Alderaan's destruction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
