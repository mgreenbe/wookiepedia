The city is under a heavy Imperial occupation, and its streets are being patrolled by stormtroopers and AT-AT walkers. Imperial Star Destroyers patrol the skylines. Ezra, looking at the city through a pair of macrobinoculars, says that it's worse than their local rebel contact, Ryder Azadi, reported. As the three rebels wait, Chopper spots Ryder's landspeeder being pursued by two Imperial 614-AvA speeder bikes and an AT-DP walker. Ezra and Kanan jump onto Ryder's speeder, while Chopper jets onboard with his rocket booster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rebels almost run into a roadblock, and Ezra and Kanan struggle to cling on to the speeder's engine thrusters. Ryder is forced to do a U-turn towards the AT-DP. Ezra and Kanan use their lightsabers to cut through the walker's legs, causing it to topple to the ground. Ryder's speeder is pursued by the two speeder bikes on the highway. When Ezra asks about the bikes, Ryder assures him that they don't need to outrun them because they just need to wait for the bikes to get to 190. When Kanan asks what happens if they go up to 190, Ryder tells them to watch and wait. Kanan asks if Ryder's speeder even goes up to 190, and Ryder responds \"sometimes\", asking the Jedi to \"think fast thoughts\". Ezra and Kanan use their lightsabers to deflect the shots fired by the bikes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "True to Ryder's promise, the engine of one of the speeder bikes overheats, causing it to explode, its flying debris taking out the other bike. Ryder tells his guests that those speeder bikes are from the local Imperial factory, and that he and his rebel cell have been infiltrating the factory to sabotage them. When Ezra and Kanan praise Ryder's work, Ryder responds that he can't claim credit, as a friend of Ezra's came up with the idea. The rebels travel to Ryder's stone circle hideout in Lothal's wilderness. There, Ezra encounters an old friend of his family, the farmer Morad Sumar. He observes that the boy has grown and cut his hair. He welcomes Ezra and tells him that his parents would be proud.

The Sumars and Jho cheer. When Ryder asks when the strike will take place, Kanan tells him soon, but that it depends on what they learn while they are there. Ezra says that their source, Fulcrum, has told them that the Empire is developing a new weapon. If they knew what it was, the other rebel cells would agree to launch an attack soon. Morad informs Ezra that the Empire has tightened security around Section A2, and transferred the best workers there. When Kanan asks if Morad can get them inside the factory, he asks if Ezra has any manufacturing experience.

Governor Arihnda Pryce, Agent Kallus and Lieutenant Yogar Lyste have summoned the workers at the factory for an inspection. Pryce orders Kallus to make sure the workers are all present. Ezra recognizes Governor Pryce as Kallus' new boss, who Sabine Wren had told them about. Kallus tells the workers to look sharp, because they have been honored to receive an inspection from Imperial High Command. The inspector turns out to be Grand Admiral Thrawn, who does not regard his visit as an honor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn tells the workers that vehicles produced by the Lothal factory have a far higher rate of malfunctioning than those produced at others. He believes that poor craftsmanship is to blame, and states that it has caused the Empire to lose troops and missions. Thrawn warns that such malfeasance will not be tolerated any longer. He then addresses Morad, who answers to the com number Worker 5473. When Thrawn asks Morad if he had been pressed into the Empire's service, Morad confirms it, because he had lost his farm. Thrawn then asks Morad whether he takes pride in his work. Morad professes to do so."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gesturing to a 614-AvA speeder bike on display, Thrawn tells Morad it is the last model that he personally inspected. He then asks Morad to demonstrate how quickly it can reach full speed. A stormtrooper drags a reluctant Morad to the bike. Ezra tries to intervene, but a stormtrooper tells him to fall back in line. Morad starts up the bike. Its engine begins to overheat, and Morad powers it down. However, Thrawn is not finished with the demonstration and brings it to full power. The bike explodes, and Morad is killed, leaving only his blackened worker's helmet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Morad's death prompts horrified reactions from the workers, Ezra, Kanan and Kallus, whilst Thrawn is dispassionate, Lyste is vaguely disturbed and Pryce outright smirks sadistically. Now that he has gained the workers' attention, Thrawn warns them that whatever they build they will now test personally. He predicts their malfunction rate will drop substantially, fussily plucking a bit of stray ash off his uniform. Ezra attempts to charge at Thrawn, but Kanan holds him back so as not to blow their cover. Thrawn then orders Kallus, Lyste and Governor Pryce to ensure that nobody leaves the factory because he wishes to inspect the line for sabotage. Lyste informs the workers that the factory is on full lockdown. Kanan tries to contact Ryder to warn Hera Syndulla about the lockdown, but is unable to send a signal since the Imperials are jamming it."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Going undercover"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lieutenant Lyste then orders the workers to form two lines and submit for verification and questioning. A stormtrooper orders the workers to present their ID cards for examination. Kanan and Ezra know they need to avoid the scrutiny and Chopper, at Ezra's urging, causes a commotion by starting up a speeder bike, which crashes into a barrier. This distracts the Imperials, and allows Kanan and Ezra to flee the room. Lyste asks Chopper what is the matter with him, and orders the droid to report for maintenance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ezra and Kanan flee down a corridor and proceed on their mission to find out what the Empire is up to. Kanan suggests starting with Section A2. Ezra replies that they have to get changed, since the workers are on lockdown.

Ezra and Kanan knock out the Imperials and steal their uniforms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Governor Pryce asks whether the rebels have infiltrated Section A2 and warns that the secrets of that product are imperative. Thrawn responds that he has ordered anyone trying to enter that area without his personal code to be terminated on sight. He then chides Governor Pryce for compromising security by hiring locals, and Pryce responds that the factory has quotas to meet. Kallus explains that he could question the workers, but that he can't determine whether they are lying without any information on the classified project. Pryce haughtily responds that all Kallus needs to know is that the Admiral has a new fighter initiative. When Kallus states that he can't see how one fighter can change much, Thrawn responds that victory and defeat are often determined by the smallest details. Thrawn then asks a worker if an AT-DP standing on display is his work. When the worker responds in the affirmative, Thrawn has Kallus make the walker step forward, and it quickly collapses. Despite the worker's protests, Thrawn gestures for his stormtroopers to arrest the man."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back at Ryder's rebel encampment, he contacts Hera, at Chopper Base on the planet Atollon, to tell her that the factory is on full lockdown and that he can't reach Ezra and Kanan.

When one turns up, Kanan tells the droid that it is in a restricted area and that they need to see its clearance code. When the droid withdraws its clearance code, Kanan takes it. Chopper then electrocutes the droid with his spark projector, and Ezra catches the Imperial droid before it falls over and props it against the wall. Kanan hands Chopper the clearance code, and Ezra tells him to make it fast.

When Lieutenant Lyste and Kallus enter, he asks them about a piece of Sabine's artwork, painted on a section of retaining wall. Lyste merely remarks that it looks like part of the base's retaining wall, while the more astute Agent Kallus recognizes it as a symbol of Phoenix Squadron. He identifies the starbird as a creature of light rising in flames, and interprets it as a symbol of the rebels' commitment to victory. Thrawn observes that he has seen the starbird markings everywhere on Lothal, and speculates that the crew of the Ghost have a special attachment to Lothal and will always return."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Thrawn asks if they have found any more subversives, Lyste nervously informs him that two of the workers have gone missing, but their uniforms have been found. While Kallus is confident they will locate them once they have issued an alert, Thrawn points out that the rebels will have already found new disguises and suspects that they are inside the factory to gather more information and escape. When Kallus asks Thrawn whether he thinks that the rebels are more than saboteurs, he responds that the rebels are likely after the contents of Section A2 and orders Kallus to secure it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While waiting for Chopper, Ezra and Kanan are found by a stormtrooper patrol. The patrol's corporal, wearing a black pauldron, asks the two about their business. Kanan claims they're on guard duty, and when the corporal asks what they're guarding, Ezra responds that they go where they're ordered. The corporal states this is highly irregular, and asks for their operating numbers. At this point, Chopper emerges from Section A2. Kanan asks the corporal if this is Section B17, and when told it's Section A2, Ezra claims that he knew they were in the wrong section, telling the corporal that they're new transfers. They quickly walk away from the patrol, only to turn a corner and see Lieutenant Lyste ordering more stormtroopers to set up a full lockdown. As Kanan, Ezra and Chopper flee down the hall in the opposite direction, the stormtrooper corporal and his men pursue the three undercover rebels. Arriving at a pair of turbolifts, Kanan hits the call button in a hurry, but gets no response. He tells Ezra that things are probably going to get \"messy\".

However, Kallus manages to stop the fight by telling them that he is Fulcrum. When the two Jedi express doubt, Kallus proves he's telling the truth by using the code phrase \"by the light of Lothal's moons\", to the Jedi's surprise. Kanan and Ezra remove their helmets, although they are skeptical due to their previous encounters with Kallus. He manages to convince them by stating that Zeb trusted him on the ice moon Bahryn, and that he helped Sabine escape Skystrike Academy.

Ezra retorts that that's not a good thing, and Kanan tells Kallus that if he wants to help them, he can help them get a signal to the rebels outside. Kallus and the rebels enter a communications station, with Kallus pretending to fight the rebels during the attack. Using their blasters, lightsabers, and some Force pushes, Ezra and Kanan stun the stormtroopers and another Imperial officer. Kallus is irritated that Ezra Force pushed a stormtrooper into him without warning him he was going to do that, and Ezra responds, \"Where's the fun in that?\" Kallus tells them that their droid can uplock their comlinks from this port, and that he will provide the access codes. However, Chopper mutters that he doesn't need them. Kallus remarks that their C1 is pretty efficient, and Chopper beeps, pleased by the flattery.

Kallus then says that all he has to do now is make this look convincing, so Ezra off-handedly Force pushes the Imperial Security Bureau agent through the glass monitor board.
