The Force cult known as the J'doon constructed a shrine on the asteroid. During the Galactic Civil War, a cell of the Rebel Alliance camped on the asteroid while traveling from their previous base to Hoth. The scholar Korin Aphra, attempting to investigate the ruins, encountered the rebel cell, who provided him with rations and made him leave. After capturing Aphra, Darth Vader traveled to the shrine with the archaeologist Chelli Aphra, the daughter of Korin Aphra. Despite having left Asteroid Helix 13-v, the rebels continued to watch over the asteroid base using hidden cameras, learning that the Empire was searching for information on their new base. While in the shrine, Vader experienced a vision, and was compelled to leave the asteroid, declaring that the rebels were no longer present. After leaving the asteroid, Vader ordered TIE bombers to destroy it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
