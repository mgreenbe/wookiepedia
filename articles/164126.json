The crystal would resonate in the Force itself and, as such, had no affinity with the dark or light side of the Force; instead, it simply influenced the vicinity it was located in. It was for this reason that the Jedi Order never used such Force crystals, as they could easily amplify dark side or light side powers and potentially turn a Jedi to the dark side."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
