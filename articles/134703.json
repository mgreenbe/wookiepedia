The player flies an X Wing against wave after wave of TIE Fighters in the first segment of the level. Once they are all defeated, the player flies across the surface of the Death Star destroying Turbolaser Towers and TIE Fighters alike. Finally Darth Vader makes an appearance flying his TIE Advanced x1. If he is defeated, the player begins his trench run. Darth Vader makes a second appearance here and the game breaks with canon as his wingmen can be destroyed with proton torpedoes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Hoth features both the Snowspeeders and the escape from Echo Base. The main targets for the snowspeeders are the AT-STs, but when there is a call for Attack Pattern Delta, snowspeeders make an attack on the necks of AT-AT's and can decapitate them. After damaging the attacking Imperial forces, the snowspeeder lands and the player proceeds on foot through Echo Base to find the Millennium Falcon.

The battle is also noted for having to make strafing runs against the occasional Star Destroyer and a duel against a Lambda Shuttle. The Main Reactor is destroyed by firing five sets of proton torpedoes which goes against canon as the X-Wing at this time only has a rack of six.

The lightsaber is used to block Vader's attacks and when he overbalances himself, the player can strike back by pulling off a combination move as indicated on the screen. If all the combination moves are completed, Darth Vader falls and Skywalker's lightsaber points at Vader.
