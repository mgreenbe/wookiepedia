They contained duty station consoles, and their walls were lined with control panels and monitors. Those pits were designed so the flight data officers, tracking systems specialists, and combat supervisors that worked there could not see the bridge's viewports, and thus focused on their consoles without unnecessary distraction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
