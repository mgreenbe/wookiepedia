Their name had been invented by Leia Organa, then toddler princess of Alderaan, and her friend Winter. The baskets consisted in small pastry shells filled with chopped fruits. Although the baskets were intended for the children of the palace, Memily once noted that even Senator Bail Organa, husband to Queen Breha, was fond of them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
