They also sent Alpha-class Xg-1 Star Wings and three CR90 corvettes to try to destroy the Excelsior. However, Alliance RZ-1 A-wing interceptors managed to hold off the attack long enough for the Excelsior to reach hyperspace. It would send T-65 X-wing starfighters and BTL Y-wing starfighters to attack the Blue Fox."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
