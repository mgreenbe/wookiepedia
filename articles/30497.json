The nickname referred to his homeworld, as many of the prisoners were referred to by such rather than their name. Coruscant had a sabacc deck, and brought it into the grashal that served as the prisoners' mess hall in order to provide a loud and boisterous cover for a secret message that Ryn one-one-five, a member of the Ryn Network, had smuggled into the compound."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
