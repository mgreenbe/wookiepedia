After clamps on line Ten-A became jammed, a Scrapper Guild foreman droid sent the scrappers Cal Kestis and Prauf to secure the cables. The workers did as they had been ordered, allowing a ship cutter to detach the wing. However, the cables snapped and the wing tilted downwards, causing both Prauf and Kestis to fall towards the Ibdis Maw below. Prauf almost fell to his death, but Kestis slowed his fall using the Force, allowing him to land on a passing hover barge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
