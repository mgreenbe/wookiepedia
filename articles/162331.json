Major Turr Phennir was the first and only recipient of the Starburst. It was also offered to Soontir Fel but he refused on the grounds of it being created by a coward and thus meaningless. After the admiral was killed, the award effectively ceased to exist."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
