Many different types of shuttles existed. Some were designed only to carry people from a planet's orbit to its surface, or from one larger ship to another located nearby. However, many shuttles were fitted with their own hyperdrives and could thus travel great distances. Military shuttles used for the collection or delivery of troops were usually referred to as troop shuttles or troop transports."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
