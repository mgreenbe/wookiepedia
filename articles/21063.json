Jun-Fan and the task force traced the Zabrak brothers to the planet Yellowblade's Landing and confronted them, though Maul and Opress managed to escape. During the skirmish, both Jun-Fan's Padawan, Tatsu, and Kenobi were injured, causing Jun-Fan and the remaining Jedi to pursue the Sith. Jun-Fan, Plo Koon, and Jedi Master Ko Solok confronted Maul and Opress on the world Pleem's Nexus, with Jun-Fan combating Maul himself. He was injured by one of Maul's cybernetic legs, and succumbed to the injuries dealt to him by the Zabrak after the brothers escaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brun Jun-Fan, a Human male, was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order during the final decades of the Galactic Republic.

Around 20 BBY, the Sith Lord Darth Maul\u2014who was thought to have been slain by Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi twelve years earlier during the Battle of Naboo\u2014resurfaced during the war with the aid of his brother and apprentice, Savage Opress. Jun-Fan was selected by the Kel Dor Jedi Master Plo Koon to take part in a task force whose objective was to hunt down and capture Darth Maul and Opress. Jun-Fan, along with Tatsu, accompanied Masters Koon, Kenobi, Ko Solok, Grohto, and a team of clone troopers to the ice world Yellowblade's Landing, which was the last known location of the Zabrak brothers. The task force found a cantina where members of the criminal gang Scourge lay dead on the floor. Jun-Fan used his psychometric abilities to devine that the Sith were responsible for the massacre and noted that the Zabraks were in a nearby cave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When they tracked Maul and Opress to the Scourge gang's base in the caves, Jun-Fan and the clone soldiers began to combat several wampas that Maul released. The other Jedi, meanwhile, attempted to capture Maul and Opress, who ultimately managed to escape with a hostage after killing Grohto and maiming Tatsu. Jun-Fan used his psychometric abilities on a piece of jewelry that the Sith's hostage had dropped, gathering that they were headed to the planet Pleem's Nexus. Jun-Fan, Koon, and Solok left Tatsu and Kenobi behind due to their injuries and followed Maul and Opress to Pleem's Nexus.

Jun-Fan proceeded to use his unarmed abilities to try and overpower Maul, and eventually began to choke the Sith Lord, determined to end what he considered Maul's evil actions. However, Maul repositioned his right cybernetic leg and kicked Jun-Fan in the abdomen, mortally wounding the Jedi Master. After Maul and Opress escaped when Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker arrived in their starfighters, Jun-Fan died in Koon's arms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bruu Jun-Fan was light-skinned with brown hair and eyes, and kept himself in good physical condition.

Jun-Fan was dedicated to capturing Darth Maul and Savage Opress, and during his confrontation with Maul on Pleem's Nexus, he attempted to try and convince Maul to reveal his former Sith Master's identity.
