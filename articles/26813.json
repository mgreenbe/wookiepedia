In 10 BBY, Chussido was amongst the Cloud-Riders who traveled to the planet Savareen with Nest in order to try and acquire coaxium fuel from a crew of criminals working for the Crimson Dawn syndicate.

In 10 BBY, Nest led a small group of the Cloud Riders in an attempt to steal a shipment of coaxium fuel from the Galactic Empire on the planet Vandor; however, their plans were thwarted by a crew of criminals led by Tobias Beckett and associated with the Crimson Dawn syndicate, who also attempted to steal the coaxium and destroyed it in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Determined to obtain coaxium for use against the Empire, Nest then monitored the surviving members of Beckett's crew and learned that they had stolen raw coaxium from a mine on the planet Kessel and were headed to the planet Savareen to refine it.

The Cloud-Riders initially kept their blasters aimed at the criminals, but after Nest removed her helmet the two groups moved inside a local bar to talk. Nest explained what Crimson Dawn and the syndicates had done to Chussido and her companions' homeworlds, as well as their crimes against the local population of the village, and tried to convince Beckett and his followers to hand over the coaxium to them rather than let it be used by the syndicates and their ally, the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The speech failed to convince Beckett, but did persuade the outlaw Han Solo to help them. He worked out a plan with the Cloud-Riders and the rest of Becket's crew which would allow them to kill Crimson Dawn's leader, Dryden Vos, who was headed to Savareen to collect the coaxium. The plan involved Chussido and the other Cloud-Riders giving their helmets to the residents of the village, who could then act as decoys for them.

As expected, Beckett betrayed his companions and informed Vos that the coaxium was fake, causing the crime lord to send out his force of mercenaries led by Aemon Gremm to capture the Cloud-Riders, whom he assumed had the real coaxium.

She then knocked another mercenary to the ground with stock of her blaster, and aimed it at him before he could get up. The remaining mercenaries were quickly subdued or killed, leaving Vos with no back up on the First Light. Solo and his allies then killed Vos and Beckett, before returning the real coaxium to Nest, Chussido and the other Cloud-Riders, who loaded the coaxium onto their speeder bikes. Chussido and the others then mounted their vehicles, waiting for Nest to launch first before taking off behind her and leaving for a rendezvous they had to keep with the Onderonian rebel Saw Gerrera, to whom they gave the coaxium."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chussido had black eyes and yellow skin.

Davies also took inspiration from the Rodians seen in Star Wars Battlefront when designing the character. Concept art including Chussido titled \"Enfys Gang Group Version 5A\" was also produced by costume concept designer Adam Brockbank. The final mask used in Solo had some sculptural differences from the original and also had war paint applies to further distinguish it from Greedo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chussido's costume was later reused in the 2019 television show The Mandalorian.
