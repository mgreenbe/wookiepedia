Assigned as an apprentice to Jedi Master Kyle Katarn, Korr participated in the fight against a newly emerged dark side cult called the Disciples of Ragnos, which sought to resurrect an ancient Sith Lord, Marka Ragnos. Korr undertook multiple missions throughout the galaxy, foiling the cult's plans as best as he could and earning himself a promotion to the rank of Jedi Knight. Eventually, Korr defeated the leader of the cult, Tavion Axmis, on the Sith world of Korriban, stopping the Disciples of Ragnos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 40 ABY, during the Second Galactic Civil War, Korr participated in an attack on the Corellian superweapon known as Centerpoint Station, during which he killed over two dozen people aboard Centerpoint by spacing them, an act he later came to regret deeply. Having struggled throughout his whole life with the feeling of doubt and afraid of his natural affinity for dark side powers, Korr became disillusioned with the Jedi Order and his own role with the Force. He distanced himself from the Jedi and lived in a self-imposed exile on Coruscant until he received a vision from the Force that directed him to a frozen moon in the Unknown Regions. Korr then enlisted the crew of the salvage ship Junker, the Human Khedryn Faal and the Cerean Marr Idi-Shael, to fly him to the moon from his vision. Arriving there, Korr and his companions received a distress signal coming from the surface of the moon and also encountered the ancient Sith dreadnaught Harbinger, as well as Jedi Master Relin Druur. Both Druur and the crew of the Sith vessel had unknowingly traveled five thousand years through time from the Great Hyperspace War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Druur went on his separate path and destroyed the Harbinger carrying the cargo of powerful Lignan crystals, Korr followed his vision and landed on the frozen moon, where he found an abandoned Imperial research facility, in which the Empire's scientists had been conducting experiments on creating clones from combined Jedi and Sith DNA which was authorized by Grand Admiral Thrawn. However, the clones had gone mad and had killed their creators. As the surviving clones escaped from the moon, Korr and the crew of Junker pursued them, with Korr taking on the Force-sensitive Idi-Shael as his apprentice. His experiences on the frozen moon also taught Korr to accept the feeling of doubt as an integral part of himself. Following the clones' trail, Korr also discovered that one of the clones, Soldier, had been produced from his DNA."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Korr and the two scavengers tracked the clones to an ancient Rakatan space station, which had developed its own consciousness and which the clones venerated as \"Mother.\" Aboard the station, Korr and Idi-Shael were ambushed by the Umbaran Nyss Nenn, an agent of the One Sith organization. Korr killed the Umbaran but was in turn killed by the Iteration, another clone of his created by the One Sith and intended to replace Korr in the Jedi Order as their agent. Thanks to Idi-Shael's quick thinking, however, Korr's consciousness was preserved in the Iteration's body; Korr's apprentice used the mindspear device to transfer Korr's memories into the clone, after which Korr and his Padawan escaped from Mother. Korr remained unaware of the transfer that had occurred, and he returned to the Jedi Order, continuing his respectable career."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jaden Korr was a Human male raised on the galactic capital planet of Coruscant by adoptive parents during the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic.

While living with his uncle, Korr jokingly referred to his caretaker as \"Uncle Orn the Hutt,\" due to the man's obesity and wheezing laugh."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As an adolescent, Korr accidentally scarred his right cheek with one of his uncle's tools; the scar never properly healed and remained there from that point on. The death of Korr's parents caused him to retreat deep within himself and to become overly philosophical for his age. Over the years, that self-seclusion led to Korr's discovery of his latent Force-sensitivity."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Thrawn's experiments"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 9 ABY, Korr was inadvertently involved in Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn's experiments with cloning.

Soldier was the latest of the clones produced and was the most stable of the clones, not suffering from the sickness that affected the other clones and caused their bodies to deteriorate if not administered the metacycline drug. Korr was unaware of his clone's creation; Soldier was none the wiser as to the identity of his genetic template, as the clone lived in isolation at the facility, a subject of constant scientific experiments."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Arrival at the Jedi Academy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 ABY, guided by the Force, Korr went to his uncle's workshop. In a dreamlike state, he used whatever spare parts he could find inside the workshop to construct a working purple-bladed lightsaber, a rare feat for an untrained Force-sensitive. Marveled by the blade he had created, Korr showed the lightsaber to Orn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Concerned by Korr now possessing such a dangerous weapon, Orn reported his nephew to the New Republic authorities on Coruscant, and within two days Korr was enrolled into Jedi Master Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum on the moon of Yavin 4 to be trained as a Jedi. After a series of space flights and multiple changes of transports, Korr ended up on the shuttle Yavin Runner II, bound for the Jedi Praxeum."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the ride, he met a fellow recruit, Rosh Penin, who was intrigued by Korr's lightsaber and inquired Korr about its origins. Before Korr could answer, their shuttle was shot down by hostile forces as it approached the surface of Yavin 4, although the shuttle pilot managed to crash-land the transport without any casualties."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Korr and Penin were separated from the rest of the group during the crash and could not join the other students, who were escorted to a nearby Massassi temple by the pilot. Skywalker was planning to pick the students up with a shuttle and deliver them to the main Academy site, the Great Temple. Korr and Penin, meanwhile, proceeded to the nearby temple on their own, but they ran into a group of stormtroopers and a darksider wielding a red lightsaber. After Korr defeated the enemies, he crossed a moat surrounding the temple and climbed up one of its alcoves. From that hiding spot, he saw three figures standing at the entrance to the temple, a female and two males. The female was pointing a glowing scepter at the building, linking the two by a beam of pulsing energy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Korr's eavesdropping efforts were detected, and the mysterious figures turned on him, emanating a bright flash of light from the scepter that knocked Korr unconscious. Upon awakening, Korr witnessed that the three figures were gone. He was reunited with Penin and the other students, who had arrived on site. Korr then met Jedi Masters Kyle Katarn and Skywalker, who had arrived to retrieve the Jedi initiates. The Jedi Masters welcomed their new students to the Jedi Academy and questioned Korr about what he had seen. The incursion by the unknown forces, which bore striking semblance to a Sith cult, worried the Masters, as did the fact that the aura around the temple had become much weaker after the attack."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First training exercise"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly thereafter, Korr and Penin attended Skywalker's welcoming ceremony at the Grand Audience Chamber inside the Praxeum. During the ceremony, Skywalker assigned the new recruits to their Masters. Both Korr and Penin were assigned to Katarn as students, and they were taken to a nearby Jedi training course to be instructed in basic Force abilities such as telekinesis, Force speed and Force sense. Overseen by Katarn, Korr and Penin took separate routes to the finish line of the course. On the way, however, Penin set loose a lightsaber practice droid upon Korr in the hope of slowing him down so he could finish the exercise first, but Korr defeated the machine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After they completed the course, Korr became angered at Penin for his actions, but Katarn warned Korr that anger could lead to the dark side of the Force, and Korr accepted Penin's apology, cementing the friendship that had started to develop between them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker then informed the three that he had analyzed a piece of clothing worn by one of the Sith Cultists whom Korr had encountered, discovering that it bore the symbol of Marka Ragnos, an ancient Dark Lord of the Sith Empire who had died more than five thousand years earlier. The Jedi Master told Korr and Penin that they would be assigned on different missions throughout the galaxy and instructed them to look for more information regarding the cult during those missions."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Disciples of Ragnos crisis"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Teaming up with Chewbacca"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having heard that members of the mysterious cult were trying to recruit mercenaries and smugglers on the desert planet Tatooine to transport a special cargo, Skywalker sent Katarn and Korr to investigate the matter. Reaching the city of Mos Eisley aboard Katarn's starship, the Raven's Claw, Korr and his Master discovered the legendary YT-1300 light freighter Millennium Falcon, standing empty in one of the city's hangars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Katarn then left to meet his contacts in the nearby Krayt Cantina while Korr guarded the door to the hangar. Korr soon heard blaster fire and lit his lightsaber to face the attackers, but instead it was the Wookiee Chewbacca, the co-pilot of the Falcon, who ran through the door, escaping from a group of mercenaries. The famous Wookiee, who was on the planet for a mission in connection with Chief of State Leia Organa Solo, helped Korr to get rid of the members of the Tatooine underworld that assailed them both, and together they eliminated many of the thugs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In an attempt to stop Korr and Chewbacca's advance, the mercenaries then activated tractor beams that prevented the Raven's Claw and the Falcon from taking off. Korr and Chewbacca split up, and while the Wookiee distracted the mercenaries, the young Jedi handled the deactivation of the tractor beams. Upon reaching the tractor beam control room, however, he was confronted by a lightsaber-wielding enemy, a member of the same Sith cult that Korr had previously engaged on Yavin. Korr defeated the opponent and deactivated the tractor beams."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Korr and Chewbacca reunited and then eliminated the last mercenaries, who had prepared an ambush around the Falcon. It was at that moment that Katarn came back to the hangar, sharing the intelligence he had gathered from his contacts with Korr and the Wookiee. Katarn had learned that the mercenaries were known to take a high price for their services, a fact that led Katarn to suspect the Imperial Remnant in financing the cult. Before the Jedi left, Chewbacca showed his affection for Korr, and Master Katarn instructed the Wookiee to inform Organa Solo of his discoveries."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The deserts of Tatooine"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Korr and his Master were then informed by Skywalker that a Tatooinian moisture farmer had overheard smugglers talking about the cult in a cantina, and had ordered his R5 droid to record it. Having taken flight, the farmer had sold his droid to the Jawa scavengers and had left the planet. Traversing the deserts of Tatooine, the apprentice and his Master attempted to retrieve the R5 unit before the Jawas could erase its memory and sell it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Katarn instructed his apprentice to attempt to locate the Jawas sandcrawler in a nearby canyon, while he was collecting information from local farmers. On his way to the sandcrawler, however, Korr bore witness to a Tusken Raider attack on the Jawas. Korr was forced to eliminate the Tusken warriors and snipers located in the canyon before reaching a deserted settlement, inhabited only by a few droids and marauding Tuskens."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After passing through a tunnel network infested with Tuskens, Korr eventually reached the Jawas' sandcrawler, which had been taken over by the Sand People. Korr managed to penetrate the vessel's hold in search of the droid and defeated the infesting Sand People. As most of the Jawas had been killed in the Sand People attack, Korr believed that there was no one left to negotiate the trade with, so he extracted the droid from the sandcrawler. After dealing with a final Sand People attack outside, Korr reunited with his Master.

After a Bakuran team sent to investigate on the intrusion did not return, Skywalker assigned Korr on a follow-up mission, asking him to wait for Katarn's arrival before dislodging the unknown forces from the power plant. The Jedi were instructed to ensure that the station\u2014built on the crater of a dormant volcano\u2014remained intact, because the awakening of the volcano could destroy a crowded city."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arriving on Bakura in his starfighter, the Z-95 Headhunter Far Wanderer, Korr waited for Katarn for an extended period of time on the landing pad. After a while, Korr lost his patience and decided to explore the vicinity of the plant alone. Following a trail of corpses of the Bakuran rescue team, he infiltrated the facility and checked the security system of the plant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Korr discovered that the infiltrators, forces of the Imperial Remnant, had placed five bombs at crucial points throughout the facility.

As he was leaving Bakura, Korr received a message from Katarn, who apologized for being unable to come.

The Jedi Academy had recently picked up a distress call from a merchant ship, which had been attacked by an Imperial Immobilizer 418 cruiser and had crashed on the planet Blenjeel. Korr was then sent to the supposedly uninhabited planet to rescue any survivors. Once on site, the aspiring Jedi was caught in a storm and several essential pieces of his rescue vessel were damaged by lightning.

He left the planet, and the Jedi Order signaled the dangerous nature of Blenjeel to the authorities of Coruscant so that the planet could be marked as hazardous on the star-charts. A beacon was also installed on the planet, warning visitors to stay away from it."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Saving Coronet"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After reuniting with his Master at the Academy, Korr left with Katarn for the planet Corellia aboard the Raven's Claw, on a mission to investigate reports indicating the presence of members of the Sith cult in the capital, Coronet City. As they flew over the city aboard the Raven's Claw, the Jedi received a distress call from the pilot of a maglev train attacked by the cultists and their mercenaries. Katarn dropped off Korr on the train, while himself engaging the ships of the cult in the skies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Korr began to jump from wagon to wagon, eliminating the mercenaries and even several Dark Jedi who barred his way. As he reached the middle of the train, he located a bomb protected by another Dark Jedi, killing the enemy and deactivating the explosive. With the bomb disabled, the saboteurs accelerated the train in order to collide with a nearby train station.

Investigating further, he soon found a number of flashing relay beacons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following their trail, he found that Imperials were patrolling the area. Encountering some local tauntaun creatures, Korr climbed on the back of one of the creatures and cut his way through Imperial patrols to a cave, where he encountered a wampa beast. After defeating the wampa, Korr proceeded to follow the flashing beacons placed by the Imperials, and reached an outpost abandoned by the Rebel Alliance during the evacuation from Hoth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before penetrating into the base, the young apprentice had to fight his way through the All Terrain Scout Transports, Viper probe droids and Imperial troopers guarding it, and then he had to eliminate the Imperial soldiers who were patrolling the inside of the outpost.

Now a formal Apprentice of the New Jedi Order, Korr also learned a new style of lightsaber combat\u2014either fast or strong\u2014in addition to his medium style.
