The famous droid R2-D2 was equipped with such boosters, and he put them to good use throughout the Clone Wars. However, by the time of the Galactic Civil War, R2-D2's boosters had not worked in ages, and his warranty was long expired, having been damaged at some point after the Clone Wars. During the Age of the Empire, the C1-series astromech droid Chopper also had a single rocket booster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
