It was caused by an infection, such as by bacteria or by blocked blood vessels. It was usually the result of critically insufficient blood supply. This condition was most common in the lower extremities. The best treatment for gangrene was the restoration of blood flow of the affected organ, which could reverse some of the effects and allow healing. Other treatments include removal of the dead tissue and surgical amputation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
