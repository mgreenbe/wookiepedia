Born in 1026 BBY, he was raised as a poor miner on the Outer Rim planet Apatros. After killing a Galactic Republic ensign in a fight in 1003 BBY, Dessel was in danger of being arrested and imprisoned by the Republic. With the help of his friend Groshik, he escaped off-world to join the Sith Brotherhood of Darkness. Initially serving as a foot soldier in the Gloom Walkers unit, he was recognized as a Force-sensitive, and taken to the Sith Academy on Korriban. Bane, as he had been christened, quickly became one of the best students at the Academy before he lost his faith in the dark side of the Force. Though Bane was able to regain his confidence in the dark side, he lost his trust in the Brotherhood of Darkness, believing it to be a flawed organization whose leader, Skere Kaan, was a coward and a fool. Deserting the order, he went to the planet Lehon and studied the holocron of Darth Revan, and, armed with new knowledge, helped destroy the Brotherhood, allowing him to create his own Sith Order. He then instituted a Rule of Two, which stated that there could be only two Sith to avoid the infighting that had plagued the Sith for millennia. He also took both the title of Darth and an apprentice named Darth Zannah."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 990 BBY, ten years after the destruction of the Brotherhood, Bane sought to learn how to create a holocron, through which he would pass down his knowledge to future Sith Lords. The Sith journeyed to the Deep Core world of Tython to locate the Sith holocron of the ancient Dark Lord Belia Darzu. However, while Bane was on Tython, the Jedi Order learned of his existence, and sent a group of Jedi to kill him and his apprentice. Once the Jedi arrived, they confronted the two Sith in Darzu's fortress. Though outnumbered, the Sith were able to defeat the Jedi; however, Bane was grievously injured. Zannah took him to Ambria, where she convinced the healer Caleb to help them. Caleb notified the Jedi Council, only to have Zannah use her powers to drive her cousin Darovit insane. Zannah killed Caleb, then hid herself and Bane. When the Jedi arrived, they killed Darovit, believing him to be the Sith Lord. Thus, the Sith were believed destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A decade later, Bane began to worry that his apprentice was too weak to overthrow him and assume the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith, as was necessary under the Rule of Two. He began to research the secrets to prolonging his life by transferring his essence to another body, and traveled to Prakith, where he claimed the holocron of the ancient Darth Andeddu. After returning from Prakith, Bane was ambushed by a team of assassins hired by Caleb's daughter, Serra, and was captured. Taken to Doan, Bane was imprisoned and tortured, only to covertly gain his freedom soon afterward. Encountering Zannah on Doan, Bane dueled his apprentice, who sought to become the new Dark Lord. The fight ended in a draw, with Bane escaping and heading to Ambria with Darth Cognus, an Iktotchi assassin skilled in use of the dark side whom Bane planned to take as his apprentice if Zannah proved herself weak and unworthy. There, Bane and Zannah engaged in a fateful duel that resulted in the death of the Sith'ari and Zannah claiming the title of Dark Lord. Bane tryed to initiate the ritual of essence transfer but failed to control his apprentice's body. Part of Darth Bane's soul lived in Zannah's body after the failed ritual. But the majority of his spirit was thrown into the void, causing him an eternity of suffering. Nearly a millennium later, Bane's Sith Order defeated the Jedi Order and overthrew the Republic. His holocron still imparted wisdom through the years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Human male who would become Darth Bane was born as Dessel on the Outer Rim planet Apatros in 1026 BBY to an abusive miner named Hurst. Des, as he was nicknamed, was often bullied by his father and the other miners. Hurst blamed his son for the death of his wife, who had perished during childbirth. Hurst also took to blaming Dessel for his own miserable life on Apatros, and considered his son to be the bane of his existence\u2014so much so that he took to calling him \"bane\" frequently. In 1010 BBY, at the age of sixteen, Dessel began to work in the cortosis mines of Apatros under the direction of the Outer Rim Oreworks Company. He learned to fend for himself, ignoring the threats and insults hurled at him by his father and the other miners, and grew into a muscular young man as he worked deep in the cortosis mines. One of Dessel's few friends was Groshik, the Neimoidian owner of the local cantina. Unknown to anyone, Dessel was Force-sensitive, and he occasionally felt the call of the Force's dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One day, when Dessel was eighteen, a drunk Hurst berated him until Dessel stood up to his father and challenged him to a fight. Irate, Hurst beat him until his ribs cracked, although Dessel withstood the pain without sound. That night, Dessel, filled with hate, envisioned his father dying by picturing a giant hand squeezing his heart. The next morning, Hurst was dead. Unknown to Dessel, he had used the Force to kill his father. After Hurst's death, his friends tried to continue with their harassment of Dessel, but the young miner now had the confidence to stand up for himself, and proceeded to best many of them in fights until they learned to leave him alone. On the fifth anniversary of Hurst's death, a man named Gerd\u2014who had been friends with Hurst\u2014decided that he would put Dessel in his place. In a drunken stupor, Gerd attacked Dessel and attempted to gouge out one of his eyes. With a premonition granted by the dark side of the Force, Dessel severed Gerd's thumb with his teeth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning to town on a Galactic Republic cargo ship, Dessel began playing sabacc in Groshik's cantina against other miners and a group of Republic soldiers who had arrived to pick up cortosis shipments from Outer Rim Oreworks. A skilled gambler, Dessel proceeded to win many games while also tossing frequent barbs at the Republic to the soldiers in the cantina. Successfully driving every other player out of the game, Dessel played his final hand against a young ensign, and both ended up with an Idiot's Array, the rarest hand possible. In a final round where whoever was dealt the highest card would win, both players received nine. In the next sudden death round, Dessel got a nine, beating the ensign's eight, and giving him sabacc and the ten thousand credit sabacc pot. The irate ensign attempted to attack Dessel, but was stopped by Groshik. Groshik also ordered everyone but Dessel out, and explained to the Human that he was worried; Dessel had somehow played the soldiers, twisting them to his advantage and never relenting. Furthermore, the crowd had somehow fed off of Dessel's anger, Groshik believed. Dessel reassured his friend, but the Neimoidian warned him to be careful."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Dessel left the cantina, he was attacked by the ensign and two other soldiers. Easily dominated by the miner in physical combat, the ensign pulled out a vibroblade. However, Dessel's unconscious use of the Force allowed him to detect the weapon. Reacting without thinking, Dessel stabbed the ensign with his own weapon, killing the soldier. Panicked, the other Republic soldiers fled to alert their superiors. The miner was forced to turn to Groshik, who used his contacts to save Dessel from being caught and imprisoned by Republic forces by arranging to have him smuggled off-planet to join the Sith\u2014the enemies of the Jedi and the Republic engaged in a prolonged war with them."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "New Sith Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dessel was hidden onboard a Rodian's starship, and taken to join the Brotherhood of Darkness as a foot soldier, helping to win the New Sith Wars. The Human quickly rose to the rank of sergeant in a Sith unit known as the Gloom Walkers. Wielding a GSI-21D and a TC-22, he became a skilled shot. His use of the Force made him an adept soldier and commander, and he was able to guide his unit away from death many times, such as during the Battle of Kashyyyk. For his actions, Dessel earned the trust of the Gloom Walkers over that of the unit's commander, Ulabore, who took credit for his unit's victories, which had been enabled by Dessel. The Gloom Walkers soon became one of the most skilled of the Sith's infantry units, and they were sent on the most critical missions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, things changed for Dessel after the Gloom Walkers received an order regarding the Battle of Phaseera. Ulabore knew the order to be a tactical mistake but planned to follow it anyway since he was afraid to face the Sith Lord who had issued the command. Dessel mutinied and punched Ulabore in the face, knocking him out cold, and then proceeded to lead the squad into battle. After being blinded by a flash grenade, Dessel discovered that he could still \"see\" where all the Republic soldiers were. Thanks to this mysterious sight, he managed to kill each soldier with a sniper rifle in the space of a few seconds. Though he did not know it at the time, he had unconsciously used the Force. After the battle, Dessel discovered that Ulabore had informed the Sith Lord Kopecz of his actions. Expecting to be court-martialed, Dessel was saved from this fate by the Dark Lord, who offered to take him to Korriban where he could enroll at the Sith Academy. Dessel decided to accept Kopecz's offer. Having been offered the chance to create a new identity for himself, he thought back to the cruelty of his father, and decided to take a new name, one which would signify his new life\u2014Bane."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Training on Korriban"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane arrived at the Academy and immediately began to study the ways of the Sith under the Sith Lords Qordis and Kas'im. On his own initiative, he also frequently studied the archives in the academy, which contained documents about the dark side and the history of the Sith. However, the Sith Masters discouraged the studying of the archives, claiming they were relics of a time long forgotten. Thanks in part to the Masters' advice, Bane began to abandon the archives he studied at the beginning of his training in favor of increased focus on physical and mental exercise. Despite the late discovery of his Force-sensitivity, Bane began to exceed many of the students who had been trained since birth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After training for several months and rapidly climbing to the top of the ranks among the students, Bane challenged to a duel a Makurth student named Fohargh who had previously beaten him. After beating Bane in lightsaber combat, Fohargh began to taunt him, causing Bane to fill with rage. He unleashed his anger, killing Fohargh with a wave of dark Force energy against Kas'im's instructions. This victory earned Bane the attention of the Zabrak Sirak, the favorite of Lord Qordis and one of the most prominent students at the academy. Though Bane expected to be punished for killing a fellow student, Qordis instead was impressed by Bane, and began urging the Blademaster Kas'im to pay special attention to Bane."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the victory left Bane shaken. The Sith apprentice realized that he had been responsible for the death of his father years before. This revelation caused Bane to doubt the Masters' teachings, and he began to fear the power of the dark side. As a result, he also started to lose his connection to it. Realizing that unless he acted quickly he would fall behind the other students, he challenged Sirak. The Zabrak easily bested Bane, nearly killing him. After his loss, Bane was shunned by the other Sith. Desperate, he turned to the archives once more. From them, he learned more about the history of the Sith and the power of the dark side. Bane began to question the direction the Brotherhood of Darkness had taken, and he seemed especially interested in finding out why none of the current Sith Lords took the title Darth. He began to believe that the Brotherhood was inherently flawed, and ruled by pretenders. Upon questioning Kas'im later, Bane learned that the leader of the Brotherhood, Lord Skere Kaan had forbidden any Sith from taking the title Darth, as he claimed that the use of this title would only encourage the infighting that had nearly destroyed the Sith thousands of years earlier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this time, a Jedi deserter named Githany arrived, and Bane saw his chance to reclaim his place among the other students. Githany in turn saw Bane as a tool she could use against Sirak, her only real rival at the Academy. Requesting that Githany secretly teach him Force techniques she learned from the masters, Bane also began private lightsaber combat instruction with Kas'im. Neither teacher was aware of the other, ensuring that Bane had an edge over both. Bane and Githany soon began to realize that they had feelings for each other, though neither wanted to admit it. As his training progressed, Bane learned far more from the archives at the Academy than he had originally thought possible, and continued supplementing his knowledge of the Force with the teachings of the ancient Sith. Bane mastered many Force powers while perfecting his lightsaber techniques."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When he believed himself to be ready, Bane once again challenged Sirak to a duel. The Human played his opponent, wearing him down before wounding him, sending a humiliated Sirak to the medical wing. Following this victory, Kas'im presented Bane with a curved-hilt lightsaber that had previously belonged to his own master, a Sith Lord named Na'daz, who had saved the Blademaster from slavery on Ryloth. Kas'im also revealed that he had killed his master in a personal test of skill and took his weapon as a reminder of what his master taught him. This revelation left a lasting impression on Bane."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once again under the gaze of the Academy Masters, Bane was summoned by Qordis, who revealed to the apprentice that he had been aware for some time that Githany was teaching him. Qordis then told Bane that he was to stop studying the archives. Bane, whose doubts about the Brotherhood had only grown, was angered, and defied Qordis by leaving the Academy for the Valley of the Dark Lords in search of answers from the tombs of long-dead Sith Lords. However, Bane found no Sith spirits in the tombs, concluding that they judged the current Sith to be weak and unworthy. Bane believed that the Brotherhood was flawed, and that Kaan placed the greater good of the order over the dark side as a whole, preventing the Sith from defeating the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nearly dead from exhaustion and hunger, Bane returned to the Academy two weeks later to learn that the students were to be raised to the level of Dark Lords of the Sith on the orders of Lord Kaan, and were to be sent to the planet Ruusan to participate in battle against the Jedi Army of Light. Bane was greeted by Githany, who informed him of the news, and led him to the archives. Unknown to Bane, she had secretly entered into an allegiance with Sirak, who wished to kill him. In the archives, Bane was attacked by Sirak and his allies Llokay and Yevra. However, Githany then betrayed Sirak by giving Bane his lightsaber and entering the fight on his side. She killed Llokay and Yevra while Bane disarmed his rival. Sirak begged for mercy, claiming that if Bane spared him, the Zabrak would serve him. Ignoring his pleas, Bane decapitated Sirak, releasing all his fears and guilt in the process and fully opening himself to the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Githany proclaimed that the two were now Dark Lords bound for Ruusan, Bane explained to her that he planned to go elsewhere. He denounced Kaan's Brotherhood, even when Githany praised Kaan and begged him to wait. Marching to Qordis's chamber, Bane confronted the Sith Lord, asking if he had ordered Sirak to kill him. Qordis was horrified that Bane had killed one of the Academy's most skilled students. However, Bane ignored his anger, denouncing Qordis and the other masters as cowards. Taking the title of Darth, Bane proclaimed that he was leaving the Brotherhood. The Human headed for the rooftop, where Qordis's personal starship, the Valcyn, was docked. Boarding it, Bane set a course for the planet Lehon in the Unknown Regions, hoping to find true understanding of the dark side."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Lehon and the Holocron of Darth Revan"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After landing on Lehon, Bane began his search for the Temple of the Ancients, and along the way managed to tame a wild rancor to be used as his steed. He felt a much stronger connection to the dark side on Lehon than he did on Korriban, which reinforced his belief that the Brotherhood was flawed. Once he made his way to the temple, Bane began searching for any dark side relics. Though the temple appeared empty, he sensed a great power hidden there, and so continued to search until he located a holocron that had been created by the Sith Lord Darth Revan millennia ago. Thrilled at having his faith rewarded, Bane activated the holocron, and spent several weeks studying it. From the holocron, Bane learned a tremendous deal about the dark side and Sith\u2014more than he had learned in his entire time at the academy, he felt. The knowledge he gained from this holocron validated his view that the Brotherhood needed to be destroyed for the Sith to conquer the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Kaan, fearful of Bane and his intentions, dispatched Kas'im from Ruusan to kill his former student. Thanks to Githany, who had had a vision of Bane on Lehon, Kaan knew where to send the Blademaster. The Twi'lek Master made his way to the planet, and then confronted Bane in the temple, revealing that he intended to kill him. After a heated lightsaber duel, Bane gained the upper hand, and forced Kas'im into a corner. However, the Blademaster split his double-bladed lightsaber, wielding it as two separate blades. During training Kas'im had always derided fighting with two lightsabers, ensuring Bane had no experience facing such an opponent. Where Bane had been sure of victory only just moments before, his inexperience put him at a severe disadvantage, and he quickly lost his momentum. Bane was sent tumbling down a staircase as Kas'im advanced, ready to deliver the killing blow. Furious at himself and Kas'im, Bane remembered that he knew the layout of the temple, an advantage the Blademaster lacked. He unleashed his anger into a blast of dark Force energy, and though Kas'im managed to throw up a Force shield to protect himself, the blast caused the temple to collapse on the Twi'lek, killing him. Bane then dispatched a messenger drone to Ruusan, informing Kaan of Kas'im's death and handing the Sith Lord instructions to perform the Sith ritual to make a thought bomb, one of the many secrets he had learned from Revan's holocron. The Dark Lord kept this secret from the other Sith."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Near-death on Ambria"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By then, Kaan believed that a military victory on Ruusan was certain. An orbital blockade sustained by the Sith battle armada kept Jedi reinforcements from landing on the planet. Not long after sending Kas'im after Bane, Kaan received a message from the disillusioned Sith, who stated that he wished to return to the Brotherhood. However, Githany believed that the Brotherhood no longer needed Bane and offered to kill him. Believing Bane to be a threat, Kaan agreed and she left to meet with her former love interest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane chose the barren world Ambria to meet Kaan's envoy. Lake Natth, a body of black and poisonous water, had become the focus for the dark side energy on the planet, and Bane made his camp on its shores. While Bane waited for Githany he considered a question he still could not answer; once he had eliminated the Brotherhood, where would he find an apprentice worthy of the knowledge he had to impart? When Githany arrived they shared a passionate kiss, but Bane tasted poison on her lips and realized that Kaan had sent her to Ambria to kill him, although he kept this realization secret. Seeing that Githany understood the source of the strength in the dark side, Bane wondered if she could become his apprentice. He realized, though, that she believed too strongly in Kaan and the Brotherhood to accept his knowledge, and he sent her away, confident that her poison would have no effect on him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Githany left, Bane realized that she had tricked him and she had used a lesser poison to cover a far more powerful toxin on her lips\u2014synox. Though he attempted to strengthen himself by drinking in the suffering of those who died on a battlefield on Ambria, the dark side was too faint on the planet. Falling into unconsciousness, Bane collapsed. A small boy named Mikki, along with his father and brothers, who were scavenging the battlefield, happened across Bane's lightsaber. Seeing his chance, Bane used the Force to control the lightsaber and kill the boys. In so doing, he absorbed the father's horror and suffering, using it to temporarily give him strength. Still feeding on the man's fear, Bane then killed him, ignoring his pleas for mercy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Strengthened by their pain, Bane was able to hold off the poison long enough to locate the healer Caleb, who had come to the planet to help the victims of a recent battle.

However, Bane sensed the presence of another individual: Caleb's daughter, and threatened to torture her unless the healer assisted him. Caleb relented and healed Bane, leaving him fully revitalized.

During a tactical planning session among the Dark Lords, Bane revealed himself, much to the surprise of the Sith. Bane proceeded to mock Kaan and the other Sith, accusing them of acting like cowards and holding back from the true power of the dark side. He then offered an alternative method to defeat the Jedi: a Force Wave. Kaan agreed to Bane's plan, and at nightfall, Bane met the others atop a cliff overlooking the forest where the Jedi were hiding. Bane led the Sith in a ritual designed to concentrate the power of the dark side in one being\u2014Bane\u2014and unleash its power on the Jedi. With Bane as the conduit, the Sith Lords released an inferno upon the forest. As the forest burned, the Jedi were forced to flee to the plains nearby to avoid destruction. However, before Bane could wipe out the Jedi, the ritual was cut short. Fearing the power that had been revealed to him, Kaan had ended the ceremony, using his connection to the other Dark Lords to pull them out as well, announcing that they would board their speeders and defeat the Jedi using more conventional methods.

Bane was intrigued, until Qordis revealed that he could help Bane overthrow Kaan and seize control of the Brotherhood. The Dark Lord then informed the former Academy head that he was mistaken\u2014he had come not to take control of the Brotherhood of Darkness, but to destroy it.

Nyras obeyed the Sith Lord's orders, and as the two fleets met, several smaller ships with Jedi onboard were able to reach the surface. The Jedi immediately came to the aid of Hoth, forcing the Sith to retreat from what had seemed like certain victory.

He also ordered Bane to remain at camp; after the defeat of the Army of Light, Kaan planned to return and have the Sith Lords kill the powerful darksider. Unknown to Kaan, Bane was able to easily resist his mind tricks, and was merely feigning obedience. Kaan believed he had tricked Bane, and was also convinced that he and the other Sith could survive the thought bomb. Kaan and the other members of his order made their way to a series of caves nearby, planning to allow the Jedi to follow them. A number of Jedi followed the Sith, confronting them deep underground.

There, Bane located Nadd's holocron. However, as Bane moved to claim it, he was attacked by a number of beetle-like creatures in the chamber where the holocron was. Bane was unable to keep them away, and two of them attached to his skin (square in the chest and the back of his left shoulder).

Furthermore, they gave Bane tremendous healing abilities, and pumped chemicals into his bloodstream, enhancing his connection to the Force while increasing his rage, thus boosting his power in battle. Because they increased his capabilities while causing him to suffer unending pain, Bane viewed the creatures as both a gift and a curse.

Around this time, Sith prisoners in custody on Akrit'tar revealed to the Jedi that they believed Bane to be the fabled Sith'ari, although the Jedi incorrectly believed that Bane had been killed during the Ruusan campaign. The Jedi archivist Restelly Quist wrote about Bane in the Jedi training manual The Jedi Path. Along with studying the dark side, Zannah was tasked with occasionally stirring up rebel groups on different worlds over the years, in order to distract the Republic. He was careful to always instruct his apprentice to cause these groups to be defeated, as while he wanted the Republic distracted and weakened, he did not want one of these separatist groups gaining enough power to overthrow the Republic itself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 990 BBY, Zannah undertook a mission to Serenno, where she manipulated the Anti-Republic Liberation Front and their plans to kidnap former Supreme Chancellor Tarsus Valorum, leading to them failing in their mission.

Darovit had revealed the Sith's existence to the Jedi, and had been taken to the Jedi Temple to speak with the council.

By postponing the inevitable duel between master and apprentice, Zannah, Bane believed, was destroying the purpose of the Rule of Two\u2014to keep the Sith strong. Further worrying him was the fact that he was aging rapidly due to his use of the dark side, and his injuries on Tython a decade ago.

Whereas the Jedi and the Republic believed that it was the duty of the strong to help the weak, Bane believed that the strong were intended to rule the weak masses. Equality, Bane believed, was a lie perpetuated by the Jedi. One of the reasons he hated the Brotherhood was that it supported equality amongst the Sith. Bane's Rule of Two was designed with the intention of strengthening the Sith Order over time, with each apprentice challenging their master for the title of Dark Lord. If the apprentice failed, the master would ideally find another apprentice. In this way, each successive Dark Lord would be stronger than their predecessor.

Additionally, he believed that the power of the dark side was finite, and that the existence of many Sith spread the power of the dark side thin.

One drawback to being infested with the orbalisks was that, because they drew on Bane's power to feed themselves, he was only capable of performing delicate tasks with the Force for a somewhat limited period of time. This was due to the fact that, in order to precisely modulate his powers for subtle tasks, he had to cut the orbalisks completely off from the dark side.

As a sergeant, Dessel was allowed to wield a secondary weapon, and so carried an advanced GSI-21D pistol, able to disintegrate armor. He also kept a vibroblade in his boot.

After he returned from the tombs on Korriban in an effort to find knowledge, Bane declared his abandonment of the Brotherhood, and aware that Qordis would not try to stop him, left the planet in the Headmaster's ship. Bane traveled to Lehon, Ambria, and Ruusan in the highly advanced ship before he crashed on Dxun. By 980 BBY, the Dark Lord had come to own a Theta-class T-1 vessel named the Triumph. The Cygnus Spaceworks vessel could be flown by one pilot, which Bane used to his advantage in 980 BBY when he made a trip to the Deep Core planet Prakith without informing his apprentice. His return trip to his mansion on Ciutric IV proved to be Bane's final journey in his shuttle, as he was ambushed on the planet and taken to Doan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Character origins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Darth Bane, and his Rule of Two, were created by George Lucas as part of his backstory of the Sith he developed for the prequel trilogy.

Part of the novel covers Bane of the Sith, while it also invents new history for Bane and his apprentice. A third novel, Darth Bane: Dynasty of Evil, was released in 2009.

Although George Lucas commissioned the scene, he later cut it before the scene could be fully animated. Series Director Dave Filoni voiced similar concerns to the inclusion of the two Sith Lords; though the scene would have been appreciated by Expanded Universe fans, he stated that cutting the scene had been the right thing to do. The fact that Revan later converted to the light side could also have raised continuity issues if he did appear as a Sith spirit. Darth Bane himself later appeared in the sixth season episode \"Sacrifice\" as a spirit that Yoda had to face and defeat.

Also, in Bane of the Sith and Path of Destruction, Bane's lightsaber hilt is clearly described as being \"hooked\". However, in almost every illustration, even those from after the publishing of Path of Destruction, Darth Bane is depicted with a standard-hilt lightsaber.

In Path of Destruction, Bane comes to detest the Brotherhood after studying Revan's holocron and the ancient records when he realizes that the Sith can never be united or equal.
