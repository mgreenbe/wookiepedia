Shortly prior to the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, one such starship was near the MC80A Home One Type Heavy Star Cruiser Home One while the fleet contingent prepared itself for hyperspace. Once the group arrived above Endor, all Alliance cruisers established a perimeter while the starfighters flew closer to the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station. Once it was revealed to be a trap, more Alliance forces participated in the battle. By the battle's end, at least six of the starships survived along with other Alliance vessels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The starship physically resembled the MC80 Liberty Type Heavy Star Cruiser, with the exception of not having large winged protrusions on the port and starboard. Similarly, this vessel had nine engines, and had the ability to travel in hyperspace. Like other Mon Calamari vessels, the starship has a bulbous hull."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
