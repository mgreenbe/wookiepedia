The office was responsible for handling operations considered too important to delegate to the operatives of Systems Operations. Such missions generally included infiltration of high-priority targets such as Imperial Army and Navy installations, Imperial Intelligence, and the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Coordinate agents were highly trained, highly skilled operatives, armed with the best weapons and equipment the Alliance to Restore the Republic could offer. The best case officers commanded the operations, and they were coordinated from Operations HQ. Coordinate operatives would conduct operations on planets where an active cell network was in place, usually in situations where the task at hand was too large for local assets, or where the cell was not entirely trusted by Alliance Intelligence. In these cases, Coordinate would either not inform the local Sector Intelligence of their activities, or use them as a diversionary asset."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
