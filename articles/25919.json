During a battle against a Separatist dreadnought, Chiata's Venator-class Star Destroyer crashed onto the planet Zeffo. Chiata and Marseph both survived the crash, along with some of their men, but were separated. Chiata was found by her clone commander, but Order 66 was executed just as he did and she was forced to kill him in self-defense before being attacked by more clone troopers. Though she reunited with Marseph and mounted a brief defense, Chiata was fatally wounded, dying of her injuries. Marseph then buried her among the wreckage before dying of his own wounds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
