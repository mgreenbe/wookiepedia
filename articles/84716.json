Its predecessor, the MG7 proton torpedo launcher, only held up to three proton torpedoes. The MG7-A held eight miniaturised MG7-A proton torpedoes. Quick-change magazines allowed for the torpedoes to be swapped for other payloads, such as concussion missiles or mag-pulse warheads. The launcher itself was also a detachable unit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
