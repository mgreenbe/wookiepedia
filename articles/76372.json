Kinlo was hidden by Yahenna Laxo of the Gray Syndicate, one of several such individuals in hiding for petty crimes. The Gray Syndicate was a minor presence in the world of crime on the Outer Rim planet of Lothal, though Laxo fancied it as something greater.

Worried they might catch wind of his other activities, he decided to have Rosey of his syndicate visit Kinlo along with Apapaba, Durchine, Holshef and Marhas that night to move them to new locations. Prior to this, he sent Merei Spanjaf, another member of the group, to tell them to be packed and ready."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kinlo is mentioned in passing in Servants of the Empire: Imperial Justice, the third title of Jason Fry's Servants of the Empire quartet.
