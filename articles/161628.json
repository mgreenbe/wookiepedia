Void Droids often joined up with fellow malfunctioning droids to form roving bands. To survive, such groups were forced to scavenge and steal power and replacement parts; some Void Droids even became violent toward mundane droids out of desperate need for lubricant and other hardware. Void Droids were associated with the wreckage of starships and space stations. One such group inhabited a chunk of wreckage from the Galactic Empire's destroyed Death Star battlestation after the Battle of Yavin. The droids encountered a band of Alliance to Restore the Republic operatives and their Squib guide sometime before 2 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
