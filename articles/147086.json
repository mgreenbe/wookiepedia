They had a multi-generational feud with fellow Wookiee Chewbacca after Tojjevvuk, a famous member of the clan, died dueling Chewbacca in a fight for Mallatobuck in 155 BBY. Although Tojjevvuk's father Tvrrdko forgave the Wookiee he saw responsible for his son's death after Chewbacca freed children of the Tojj clan from slavery, there was seen to be lingering resentment between the Tojj clan and Chewbacca's clan even fifteen years after the latter's death on Sernpidal during the Yuuzhan Vong War. Tojjelnoot, the council leader of Kashyyyk at the time of the Second Galactic Civil War, bore no grudges against Chewbacca's relations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although in the comic Chewbacca Tojjevvuk and his father are present in flashbacks as characters, it was not until Legacy of the Force: Inferno that Troy Denning established that there existed the Tojj clan, of which both Tojjevvuk and Tojjelnoot were members, and that the feud continued into the period in which that novel was set. Tvrrdko, although his name does not possess the 'Tojj' section, is presumed to be a member."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
