The gang stripped Bliss of almost everything valuable, but Bliss's revenge on them was hard. Mercenaries were set on their tail and Vette was captured and sold into slavery. Plasmajack and the others tracked down Bliss in return, hoping for eventual payback. By the time Vette changed hands and ended up with a Sith apprentice of Darth Baras, Bliss has acquired a Twi'lek artifact called the Star of Kala'unn. Driven by her desire to take the artifact back, Vette convinced the Sith to confront Cada Bliss at the Nar Shaddaa spaceport, where she took the artifact from him. Vette later arranged a reunion with Plasmajack and the others at the spaceport and the gang had a good time together, before Vette handed the Star of Kala'unn over to them.
