Because of this, the planet's rotation period was extremely short. However, the heavy molten core of Syned counter-balanced the planet's fast rotation to produce a standard gravity environment. Syned was orbited by an adolescent star, therefore its surface was entirely covered in ice and snow. The planet had little oxygen in its atmosphere, making it necessary for members of most sentient species to don an environmental suit when outdoors. Physicists during the Republic Dark Age expected the planet to eventually tidally lock to its parent star, thawing the dayside. Its surface had a tortured appearance, with shattered ice sheets broken by ancient tectonic activity frozen into place."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Syned was home to at least two non-sentient species: giant ice lizards known as beralyxes and Synedian algae. The latter thrived in the seas beneath the ice sheets covering the planet's surface. Synedian algae were used as both a source of fuel and food, being extracted through thermal veins and then processed at algae processing plants. Without these algae processing plants, Syned would be unable to sustain any civilization. The planet's reclamation facilities were also used to extract underwater minerals at a rate of one miligram at a time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Dravian Starport was eventually built to serve as a waypoint between Syned and the desert world of Cotellier."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "New Sith Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point between 1066 BBY and 1040 BBY, Syned was under the control of Sith Lord Chagras."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Chagras' death in 1040 BBY, the world came into the possession of the Sith Lord Arkadia Calimondra and served as the capital of her realm.

During the Imperial Period, each city was governed by a councilor who were very loyal to the Imperial governor.
