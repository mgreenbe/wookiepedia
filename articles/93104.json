In 19 BBY, the station was raided by the Sith Lord Darth Maul and his brother, Savage Opress, as part of their scourge across the Outer Rim. The Nightbrothers destroyed multiple squads of police droids and seized a fortune in credit chips as well as Snugg's cargo ship. Following the attack, Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Adi Gallia traveled to the station in order to investigate a distress signal sent from it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two Jedi met with Snugg in one of the station's main offices, where the warehouse supervisor informed them of the Zabraks' heist, and that the credits they stole could not be traced. Snugg asked if the thieves were rogue Jedi, which Kenobi denied. The superintendent then requested that Kenobi ignite his lightsaber, and after seeing its blue blade Snugg stated that the droids who had been attacked observed Maul and Opress's sabers to be red. Kenobi told Snugg that the pair were Sith, and stressed the importance of locating the brothers before their next attack. Snugg told the Jedi that the two had stolen his freighter, and that the droid survivor of the raid had heard the Sertar sector mentioned. Having acquired a lead, Kenobi and Gallia left for the sector as Snugg examined the office."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Capable in logistics and bureaucracy, Morlimur Snugg was a no-nonsense member of the Snivvian species who stood at 1.88 meters (6 feet, 2 inches) and kept order aboard the Cybloc Transfer Station.
