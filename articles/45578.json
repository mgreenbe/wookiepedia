It was captured by the Tribe and placed under the command of Lady Olaris Rhea. Rhea's Sith apprentice, Vestara Khai, also served aboard the starship. In 43.5 ABY, the ship was chosen to carry a strike team to find the Sith Meditation Sphere Ship and kill exiled Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker. After locating Ship on a planet in the Maw, the Sith discovered the dark side entity Abeloth. As numerous Sith fell to the planet's deadly plants, more and more Sith were ferried down from the Eternal Crusader in shuttles, until finally there were no Sith left aboard the warship. When the strike team finally recovered Ship, they took the Meditation Sphere to Sinkhole Station\u2014a space station that Skywalker was visiting\u2014to complete their mission. They failed, however, and Khai was the strike team's sole survivor; thus the Eternal Crusader was left in orbit over Abeloth's world. Later, in 44 ABY, the Sith allied themselves with Skywalker for a mission to destroy Abeloth. Upon their arrival at her world, they saw the Eternal Crusader still in orbit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
