A clone trooper pilot captain during 19 BBY, he led his own squadron of starfighters. Soon after the Battle of Coruscant during the Clone Wars, Archer's squadron was called upon by the assistant director of the Republic's Senate Bureau of Intelligence to pursue the YT-1300 light freighter Stellar Envoy as it tried to escape the planet of Coruscant after being reported for using a security code its pilots should not have known."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Archer and his men took up the chase in at least seven ARC-170s and V-wing starfighters. Director of the Senate Bureau of Intelligence Armand Isard gave Archer authorization to disable or destroy the ship; however, though Archer's squadron fired upon the vessel, the Stellar Envoy merged with a swarm of civilian craft trying to leave the planet in the battle's wake. Archer and his pilots were forced to hold their fire and follow the Envoy from a distance. When the Envoy reached the upper atmosphere, it was designated as a target by two Republic Navy fleets, the Open Circle and Home, which the ship flew into for cover from the squadron's resurgent fire. Shots from Archer's squadron struck the craft before the Envoy was caught by a tractor beam from a capital ship, the Integrity. Nonetheless, the Stellar Envoy jumped to hyperspace before the squadron could disable it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett, Archer was genetically identical to his template.
