Jukassa attempted to flee via one of the Temple hangars, but he ran into a group of clone troopers on the landing platform. The Padawan fought heroically against them with his lightsaber, executing a flip and killing several clones, as well as striking down Commander Appo, before being shot and killed by Clone Sergeant Fox.

In a deleted sequence from Episode II, Jukassa walks by Obi-Wan Kenobi on a flight of stairs and nods at him. Around twenty takes of the scene were shot. The character's name was changed several times during production of Episode III; his alternate names included Titi Jukassa, Tado Jukassa, and simply Tado. Ultimately, it was decided that he would be known as Zett Jukassa. His scene for Revenge of the Sith\u2014which was numbered 113\u2014was filmed on Monday, July 28, 2003 on Stage 5 at Shepperton Studios. The set was raised and filmed on a bluescreen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the role, Lucas trained with stunt coordinators Nick Gillard and Kyle Rowling on how to use his lightsaber to fight against the digitally created clone troopers. Before they taught him more complicated moves, they began with basic techniques such as sword twirling. For Jukassa's flip, Gillard originally intended to have Lucas perform it in wires. While the scene was indeed recorded in that manner, Lucas was later asked to jump and pretend to land, with the rest being done digitally. George Lucas's direction for Jukassa was to act angry for the scene. Gillard, as well as Lucas's sister, Katie Lucas, thought that Jett did quite well in his portrayal of Jukassa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Star Wars Legends continuity, Lucas chose for his character in Episode II to be known as Padawan Warpoc Skamini, though after the release of Episode III, the two characters were merged into one via a backstory revealed in \"Order 66: Destroy All Jedi,\" a magazine article written by Daniel Wallace and published in Star Wars Insider 87 on April 17, 2006.
