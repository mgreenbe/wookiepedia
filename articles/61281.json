Used by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars, the short-range ship was launched from low orbit and reached its target destination through the use of powerful positional rockets. Once it entered the atmosphere, the craft burned through its high-energy shielding system as it deflected reentry heat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To help it reach its landing site, the ship was equipped with a sophisticated targeting array that quickly mapped a planet's topographical features."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the vessel entered the lower atmosphere, repulsorlift units were activated, providing the ship with impressive flight capabilities but insufficient thrust to re-achieve orbit.

However, it switched sides to the Republic, becoming known as the GGA support ship, or the \"Good Guy A\" support ship. It then switched back to the Separatists before switching allegiances one last time, being scaled down, repainted, and modified to become a speeder-sized clone vehicle in the scenes on Utapau."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
