It used a low powered targeting laser to fire continuously at a target. Using the range and vector data it collected, it could lock onto a target and provide a 97% probability of a hit. However, the laser would give away the location and approach vector of the starfighter so the targeting system was not used often. It could track up to 1,000 moving sublight objects, and acquire 20 possible targets. When programmed for extra sensitivity, the computer could track up to 120 specific sensor signatures."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
