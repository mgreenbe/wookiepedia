The model utilized a rudimentary thorax and had a long, cylindrical head. However, the model failed for two reasons; the droids were both obvious in appearance and prone to lose control and kill their makers. One female individual who was involved in the droids' design was killed by one of these droids due to the model's flaws. The droid that killed her later had its verbobrain destroyed by security droids, and Raith Sienar, a prominent engineer in the waning years of the Galactic Republic who had attended the Rigovian Technical University with the female, had the droid placed in his personal museum as a reminder to not overstep one's competence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This droid model first appeared in Greg Bear's Rogue Planet, a novel released in May 2000."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
