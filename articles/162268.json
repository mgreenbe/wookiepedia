Vult served as a customs officer for the government of Dorin and held the rank of sergeant during that time. In 43 ABY, the exiled Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker and his son, Jedi Knight Ben Skywalker, visited Dorin and landed in the capital city, Dor'shan, in their ship, the Jade Shadow. While Vult inspected the ship, Lieutenant Dorss asked the Skywalkers for the purpose of their visit. Luke Skywalker told the Lieutenant that he intended to speak with the Baran Do, in hopes of finding out more about Jacen Solo's fall to the dark side of the Force and transformation into Darth Caedus. After Vult had completed the inspection of the Shadow, he reported to Dorss that all items on the ship corresponded with the categorical limits.

To do so, he used a baton-like instrument, connected via cable to a backpack that he wore, that possessed several sensor intakes along its length. The Kel Dor was rather thin, had no hair, and had eyes that were intelligent and Human-like in appearance. He wore a black robe with sky-blue and black patterns on it as well as a breath mask to protect him from carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and oxygen, which were fatal to a Kel Dor.
