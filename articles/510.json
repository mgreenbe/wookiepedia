Initially the 181st Imperial Fighter Wing of the Galactic Empire, it suffered from an abysmal reputation. Commanded by Colonel Evir Derricote, the 181st had lax discipline and low morale.

Discipline was sloppy and morale was low, with the men simply whiling away time until they expected to be sent to their deaths by the political enemies who had gotten them transferred into the wing. Shirtsleeves were the normal dress, drunkenness was common, personnel left their barracks in a state of disarray, and military regulations were ignored. Pilots did not even salute or rise for Derricote.

As a result, he received a punitive transfer to the 181st, where Derricote had received a promotion to colonel.

Red Leader Wedge Antilles later reflected on the trepidation he felt when he saw the red stripes on the wings of the squadron's TIE Interceptors. The 181st inflicted heavy casualties on the Rebel Green and Blue Squadrons, but the fighter group was outnumbered and was receiving contradictory orders. The Alliance was able to concentrate its starfighters on the Tarlandia, allowing Gemmer Sojan to destroy the ship with his A-wing. The loss of the Pride of Tarlandia seriously disrupted the Empire's communications and contributed to the lack of coordination that allowed the Rebels to destroy the Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Battle of Endor was a massive loss, with both Palpatine and Vader killed and the second Death Star destroyed. The fleet and the 181st retreated in confusion to Annaj. Several commanders began splitting away, taking their resources and going rogue as warlords.

It had been scouted by Rogue Squadron, and Ysanne Isard, the Director of Imperial Intelligence and a major figure in the government under Sate Pestage, dispatched the fighters to guard it from a possible invasion attempt. In short order, it was attacked by the New Republic. The 181st pilots there flew against the elite Rogue Squadron, and while they provided solid opposition, they were eliminated by the Rogues and the moonbase was taken."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In response to the loss, Isard dispatched Fel and the rest of the 181st to defend Brentaal IV. The planet was under the command of the incompetent Admiral Lon Isoto, and Fel came to strongly suspect that Isard was deliberately setting up the world to fall, sacrificing the 181st to make Pestage look like a fool and usurp power from him. Fel's suppositions were correct. Isoto was convinced the attack would come on Vuultin, his capital, but Fel thought it more likely the New Republic would attack Oradin, which had the spaceport facilities to land troops. At Isoto's insistence, Fel kept the 3/181st in Vuultin, but concentrated his forces at Oradin. Dissatisfied with Isoto's orders, Phennir suggested to Fel that he take command of the world and strike out on his own as a warlord, but Fel, ever a man of duty, refused."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the New Republic struck, the 181st answered. The Rogues attacked Vuultin, thinking the 181st was headquartered there, and Aggressor Wing, a Y-wing unit, was sent to support the occupation of Oradin. The Vuultin fighters shot down a handful of Rogues, including Wes Janson, while Fel and his Alpha Squadron savaged the Y-wings in the Oradin theater. Phennir led attacks on the landing craft. While the main attack was clearly aimed at Oradin, Isoto recalled all Fel's forces to Vuultin, where his headquarters were under attack. Phennir again urged that Isoto be left to his own devices, but Fel complied with his orders. The 181st withdrew, and Phennir provided a rearguard, charged with destroying as many Oradin assets as possible as they withdrew. The Rogues, however, departed Vuultin before Fel's fighters ever got there, while Oradin fell."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isoto, mistaking the losses inflicted on the New Republic for victory, held a celebration in which the members of the squadron were awarded a medal concocted by Isoto for the occasion, the Oradin Diamond. Fel refused any reward, understanding that Isard was sacrificing Brentaal IV and the men of his fighter group. That night, a convoy arrived from Coruscant, looking to evacuate the wealthy Imperials of Brentaal IV. The 181st scrambled to defend the evacuation. The battle moved from Vuultin to space as the evacuation got underway, and Tycho Celchu of Rogue Squadron nearly killed Phennir, who shepherded the evacuation when Fel battled Antilles and was captured via a surprise ion cannon attack by Colonel Horton Salm of Aggressor Wing. Brentaal IV fell, but many of its wealthy were evacuated safely."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The unit under Phennir"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 181st continued to be the Empire's most elite unit, with Phennir becoming its commander as Fel defected to the New Republic. Fel was vilified as a traitor for his defection, and the loss at Brentaal IV was blamed on him; the 181st, however, retained a strong reputation. During Phennir's leadership, in 7 ABY, Warlord Zsinj had actor Tetran Cowall impersonate Fel, commanding an impostor 181st consisting of an even mix of pilots and droid-piloted TIEs packed with explosives that flew as their wingmen. It was designed as a trap for Wedge Antilles of Rogue Squadron, who was known to have searched for Fel after he had disappeared in 5 ABY. While the ploy fooled New Republic analysts for a time, the Empire maintained the true 181st, and Antilles eventually exposed the plot, to no gain for Zsinj."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 181st remained in Imperial service, and may have been present at the Battle of Bilbringi; at least one interceptor in 181st colors was present at the battle, but as it was common for veterans of the unit to retain the trademark red stripes even after transferring out of it, it is not clear that the unit was participating in Thrawn's attack. After the Empire crumbled in 10 ABY, some 181st pilots or former pilots went rogue, serving with warlords like Leonia Tavira. The 181st Imperial Fighter Group as a unit, however, became part of the Imperial Remnant, formed in 12 ABY by Admirals Natasi Daala and Gilad Pellaeon. Phennir retained command and was promoted to the rank of general, with the three squadrons of the 181st maintaining their elite reputation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the reunification of the Outer Rim Moffs and warlords into the Imperial Remnant, the 181st participated in the Orinda campaign, Gilad Pellaeon's first offensive against the New Republic. Deployed from Borosk aboard the Star Dreadnought Reaper, Phennir's squadrons assisted in the capture of Orinda and six other systems along the Entralla Route. When the New Republic counterattacked with the Dreadnought Lusankya, Phennir and the 181st skirmished across the Mid Rim with their old adversaries, Rogue Squadron. The 181st won at Hewett and Tartaglia, and fought alongside the Pellaeon's Reaper at Darkon, and again at Traval-Pacor. The 181st fought Rogue Squadron to a draw at Orocco, and successfully halted Wedge Antilles' drive up the Entralla Route at Tyan. When New Republic reinforcements led by the Endurance moved in, the 181st fought a holding action at Obredaan before retreating to Orinda itself, where they participated in the decisive battle of the campaign which saw the destruction of the Endurance and the retreat of the Lusankya."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Diplomacy on Adumar"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 13 ABY, Adumar, a world colonized by exiled insurrectionists ages ago, rediscovered the wider galaxy. The Adumari, who idolized combat pilots, decided to accept envoys from both the New Republic and Imperial Remnant before choosing with which state to ally. The Remnant sent Phennir and three other 181st pilots aboard Admiral Teren Rogriss's Agonizer as their diplomatic point men, receiving a heroic reception in the nation of Cartann. They did not learn that the New Republic was also in talks with the Adumari until Phennir bumped into Antilles at a diplomatic reception at the palace of Cartann's perator, Pekaelic ke Teldan, the night of their arrival."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pilots spent much of their time familiarizing themselves with the local fighter, the Blade-32. On their first day, they were introduced to the Adumari practice of challenging opponents to aerial duels. They accepted a challenge from four Adumari pilots, and shot each down in a dogfight. They continued in this pattern for some days, achieving great honor among the Adumari with their aerial victories, and spending their evenings at dinners with Adumari nobles. They exceeded the popularity of the New Republic pilots, who insisted on using simulated weapons in their duels, which was held by the Cartannese to be less honorable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the perator of Cartann came to the decision to institute a world government unilaterally, promising to conquer any nations that resisted. The next day, the perator requested of both sides that they aid him in the war that would have to be waged against the recalcitrant countries; Antilles refused, and his party was exiled from the court. Phennir agreed to lead the Cartann air forces. When Antilles accepted command of the forces of the nations arrayed against Cartann and led them in a surprise morning attack on Cartann, the pilots of the 181st flew for Cartann in their TIE interceptors, using their superior speed to cut repeatedly through the enemy forces, which had nothing to match their starfighters. Mass-fire tactics from Antilles and his Red Flight killed one of the pilots, but the TIEs shot down Celchu, one of the Red Flight combatants. After that exchange, Phennir avoided any units flying in formation. When Red Flight recaptured its X-wings, they killed another 181st pilot in their first pass, though the TIEs damaged Derek Klivian's fighter. The third of the pilots died in a dogfight with Antilles, and Phennir departed the field, retreating to the Agonizer. Shortly thereafter, Cartann surrendered to Antilles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rogriss, unwilling to execute orders that would have him bomb the world and break his word to the Adumari that he would depart peacefully, sent the Agonizer and Phennir away before defecting to the Adumari. The 181st returned to Adumar with the Imperial assault force that was organized once Agonizer made contact with the Remnant. Elements of the wing escorted bombers sent to strike at the planet while Phennir flew an advanced TIE Defender in the space battle.

These three squadrons were often referred to simply as the first squadron, second squadron, and third squadron, or 1/181st, 2/181st, and 3/181st; however, they also used alternate designations. The first squadron could be referred to as Alpha Squadron, with Beta Squadron and Gamma Squadron designations presumably in use for the other two squadrons.

It was not until after the Battle of Hoth that the unit upgraded to the faster, more maneuverable, and better-armed TIE/IN interceptor, a more elite fighter for what was already known as an elite unit. It was with the interceptor that the 181st pioneered their signature marking, the red horizontal stripes along the interceptor's horizontally aligned wings, and it was with the interceptor that the 181st stayed for another decade, becoming among the most expert pilots of the interceptor alive. By 13 ABY, though some TIE/D Defenders were available, the 181st was not equipped with them, not even the elite diplomatic party sent to Adumar. On Phennir's punitive return to the world, however, he flew a Defender, as did some non-181st pilots, but the fighter remained in highly limited deployment.
