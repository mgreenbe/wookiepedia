This person was seen in Depatar, the City of Masks, in 31 BBY. Like all the visitors and many inhabitants, this person was in disguise, particularly with a tray on his head. This allowed him to watch the girls' legs without their consents. Sometimes, an unaware dancer laid a cup on Crolar's tray, and then Crolar moved away and drank it for free."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
