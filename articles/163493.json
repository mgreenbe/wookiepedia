It had two long, pointed arms and could shoot a stream of oil as well as weld. C-3PO and R2-D2 encountered a Welding Beetle while waiting in a queue to be registered upon arrival on Annoo. Artoo angrily objected to the droid cutting into line in front of them, prompting the droid to give Threepio a face full of oil. The droid could also be found in Sise Fromm's stronghold."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
