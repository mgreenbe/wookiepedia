Both Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones include scenes shot at Oung Jmel. A short sequence for the podrace was filmed just next to the rock. The landing place for Darth Maul and his short fight with Qui-Gon Jinn was also filmed just near the rock. There were two sets built about one or two kilometers west of the rock. One small one was edited with Ksar Hadada as the slave quarters back yard, where Anakin Skywalker parked his podracer. There is another one 500 meters further west where many of Mos Espa's exterior scenes were filmed. As per a request from the Tunisian tourist office, the sets were left standing. A road from the nearby town of Nefta was built for the filming of English Patient and leads to the location. If you are trying to get there, go to north Nefta and look for a sign saying \"Site Touristiqu\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
