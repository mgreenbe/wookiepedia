It wasn't until the Clone Wars that war began to broil in its space. It was located within Separatist-controlled space during the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Annexed by the Galactic Empire, the Imperials constructed the Pyramid One complex with the support of the upper classes. Abolishing the democracy that had stabilized the world for centuries, Darth Vader incited a civil war by organizing the planet's elite to take control of the government in order to consolidate power. Hearing rumors of the construction of Pyramid One, the Rebel Alliance dispatched commandos to thwart the Empire's activities on Ahakista, but lacked any real strength. After many failed plots, the rebels garnered the support of crime lord Raze, who agreed to provide agents capable of destroying The Hub."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the fall of the Empire at the Battle of Endor, the Imperial Remnant organized a large area of space containing Ahakista into Oversector Outer. Later consolidated into the Pentastar Alignment by Ardus Kaine, the area would become the heart of Gilad Pellaeon's Imperial Remnant after signing a treaty with the New Republic. All went well on Ahakista for a time, until the horrors of the Yuuzhan Vong War were unleashed upon the world. Devastated by the war, the Remnant attempted to mend its member states who were in need."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As of 137 ABY, the Myto sector remained aligned to the Fel Empire-in-Exile."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Geography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A remote planet in the Outer Rim, Ahakista was a temperate world, with an arid landscape. No being paid it much attention, which was why the Empire established a secret outpost on the planet during the years leading up to the Battle of Yavin. It was believed that the facility known as The Hub would be safer from terrorism on a world like Ahakista, since it was far enough from Coruscant to avoid notice, yet close enough to allow for regular transmissions of data."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
