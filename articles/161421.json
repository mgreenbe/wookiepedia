In the meantime, Vitale played a game of Who? What? Where? with the rest of her new squadron until a Shadow Wing pilot found the remnant.

After Shadow Wing's forces began diverting to the mining facility, Vitale's squadron, backed by the 61st ground troops, attacked Core Nine. Vitale's squadron engaged the fighter wing's TIE/ln space superiority starfighters, and Shadow Wing eventually fled on a bulk freighter after New Republic reinforcements led by General Hera Syndulla arrived.

One day, she was at the 61st's camp aboard the Lodestar with a dozen others when the New Republic pilots Nath Tensent, Wyl Lark and Kairos of the New Republic's Alphabet Squadron passed by.

Vitale heard Chadic swear over the comm and asked if there was any problems, only for Tensent to reply that the B-wing pilot was in a bad mood.

Chadic told the sergeant to be grateful that Alphabet Squadron was scouting so that the 61st troops would not get killed.

Vitale, raising her wine glass and spitting to the ground, argued that if Palpatine was tried first, all those who had a trial after would argue that they were not as bad as the Emperor."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "On the run"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Regrouping and consolidating"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the campaign in the Cerberon system progressed, the Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing, better known as Shadow Wing, was coaxed to the system as a part of a trap set up by the battle group.

Shadow Wing's TIE/ln space superiority starfighters then routed the 61st's troops from their positions. Vitale and two dozen other New Republic personnel rendezvoused at a three story speeder garage in the Highgarden District.

While the caravan traveled through the tunnel, the members of the squadron took turns on sensor duty. During the journey, the pilots talked and one of them, Gorgeous Su, proposed a game of Who? What? Where?, where the contenders detailed who first heard of their death and how and where they died."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vitale argued with the other pilots on who went first in the game, Tensent being nominated to go first. The sergeant was displeased with the what the BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber pilot wanted to kill him.

Meanwhile, Vitale spent time with the rest of her squadron, reviewing Lark's combat courses and socializing with other 61st soldiers.
