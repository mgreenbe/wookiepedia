The Security Forces used the outpost near the Great Grass Plains to use as a base during the invasion. After the Queen returned to the planet, she joined with the Gungan Grand Army to retake the planet. In response, the Trade Federation Droid Army sent three strike forces to engage the Gungans. Army B flanked the Great Grass Plains and found the outpost. A Naboo scout warned the outpost, which activated its defenses. The Federation Heavy Artillery Guns commenced attacking the turrets. The pirate Nym and his wingmate Vana Sage joined the battle and engaged the attacking Federation forces, ultimately driving off the Federation army. The loss of this Federation element allowed the Gungans to hold out while the Security Forces destroyed the Droid Control Ship in orbit, ending the invasion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This outpost appeared in the penultimate mission, named \"Last Stand on Naboo,\" of the 2001 video game Star Wars: Starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
