The datapad's information could only be changed by attached it to a customized format input plug available only at BoSS and Imperial Space Ministry offices. This was the only way that new information or permits could be downloaded to the pads. A separate port allowed data to be downloaded from a ship's computer; the data could not be edited and was presentable only in read only format."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While seemingly secure, BoSS Documentation Datapads could be circumvented. Some forgers could turn the read only port to a write only one, although at risk of frying the internal electronics of the datapad. Other forgers managed to get their hands on a BoSS input plug or manufactured their own. Low price forgers would crack the casing of the datapad to change the information inside. Canny customs officials would check for damage to the datapad during inspections."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
