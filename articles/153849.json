Sometime in 19 BBY, Separatist forces attacked Aq Vetina, a settlement of humans, killing many of the residents. However, members of the Death Watch, including the Mandalorian warrior, arrived to fend off the Separatist B2-series super battle droids. The soldier gunned down a battle droid which was attempting to kill the young boy Din Djarin, who was hidden in a bunker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Djarin's parents had been killed after hiding the boy, and the warrior beckoned Djarin and helped the boy out of the bunker while other members of the Death Watch landed and gunned down super battle droids. The pair watched the fighting before one of the other Mandalorians gestured the soldier to lift off with Djarin. The Mandalorian warrior complied, and picked up the boy with his consent, flying up from the settlement with the orphan by jetpack. Djarin became a Mandalorian foundling, and swore to the Mandalorian Creed when he was of age. He later reminisced his rescue by the Mandalorian warrior while pinned down in a common house on the planet Nevarro by forces of a Galactic Empire remnant around 9 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The warrior wore blue Mandalorian armor with the Death Watch symbol on his left shoulder pad.

The episode was directed by Taika Waititi and released on December 27, 2019. Credited as \"Mandalorian Warrior,\" the character was played by Brendan Wayne, who also acted as a body double for Din Djarin, the show's protagonist. Concept art for the soldier was conceived by artist Christian Alzmann among at least ten versions on the scene itself. In version 7, the artist based the warrior off of the white Mandalorian concept art drawn by Ralph McQuarrie which became groundwork for Boba Fett. Two other versions the Mandalorian warrior and his Death Watch comrades was made to look biblical and dreamy to represent the flashback nature of the scene."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
