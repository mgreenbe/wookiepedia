It focused dark side energy which could be put to use by even marginally Force-sensitive individuals. The temple was occupied by the Galactic Empire and its power was tapped by the technician Cartariun to take control of the planet and exert mental control over the native Irrukiine. Cartariun was defeated by Rogue Squadron in 4 ABY and the temple was destroyed when Rogue pilot Herian I'ngre rammed the structure with her X-wing, guided by fellow Rogue Dllr Nep inside the temple."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
