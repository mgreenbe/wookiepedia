During the Mission to Darkknell in 1032 BBY, the Jedi Knight Kerra Holt's pursuit of the Bothan spy and Odionate mercenary Narsk Ka'hane took her through the area. After overpowering and stealing the Bothan's stealth suit, Kerra's location meant that she had to walk past the destroyed Black Fang facility on her way home to the Sullustan Gub Tengo's home, where she worked as a part-time tutor for his daughter Tan Tengo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
