Located on the Galactic capital of Coruscant, Ziro operated a nightclub within the palace, after moving from Sleheyron. This would serve as the headquarters of Ziro's criminal enterprise in the time leading up the outbreak of the Clone Wars. After Ziro's role in the kidnapping of his nephew Jabba the Hutt's son Rotta was exposed, the Palace most likely became abandoned after Ziro was taken into Republic custody."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After moving to Coruscant from the world of Sleheyron where he worked for some time as a Desilijic loan shark to purse larger fortunes, Ziro setup new headquarters in a seedier neighborhood of the capital. He purchased a rundown tower that once belonged to the Lantillian Spacers' Brotherhood and remade it as a gaudy pleasure palace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the years, Ziro's Palace became a popular gathering place for dregs of the Coruscant underworld. If a galactic lowlife with either a fearsome reputation or a lot of Credits made their way to the Galactic Capital, they eventually found their way into Ziro's court. Among those likely to be found where Trandoshan slavers, Nikto thugs, sleazy humans, even renegade droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala traveled to the palace when she was attempting to forge an agreement between the Galactic Republic and the Hutt clan.
