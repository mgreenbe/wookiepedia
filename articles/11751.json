Because of the enhancement, the commandos, part of the Special Operations Brigade of the Grand Army of the Republic, were able to quickly process the medical substance bacta, allowing them to heal critical injuries in seconds. Incapacitated commandos could be quickly revived in seconds by their squadmates, courtesy of a hand-held jumpstarter unit. Clone troopers were not equipped with such implants, to the disappointment of clone commando RC-1138\u2014known as Boss\u2014when he was separated from his squad during their Mission to the Chaykin Cluster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bacta processing implants were first mentioned in the video game Star Wars: Republic Commando, released for Xbox and PC in 2005.
