It was originally intended as a pilgrim boat; however, when no buyer could be found, she was renamed Stardust and used as a tourist cruiser. During a tour of the anticipated nova of the star Ariarch-17, a shockwave caused the dramatic failure of the ship's artificial gravity systems. Many lawsuits ensued, and litigation lasted two generations. Stardust was seized by the lawyers defending the cruise company and sold off to Kut-Rate Kruises after she was renamed Reasonable Doubt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reasonable Doubt was the ship that carried Jedi Masters Yoda, Maks Leem, and Jai Maruk, as well as Padawans Whie Malreaux and Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy, on a secret mission to the planet Vjun to meet with Count Dooku."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
