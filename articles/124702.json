This made her the great-grandmother of Jaina, Jacen, and Anakin Solo, the latter who was named for her son, as well as Ben Skywalker. This also made her the great-great-grandmother of Allana Solo.

Upon reaching adulthood, she was dropped from house servant status and forced into cleaning work. While some of these masters were cruel, others were kind\u2014notably Pi-Lippa, who taught Shmi valuable technical skills.Though Pi-Lippa had planned to free Shmi, she'd died before she could, and Shmi instead became the property of one of Pi-Lippa's relatives, who did not want to free her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this time Shmi discovered that she was pregnant and gave birth to a son she named Anakin. Shmi would say that her son was conceived without a father, but she could not explain how it happened. Nevertheless, she gladly accepted his birth and raised him. Three years later, Shmi and her son came into the ownership of the Hutt crime lord Gardulla the Elder on Tatooine. Gardulla was a cruel master and had little regard for the safety of Shmi and her son, as evident when she allowed young Skywalker to participate in the Boonta Eve Classic, believing Anakin to be incapable of winning."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few months after her arrival to Mos Espa Gardulla lost ownership of the two in a bet, Shmi and Anakin became the property of the junk dealer Watto. However, like Gardulla, Watto was often found to be quite harsh, seldom showing his softer side to the two. Under Watto's care, they were afforded simple luxuries and were allowed to have very few personal possessions. When not performing tasks given to her by Watto, Shmi spent most of her time worrying about her adventurous son. Whether it was to recover parts for Watto or going out of his way to help someone in need, Anakin often managed to get himself into trouble. Shmi did little to discourage his tendency, though she began to fear that she was going to lose him someday. The two were very close, and despite not having enough money, Anakin showered Shmi with simple gifts to show his affection. At other times, he built inventions to sell or use to lighten her workload. One such invention was a protocol droid Anakin had found and managed to scrape together using old parts he gathered from Watto's junkyard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shmi became aware of Anakin's gifts and hid as much as she could from Watto, though she could not hide Anakin's natural piloting abilities. After discovering this almost by accident, Watto let the boy continue his piloting, believing he could gain potential profit from the venture. Anakin proved to be an excellent pilot despite the fact that he had never been able to finish a race. To her relief, Anakin managed to come out unharmed, save for a few bruises, though she hated watching him drive in what she referred to as \"those awful races\". Though she never said so, Anakin thought that his mother believed that simply by being there she could keep him from coming to harm.

Shmi offered the group her hospitality and place to stay during a raging sandstorm that enveloped Mos Espa. Like Anakin, Shmi initially believed that these strangers arrived on Tatooine to free slaves. This proved not to be the case when they recounted to Anakin their plight of how they ended up being stranded on Tatooine on a diplomatic mission to Coruscant. Anakin offered to help his newfound friends repair their ship, forming a plan that included Qui-Gon sponsoring him in the upcoming Boonta Eve Classic. Shmi, however, disagreed.

Unbeknownst to her, before the start of the race, Qui-Gon made a bet with Watto for the freedom of Shmi and Anakin. Watto, however, wouldn't have it, claiming that no podracer was worth two slaves. Because of his interest in the boy, Qui-Gon opted to free Anakin, using his powers to tamper with the chance cube Watto had brought out to decide which of the two would be freed. To her surprise and theirs, Anakin won the race, and likewise, his freedom. Shmi joined Anakin in the crowd of admirers, and the two shared a brief mother-and-son moment with Shmi telling Anakin how proud she was of him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After securing Anakin's earnings from the race, Qui-Gon informed Shmi of Anakin's freedom and of his intention to train the boy as a Jedi. He was, however, unable to secure her freedom. It was then that Shmi had to make the most difficult decision in her life: letting go of her son. Comforted by Qui-Gon, she watched as Anakin prepared himself to leave, the latter stopping a few times to express his doubts about leaving home. She advised him to let go, claiming that her place and future was on Tatooine. This prompted Anakin to leave with the Jedi Master, but not before promising that he would return and free her."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Freedom"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While her son trained with the Jedi, Shmi remained in the service of Watto.

As ordered by her master, Shmi gathered the droids and brought them to Villie's ship, Inferno, choosing not to inform the Devaronian of Watto's deceit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Watto's business began to decline due to his excessive betting on podraces, further discrediting his reputation as a successful junk dealer. His losses were so bad that he was forced to sell Shmi to Cliegg Lars, a moisture farmer who had fallen in love with her. Watto made several excuses and created a number of delays in the transaction, torn between the loss of his only slave and his hope that she would be happy with Lars. With her help, Cliegg and his son Owen tricked Watto into selling Shmi in exchange for a Tobal lens. Watto later admitted to deactivating her slave transmitter shortly after Anakin's departure for a fear that Shmi would wander aimlessly off in her sorrow and blow herself up. When Cliegg asked for her hand in marriage, Shmi agreed.

Cliegg assembled a search team in an attempt to locate her, but ended up losing 26 out of the 30 that were sent out and his right leg. After a month, he decided to give up the search, believing Shmi to be dead. In actuality, Shmi was still, just barely, alive\u2014severely beaten and dehydrated, holding on to her memories of Anakin in an effort to stay alive. Shmi's resilience fascinated the Tusken Raiders, prompting them to try other methods of torturing; however, it only strengthened her resolve to live long enough to see her son.

Unable to bear them any longer, Anakin traveled to Tatooine to find her, bringing Padm\u00e9 Amidala and R2-D2 with him. Upon their arrival in Mos Espa, they were told by Watto that he had sold Shmi to Cliegg Lars, who had freed and married her. At the Lars homestead, he encountered his old droid, C-3PO, and the Lars family. A heartbroken Cliegg recounted to Anakin Shmi's capture and the settlers' attempt to rescue her. He tried to convince Skywalker that it was impossible for Shmi to have survived, but Anakin wouldn't have it. In his disbelief, Anakin set out to find her, leaving Padm\u00e9 in the care of the Lars. Using his senses, Anakin managed to locate her inside a Tusken Raider encampment, bound to a rack at the side of a tent, and bearing scars from weeks of beatings.

The vision was induced by the Son, one of the powerful Force-wielders controlling the planet, through which the current of the Force flowed. Anakin's vision of Shmi told him that he was not at fault for letting her die but that he had drawn the burden of guilt around himself. When Anakin revealed to Shmi that he was married to Amidala, whom Shmi had met in 32 BBY, Shmi told him that Anakin's wife did not represent his true destiny.
