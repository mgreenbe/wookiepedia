Although he managed to capture Wedge Antilles and had his servants attack the Rogues, the former escaped and his squadron mates defeated Cartariun's cohorts. Cartariun was killed by the Bothan operative Girov Dza'tey, who also desired the power of the temple."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
