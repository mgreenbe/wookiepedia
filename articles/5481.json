Its general appearance was similar to that of the All Terrain Scout Transport, but it was fitted with \"arms\" acting as missile launchers and a chin-mounted rotary laser cannon. While the AT-MP's salvos of missiles could take down almost any target, the walker itself was nowhere as agile as its AT-ST cousin. Because of that, it could be easily defeated by infantry and volley of fire tactics. It had a more heavily-armored, more powerful variant with a darker color scheme called the AT-MP Mark III."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The walker was used about five years before the Battle of Yavin on the planet Lothal. One was stolen by the young rebel Ezra Bridger at an Imperial installation while he was rescuing an Ithorian Lothalite named Dorthu Santim who was forced to work there by stormtroopers. Later, shortly after the Battle of Yavin, the Empire deployed several AT-MPs to the desert planet Tatooine for use during their campaign there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The All Terrain Missile Platform was first introduced in the now-Legends game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II. Although it appears in canon, its appearances differ in the media it appears in: in Star Wars: Commander, though the basic design is the same as the original, the walker has twelve rocket tubes (six on each side) and no chin-mounted cannon, whereas in Star Wars Rebels: Recon Missions, it has eight missile tubes and has the chin-mounted cannon as in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
