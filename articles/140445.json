They evolved to counter the planet's rotational cycle; One side of Altor-14 spent forty-seven hours baking in the twin stars of Roti and Ow, and forty-seven hours in shadow. As such, all water on the planet evaporated during the forty-seven hours spent in direct sunlight. Tarpaulin plants adapted to collect the nocturnal condensation. During the day, they resembled large balls of green cloth of varying sizes. During the night, the plants unfolded to create a tarpaulin effect to collect the condensing water vapr and funnel it into the plant. Tarpaulin plants were the primary source of water for most of Altor-14's lifeforms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
