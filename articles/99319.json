Rebel Alliance players who requested Tier 7 Duty Missions from certain space stations had a chance to battle elite Imperial pilots. One of these pilots could be Rashon. The \"Howlrunner\" card for the 2012 TIE Fighter Expansion Pack of Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game also depicts Rashon flying a TIE fighter. As there is no confirmation that Obsidian 1 is Rashon's TIE fighter for either of the aforementioned works, this article avoids linking the fighter to those sources."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
