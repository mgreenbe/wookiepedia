Enemy battle lines rushed each other, with the battle descending into separate combat between starships. In some cases, two or three vessels would target a single enemy, or ships would collide. In a brawl, anything was possible, and the battle was usually won by the luckier commanding officer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
