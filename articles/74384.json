The islands contained a small village, a harbor and a landing zone and was also the site of the Battle of Kashyyyk (Separatist Crisis). The Wookiee Trade Guild opposed the Trade Federation's taxation, leading to an attack on the islands by an army of recently revealed B2 super battle droids. Along with the assistance of Count Dooku and droid air support, the droid army quickly laid waste to the Army of the Wookiee Trade Guild. Because no survivors remained, word of the attack never got out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
