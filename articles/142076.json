The female pendant of those glands were called ovaries. Being hermaphroditic, the swamp slugs of Dagobah had both testes and ovaries located in the rear part of their bodies. In Human males, the crotch area, where the testes were located, was a highly sensitive zone, and blow landed in that area could prove quickly debilitating. To exploit that natural weakness, the Mandalorian martial artists developed a low blow technique called the \"Keldabe handshake.\" Similarly, a woman would sometimes slam her knee between a man's legs to rebuff his unwanted sexual advances."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
