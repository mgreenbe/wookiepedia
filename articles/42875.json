The planet was settled by Hugo Bartyn, a Human agent of Outer Rim Oreworks who built the ORO Mining Station LM0228 in the Krakana's Maw mountain range and the alien-populated city Bartyn's Landing in a nearby bay. Speciesist Bartyn and his cohorts also hunted the primitive Menahuun until what they believed to have been their extinction. Really, the Menahuun had secretly gathered and migrated towards the northwestern area, far away from the civilization \u2014 which they called \"The Slayer's Land\", as they considered Hugo Bartyn to be \"The Slayer\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "C. 194 BBY, the local flora in their new home began to die because it was too near a waste dump of the mine. The Menahuun incorrectly assumed this to be a new attack from The Slayer, and decided to go back to their ancestors' land. Following their custom, they would challenge The Slayer's \"tribe\" to a duel of champions, trying to avoid an open war. During their comeback, they found a secret entrance to the mine. The Menahuun began inhabiting the mine, calling it \"Hua'Bal\", for one century and a half, sharing it with the mining droids, while they were learning about the Human's customs, skills and power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "C. 29 BBY, Eeytch was a shaman and a community leader of Hua'Bal.

As the aliens were agents of ORO, they held ORO badges and as such Eeytch considered them worthy of the title of champion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eeytch guided the newcomers to the arena and then he joined the other Menahuun champions in the duel.
