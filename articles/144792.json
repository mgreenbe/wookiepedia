He then returned to the staging area to find the authorities were raiding the area and he decided to flee to his Swoop Garage without any money. While examining the damage to his bike, his friend Pargo knocked and informed Maarek of some characters at the Maze that might be Bordal spies that might know something about his father Kerek Stele. Both agreed to meet in three hours."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maarek returned to his hidden home, where his mother, Marina Stele, was waiting for him to inform him that his stunt was broadcast and that they know his real name. They were in the middle of suggesting that they move to another place to hide when Bordali agents breached the door. Marina killed an agent and took Maarek with her to try to escape, but they were soon captured by agents and were taken to a shuttle, which left Kuan. The two were introduced to Gwadj, who explained that they found Maarek by questioning the swoop gang and then captured and interrogated Pargo, whom they brought into the room and explained that they needed both to ensure Kerek's cooperation. Suddenly there was a disturbance, which prompted Gwadj and a female Bordali to leave the room with just one guard. The guard decided to put Pargo into some restraints when Pargo, despite his tortured state, fought back and overpowered the guard, putting him into restraints and freed both his friends. They were discussing the next step when the shuttle lurched as it was caught in a tractor beam controlled by the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Vengeance. Gwadj came into the room moments later to assess the situation, and everyone\u2014including Pargo, at Marina's insistence\u2014decided to stand down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial stormtroopers boarded the shuttle and brought everyone on board.

After the briefing, Maarek and Pargo chose to stay on the ship, while Marina decided to stay on Kuan to search for her husband."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three months later Maarek became a mechanic for the TIE Series and was proficient at repairing them when they returned from combat missions. One day he was piloting a newly repaired TIE Interceptor, near the Planet Farboon, to test it when he picked up a distress signal from a Lambda-class shuttle that was under attack from Rebel starfighters and its escorts were destroyed. Stele flew in and engaged the two Y-wings; soon two X-wings arrived and gave chase, but despite the situation growing desperate, reinforcements arrived and the situation was soon under Imperial control. Stele returned in his damaged fighter to the Vengeance, to realize that the shuttle he had saved carried Admiral Mordon. Mordon praised his performance and nominated him to perform pilot training."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maarek was brought to an Imperial base to be trained under Sergeant Jona T. Stark.

Temporarily based on a Corvette, there he met Cadrath, who was putting on his suit and showed Stele how to put on his suit and inspect the tubes to make sure his life support worked. Stele then left the ship and formed with Cadrath to commence picket duty. During this mission, six freighters arrived, and Stele inspected them to find food supplies on the first, until the fifth freighter contained weapons. Soon Rebel shuttles arrived and engaged the fighters but were routed with Stele destroying three of them. The battle cost two TIE Fighters with one of them colliding with one of the shuttles destroying the fighter but leaving only minimal damage. This led Stele to the conclusion that the way to survive as an Imperial pilot was to fly a better craft, and the only way to do that was to be the best pilot in his squadron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That night, Maarek had a vision of Emperor Palpatine saying, \"Maarek.
