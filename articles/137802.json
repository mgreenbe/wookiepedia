There were legends about how the sword was cursed and caused the Sith to turn on each other. At some point in history, the sword was bisected, with the hilt coming into ownership by the Ithorian collector Dok-Ondar, who held it in Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities on Batuu. Kendoh Voss and the Kendoh Gang attempted to steal the hilt of the sword, already possessing the other half of the relic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sword of Khashyun was created as a prop for the Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities store at the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge theme park land.
