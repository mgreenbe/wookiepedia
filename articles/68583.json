It takes place sometime before 18 ABY and is essentially the tale of how Mara Jade acquires her formidable starship, the Jade's Fire, which is seen in Star Wars: The Corellian Trilogy and Star Wars: The Hand of Thrawn Duology.

To back up his demand, he takes the crew of Mara's ship hostage, warning that they will be killed unless Mara rescues his daughter.
