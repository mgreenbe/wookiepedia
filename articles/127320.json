The row was lined with cheap hovels originally built by the mining companies who first colonized Tatooine. These hovels were home to slaves of such prominent Mos Espa figures as Gardulla the Elder and the junk-dealer Watto. The hovels used outdated bio-converter power generators that converted sludge from the underground pipelines into natchgas to fuel the hovels' limited power needs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin Skywalker lived out his childhood years with his mother in Slave Quarters Row, along with his friends Kitster Chanchani Banai, W.
