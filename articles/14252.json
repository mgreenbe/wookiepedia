However, the Confederacy of Independent Systems and Zygerrian Slave Empire decided to invade and occupy Kiros. Upon seeing the initial invasion, Governor Gupat Roshti contacted the Jedi Council's Grand Master Yoda for aid. Yoda promised to send help and warned him not to trust Count Dooku, who was present there with his forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Roshti and Yoda ended their communication, the Droid Army troops came from their landing crafts. Dooku, a tactical droid, and Zygerrian Commander Darts D'Nar then came out from the YV-865 Aurore-class freighter, Tecora. Together, they met Governor Roshti. Dooku assured him that this was a peaceful occupation, not an invasion. He then offered Roshti and his people sanctuary away from the War. Roshti, seeing no other choice, agreed to Dooku's offer. In truth, Dooku had made an alliance between the Confederacy and the Zygerrians' Slave Empire to provide them with slaves. Thus, D'Nar then had the Droid Army round up all of Kiros' people. D'Nar then all the Togrutas shipped to Zygerria where they would sold into slavery at Queen Miraj Scintel's slave auction. D'Nar was then left in command of Droid Army's occupation force and had his headquarters in the Governor's tower."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ten planetary rotations later, the Republic forces arrived led by Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, Clone Commander \"Cody,\" and Captain \"Rex.\" The republic forces then landed on surface. As the Republic landing ship made its landing, the Republic forces deployed AT-TEs, AT-RTs, and their troops. The Jedi and their troops then started their ground assault. Kenobi, Skywalker, Tano and Rex then took several of their troops on BARC speeders ahead towards the Governor's tower. Together they were able to take out several commando droids on Flitknot Speeder Bikes as well the AATs and the rest of the battle droids. Captain Rex was able to destroy the last one with his missile launcher."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, en route to the tower, Rex and Tano saw that there were no people anywhere. They found it suspicious since the Droid Army was not shy about using hostages such as they did during the Ryloth Campaign. As their forces surrounded the tower, Commander Cody then received a message from D'Nar, who wished to discuss terms of surrender with Kenobi. However, Skywalker did not like the fact the D'Nar was Zygerrian slave trader and wanted to deal with him himself. However, Kenobi insisted that he should do as D'Nar wished.

After Dooku introduced Kenobi to Molec and D'Nar, he demanded to bring Kenobi to him on his knees. D'Nar then demanded that Kenobi surrender to him. He told Kenobi that he had planted Thermal annihilator bombs through out the city. He would detonate them and kill anyone who nearby. D'Nar then had his tactical droid set one off near the Republic forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker then canceled the bio-scan and had R2-D2 scan for bombs. Kenobi then distracted D'Nar by pretending to surrender. D'Nar considered killing as revenge for the Jedi's termination of their slave empire, but knew Dooku would rather have him alive.

Thus, the two of them fought each other without their weapons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker and Tano then too a pair of AT-RTs took disarm the bombs with their lightsabers.

However, they saw that the droids were vulnerable on their sides. Together they were able to destroy the droids and disarm the last two bombs. As D'Nar was winning his fight against Kenobi, the tactical droid showed him a message from his battle droids, telling that all the bombs had been disarmed. D'Nar then took the detonator and tried to set the bombs off to no avail. Kenobi then destroyed the commando droids and retrieved his lightsaber. Kenobi then offered him the chance to surrender again. D'Nar refuse and decided to set off the last one that was on the back of the tactical droid. As the bomb was going off, D'Nar made his escape. Kenobi tossed the tactical droid out the tower and the droid was destroyed in the bomb's explosion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi then told Skywalker and Tano that D'Nar was escaping to his ship, the Tecora.
