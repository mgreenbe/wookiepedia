As such, the compartments could snap into cargo ships' frameworks to temporarily convert them into passenger ships. They were largely self-sufficient, and to this end possessed life support systems, onboard batteries and even individual hyperspace field emitters. During the Great Hyperspace Disaster and its aftermath, many of the surviving passengers of the destroyed freighter Legacy Run were rescued from such compartments."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
