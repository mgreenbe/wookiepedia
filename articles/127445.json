Zaluna Myder, a shift leader for the surveillance company Transcept Media Solutions on Gorse, was capable of slicing into various Imperial systems. When Myder joined Skelly, Kanan Jarrus, and Hera Syndulla on a mission to stop Count Denetrius Vidian's plan to destroy Cynda, she was able to slice into surveillance and communications systems and carried devices that helped her do so. However, when they had the opportunity to explore files downloaded from Vidian's cybernetically enhanced brain, Myder was unable to decrypt one of the files, claiming she was not a slicer. When confronted by Vidian, Myder's equipment fell out of her bag, leading the Count to believe she was indeed a slicer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sabine Wren possessed slicing skills.
