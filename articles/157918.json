It could recharge cutting blasters in four hours, the heaters in the Bulky Exploratory Armor in twenty minutes, and the portable heater in three hours, or five if the heater was in use. An interface on the device allowed all three items to be plugged in at once, and charging priority could be set through a keypad. The Universal Recharger itself could be recharged in twenty-four hours from a starship, or in eighteen hours from a commercial recharger."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
