When a Hardexian ambassador visited Craw, the Dictator-Forever told a joke about three Hardex and a bantha. The ambassador was not amused by the protocol droid's translation of the joke, so Craw had the droid deactivated and turned into a fountain. In his new function, the droid stood upright and spewed water out of his mouth. Birds would sometimes perch on his limbs. During the time the droid was being used as a fountain, Captain Steggus, one of Craw's underlings, had to remind Craw of the droid's fate when Craw asked Steggus to have a protocol droid standing by."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The protocol droid owned by Craw was a bipedal droid with masculine programming and orange-colored plating.
