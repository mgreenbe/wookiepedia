He served as Blue Two. Starck often served under Blue Leader Lieutenant Tallissan Lintra, who appreciated his skill as a pilot, but had to work to keep his impulsive, headstrong nature in check. Flying as Lintra's wingmate in the Battle of D'Qar, Starck bought time for the evacuation of the Resistance base and covered the Resistance's MG-100 StarFortress SF-17 bombers in their attack run on the Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought Fulminatrix. Preparing to launch from the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus following the discovery that the fleet had been tracked through hyperspace, Starck was killed when Kylo Ren's personal squadron destroyed the cruiser's main hangar. During the Resistance's war against the First Order, he wore an orange pilot's uniform including a FreiTek Incorporated life support unit and a Guidenhauser ejection harness with three flares strapped in above his left ankle. His flight helmet was red and white with a black and red checkered pattern on top."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stomeroni Starck was portrayed by Noah Segan in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, which was released on December 15, 2017.
