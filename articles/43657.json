It served as an extremely large marketplace of sorts home to all kinds of businesses as well as the Elrood Sector Stock Exchange. The Daya, the grand plaza of the Elrood Bazaar was where potential customers would linger before searching the buildings. The most notable architectural layout of the Elrood Bazaar was the Perma, a ring of buildings surrounding the Daya that had a permanent place in the Bazaar.
