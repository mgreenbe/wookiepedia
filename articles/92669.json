They were composed of multiple strands of razor-sharp monofilament wire. These nets shredded virtually anything that came into contact with them. The people of Anobis used monofilament nets during their civil war. However, not all monofilament nets were lethal. At least one net was used as a safety net in the remains of the Grand Hall in the Aldera Royal Palace. Individuals falling into the net had their fall broken to stop them from descending into a pit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
