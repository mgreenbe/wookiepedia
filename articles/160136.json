Drassk eliminated his rivals through a Wookiee bounty hunter named Gwarror, and the older Trandoshan hunter Qyzen Fess discovered this and issued a ghrajath against Drassk to halt his plans to become Clan Speaker. Drassk attacked Fess and the hunter's companion, the Barsen'thor, at their meeting on Taris, but was slain. Afterwards, Fess was convinced by the Barsen'thor and the younger Trandoshans of Drassk's clan to assume leadership of the clan and to teach them the ways of the Scorekeeper."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
