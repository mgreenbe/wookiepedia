Like most pit droids, DUM-4 was not too clever, and he would often fight with others. He seemed to particularly enjoy working with the young Anakin Skywalker, despite being officially assigned to Ody Mandrell's pit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the race, DUM-4 was called upon to locate a power plug for Skywalker's podracer. The droid ran to Gasgano's pit and asked for one, and the Xexto racer promised he would provide a plug in exchange for a thrust cone. DUM-4 was sent to Sebulba's pit to ask for the cone. Once again, the Dug refused to hand out the part without compensation. He tasked DUM-4 with the delivery of a private message to Jabba the Hutt, and insisted on getting the crime lord's written answer. While some pilots were flying practice laps, the pit droid reached Jabba's private box and he held out Sebulba's note. The pit droid then made all his deliveries, and got the part to Anakin just in time, five minutes before the beginning of the race."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the race began, DUM-4 remained at the pit stop to help repair any damaged Podracers. However, while attempting to correct an engine failure on Ody Mandrell's Podracer, the little droid was sucked into the engine. He destroyed the entire engine, costing Mandrell the race, although DUM-4 survived the accident, coming out of the engine, blackened and scorched, but laughing hysterically."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars Episode I: I Am a Droid and Anakin's Fate both indicate that DUM-4 was a series of pit droids, not an individual unit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jon Knowles stated in the Episode I DVD commentaries that DUM-4 and his two fellow pit droids were based in part on the Three Stooges.
