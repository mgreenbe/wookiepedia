He was double crossed during a spice run for a Hutt clan by another smuggler, Boffitt Einer, who informed the Imperials of Osck's actions and took the shipment himself, thinking that it belonged solely to Osck. Einer was unaware that he had just stolen from the Hutts, notorious as the most vicious crime syndicates in the galaxy, and Osck wrote a letter to him to inform him, though the message intentionally did not state which clan. The letter was recovered aboard Purge after its occupants were decimated by a plague so it is unlikely that it reached Einer before it was released to the public for academic purposes in relation to the history of Purge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
