Available during the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, the gun was officially classified as a grenade launcher and fired 40 millimeter entangling and spin-stabilizing shells. The munition consisted of weighted synthetic ArachSilk fine-mesh netting which was tightly packed into each shell. The munitions released the net a preset distance after being fired, and the spin of the munition caused the net to unravel to its maximum width as it was released. The netting tightened around sentient or non-sentient targets that struggled within it which, combined with the high tensile strength of the net, made it difficult for targets to escape. The gun itself was heavy and squat in nature, similar in size to a small blaster carbine. It was built with a wide-gauge rifle barrel. With lightweight polycarbonate furniture, the gun was single shot, break-action and breach-loading."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The AO14 was first mentioned in Enter the Unknown, a sourcebook released in 2013 for Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
