Shortly after they were finished constructing a new autoturret, the mercenaries were attacked by a group of outlaws working for the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. The homestead's autoturrets managed to kill the criminals, after which Jabba's majordomo Bib Fortuna contacted them and informed them that the Hutt was angry. The Sith Lord Darth Vader then contacted the pair by hologram and ordered that they aid the local Imperial garrison in destroying a nearby Tusken Raider camp. The Sith provided the mercenaries with three All Terrain Scout Transports for the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The attack"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mercenaries deployed the three AT-STs, causing a group of seven Tuskens to emerge from the camp and attack.
