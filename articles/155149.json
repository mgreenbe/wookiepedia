The pirate Nym led his band in a raid on a Trade Federation convoy, of which the vessel was part of. Nym disabled the vessel, which launched its cargo in a vain defense. The vessel crashed on Lok, and Nym sent one of his own freighters to retrieve the cargo. The Federation sent another Superfreighter to recover it, but it was also destroyed. The Revenants secured the downed Superfreighter's cargo and returned to base. The cargo contained a transmitter which later led a Trade Federation attack force to the base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Trade Federation Superfreighter appears in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Starfighter.
