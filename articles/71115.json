The vehicle had average acceleration and an acceptable top speed. However, Reeso's Podracer had poor handling, and the size of the engines made it difficult to fly straight through narrow gaps or passages. The vehicle could sustain a heavy amount of punishment, being able to take multiple hits from obstacles and other racers before being destroyed. The Podracer was primarily painted black, with gray, wing-shaped logos on the engine and cockpit. When racing, Reeso wore a black jumpsuit, a helmet, and darkened race goggles that obscured the upper half of the face."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinn Reeso is an unlockable playable character in the the video game Star Wars Episode I: Racer. Reeso is not available in normal play but is accessed by using the cheat codes RRJINNRE or RRTANGENTABACUS in the Nintendo 64 version and through a key combination in the PC version of the game. Upon activation, Reeso and his Podracer completely replace all aspects of the character Mars Guo, including the game's record listings and as the track favorite for the game's Spice Mine Run course. Reeso was one of two cheat-code characters in Episode I Racer, the other being Cy Yunga."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reeso's voice was provided by Bob Bergen and Jim Ward. Bergen also provided the game's voices for Ody Mandrell, Cy Yunga, and Gasgano, while Ward provided the voices for Fud Sang and Mars Guo. However, the dual voice acting is due mostly in part to Reeso recycling sound bytes from the other racers. Despite not physically appearing in the PC version of Episode I Racer, Reeso's voice talent still appears in the game's credits. The model for Reeso's body is a re-textured version of Bozzie Baranta's body model."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
