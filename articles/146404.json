Master Qua was also present to hear the message of Roan Fel, through a contingent of his Imperial Knights, including his daughter Princess Marasiah Fel. Fel's Knights revealed that the Emperor wished to form an alliance between the New Jedi Order and the Empire-in-exile, with the objective of overthrowing Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire; Master Qua held some reservations about the Jedi allying themselves with the Imperial Knights after Roan Fel willingly, if reluctantly, warred with the Jedi and sided with the Sith, an act which resulted in the devastation of the Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Master Qua later agreed, along with the rest of the Jedi Council, to allow the reborn Darth Krayt's forces to attack the Hidden Temple, in order to allow Admiral Gar Stazi's fleet and Fel's fleet to ambush the Sith-Imperial fleet and deal a devastating blow to the Sith Empire. When Darth Krayt's Dragon ships began devastating the allied fleets, Master Qua evacuated the Hidden Temple in a vessel holding the Jedi younglings, encouraging them to draw strength from the Force to combat their fear."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the remaining ships of the allied fleet arrived at Bastion, Master Qua went down to the surface of the planet and viewed the autopsy of one of Darth Krayt's new Sith troopers that had been captured by Cade Skywalker.
