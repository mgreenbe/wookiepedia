Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, were to plant a bomb inside a Besadii vault on the planet, because Republic intelligence had determined that Clan Besadii had been giving money to the Confederacy of Independent Systems. As they were making their way underground to the vault, the Jedi encountered a professional thief named Kanto Raka. He told them he did not care about politics, or the war, and would help them blow up the vault in exchange for a cut of the fortune to cover his expenses. The path he led them kept them from re-entering the sewers, but they encountered five B1-Series battle droids, which they made short work of. The Jedi were successful in blowing up the vault, and Raka took as much of the fortune as he was able to carry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
