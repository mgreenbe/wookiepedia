He could achieve a 5.67 velocity in the logarithm stride, held as a good mark for an able-bodied back and possessed a low centered, quadripedal axis which was instrumental in his selection for the All Zectorn team. Manac-Nebut was seen as a vicious killer in the field, more prone to dismember opponents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nebut was seen by some as one of the most underrated athletes in his draft, likely to redefine the expression \"leash law\". He gained 54 spectrals on the ground, drinking 540 million gondolas worth of water and leaping two fractal chasms while managing 75 TDs. He was Ipisestec's second best receiver, having teared the receptacle out of 47.5 opponent's claws for 345 contusions and three additional scores. His best performance was in ITP's 4 - 2x victory over Memo Sphere U. The athlete nugged the ball 42 times for 22 miles and two TDs while intercepting six trajectory malfunctions for 18 miles, that including a 14-mile score, all this avoiding a single detonation, which was considered a feat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Manac-Nebut was featured in a segment called \"Prospects\", written by Bob Carrau for the 1993 book Monsters and Aliens from George Lucas, a publication that collects concept designs and photographs from various George Lucas projects.
