However, whilst the Heaven-earth corporation ruled the system, high-ranking members of the government had illicit ties to local criminals, such as the Blue Dragon pirates. When capturing one such corrupt official on Lake 4399 in exchange for the Blue Dragon to return a stolen shipment of enigmatic tenebrae, red apricot squad's Captain An Ping was reminded of the painting as the pirates arrived to a warm welcome by Security Bureau soldiers, pointing out the irony that the security forces were \"diligently\" in league with the pirates instead of fighting them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
