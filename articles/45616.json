It allowed them to make sharp turns without the use of attitude thrusters, allowing  for precision thrust vectoring and enhanced maneuverability; in the case of 4L4 fusial thrust engines, maneuverability was so increased that pilots likened it to flying a T-16 skyhopper in atmospheric flight. Etheric rudder prototypes were also used on Recon-Xs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The term was created by Timothy Zahn for Heir to the Empire.
