The difference is that these goggles could filter and balance levels of light, allowing the user to see in pitch black areas, though the vision was cast in a greenish hue. The infra-goggles required batteries to function, which drained at a rate comparative to Electrobinoculars. They could be worn during combat, which came to good use when Jedi Kyle Katarn used them in the dark mines of Artus Prime."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
