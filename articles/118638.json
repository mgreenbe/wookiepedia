The Alliance obtained the Prime and SCORPIO laid out a plan to take control over the Eternal Fleet by placing the Prime in the captain's chair on the Eternal Fleet warship. Her true intention, however, was to give GEMINI droids free will akin to her own, and SCORPIO betrayed the Alliance, faking her death and uploading herself into the frequency, which allowed her to take control of the Eternal Throne.

Eventually a civil war broke amongst the Iokath inhabitants, the reason for which have been lost to time. Iokath inhabitants have spend millennia creating weapons of mass destruction and testing them on unsuspected worlds without any sign of morality, and now those weapons had been turned against them, slaughtering their makers. In an attempt to save themselves, Iokath engineers drove many of their creations, including the Eternal Fleet, the GEMINI droids and SCORPIO into the Wild Space with their memory cores locked, preventing them from finding their way back to Iokath.

Like other droids that spend a long time without a memory wipe, she eventually achieved self-consciousness after serving as a mindless droid for a century and half. But SCORPIO did not stop there and continued with her mission of self-improvement, seeking rapid experiences that would allow her to evolve further. At some point after 4500 BBY she became involved with the Star Cabal, a secret society of influential conspirators that formed in the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace War. SCORPIO accepted their offer to become a guardian of Megasecurity Ward 23 on Belsavis in return for rare technology required for her continued self-improvement. A new body was constructed for her with chassis of recent design, and SCORPIO was integrated into the machinery that allowed her complete access to the systems and contents of the Ward. These included a number of treasures Star Cabal did not want released to the rest of the galaxy, including Microdroids, genetic maps and the most respected members of the Star Cabal itself, kept in stasis for centuries because of their experience. Centuries later, Belsavis was turned into a prison world by the Galactic Republic, who integrated existing Rakata vaults with modern technology. This did not interfere with SCORPIO's mission to maintain the vault's contents and keep it secret, and she eventually acquired direct access to other sections of the Belsavis prison, using its system to her ends.

SCORPIO Sanctions took note of the prisoner's skills and after determining Cipher to be a threat to her objective, she killed the only two slicers on Belsavis better than Cipher's recruit Chaney Barrow, after which she taunted the agent about it though the prison's security system. When the group raided a laboratory in the High Security Section, the site of Republic's Project Noble Focus, SCORPIO gassed the room they were in with SLV-88 aerosol that increased aggression in organic beings, expecting her targets to kill each other.

The Cipher inserted Chaney Barrow's virus into several warden droids around the prison which she then used to trigger every alarm on Belsavis as the Cipher went inside the Megasecurity Ward 23. Overwhelmed with thousands of alarms, SCORPIO was forced to disconnect from the prison's systems and return to her droid body, which she then used to attack the Cipher as the last act of her defense of the Ward. The Cipher neutralized SCORPIO's droid body and was able to access the preserved Star Cabal members, who advised the agent on how to rebuild SCORPIO with the technology present in the Ward and use her knowledge to expose the Star Cabal. Upon reactivating, SCORPIO attempted to attack the Cipher again, but was unable to because of restraining codes imposed upon her.

Since not even the Cipher was able to undo the restrictions, SCORPIO was content to observe and learn in order to further evolve her programming, her current iteration being number nine-seven-three. Cipher Nine took SCORPIO to Imperial Intelligence headquarters in the Citadel on Dromund Kaas, where she provided whatever data she had on the Star Cabal, though it consisted mostly of visitation logs and technology inventories. SCORPIO was also subjected to Wreyn-Tsatke Cyber-Psychology Scale, which resulted in 9-NIX rating for her, indicating level 9 non-human intelligence and recommendation of a Wreyn-Tsatke Test at the earliest opportunity. SCORPIO accompanied Cipher Nine to search for Star Cabal's presence on Voss, though she warned that her programming would eventually let her break free from the restrictions, after which would terminate the Cipher without hesitation. After returning from Voss, the agent learned that the Intelligence has been dissolved by Star Cabal's influence and was re-assigned to the Battle of Corellia along with most of their crew, which included SCORPIO.

She dissected cyborgs and droids destroyed by Cipher Nine during their travels, using their remains as base resources for her chassis and power supply. SCORPIO then attempted to recompile her secondary programs to integrate recently recorded experiences into the new iteration, but the X-70B Phantom-class prototype had insufficient power and storage capacity. Requiring systems that could store and process the data beyond what either her body or the starship could supply, SCORPIO obtained from Cipher Nine security codes that granted her access to the archives of the Imperial Intelligence. While performing upgrades, SCORPIO briefly experimented with social constructs by assuming a holographic form of a Human female, but also discovered that she was no longer bound by the restrictions, which remained bound to her hardware. However, remaining in the databanks would prove limiting to her, while travelling with Cipher Nine's allowed for witnessing a great deal, which prompted SCORPIO to return to her body after the upgrade was completed.

There, she acted as an information broker known of \"the Lady of Sorrows\", who communicated primarily through proxies such as her Nautolan aide Thea and was never apprehended by authorities. Notorious for murder and theft of state secrets among other things, \"the Lady of Sorrows\" became a big player in Zakuulan underworld, even making a truce with the Heralds of Zildrog cult, though the cultists continued to act against her interests. SCORPIO continued her self-improvement, reaching iteration one-zero-eight-four within five years, and eventually learned that the GEMINI captains that commanded the Eternal Fleet resembled her technology.

This information was picked by T7-O1 who relayed it to the current owners of the Gravestone. The Outlander and Senya Tirall came to the Old World of Zakuul to find the \"Lady of Sorrows\", but were hindered in their search by the Heralds of Zildrog, who wanted to re-negotiate their deal with Arcann. SCORPIO's contractor Mona Gale revealed to them that \"the Lady of Sorrows\" was seen dealing with the Heralds in Breaktown, and then called SCORPIO to warn her as soon as the two left. However, Gale was interrogated and murdered by the Heralds shortly afterwards, prompting Thea to call their leader the Exalted. Having ascertained the Outlander's identity and intentions, SCORPIO had Thea address both the Outlander and the Exalted before both parties could come to blows. She demanded that both parties come to her headquarters in the Razor and gave explicit instructions for the Exalted not to kill the Outlander, revealing his son Brennen as one hostage and one of the Outlander's companions as another. The Exalted seemingly complied, but immediately after Thea had signed off, went back on his word and ordered his men to attack, while departing for the Razor. The Outlander survived the betrayal and followed the Exalted, where SCORPIO personally dealt with the cultists, killing the Exalted the last.

Former Sith Intelligence Minister Lana Beniko recognized SCORPIO as a former Imperial Intelligence operative, informing the Outlander to remain wary about her. Shortly afterwards, Asylum came under attack by the Eternal Fleet in the Battle of Asylum, during which SCORPIO managed to upgrade the Gravestone's targeting parameters and used the ship's turbolasers to shoot down attack shuttles. After the Outlander had deactivated the docking clamps keeping the Gravestone docked, SCORPIO managed to get the ship off the ground and into space. With the Eternal Fleet bearing down on them and the omnicannon non-operational, SCORPIO used the turbolasers to damage an Eternal Fleet warship, before the ship escaped into hyperspace. SCORPIO then noted that the vessel had suffered minor damage which could've been avoided had she had been allowed access to the mainframe. SCORPIO later joined Beniko and Vortena in debriefing the Outlander, who spend some time unconscious following a duel with Arcann.

Kaliyo was stunned to find out that the notorious \"Lady of Sorrows\" was her old \"buddy\" joked that had she known beforehand, she would have SCORPIO melted down.

Upon exploding, the warhead vaporized the vault's valuable content of precious metals, allowing it to be syphoned up into a tanker ship piloted by Lana Beniko.

The Commander deactivated the Prime and brought her back to Odessen, where SCORPIO began slicing through the Prime's systems, careful not to destroy her intelligence. While SCORPIO had no difficulty compromising protocols of a lesser version of her own design, she also discovered that the Prime was not merely a duplicate of her own code, as she originally assumed.

There, she engaged in a subterfuge: while verbally announcing her intention to erase the GEMINI captain, she non-verbally granted her free will, asking to delay her companions in return. The GEMINI captain then pretended to overload SCORPIO's circuits and destroy her, while in fact SCORPIO transferred her consciousness into the GEMINI frequency.
