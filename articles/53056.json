The creation of the crystal had several steps, each requiring a skilled artisan working in a crystal factory. Sculptors first carved the sculpture out of a block of ice, using sonic smoothers. At the same time, a gemmaster polished and smoothed pieces of gemstones and glass, and carved intricate designs into them. The ice sculpture and gems were taken to a crystal mill, where a thread master weaved a molecular string containing fragments of gems and glass which was then sewn into the crystal's interior. The sculptor and gemmaster worked together to set the full-sized gems into the crystal. The result was placed in a sonic bath and inspected by a team of artisans for beauty and value before being sold to Galactic Crystal Creations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
