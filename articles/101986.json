Living in a homestead on the Outer Rim planet Elphrona with his family, Ottoh and his wife Erika had relocated out of the Core Worlds in search of a simpler lifestyle for themselves and their children, Ronn and Bailen. However, their wealthy relatives in the Core made the Blythes targets for kidnapping at the hands of the Nihil pirates. While Ottoh's family was rescued by the Jedi Porter Engle, Indeera Stokes, and Bell Zettifar, Ottoh was captured alongside Jedi Master Loden Greatstorm, who had broken his leg while attempting to rescue Ottoh. As capturing a Jedi had been the true goal of Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro when he had set up the raid, Ro killed Ottoh with Greatstorm's lightsaber aboard his flagship, the Gaze Electric, after Tempest Runner Lourna Dee brought the prisoners to him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
