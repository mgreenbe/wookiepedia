In 22 BBY, the first year of the war, the people of the planet Valahari joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and the Galactic Republic, in response, established blockades of neutral worlds that supplied military aid to the Confederacy. Aldanna was placed in charge of a blockade of the Hexus system and was given command of three Venator-class Star Destroyers.

Vane managed to best Skywalker and shoot him down, but ultimately spared his life.
