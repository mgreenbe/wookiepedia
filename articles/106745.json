Polyp worked at a droid salvage yard owned and operated by a Human known as Skinker, who in 0 ABY embroiled Polyp in his dealings with notorious bounty hunter Beilert Valance. Valance, who plied his trade on Feriae Junction for a time, formed a relationship with Skinker: Valance, a virulent hater of droids, paid Skinker to provide him with droids to destroy. After a few weeks, a young man named Luke Skywalker and his protocol droid C-3PO walked into his yard. Skinker instantly recognized him as an Alliance war hero Valance had been tirelessly searching for, and sent Polyp to track the hunter down and give him the word. Polyp passed along the message and returned to Skinker, but the two's whispering made Skywalker suspicious and foiled Valance's attempt to get the drop on his target. Polyp and Skinker were caught in an explosion in the ensuing firefight, killing both."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Polyp made his first and only appearance in the Marvel Star Wars comic series in Star Wars 27, written by Archie Goodwin and released in 1979.
