Under the command of the Galactic Senate, it became a department of the Office of the Supreme Chancellor during the last decades of the Republic. Though the Judicials of the department, in general, served as law enforcement and later also as military forces, the department had specific agencies to provide police services. This included the Republic Office of Criminal Investigations (ROCI), the Sector Rangers (officially under the ROCI), the Republic Security Force, and the Senate Guard. The ROCI was in charge of coordinating Republic criminal investigations and managed the Sector Rangers, one of the earliest law enforcement agencies in Republic service. The Republic Security Force was composed of uniformed police officers called Republic Peace Officers. It provided basic law enforcement services to Republic worlds including emergency response, traffic control, apprehending criminals and conducting raids. Though officially a part of the Judicial Department, the Senate Guard mostly acted independently."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Ruusan Reformation the department was drastically reorganized, and its responsibilities were expanded. Notably, the Judicial Department was placed in charge of supervising the Jedi Order. Also, the remaining forces of the Army of Light were reorganized as the Judicial Forces, the only form of a standing military the Republic would have for the next thousand years. With the coming of the Clone Wars between the Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Judicial Forces' navy and ground units were merged into the re-established Republic Navy and Grand Army of the Republic, respectively. The Jedi Order similarly became a part of the military command structure. With these changes, the Judicial Department focused solely on law enforcement duties until it was dissolved with the formation of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Duties and departments"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Judicial Department was the primary law enforcement agency for the Galactic Republic. Headquartered in the Judicial Arcology on the planet Coruscant, the Judicial Department was responsible for policing the Republic's space and investigating criminal activities. To accomplish this, the department managed several agencies with specific law enforcement duties. This included the Republic Office of Criminal Investigations (ROCI), the Sector Rangers (officially under the ROCI), the Republic Security Force, and the Senate Guard. The ROCI was charged with coordinating investigations by law enforcement agencies of criminal activities. They also supervised the Sector Rangers. The Rangers were one of the earliest law enforcement agencies in Republic service and though officers were assigned on a sector level, the Rangers had Republic wide jurisdiction and were usually sent to investigate organized crime. The Republic Security Force, also called the Republic Guard, was composed of uniformed police officers called Republic Peace Officers. Republic Security provided basic law enforcement services to Republic worlds that requested them including responding to emergency calls, controlling traffic, apprehending criminals and, when needed, conducting raids. The Senate Guard, though an official branch of the Judicial Department, mostly worked independently and ultimately answered to the Senate Guard Committee."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Organizational structure"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Judicial Department was a part of the Office of the Supreme Chancellor and led by the Supreme Chancellor.

After being processed, Grand Master Yoda revealed to the HoloNet that Tejere had no connection to the Separatists. Judicial Forces did not reveal their questioning of the suspect after he was brought into custody by Jedi Master Yoda and Mace Windu. The investigation of the Givin saboteur was later a joint venture between the Judiciary and Senate Bureau of Intelligence agents as well as overseen by Jedi Knight Qu Rhan.
