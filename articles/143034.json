By the year 4.3 ABY, it was home to a new and exotic resort that included the Rodon Value Pod Hotel, the Solar Power Plant, and the Space Observatory, as well as an asteroid installation.

The models for Horizons' three ending segments were designed, constructed, and filmed by Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope special effects veteran David Jones. The space sequence was created with input from Princeton physicist Gerald K. O'Neill and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory was consulted regarding growing crystals for semiconductors in space. Model maker Kenneth A. Larson started making all the large parts and turnings on a machine lathe, though assembly of the Brava Centauri sequence was delayed until neon tubes could be completed. By the time they were ready, Larson had already moved on to the Mesa Verde sequence and Dave Heilman completed the assembly and detailing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
