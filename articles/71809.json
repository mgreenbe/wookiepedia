However, Uln began to succumb to mental illness and was overthrown by Wynn, who took over his former master's position as headmaster. Uln went into hiding in the tomb of the ancient Sith Lord Tulak Hord, and during his tenure in Hord's tomb, he studied the ancient ruins to find theories on the philosophies of the ancient Sith. By 3956 BBY, the third year of the war, Uln had gained a reputation for being the \"old hermit in hiding.\" He began capturing pupils from the Academy and forced them to participate in torture games, hoping to find individuals who shared traits exhibited by the ancient Sith.

Revan was searching for the Rakatan Star Forge, a space station under the control of his former apprentice and the ruling Dark Lord, Darth Malak. When Revan, who had heard of Uln's reputation, and his companions attempted to make their way to Hord's sarcophagus, they were incapacitated by a trap set by Uln.

Uln told Revan that if he answered several questions concerning Sith morality correctly, Uln would torture the Sith student Mekel, who was also in the tomb, with Force lightning. Uln also informed Revan that incorrect answers and refusals to answer would result in the Jedi himself being tortured. When the game began, Revan answered Uln's four questions incorrectly in order to spare Mekel's life. Much to Uln's surprise, Revan survived the test. The Sith Master told Mekel that he was free to leave the tomb while he figured out what to do with Revan, but Mekel instead assaulted Uln with the Force. Angered by this, Uln attacked both Mekel and Revan, but the Jedi and his allies, along with Mekel, combined forces and killed the former headmaster. After Uln's death, Revan was able to convince Mekel to abandon the Sith ways.

His skin was a sickly pale and his eyes were white. By the time he met Revan, Uln was bald, and only had hair on the back of his head. Uln possessed strong beliefs in the principles and teachings of the Sith. During his time in Hord's tomb, he studied the ancient ruins inside to find theories on the ancient Sith's philosophies. He believed that the students that his successor, Uthar Wynn, had been training lacked the \"gumption\" and purity he expected from a true Sith. Because of this, he captured students from the Sith Academy and played torture games with them, in the hopes of finding students who exhibited traits of the old Sith. These games involved questioning the students and torturing them if they failed to answer the question correctly. He was sadistic in his teaching and activism for the Sith cause. Although Uln believed that he would still be remembered for being the Academy's former headmaster, he did not expect the Sith to consider him an \"old hermit,\" which he believed to be slander. Uln held Wynn in low regard and went out of his way to ridicule Wynn's teachings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Uln was capable of setting traps in order to capture students for his torture sessions.

Alternately, Revan can cooperate with Mekel to defeat Uln, then kill the student. Revan can also let Mekel attack and be killed by Uln, a course of action that results in the Sith Master's loss of vitality. This option results in no alignment change.
