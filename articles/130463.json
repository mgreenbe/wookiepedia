The design had less firepower than its predecessor, trading its heavy laser cannons for lighter lasers and heavier shielding while also removing the original model's proton torpedo launchers and replacing them with ion cannons. However, the increased versatility offered by the ion cannons made the craft popular with pirate groups and other criminal forces, including the Zann Consortium."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance, multiple criminal organizations made use of the StarViper Mk.
