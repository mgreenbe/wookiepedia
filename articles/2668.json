The novel reveals that it would take \"days\" to travel from Endor to Bakura; thus, it stands that Skywalker, Antilles, and Rogue Squadron are in hyperspace transit three days after the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
