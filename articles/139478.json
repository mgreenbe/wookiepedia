The Nightsisters used the Talisman of Age to tap into the animal nature of Humans to restore the vigor of their youth for a brief moment. Like all Nightsister artifacts, it was thought to work through the powers of the Spirits, beings said to be from a parallel realm in Nightsister mythology. In her book Wild Power, Mother Talzin wrote about the talisman and its effects."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Talisman of Age was mentioned in the 2012 reference book Book of Sith: Secrets from the Dark Side, written by Daniel Wallace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
