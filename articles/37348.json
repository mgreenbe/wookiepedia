Fierce snake-like creatures with yellow-brown scales, desert worms burrowed through the sands of the Dune Sea and could travel under the surface for several kilometers at a time. They could grow up to ten meters tall, and grew to a length between twenty and fifty meters. Desert worms were seldom seen creatures, but the residents of Tatooine feared them nonetheless. Their main prey was desert wildlife which they ambushed by burrowing under the surface and attacking from below."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
