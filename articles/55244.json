When the Golbah drones revolted, the Geonosian aristocracy responded by dropping a proton bomb on them, obliterating them and creating Golbah's Pit on the former site of the spire. The queens of Golbah were moved to the Stalgasin hive, and were put in the catacombs of a spire in Stalgasin which was called Golbah spire. Offspring of these queens said they came from the Golbah hive, though it had already been destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
