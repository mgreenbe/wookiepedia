A large number of lasers would be fired at a target who set them off, hopefully killing them. The bounty hunter Cad Bane used them is his raid on the Galactic Senate to trap the Galactic Republic senators. The Jedi Order was also known to use laser webs to lock down the Holocron Chamber in the Jedi Temple. Boba Fett used laser webs in his trap for Jodo Kast on Nal Hutta, but Kast avoided them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
