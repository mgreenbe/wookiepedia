After the best veins in the area were depleted and mined, mining companies moved out of the area, leaving behind  derelict machinery and dumping hazardous waste and compounds into the valley. Over the years, other operations only added to the danger by dumping their own broken equipment and toxic waste into the valley, usually from the safety of high-flying speeders and cargo freighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
