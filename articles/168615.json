The dissident miner Skelly tried to convince Moonglow Polychemical and the other mining companies not to conduct blasting past Zone Forty-Two while he conducted a test bombing. Skelly's bombing indicated that Cynda's structure was brittle and that mining operations were endangering the planet's existence. His test-bombing also triggered after-shocks that disrupted mining operations nearby."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
