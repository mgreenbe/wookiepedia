It also had a pair of manipulator arms that could be used to move materials many times the vessel's weight, although those generally required a co-pilot to operate. The KE-8 had fine repulsor control, and could hover in place for extended periods of time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "KE-8 Enforcers were used for isolating clones straying from the process and for finding new and better ways to deal with them. Pilots were commonly specialists in the detection of genetic mutations and aberrant development. KE-8s were also used at the opposite end of the spectrum, and would use their sensors to pick out promising warriors from clone trooper ranks. These individuals would then be recommended for advanced training, set to become cross-trained clone trooper commanders, clone commandos, or Advanced Recon Commandos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
