Their culture emphasized family commitment over mere technicalities such as legal niceties. They took little part in the social whirl, though in fights Dran and Rae would obey orders given by Bles. They were aboard the Ananuru Express when the secret Imperial RNA brainwashing virus datatape was up for auction.
