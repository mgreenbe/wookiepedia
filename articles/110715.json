They advocated a more aggressive stand against the Yuuzhan Vong which did not take New Republic concerns into account. Although never expelled from the New Jedi Order, they came into conflict with Luke Skywalker's leadership, which most of the other masters rallied around."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the radicals argued that the Force was with them, the numbers were against them. During the war, Durron's aggressive stance saw him become increasingly isolated from the rest of the Jedi Order. Additionally, many prominent followers of Durron were either killed or came to believe that Durron himself was unstable. Eventually, the radicals were somewhat co-opted when Luke Skywalker placed Durron on the High Council when Cal Omas became Chief of State."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
