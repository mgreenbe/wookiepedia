When bringing the idea before the Alliance High Command, General Davits Draven suggested Arpagion, who was being held at the Dex Acquisitions Depot on Meor Ain. Organa led her team on a mission to rescue Arpagion, tricking her way into the facility by pretending that she had been captured by Chewbacca. After the Wookiee had knocked the guards unconscious, Luke Skywalker cut the cell door's panel off with his lightsaber, allowing Chewbacca to break the door down. Organa and her team entered the cell to find Arpagion, who was in the form of her father, Bail Organa, as a joke. An offended Leia saw through the disguise, and punched Arpagion, who reverted back into his regular form.

Arpagion stated that he could, but would be unable to impersonate him while on duty. Organa told Arpagion that it would not be necessary, due to a performance at the Moncaladrome which Hubi would be attending. Arpagion inquired as to why why Organa needed the Moff, but the details of the mission were confidential until he accepted. After Arpagion accepted the job, the team went to Mon Cala, where Arpagion stayed in a cave with Leia, waiting until the Moff had been captured. Han Solo and Chewbacca managed to kidnap the Moff, and brought him to Arpagion, who studied his appearance and voice. As Hubi yelled out, Arpagion transformed into him, repeating his words back to him.

C-3PO informed Arpagion that his entrance was out of character for the Moff, but he disregarded it, asking the protocol droid to translate the show for him. During an intermission, Arpagion answered several questions under the\nguise of the Moff. The second half of the show started, and Arpagion returned to his seat.

On Strokill Prime, the real Moff activated an button in Lee-Char's cell, alerting several stormtroopers to the fact that the Moff on Mon Cala was an impersonator. Stormtroopers burst into the Moncaladrome, announcing that the Hubi on the stage was not real, but a sudden light failure allowed Arpagion to escape with the droids. Hiding backstage, Arpagion shape-shifted into a Mon Calamari, disguising the droids in colorful costumes. They slipped back into the chaos, escaping the Moncaladrome. Arpagion and the droids, no longer disguised, met back up with the rest of the team, but they were confronted by Regent Urtya, who demanded to take the recording that Organa had made of Lee-Char's last words. With the mission an apparent failure, the team boarded the Falcon and left the planet. As they left, Urtya broadcasted Lee-Char's message to the Mon Calamari ships, causing them to overthrow the Imperials on board.

However, they received a message from Urtya, who had contacted the Rebellion himself. The Falcon crew watched as a Rebel Alliance fleet arrived above Mon Cala, entering battle against the Imperial forces. Arpagion was shocked when the escape pods from the cruiser Aurora Flare were shot down by the TIE fighters. The Aurora Flare itself was damaged by Admiral Meori's Star Destroyer, causing its cargo of coaxium to explode, damaging the Star Destroyer and allowing the rebel fleet to escape with the Mon Calamari ships. Arpagion was dropped off at the Cosmatanic Steppes, where he thanked Organa, who still had not forgiven him for pretending to be her father. Arpagion told her that he'd make it up to her, before walking away from the Falcon.

He created a show based on the events of the mutiny, albeit with changes to the characters' names due to a suggestion from his agent, performing it in a theater on Gralack, where he took the role of Luke Skywalker. During the play, several stormtroopers intervened, accusing it of being treasonous material. Arpagion shape-shifted back into himself, and along with the other actors, attempted to run backstage. When the stormtroopers followed them, intending to put them under arrest, the real Luke Skywalker stepped in, taking down the stormtroopers with his lightsaber.

She revealed that their objective was to take down the Imperial world of Shu-Torun as an economic strike to the Empire. They traveled to the planet, landing close to the Spike, a structure that powered the entire mining operation. Arpagion was eager to hear Organa's plan, and was not optimistic upon hearing that they had to shut the Spike down. In order to access the planet's master security controls, they needed a scan of Queen Trios of Shu-Torun's eyes. Arpagion was doubtful about successfully kidnapping the queen, but Organa instead planned to impersonate an ore-duke and use the disguise to get close enough for a scanner to view her eyes."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Undercover at a party"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using a speeder, Arpagion, along with Organa, Solo, Meorti and C-3PO, located the ship of Lord Or-Tar in the Abyssal Approach, boarding it and stunned both Or-Tar and his pilot.

While C-3PO's scanner recorded her eyes, Arpagion distracted the queen, showing off the earring that held his comlink. Trios was suspicious of his display of wealth and the apparently new protocol droid, as Or-Tar had previously complained about the Empire's high quotas. Once the scan was successful, Leia spoke to Arpagion through the comlink, telling him to find an excuse to leave. Arpagion claimed that the earring was merely made of tin, and that the droid was useless, bidding farewell to the queen.

He reverted into his regular form, and the team headed for the Ancestral Retreat, leaving Or-Tar and his pilot safely on an isolated island. Arpagion returned the clothing he had taken from the ore-duke, before putting on a royal dress that he would wear to impersonate Queen Trios. They landed at the Retreat, where Arpagion, who disembarked from the ship in disguise as Trios, was welcomed by the queen's staff. Arpagion gathered the staff and took their weapons under the pretense of an inspection, before locking them in a room, leaving free roam of the retreat to Organa's team."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Clawdite returned to his normal form, meeting the other rebels in the retreat's throne room, where he was congratulated by C-3PO.

However, Trios discovered that she had lost control, finding herself trapped inside the Abyssal Rooms. While the team waited for Skywalker and the Partisans to take down the Spike, Arpagion suggested passing the time with conversational improvisation games.

Trios managed to enter the throne room with several soldiers, dueling Organa. Trios was fatally injured, leading her soldiers to rush to attack the rebels while Arpagion looked on in shock.
