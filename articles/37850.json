When Surik was invited to meet the Quarren Visquis\u2014G0-T0's representative on the moon's surface\u2014to discuss the bounty on her head, she was consequently captured and then imprisoned by the crime organization aboard the Visionary. The bounty hunters believed that the truce was off, taking the meeting as permission to begin their hunt.

During the following space battle of the Onderon Civil War, both ships were forced to land on Onderon's moon Dxun after taking damage from the Onderonian separatist forces.
