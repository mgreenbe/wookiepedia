Prior to the Lost Tribe of Sith's invasion of Alanciar in 2975 BBY, it was an independent continent on the planet Kesh that was not ruled by the Sith. The Alanciari who made up the Signal Corps worked in signal stations, tower-like structures within which they operated fireglobes to send coded messages to other signal stations via a language known as semaphore. One known member of the Signal Corps was Jogan Halder, who would help the Sith reunify Alanciar by convincing the Alanciari that the Sith did not pose a threat to them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
