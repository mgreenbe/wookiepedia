Similar but smaller than Neimoidian communal hives they were the original place where Neimoidians put their young. But the communal hives were larger and cheaper to use so only wealthy Neimoidians used the grub-hatcheries. During the Battle of Neimoidia, in the final year of the Clone Wars, the grub-hatcheries were destroyed by Republic forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The walls of Trade Federation Senator Lott Dod's Senate office on Coruscant were modeled after those of a grub-hatchery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
