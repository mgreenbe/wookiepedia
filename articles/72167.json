It involved players betting on which of 100 numbers would appear after a spin of a giant wheel. Players placed bets on the number they believed the wheel would stop on. The wheel was then spun. Once the wheel stopped, a win indicator pointed to the winning number. Any player who picked the winning number won the pot, which could be split among multiple winners. If no player picked the correct number, any player within five of the winning number won from a pool of half the pot, with the rest going to the house."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
