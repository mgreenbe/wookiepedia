She lived in the Lupr'or village, which was the home of remaining Lupr'or who had survived the rising sea levels and the threat of the aquatic Tsw'ells and the R'ora. She brought Captain Phasma, TN-3465, and the droid BB-K8 before the village leader Jair'i. After recounting the bleak history of the Lupr'or, Jair'i told them that their \"friend\" Lieutenant Sol Rivas and that he would be dead soon. After Phasma refused to accept the assumption that Rivas would be killed, she was told that Dar'en would take her and TN-3465 to where the creatures would keep Rivas so they could see how futile it was."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dar'en brought Captain Phasma and TN-3465 to the R'ora stronghold, which lay in a lake surrounded by tsw'ell monsters. As Phasma bent down at the water's edge to study the site, Dar'en warned her that they should depart because it was dangerous to be close to the water's edge. When Phasma asked if the creatures had a sleep cycle, Dar'en told her that the creatures slept in the early hours of the morning but for long."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dar'en accompanied Captain Phasma, TN-3465, and Ali'ane's great granddaughter to the home of her great grandmother Ali'ane.

Dar'en was present when TN-3465 argued with BB-K8 and told the droid to correct its mistake at the expense of looking stupid. Shortly later, Captain Phasma delivered a rousing speech urging the Lupr'or to fight for their survival against the R'ora. Captain Phasma came up with a plan to neutralize the tsw'ells surrounding the island stronghold by electrocuting them with generators recovered from the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After rowing across the lake, Dar'en climbed with Phasma and TN-3465 up the cliff overlooking the battlements of the R'ora stronghold. While climbing the cliff, Phasma experienced flashback of climbing with Torben, Frey, and Siv. While Dar'en and her people fought the R'ora, Phasma snuck away and killed Rivas, concealing her role in the destruction of Starkiller Base. Deeming the Lupr'or unfit to survive the planet's evolution, Phasma abandoned D'aren and her people to the R'ora and Luprora's brutal environment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dar'en was a Lupr'or woman with green skin, black hair, and green eyes.
