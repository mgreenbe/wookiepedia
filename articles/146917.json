The ritual was a sign of appreciation or respect for an individual or event.

Hondo Ohnaka held a banquet, supposedly in honor of the successful transaction, and offered a toast, but the event was a sham. Kenobi and Skywalkers' drinks were drugged, but the two detected the ruse and switched the drinks. As the pirates passed out around them, Skywalker offered his own toast to the unexpected opportunity that the pirates had unwittingly provided them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a celebration of Empire Day on Lothal a group was gathered at Old Jho's Pit Stop, a local cantina, when an Imperial TIE fighter pilot ordered that the broadcast of the HoloNet News should be played, according to Imperial law. On the broadcast, reporter Alton Kastle described how Emperor Sheev Palpatine had ended the Clone Wars and founded the glorious Empire. The pilot then shouted for everyone to raise their glasses in honor of the Emperor, but few joined the toast, as the Empire and its policies, and by extension the Emperor, were unpopular with the group."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
