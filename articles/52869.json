The device consisted of a claw attached to a long shaft. The grabber utilized tractor beam technology. When the wielder desired to pick up something out of reach, he or she could capture it with the tractor beam, bring it close, and secure it with the claw. The garbage grabber was of Squib origin, hence the association with garbage. Many Squibs wore a garbage grabber strapped across their backs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
