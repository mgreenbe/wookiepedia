It contained the Eriadu Planetary Security Launchport and the main facilities of Eriadu Manufacturing. Phelar Port was the most notable spaceport on Eriadu and in the entirety of the Seswenna sector.

Although crime rates began to increase at the Port, the EPS's presence helped keep individuals in line. The Jedi Order established a starfighter base at this port, hoping to bolster security in the Seswenna sector. The spaceport was administrated by the Republic Navy and heavy policed by soldiers of the Republic, until the rise of the Galactic Empire which saw stormtroopers replace Republic soldiers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
