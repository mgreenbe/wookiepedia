Made of metals or plastic, they were handles with curved, blunted blades used to grab cargo crates and box handles. Using crate hooks was easier for individuals to move large and bulky cargo by hand, and avoided the possibility of crates falling and injuring them. Cargo hooks could also be used as a makeshift melee weapon or climbing tools. During the Galactic Civil War, Vlanth Shipping Suppliers manufactured crate hooks named Cargo Grippers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
