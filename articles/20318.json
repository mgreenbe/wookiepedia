He was taken to Korriban where he was held with several prisoners under the control of Jailer Knash. When the unidentified Sith acolyte arrived to meet Knash, Brehg was last one to face the trained acolyte. In spite of all the torture he underwent, Brehg still insisted that he was innocent. He admitted that he did once serve time in a Republic prison for forgery, but insisted that since his release, he had been honest ever since. Brehg begged the acolyte and Knash to let him go, but the warrior believed that he was lying and that he should be tortured even more until a confession came out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
