It was comprised of forty planets that orbited a giant blue-white star.

The area was later explored by the Galactic Republic sometime between 3956 BBY and 3000 BBY. In 3350 BBY, the system's sector organized an independent government called the Centrality; however, the cluster of worlds was under the control of the Hutt kajidics. By 1004 BBY, the area had fallen under the influence of the Brotherhood of Darkness, although the faction was dissolved at the end of the New Sith Wars, in 1000 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Republic was reformed as the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, the Centrality planets swore allegiance to the new regime, though the Hutts were largely in power during its reign. Once the New Republic took control of the galaxy in 6 ABY, the Centrality sector was again independent of galactic governments. By 137 ABY, the Dilonexa system was within the territory of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Dilonexa system first appeared in Lando Calrissian and the Flamewind of Oseon, a 1983 book written by L.
