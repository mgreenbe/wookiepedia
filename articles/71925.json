He handled the heavy lifting for the crew and provided security for their base of operations, a backroom in the Poison Pit cantina in the town of Jiguuna on the planet Nal Hutta. In 3643 BBY, Braden found a new prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who he hoped could win the competition known as the Great Hunt. The prot\u00e9g\u00e9 traveled to the base of operations on Nal Hutta and Braden introduced Mako and Jory as the bounty hunter's support crew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to enter the Great Hunt, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 would need the sponsorship of local crime lord Suudaa Nem'ro and so Braden had Mako find a nearby bounty that the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 could claim in order to cement their reputation. After the slicer suggested the criminal Vexx be the group's target, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 left to search for information on Vexx at the criminal's safehouse. While the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was gone, Jory and Mako worked on what Braden described as \"all the little details\" of their mission so that the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 would not have to. While Braden was visiting Nem'ro's Palace, Mako discussed with Jory how she wished to participate in missions rather than staying at the base with him. The prot\u00e9g\u00e9 then returned with a datapad from the safehouse and Jory complemented his new associate's skill while Mako searched the device. After she discovered a shuttle ticket that Vexx had booked, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 left in order to catch the criminal before he could leave Nal Hutta."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A casualty of the Hunt"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was gone, the bounty hunter Tarro Blood and his associate Sedyn Kyne arrived at the base of operations while Braden and Jory were inside. Braden told the hunter to leave, but Blood introduced himself and explained that he also hoped to win the Great Hunt and so was removing the competition. Assuming that Blood planned to kill Braden's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Jory declared the rival hunter's mission a failure as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was not in the base and now Jory and Braden knew Blood's plan. Blood revealed that, as directly attacking other competitors was against the rules of the Great Hunt, he planned to instead eliminate his rival's support. Blood then ordered Kyne to kill Braden and Jory and left the room. Braden ordered Jory to shoot Kyne, but neither of them was quick enough to out draw their foe and he killed each with a single shot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The prot\u00e9g\u00e9 returned to the base after successfully killing Vexx and discovered Braden and Jory's bodies where Kyne had left them.

The pair watched a hologram showing what had occurred, and swore to continue in their goal to win the Great Hunt so that they could defeat Blood for what he had done. The prot\u00e9g\u00e9 then left to meet with Nem'ro while Mako used the pay out from Vexx's bounty to give Jory and Braden a proper burial.

When she said she would rather be out in the field then stuck at the base with him, he took no offence due to her age. He was impressed by the natural talents of Braden's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and considered himself lucky to be working in the support crew, which he hoped would make him rich and famous. Jory was fond of credits and material stability, so although he did not know the exact nature of the Great Hunt, Jory hoped the prize would be an easily divisible pay out.
