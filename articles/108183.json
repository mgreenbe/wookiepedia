The Prosperous and the rest of the Separatist navy arrived out of hyperspace in the space over Coruscant, and began to engage the Republic's defense fleet. However, during the battle, the Republic Venator-class Star Destroyer Impavid was badly damaged.

Floating through the vacuum between the two destroyers, Tiin and his clones landed on the Prosperous's hull and began to fight their way inside the Separatist capital ship. The Prosperous's own turbolasers held back most of the clone boarders on the ship's hull, killing many of the marines.

Using the different consoles on the bridge, Tiin redirected the Prosperous's turret fire from the clone marines still stuck on the hull to other nearby Separatist warships, with the marines on the hull cheering as they realized that the Republic had captured the vessel. Because of the high level of automation across the carrier, Tiin and his marines secured the rest of the Prosperous with relative ease, and returned to Coruscant aboard the Prosperous after the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Commanders and crew"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During its service in the Confederate Navy, the Prosperous was crewed and guarded by several B1 battle droids.
