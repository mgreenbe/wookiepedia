The ship was owned by Reegas Vance, but was taken by Khedryn Faal and Marr Idi-Shael, who used it for salvaging operations. In 41.5 ABY, Jedi Knight Jaden Korr enlisted the aid of Junker's crew to resolve a Force vision he had received.

On the stern of the ship a short-range tractor beam array and military-grade universal docking ring were installed. While Junker was not equipped with any weapons, it had a power crystal attached on the beam projector, however it used a lot of power. The interior of the ship was lined with safety rails, wall-mounted emergency equipment cases, and contained a passenger berth which was converted into a rudimentary medbay.

The hold of the ship held a Searing swoop bike, a speeder bike, two landspeeders, and several containers of electronics and assorted scrap until it was all destroyed on the Harbinger, an ancient Sith dreadnought from 5000 BBY. After Massassi warriors had boarded Junker in the Harbinger's hangar bay, a cooling rod had to be used to prop open the cockpit door. Faal disliked droids, and did not allow them on his ship.

In the cantina, a bearded Human male blocked Faal's path in an attempt to talk, but Faal told him to wait until after the game had finished. The bearded man turned out to be the Jedi Knight Jaden Korr, who was looking to hire Junker's crew.

The Jedi Knight also offered the services of his astromech droid, Arsix, but Faal responded that he does not like droids, and never allows them on his ship, so Korr gave the droid orders to orbit Fhost's largest moon and contact Grand Master Skywalker if the droid hadn't heard from Korr in two weeks. At the hangar, Faal told Idi-Shael to head to the cockpit to continue preparing the engines while he and Korr would load the speeders into Junker's packed hold.

They had received the coordinates after having to travel out of their way while returning to Fhost from a situation that had gone wrong, and picked up an encrypted signal in a remote system.

The Jedi Knight believed that he had seen the frozen moon in a vision given to him by the Force back in his apartment on Coruscant, and that it might have consequences for the Jedi Order, but he had not told anyone else what he had seen. After discussing Korr's reasons for the coordinates, Faal presumptuously accepted Korr's offer to pay five thousand credits up front, which Korr later agreed to.

Arriving at the docking port, Korr saw through a viewport an unknown small sphere, what he thought could be an escape pod, attached to the ship.

The man removed his helmet, and Korr realized the intruder was a Jedi. Further questioning revealed that the intruder was named Relin Druur, a Jedi Master. Master Skywalker had not sent Druur on his mission, however, and had never even heard of him. He was sent on a mission by Master Nadill, and had to get back aboard Harbinger to prevent it from delivering its shipment.

Faal pointed out that the Harbinger had already failed in bring its cargo to Kirrek, and that the moon would still be there for them to come back to. Korr suggested hiding in the rings of the gas giant, as Harbinger's sensors would not be able to detect them, and no starfighter would follow them. However, Harbinger and the fighters were under the command of Druur's former Padawan, the Kaleesh Sith Saes Rrogon, and he would not simply let Druur escape him. While Junker had no ship-to-ship weapons, Druur decided to head to the rear, to use the tractor beam mounted there, and Korr would pilot the freighter using the Force for additional guidance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Typically, the tractor beam was only used for towing derelicts, but Druur planned to use it as a makeshift weapon, while alerting Korr so he could compensate for the drag. As Junker entered the ring, Faal had Idi-Shael disengage Druur's escape pod to make it easier for Korr to traverse the ring. While the Blades were essentially floating laser cannons, with minimal shields, Junker was a salvage ship, with nothing in the way of deflectors strong enough to defend against the Blades, and with the risk of the floating rocks and ice, Faal had Idi-Shael increase the power to the forward deflector. Junker was pelted with small rocks and ice against the deflector, which caused no damage, but the Blades followed behind, firing green lines of energy from their laser cannons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after entering the ring, one of the Blades hit a chunk of rock, which caused it to wildly spin out of control until it crashed into another rock and exploded. As they went deeper into the ring, the chunks of ice and rocks grew larger, and a second Blade crashed into one and exploded. Korr wasn't seeing the ice and rocks outside the viewport, but rather feeling them through the Force, which had allowed him to act without thinking. When he flew Junker out of the rings for a moment before turning back in, the internal compensators were not able to adjust quickly enough and caused Faal some uneasiness. Druur then alerted Korr that he would next use the tractor beam to starboard, which allowed Korr to adjust for it, and pulled on a large planetoid for a few seconds. This pulled the planetoid from its orbit in the ring, and started a chain of collisions with two more chunks of rock, and resulted in the two lead Blades being destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a large rock exploded near the back of Junker, and caused particles to hit the ship, Druur used the tractor beam on one of the Blades.

Faal planned to space the contents in Junker's hold, which he hoped would then crash into the chunks of rock and ice and explode, and make the Blades pilots believe Junker was destroyed. Druur handed Faal two mag-grenades to attach to the speeders in the hold."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Korr accelerated, twisted, and turned Junker hard enough to make the ship's chassis creak because of the strain. After attaching the mag-grenades to two speeders in the hold, Faal uncoupled the speeders, and opened a container with loose electronics as the hold was about to vent. Once the Blades were lost, Idi-Shael vented the cargo hold, and the two speeders slid out and exploded on a part of the ring.

Once all four onboard Junker were in the galley, Faal informed them Junker was his ship, and he was no longer going to risk it on a salvage job. Faal discussed with the other three, and Korr and Druur both implored that everything that had happened could not have been merely chance. Druur reasoned that even though he hadn't stopped to receive medical aid, or even pain relief, he would not until he accomplished what had to be done."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To further prove his point that events were not controlled by chance, Korr informed Idi-Shael that he was Force-sensitive. Idi-Shael had plotted Junker's hyperspace route without the navigation computer, and had unknowingly been influenced by the Force. Korr told Druur that he would accompany him to the Harbinger, as its cargo of dark side enhancing Lignan ore was more important, but Druur told him that since Korr was not able to conceal his presence in the Force, it would not work. It was decided that Idi-Shael would go with Druur to the Sith dreadnought.

Since Rrogon had not used the Harbinger's weapons to destroy Junker with Druur onboard, and had instead deployed the Blade starfighters, Druur reasoned that the dreadnought's weapons must have been disabled. Harbinger still had shields, however, so Idi-Shael said they could use Junker's power crystal to rupture a hole in the dreadnought's shield, and enable Junker to land inside. Idi-Shael was not going to stay onboard Harbinger long, and was to leave the ship and jump away, with Druur stating he would use an escape pod again.

The Cerean and ancient Jedi then prepared to fly slowly through the ring, and come out of the ring close to the Harbinger. When they reached the edge of the ring, Idi-Shael did the calculations and realized that it would take them one minute to fly through the space between the ring and the Harbinger, too much time to be safe, especially when taking into account the Blades.

A blaster shot came through the doors as they lowered and impacted on the inside of Junker's cargo bay walls. More shots followed them, but were deflected by Druur using his lightsaber, before he ran out of the freighter and onto the Harbinger.

The caf would not have been dripping for too long though, so Idi-Shael realized that someone had boarded the ship, which was confirmed when he heard someone moving onboard the ship. He his in one of the crew quarters to collect his thoughts before he left to retrieve an oxygen kit and vac suit from a storage locker.

Once the ship completed its pre-launch setup and Idi-Shael had donned the oxygen kit and vac suit, he turned on the repulsorlifts and started to leave. An explosion outside Junker shook the freighter, and scrambled the sensors. Without sensors, he had no way to pilot Junker out of the landing bay, and away from Harbinger, until he tried to visualize the dreadnought's schematics in his mind, and allowed the Force to flow through him.

It was piloted by Nenn's sister, Syll, and the two Umbarans only needed Korr alive. They fired, but Junker's deflector shields were not active, and the freighter took the red beams of plasma to its port side. Flame, smoke, and debris flew out of Junker, but Idi-Shael and Ar-Six worked to seal off the damaged areas, and activated the deflectors. They were also able to keep the engines functional during the attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Umbarans then turned toward Faal's escape pod. Korr told him to quickly turn the pod, and at the same time fired the hardsuit's thrusters toward the pod. The unexpected turn saved Faal, and took the Umabaran siblings additional time to aim at him. Korr used the Force to pull the pod toward him, which saved it, although it did lurch hard from the proximity of the shot. Korr made it to the pod, and when the Umabarans fired again, he deflected the shot with his lightsaber. The deflection hit the cockpit of the scout flyer, the blast killing its pilot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Faal and Korr then made their way to Junker, and Idi-Shael used the tractor beam to reel them in. An alarm in Korr's hardsuit started going off, however, because it had started to leak oxygen into space. With two holes near the ankle section of the suit leaking, Korr only had thirty seconds of oxygen left. In addition to the tractor beam pulling the pod in, Idi-Shael maneuvered Junker closer to the pod. Korr began losing his vision, but saw that Idi-Shael had donned a hardsuit himself, while Ar-Six flew the freighter. As Idi-Shael propelled himself towards Korr, and brought him back aboard Junker, Korr was losing consciousness and remarked that the image of Junker with an open airlock looked \"hungry\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Korr awoke in the corridor outside the airlock. Idi-Shael was able to get him inside Junker quickly, and Korr only went a few seconds without air. They saw that the supply ship was moving away from them and was about to jump to hyperspace, while the scout flyer moved deeper into the system. Faal then told Korr about the Umbaran, and how he had been able to block the clones' Force use and dampened their lightsabers, as well as the fact that one of the clones was of Korr. Even though there were only three clones left, they were still dangerous, and Korr stated Junker's crew had to go after the clones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After discussing what had happened on the supply ship, and that they had to go after the clones, Marr saw on the scanners that the Umbaran's scout flyer was leaving the system, and Faal hoped they would not show up again. Arsix brought Faal medical supplies, which he accepted with a smile, as he had changed his views on the droid. The supply ship then jumped to hyperspace, and Junker's crew would have to follow it using the tracking beacon Korr had placed on the ship on while at the Farpoint medical center on Fhost. While Faal had begun to accept Arsix, he told the droid that he would have to earn his keep on the ship, and would have to bring him caf as Junker ran on caf."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tracking beacon tracked the supply ship to a remote system that only had two planets and an asteroid belt. The system also contained high amounts of radiation, but Junker's deflectors would be able to protect them from it. Faal, Korr, and Idi-Shael discussed whether the clones had made a misjump, or randomly dropped out of hyperspace, but Korr was certain they had traveled there for a reason. Before leaving, Faal said he needed a chewstim, but he, Korr and Idi-Shael were out.

Korr and Idi-Shael also felt something in the Force upon entering system, a feeling of the dark side. Faal asked if it was the clones, but Korr responded it was something else, despite the fact that there was nothing in the system aside from an asteroid belt and two barren planets. After engaging the ion engines to head towards the other side of the planets, a scan of the asteroid belt in the system revealed it was composed of parts of a structure, a very large structure. The three discussed that the technology to create such a large structure was impossible, and Korr theorized that it could have been of Celestial or Rakatan origin. Korr told Arsix to send the information to Master Skywalker so that it could be reported, which the droid used Junker to do. As Junker moved to the opposite side of the two planets however they saw something, a greenish black, organic, viewportless cylinder as large as a star cruiser, which was emanating with the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they discussed the station, they saw that the clones' ship had attached to the station with a docking port attacked to the bottom of the ship. Korr told Faal to keep Junker at a safe distance so that he and Idi-Shael could take the Flotsam to the station. Faal reminded Korr that Junker was still his ship, and what had happened when they had left him behind on Fhost, but Korr said Faal would not be enough to handle the powerful Force users on a station built using the dark side. The Jedi also wanted Faal to stay behind so that if something went wrong on the station with the clones, he and Idi-Shael would need a quick exit. The spacer suggested that Ar-Six could pilot Junker, but Korr said it would be better for a living pilot to do so. After Idi-Shael agreed with Korr, Faal relented, acknowledging that things had changed on the ship as he had been willing to let a droid pilot it alone, and stayed behind with him while the Jedi headed to Flotsam to go to the station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Korr and Idi-Shael had departed in Flotsam, Faal flew Junker into the asteroid belt.

The explosion moved Junker towards an asteroid before Faal activated reverse thrusters. Another explosion caused a different asteroid to break into smaller pieces and hit against Junker's hull. The attack caused a fire to erupt in the engine room, which Faal sent Ar-Six to extinguish. Junker's instrument panels also lost power for a few moments after a shot grazed across the top of the freighter. Faal flew deeper into the asteroid belt where he determined that their attacker was the Umbaran scout ship. Its arrival into the system had gone unnoticed, which made Faal believe the ship had a cloaking device of some sort, not unlike its pilot's ability to dampen a Force-sensitive's abilities. Regardless, Junker had no weapons, so Faal had to bring it away from the firefight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Faal flew Junker deeper into the asteroid belt, his cup of caf fell to the floor and spilled onto Junker's deck. Similar to when Korr had flown Junker during an earlier encounter with Harbinger, Faal piloted the freighter in a highly erratic matter, climbing, diving, slowing down, speeding up, and spinning, but without the aid of the Force that Korr had tapped into. Another asteroid exploded next to Junker, and the blast wave caused the freighter to crash into a different asteroid, causing the side of Junker's hull to screech along the asteroid. Although Ar-Six was able to remotely extinguish the fire in the engine room, Faal cursed that he had a droid serving on his ship but did not have any weapons installed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After bumping into a few more asteroids and taking a couple more laser hits, Faal told Ar-Six to contact Korr and Idi-Shael to let them know that the Umbaran had tracked them down, and was pursuing Junker.

Junker almost crashed into another large asteroid, but Faal was able to bring the freighter up over the top of the asteroid, and only skimmed the bottom before he accelerated the ship to full speed. Faal was a good pilot, however, and without Flotsam attached to the side of Junker, he was able to prevent Nenn from acquiring a target lock. Nenn's compatriot, a One Sith clone of Jaden Korr known as Iteration, found Flotsam near the mysterious station.

It wasn't until Ar-Six questioningly beeped about the laser fire that Faal thought the Umbaran had given up his pursuit, although he continued to fly evasively in case the asteroid belt was blocking the sensor readings of the scout ship. The spacer decided to risk a trip out of the asteroid belt in order to determine if the Umbaran had given up. At first Ar-Six could not detect the Umbaran's ship, but later realized that it had moved towards the Rakatan station.

When the supply ship exploded it disconnected the tether holding the station above the planet, and Junker was almost dragged down with it. Once Ar-Six diverted all power to the engines, except for life support and artificial gravity, the ship broke away from the filaments.

They disabled the engines of their ship, the Seeker, and used hardsuits and a hatch cracker to board the Blackstar. Verra was waiting for them to dock, and was shot in the chest by Idi-Shael.

Idi-Shael used his Cerean brain, and unknowingly the Force, to perform complex mathematical equations to plot hyperspace routes. When working for Jaden Korr, Junker engaged an ancient Sith dreadnought, the Harbinger. In order to evade the dreadnought, Korr took the controls of the ship and flew through an asteroid field guided by the Force. While Korr was piloting the ship through the asteroids, Relin Druur was at the back of the ship, using the tractor beam array to pull asteroids into the paths of pursuing Blade starfighters. Despite his dislike of droids, Faal allowed Korr's R6-series astromech droid, Arsix, onboard, and even let the droid control the ship when he was on the Rakatan space station known as Mother.
