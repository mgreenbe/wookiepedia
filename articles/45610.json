They arrived to find that the Death Star had already left, having destroyed the planet first. Furthermore, Imperial forces had anticipated the Rebel's arrival and lingered there to set a trap. The corvettes were disabled and the Imperials dispatched repair crews aboard the Lambda-class shuttles, Ceptor 1 and 2 to board and capture the corvettes under the protection of Assault Gunboats."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later, the Alliance mounted a rescue attempt. The operation comprised three waves. First, three X-wings from Red Squadron, flown by Keyan Farlander, Casal Marskan and Horodi, arrived to engage the Gunboats. Three minutes later, two groups of three Y-wings from Blue and Gold squadrons arrived and attempted to disable the corvettes. Six minutes after the arrival of the Y-wings, two Lambda-class shuttles from Rogue group arrived to recapture the corvettes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebels succeeded in recapturing the corvettes, but resistance was greater than anticipated and the cost was high. Marskan and Horodi were both killed before the Y-wings arrived. After the rest of the Rebels fled to hyperspace, a communications problem resulted in Farlander receiving a late mission complete message and his X-wing was destroyed as he continued to battle the Gunboats alone. Farlander was able to eject and was later recovered by the Rebels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "X-Wing: The Official Strategy Guide's mission statistics tables show Ethar 2 listed as being in the mission \"Defend the Independence\".
