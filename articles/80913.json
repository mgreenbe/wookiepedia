It depicted pink clouds with three red banners bearing the First Order insignia: one large one at the center and two comparatively smaller ones, one on each side of the larger one. In addition, there were six First Order TIE Fighter Pilots and ten First Order Stormtroopers standing in formation (three TIE pilots in front of each of the two smaller banners; seven stormtroopers in front of the central banner; one stormtrooper near each of the outer edges of the poster, and a stormtrooper superimposed in front of the central banner). The words were in High Galactic font and stated at top \"Legitimate Rule\" in black, and at the bottom in the black space \"Legitimate Power\" in red."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
