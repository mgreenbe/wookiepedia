The Separatists had successfully tested the airborne gas against the Gungan colony on Ohma-D'un, a moon of the planet Naboo. After this, the Separatists planned on using it against the clone troopers who served the Grand Army of the Republic. When Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi rendezvoused with the Jedi Masters, Ven'nari expressed her impatience to Kenobi regarding his arrival. She also questioned Antilles's involvement in the mission due to the fact that he was not assigned to their team. After conversing with Antilles, Ven'nari and the Masters successfully infiltrated the mobile Separatist base, which was located on a small island moving through the planet's lava stream. Once the Jedi were inside, both Ven'nari and Diath noted that the base was not guarded by battle droids. The Bothan remarked that the facility was manned and determined that the guards would be easy to deal with. However, Antilles noted that the guards were Skakoans\u2014a species that breathed methane and was forced to wear pressurized armor\u2014and that attacking them with a lightsaber would cause them to explode.

When the Skakoans exploded, Ven'nari used her pyrokinetic abilities with the Force to pull the fire toward her. After the fire subsided, Diath and the team found Ven'nari with extensive burns, and she told Diath that she was about to die. Diath used the Force to ease Ven'nari's suffering as she passed away. After her death, Diath, Antilles, and Fay were also killed. However, Kenobi successfully recovered the antidote and returned to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.
