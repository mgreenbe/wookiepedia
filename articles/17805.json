The dingy establishment was a favorite amongst regular visitors to the Wheel and so was often filled with customers, who were catered for by a team of droids who cleaned and worked in the cantina. The cantina discouraged fighting, and the staff was quick to call the Wheel Security Force if a scuffle began."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The establishment was in business during the Galactic Civil War, at which time the cantina's best bouncer and bartender was a muscular Human named Ceoloe, who was normally able to break up any fights. In such fights, Ceoloe particularly looked to protect Waroon Dak, a Corellian infochant who paid the bouncer a small finder's fee to regularly use a table by the bar for his work, as well as for tips as to potential sources of information."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Blasted Asteroid cantina was first introduced in Beyond the Rim, an adventure module written by Sterling Hershey in 2013 for the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game Star Wars: Edge of the Empire.
