However, Darth Vader himself was known to be on the move and it was believed that he may, possibly, have been onboard. They also learned that it would be traveling to Celanon City with a skeleton crew and would have minimal escort.

The attack was led by the Nebulon-B frigate Liberator, supported by X-wings from Red and Blue Squadrons and Y-wings from Gold Squadron. Involved in the attack were Captain Charger and Cadet Keyan Farlander, flying his first mission as wingman to Lieutenant Hamo Blastwell in Red Squadron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Blue Squadron's X-wings assisted Liberator in engaging defending TIE Fighters, the Y-wings used their ion cannons to disable Talon. The ship was then boarded by Storm Unit with Red Squadron protecting their transport from any TIEs that made it past Blue Squadron. Needing an extra R2 unit, Storm Unit asked if any pilots had one to spare. While Storm Unit fought against defending stormtroopers, Farlander and his R2 unit worked their way to the bridge where they deactivated any remaining turbolaser batteries and began downloading data from the ship's computer. He also relieved the Imperial commanding officer of some disks which he was attempting to destroy, killing the officer in the process, before leaving the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to make a quick escape before Imperial reinforcements could arrive, the Rebels left Talon where it was."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Vader had not been aboard, the documents recovered proved to contain important information.
