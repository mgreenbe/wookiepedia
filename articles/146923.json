They were powerful enough to blind those who looked into them, because they converted heat into light with near-perfect efficiency. A good Tobal lens could convert heat to light at close to a one hundred percent efficiency rate. It looks like an oval crystal about the size of a human head and is full of sparkling colors. The lens were used to power the old Renatta Racing Systems photon drives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
