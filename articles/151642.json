The Kaminoan scientist Kolac Pru stored a sample of thornsuckle plant in a safety-deposit box in the Undervaults, and his former assistant, Mahjo Reeloo, vowed to destroy it. She hired the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca to take her to the Undervaults in the Millennium Falcon, first stopping on Dhandu 3 to steal a key to an adjacent deposit box owned by Jayyar Lu-wehs.
