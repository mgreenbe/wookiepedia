Only an Imperial I-class Star Destroyer was sent, as it was believed the operation would not require any larger vessel. Vengeance was commanded by Captain Thrawn while the ground forces were led by Major Noda."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The military operation was conducted with a dual purpose in mind, both destroying the Rebels on Sulon and at the same time lay the blame on the Rebel Alliance by making it out to be their doing. To this end, all soldiers and vehicles were marked with Rebel insignias, although the hoax was only partially successful."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Special elite soldiers from the Empire's Ghost Battalion attempted to track down Rebel leader Morgan Katarn. They destroyed eleven homesteads including Katarn's and Danga's and massacred entire families in the process, all in an effort to discredit the Rebels further.

Despite their efforts, the two contingents of stormtroopers pushed them in the main chamber and overwhelmed them after a brief fight.
