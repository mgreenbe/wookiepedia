At some point during his service to the Galactic Empire, Dyer worked closely with Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod, an Imperial militant who oversaw the construction of the second Death Star battlestation.

Dyer and Jerjerrod would also plan the deployment of ground troops on Endor. As part of another task, Dyer took part in commanding an elite group of troops guarding the shield generator. Alongside Dyer's instruction to hold troops in reserve, the group consisted of members of the 501st Legion, Imperial Lieutenants Grond and Renz, as well as the stormtrooper Wallen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, a group of Rebel Alliance members infiltrated the bunker to destroy the shield generator\u2014which would allow the Rebels' orbiting fleet to attack the Death Star itself. In order to stop the intruders, the Imperial group entered the base. Dyer was joined by Renz and Grond, who became the Imperial colonel's primary aide during the Rebel attack. After the Rebel group ambushed the stationed Imperial officers inside the bunker, Dyer confronted Rebel General Han Solo, pointing a blaster pistol at him and ordering him to freeze. However, Solo threw a toolbox full of explosive charges at Dyer, which caused the colonel to fall over the railing of a catwalk and into a generator room below, resulting in his apparent death. Following the event, Renz took command of the elite Imperial group.

In the script, both Dyer's and Renz's lines were merged and the person who shouts \"Freeze! You Rebel Scum\" was identified simply as \"Commander.\" However, in Screenplays, Dyer was identified as \"Imperial officer,\" while Renz was named \"Commander.\" Dyer did not appear in the radio adaptation of Return of the Jedi. Unlike in the film, his \"Freeze!\" line was given to Han Solo in the dramatization. Dyer was not present in the comic Return of the Jedi 3, and as was the case with the radio drama, Solo was given his line."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
