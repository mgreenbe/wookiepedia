The slime of the slugs was sugary with hints of the fragrant herbs that the slugs had digested. It was prized by mixologists and cooks, including the Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs, who described it as \"unusually saccharine\" and poured it over desserts or mixed it into drinks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tuggs developed an imitation of the slime that used everyday herbs, sugar, and water to make a clear liquid infused with sweetness and herbaceous flavor, suitable for use as a substitute syrup when the slugs were in short supply. Sometime after the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY, Tuggs authored The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, which included his recipes for Dagobah Slug Syrup and two cocktails that were sweetened with the syrup, Photon Fizzle and Dagobah Slug Slinger."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dagobah Slug Syrup was introduced in the 2019 recipe book Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, written by Marc Sumerak and Chelsea Monroe-Cassel. The out-of-universe recipe uses the ingredients sugar, water, fresh ginger, and a sprig of rosemary. The rosemary and ginger are strained out of the syrup after it is infused with their flavors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the Dagobah Slug Slinger, the syrup is used to sweeten other ingredients to make a cocktail that is garnished with another sprig of rosemary.
