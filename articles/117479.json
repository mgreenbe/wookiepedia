From birth, she was destined for a glamorous life, as the blood of the most noble and wealthy House Organa coursed through her veins. She was the daughter of the Viceroy Organa and one of four siblings, the others being Tia, Celly and Bail Prestor. When she finished school and came of age, Rouge was brought to a debutante ball on Coruscant, capital city of the Republic. By custom, young noblewomen attended levees in hopes they could find a suitable husband of high lineage. Eventually, Rouge Organa got married and started a family of her own. In the meantime, her brother Bail Prestor Organa went on to become the Viceroy and First Chairman of the Alderaan system and the husband of Queen Breha Antilles."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A princess' tutor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the end of the Clone Wars, a three-year galaxy-wide conflict, Rouge's brother adopted the late Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala's daughter, a baby called Leia.

By the time Leia was an infant, Rouge Organa had become a widow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rouge and her sisters hired deportment teachers to tutor young Leia, wishing to make a \"proper\" princess out of their tombyish niece, including the redoubtable Madame Vesta, headmistress of Alderaan Select Academy for Young Ladies. The Organa sisters would often tend to the Princess' dress and hair themselves, much to Leia's annoyance. In 1 BBY, Rouge accompanied Leia Organa, now a young adult and a Senator, to a levee on Coruscant along with her siblings. When her niece noticed the Galactic Emperor Palpatine's jeweled concubines and asked her about them, Rouge assumed a superior air and answered that a Princess was not obligated to speak with their sort."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Dead with her planet"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One year later, the Galactic Empire decided to subject all Alderaanians to a radical punishment, following their Viceroy's involvement with the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The Imperial Grand Moff Tarkin decided to use his new superweapon, the Death Star, to sow the seeds of terror and keep the seditious star systems in line. The peaceful planet Alderaan vanished with a single green blast from the Death Star's superlaser, with the captive Princess Leia watching in horror. Although her aunts had made her girlhood tough and sometimes unpleasant, Leia Organa was immediately struck with grief when she realized they were gone forever.

In the evening, before dinner, she enjoyed having servants tending to her hair in front of a gilt-framed mirror in her boudoir. A refined woman born into wealth, Rouge Organa enjoyed wearing iridescent Old Republic bronze earrings, a taste she shared with her sisters. By contrast, she despised semi-dry wines, considering them unrefined and only good enough for space-hoppers. A gossipy and proud noblewoman, she overtly despised Palpatine's Imperial concubines. Rouge Organa valued patience, and she tried to inculcate this virtue into her niece. The dowager attached great importance to etiquette, and she would not hesitate to lecture other people of high-rank about their offspring's public behavior. She also had a very strict idea of the proper dress code for a self-respecting woman."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Princess Leia's three dowager aunts were first mentioned in Children of the Jedi, is a 1995 novel written by Barbara Hambly.
