The original Wraith Squadron was largely made up of wash-outs and misfits, which gave the unit a number of psychologically and emotionally unstable pilots, albeit experienced members of the military with useful commando skills. The Wraiths were designed to fulfill the mission responsibilities of both a traditional starfighter squadron and a commando unit\u2014a revolutionary concept in tactics for the New Republic, and one that its founder felt was an essential development for the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wraiths first saw action against Admiral Apwar Trigit, which resulted in the destruction of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Implacable and the death of Trigit following a prolonged campaign that started with the Wraiths' seizure of the modified Corellian corvette Night Caller. Following Trigit's demise in the Battle of Ession, they continued to mount a number of often unorthodox covert operations against Warlord Zsinj. At one point, members of Wraith Squadron posed as a pirate group in an attempt to become employed by Zsinj. They were successful in that aim, which allowed them to assist in the destruction of the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Razor's Kiss. During this time, Garik Loran assumed command of Wraith Squadron from Wedge Antilles. Afterward, they returned to more normal fleet service in a lengthy campaign against Zsinj, culminating in the Battle of Selaggis, an engagement made possible by a double agent from Wraith Squadron who was stationed aboard Zsinj's flagship, the Iron Fist. At Selaggis, the Wraiths helped scatter Zsinj's forces, believing they had destroyed the Iron Fist and largely defeated Zsinj himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their success was such that the unit was then moved from Starfighter Command to the New Republic Intelligence Service, undertaking missions such as the elimination of Imperial admiral Kosh Teradoc in 13 ABY. Wraith Squadron continued to play a vital, if unique role in the military into the Yuuzhan Vong War, during which its members jammed yammosk war coordinators, flew covert missions behind enemy lines, crafted a psychological campaign by helping Jaina Solo impersonate a Yuuzhan Vong deity, and infiltrated Coruscant. After the New Republic government transitioned into the Galactic Alliance, the Wraiths served the reformed government through the Swarm War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Second Galactic Civil War, the Wraiths were viewed with suspicion by the new Daala administration and disbanded. However, Daala's ousting in 43 ABY by the Jedi Order gave the Wraiths a new chance at life when former commander Garik Loran was asked by the head of Galactic Alliance Security, Borath Maddeus, to investigate the chief of the Galactic Alliance Army, General Stavin Thaal, for treason. Loran unofficially assembled two Wraith Squadron teams led by unit veterans, one under Bhindi Drayson and another under Sharr Latt, and kept them isolated from each other. The two units separately discovered evidence of Thaal's duplicity while Loran was also able to implicate Maddeus as a co-conspirator with Thaal. Following Thaal's and Maddeus's exposure, Loran was promoted to head of Galactic Alliance Security and unofficially reinstated Wraith Squadron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Conception and training"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Initial proposal"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the conclusion of the Bacta War, wherein Rogue Squadron had undertaken an independent guerrilla war to overthrow Imperial Intelligence Director Ysanne Isard's regime on the world of Thyferra, Commander Wedge Antilles and Rogue Squadron returned to the galactic capital Coruscant and New Republic Defense Force service, with each member of the squadron reinstated to their former positions. However, Antilles's experiences in both the liberation of Coruscant and the Battle of Thyferra had impressed upon him the need of a new starfighter unit with different tactics. In a meeting with Admiral Gial Ackbar scheduled by Antilles, the veteran starfighter pilot outlined his idea for a new type of unit: a squadron that would be equally adept at commando-type missions on the ground as well as starfighter missions in space. Antilles wanted the pilots in the new unit to have a full range of intrusion and subversion skills, as well as the equipment needed to pull off planetside missions rather than having to call in another unit to deal with a problem on the ground. Antilles also hoped that the commando/pilot squadron would formulate new tactics and methods for conducting military operations, providing what he saw as a necessary tactical innovation for the New Republic military."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An ersatz Rogue Squadron had been formed for public-relations purposes, complete with their own X-wing fighters, but Ackbar planned on disbanding the unit and returning the pilots and fighters to their prior assignments, since the returning Rogues had their own craft already. However, Antilles told Ackbar that his Rogues would be happy to sign their personal starfighters, which they had used as private property during the Bacta War, back over to the New Republic only if the next dozen fighters sent to the military were issued to his new unit. Ackbar was less than thrilled with that idea, citing personnel expenses, but in turn, Antilles told Ackbar that he wanted experienced pilots with a wide variety of skills, but also he wanted pilots that no one else wanted. Antilles sought to recruit pilots that few other commanders would want, pilots known for causing trouble or making grave mistakes. Ackbar was incredulous and noted that Antilles was more likely to be killed by malcontent pilots than form an effective unit. Antilles was willing to face that risk, though, stating that Rogue Squadron's executive officer, Captain Tycho Celchu was qualified to lead the Rogues in his absence. Unable to find another way to derail the persistent X-wing pilot, Ackbar granted Antilles's request on the condition that if\u2014in Ackbar's sole evaluation\u2014the unit had not proved its worth, Antilles would accept a promotion to general and join Ackbar's staff. As Antilles detested the notion of ever serving a staff job, that was a significant career decision. However, he was committed to the idea of a new commando/pilot unit and accepted Ackbar's challenge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Ackbar's approval, Antilles took another Rogue Squadron veteran, Lieutenant Wes Janson, as his executive officer and set about making plans to form his new squadron. Departing from Ackbar's flagship, Home One, with Janson, he set out for Folor Base on the Commenorian moon of Folor, where the new unit would train. Before they left Home One, Janson was assigned the task of finding pilot candidates and seeing if they were open to permanent assignment to a new squadron; those that agreed would be sent to the base without being informed of their destination."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Folor Base"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Antilles, however, met more official opposition to the new squadron, this time from the commander of Folor Base, General Edor Crespin. Crespin viewed a squadron of misfits as poor representatives of the New Republic. Antilles pointed out that if he was successful, the pilots would be hailed as unlikely heroes and provide a broader definition of the defenders of the New Republic than merely hologenic pilots with clean backgrounds. Crespin eventually acknowledged that Antilles had permission to carry on with his experiment, though it was expected to fail miserably. The general also reminded Antilles of the need for increased security, as Folor Base was near the border of Warlord Zsinj's territory and therefore a possible target for a raid by the warlord's forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Antilles's next task was to sort through the motley assortment of pilot candidates that had been gathered to the barren moon. Janson indulged in some needling, telling Antilles that one of the pilots was an Ewok named Kettch. Ironically, the fictional Kettch was to prove crucial in later months. The candidate group of forty-three was varied, ranging from Flight Officer Falynn Sandskimmer, a Human female from Tatooine, to Flight Officer Voort saBinring, a Gamorrean male who had been biologically modified to have a greatly enhanced mathematical acumen and piloting abilities. When Antilles had asked for pilots facing court-martial, his request had been granted, as the lineup included a kleptomaniac candidate who stole a small hologram from his desk and a mentally unstable Talz pilot. Another pilot that was entered into the ranks of candidates was Lieutenant Myn Donos, a former sniper and the only survivor of an ambush over Gravan Seven that had destroyed Talon Squadron, which had been trained by Janson and veteran Rogue pilot Captain Derek Klivian. The last pilot candidate to go through the initial interview process was Flight officer Kell Tainer, a talented man who was cross-trained in mechanical skills, unarmed combat, piloting, and demolitions. However, what Antilles and Janson were unaware of was that Tainer was the son of a Rebel pilot that Janson had killed. Many years earlier, the pilot, Kissek Doran, had been in the same squadron as Janson. Doran had panicked and fled the battlefield in his BTL Y-wing starfighter, which would have compromised the upcoming strike mission. Janson was forced to use his lasers and shoot the pilot down for the sake of the mission, and Doran's son, Tainer, had hated Janson ever since. Antilles and Janson were both aware of the considerable talents that Tainer would bring to the unit, so Antilles allowed him to proceed further into the evaluation provisionally, though both the squadron leader and executive officer would be keeping a close eye on the bitter pilot candidate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the first drills that the pilot candidates endured was a simulator mission to protect launching transports from oncoming TIE/LN starfighters and TIE interceptors that were screening a capital ship. However, Janson added new dimensions to the scenario including the addition of an ambush by Imperial fighters and the stipulation that the kills scored by each pilot were given to their wingmate. In response to the adjusted conditions, Kell Tainer, Thakwaash Flight Officer Hohass \"Runt\" Ekwesh, Voort saBinring, and and Human Flight Officer Tyria Sarkin engaged the fighters, and then jumped to hyperspace once the fighters were defeated, which marked the end of the exercise. Ekwesh was recorded as destroyed in the exercise, as he had gone off on his own and disregarded all tactics and strategy. However, the changed protocol meant that Tainer, who had scored five kills, would actually receive Ekwesh's zero kills. Tainer fumed at the perceived injustice, which he blamed on Janson's personal distaste for him. Later, Ekwesh revealed to Tainer that his species had multiple minds or personalities, and his pilot mind had been known to make mistakes in the past. That would prove to be an initial obstacle for both Tainer and Ekwesh to overcome. Other pilots who experienced the switched and altered scenario were a Human cyborg Flight Officer Ton Phanan, a former medic, and Flight Officer Garik \"Face\" Loran, who was once a famous holodrama star in his youth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next scenario experienced by the squadron was a simulator run that involved an ambush of TIE Interceptors over a volcanic moon that was a simulation of the destruction of Talon Squadron. As such, Donos was not required to participate in that scenario, as he was still recovering from the destruction of his squadron and had actually been at the real engagement. Following that was another simulated mission where the pilot candidates were assigned to defend a space station from starfighter attack. In this mission, Tainer was finally able to get across the idea of flying as a team to Ekwesh by threatening to target his craft if he did not obey orders. With such a forceful means of getting his attention, Ekwesh reined in his pilot mind, and as a result, they both scored higher on the scenario, even though Antilles destroyed Tainer in simulated combat."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Forming the squadron"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly thereafter, Antilles announced the final unit roster. Ten candidates had been selected by Antilles and Janson to form the new squadron. Temporarily designating the squadron as \"Gray Squadron,\" the initial roster comprised Antilles, Janson, Donos, Tainer, Loran, Sandskimmer, Phanan, a Mon Calamari communications specialist named Jesmin Ackbar, saBinring, Ekwesh, the Bothan slicer Eurrsk Thri'ag, and Sarkin. Each member had a specific skill set that they brought to the unit, ranging from sniper skills, to intrusion, to slicing, to medical expertise. One pilot, Tyria Sarkin, also had a limited amount of untrained sensitivity to the Force. In terms of squadron organization, the unit was divided into three flights. One Flight was led by Antilles directly, Two Flight was led by Tainer, and Three Flight was led by Janson."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the unit was being formed, the first batch of four new X-wings arrived, and Tainer, along with unit mechanic Cubber Daine, was assigned to examine them and ensure that they were combat-ready. After significant amounts of work to bring them up to operational standards, the squadron's fighters were finally ready for use. As the fighters were brought up to full readiness, the Millennium Falcon, flown by General Han Solo, arrived on Folor Base. The famous general had arrived with orders from Coruscant and was warmly greeted by his old friend, Wedge Antilles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the new squadron continued training, with Janson and Antilles adding new surprises such as the failure of all targeting sensors in a strafing drill to keep the pilots on their toes. Tainer did not do well in the drill and continued to blame his series of bad luck on Janson's supposed quest for vengeance against him, a continuation of the events that had led to the death of his father. However, his wingmate, Ekwesh, was finally able to convince Tainer that his single-minded determination and obsession with success was harmful to him, and that he should spend some time relating with the other pilots. The squadron was already beginning to develop camaraderie and friendship outside of their training, usually at DownTime, a tapcafe on base, while continuing to hone their skills. A running topic for the new squadron was the subject of practical jokes, which would soon become a favorite pastime. Given the eclectic nature and motley composition of the elite commando-pilot group, unusual entertainment preferences were unsurprising to Antilles."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Surprise attack"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unbeknownst to the Rebels, Imperial Admiral Apwar Trigit, an ally of Warlord Zsinj, through his Project Morrt\u2014a plan using parasitic spy drones distributed and assigned to latch onto New Republic vehicles\u2014learned the location of Folor Base. With the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Implacable, Trigit planned a raid on the base to deny its use to the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the emotional dynamics of the squadron continued to develop. On one occasion, Tainer shared his attraction to Tyria Sarkin, but she rejected him outright. He was also the victim of a practical joke that involved a wriggling mass falling out of a locker onto him when he opened it. Also during this time, Falynn Sandskimmer challenged Antilles' prowess as a pilot after Janson pronounced that Antilles was the best starfighter pilot living. Bemused, Antilles challenged Sandskimmer to a race in a pair of repulsorlift ore haulers down the Pig Trough, a local canyon on Folor. The race, though close, was decided at the last instant by Antilles, who brought his hauler down on top of hers, pushing him ahead to cross the marker first. When she complained that he cheated, he merely reminded her of the futility of that complaint had the contest been a starfighter duel with an Imperial pilot. During this period, the squadron also received its name, courtesy of Sarkin: \"Wraith Squadron.\" According to Sarkin, wraiths were creatures that were used as frightening images in children's stories and equated the unit as phantoms or monsters waiting in the dark to attack the Empire or Imperial warlords. Additionally, the squadron received its supply officer, a cantankerous protocol droid named Squeaky. Most of the pilots were familiar with the droid from when it had been a waiter at the local tapcafe, where it was known for its ubiquitous rudeness and lack of service."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on a routine hyperspace navigation training mission to the Inner Rim star Doldrums, Jesmin Ackbar, the squadron communications specialist, detected a tight-beam Imperial transmission in the vicinity. After some quick analysis and deduction by the squadron, the pilots determined that the transmission was originating from the Implacable. Scrambling back to Folor, the Wraiths prepared to defend the base while the personnel evacuated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Implacable approached, the fighters remained grounded at the base while the facility's transports were loaded. The Imperials launched their first strike on an abandoned mining outpost rigged to emit signal transmissions, and the New Republic forces, on the far side of the moon, began powering up their engines in preparation for evacuation. While the transport Bright Nebula launched without problems, the Borleias sustained an engine malfunction. To buy the craft time to escape, General Crespin, personally leading Blue Squadron in his A-wing, ordered the Wraiths and Blues to delay the Imperial assault force. Antilles and Crespin dispatched two pilots from each of their units to hide in the Pig Trough ahead of the others with their engines powered down. When the Imperials flew over, they would activate their fighters and ambush them. Tainer and Ekwesh of Wraith Squadron and Dorset Konnair and Tetengo Noor of Blue Squadron were assigned this duty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After racing to land in their ambush position, the four advance pilots soon spotted the formation of TIEs inbound to Folor Base and relayed that information to their superiors. However, Tainer also noticed the advancing Implacable, which the New Republic starfighters would be hard-pressed to delay even momentarily in the midst of a dogfight with its TIEs. In order to stall Trigit's capital ship, Tainer and the other pilots used older encryption codes and made a crude simulacrum of the Millennium Falcon by pretending to be Han Solo and Leia Organa, and crowding their shields to give the four fighters an erratic shield signature that bore some resemblance to the famous freighter and an escorting wing-pair of \"Rogue Squadron\" fighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the same time, the rest of Blue Squadron and Wraith Squadron engaged the TIEs, scoring at least twenty-one kills on the opposing fighters, though with the loss of two A-wings from Blue Squadron. Trigit's Implacable abruptly changed course, though, when an intelligence analyst aboard the ship, Gara Petothel, discovered the ersatz Millennium Falcon. Trigit commenced pursuit of the vessel, intent on capturing the famous Princess and Solo. He was quickly disappointed, though, when the four pilots emerged from the canyon, revealing the deception. His irritation increased when he discovered that the Borleias had also managed to escape due to his wild bantha chase. The remaining Imperial fighters then withdrew as the New Republic forces made their way into hyperspace. Tainer, Ekwesh, and their Blue Squadron partners also made their escape, evading the Implacable's fire long enough to plot a course into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Lunatic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the squadron was reunited, along with the shuttle Narra, piloted by Cubber Daine and Squeaky, the Wraiths made another jump into hyperspace to Doldrums, where they would rendezvous with the other evacuees. However, en route to Doldrums, they were pulled out of hyperspace near the Xobome system by an empion mine laid by one of Trigit's support vessels. As they reverted, every vessel was hit by a powerful ion pulse that scrambled the systems and astromech droids of their craft, to varying degrees. Antilles knew that they were low on fuel and with the ion surge having erased their navigation computer calculations, jumping back into hyperspace was not feasible. Instead, he ordered most of them to take their craft to the uninhabited, frigid world of Xobome 6 to effect repairs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, three of the fighters were completely inoperable, so Antilles, Tainer, and Daine, along with the pilots of the damaged craft, remained behind\u2014about half of the squadron. Being trained in both mechanics and demolitions, Tainer found himself on demand in both professions. Based on his experience, Tainer surmised that the weapon that hit them consisted of an ion projector, electromagnetic pulse generator, sensor array, communications system, and gravity pulse emitter, which would detect ships reverting from hyperspace, pull them out, hit them with ion energy, and alert the ship that laid the mine. Antilles agreed with the assessment, realizing that a support vessel would be inbound. Even as Tainer and Daine worked on Thri'ag's fighter, Tainer received a call from Myn Donos, reporting that his astromech, Shiner, was offline. Donos viewed Shiner as the last member of Talon Squadron and felt a psychological need to keep the droid \"alive\" and active. Tainer was able to help him restart the droid even while he worked on the starfighters; he and Daine soon had two of the three disabled fighters flyable. However, Ton Phanan's X-wing was a loss. In response to the Wraiths' situation and threat of an incoming vessel, Phanan proposed placing a pilot in his fighter to disable, board, and capture the pursuing vessel when the X-wing was seized."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Antilles was at first incredulous, but as the plan took shape and the pilots answered all his objections to the idea, a crude vessel, dubbed the Lunatic, was built as a more effective insertion vehicle than Phanan's disabled X-wing, with Antilles' somewhat reluctant approval. It was a converted smuggling compartment from the shuttle Narra with makeshift thrusters, a chopped-down laser cannon, and an astromech droid to help steer it, and was designed to allow an intruder to gain access to an enemy vessel. Based on his physiology, which would insulate him from the cold of space, Voort saBinring volunteered to pilot the ungainly craft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the rest of the fighters finally repaired on Xobome 6 and equipped with a fake distress call made by Loran, the Wraiths' desperate plan was set. While they waited, Cubber Daine and Tainer realized that there were out-of-place attachments on both the Narra and Phanan's fighter. However, before they could investigate the devices, Imperial signals were detected. SaBinring was hastily loaded into the Lunatic and launched, in hopes of finding prey to board, while the rest of the Wraiths waited in a nearby asteroid field."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial vessel turned out to be a modified Corellian corvette. The warship pulled the Lunatic into its hold, and saBinring burst out of the compartment with his blaster pistol at the ready. However, a pair of stormtroopers were waiting for him. Using a docked TIE Fighter as a shield, he shot both of them with his pistol and then fired the Lunatic's chopped-off laser cannon into the hold ceiling. After the bolt tore through the ship, saBinring climbed up one level into the bridge and demanded the surrender of the crew, which he received. The rest of the Wraiths dealt with the pair of TIE Fighters that the corvette had launched, afterward boarding and capturing the craft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Landing their prize on Xobome 6 to investigate it, the Wraiths found that the vessel's design had been extensively modified from a standard corvette, with increased starfighter-carrying capacity, among other features. Furthermore, the unit slicer, Thri'ag, was able to gain access into the ship's mainframes with little trouble; saBinring's quick capture of the ship had meant that the crew had no chance to wipe its memory or activate security protocols. This led to him discovering the ship's ties to Warlord Zsinj, as well as its complete itinerary. Also, Tainer and Daine were able to pull off the incongruous attachment on the Narra and learned that it was a tracking droid of some type, one of which had led Trigit to Folor Base."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Night Caller charade"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Now that they had transportation, Antilles decided that they could impersonate the crew of the vessel and carry out its missions while engaging in covert acts of sabotage using Night Caller. Taking the initiative, he led the starfighters and the corvette on its planned schedule, which was first to recover unexploded empion mines. With the Wraiths aboard, Antilles hoped to both uncover valuable intelligence and cause harm to Zsinj's war effort."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Wraiths became accustomed to their new base of operations, Jesmin Ackbar discovered that the ship's former captain, Zurel Darillian, who had been incinerated by saBinring's laser cannon blast, had recorded his diary in full holo. The Wraiths would later use this to help Loran impersonate Darillian with the use of a holographic overlay."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the X-wings stored in the holds on Night Caller and the pilots operating in shifts between manning the corvette and flying the X-wings, they retrieved the three undetonated empion mines laid by Night Caller as scheduled and made some modifications to the corvette, chief among them being an adaptation suggested by Tainer to let them store the pair of TIE Fighters that were on the ship in the escape pod hatches. The end result was that the corvette could safely store eleven X-wings and a pair of TIE Fighters. Antilles, pleased, prepared to commence the next part of the impersonation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On their first stop, Night Caller arrived at the small agricultural world of Viamarr 4. Following the mission profile stored in the ship's databanks, Antilles and Sandskimmer took the two captured TIEs down to inspect the rural and undeveloped world, particularly its capital of Velery. The mission was fairly uneventful, aside from a pair of local Z-95 Headhunters attempting to challenge them before the two locals were ordered to return to base by their superiors. However, Night Caller was then contacted by the Velery planetary authority, Governor Watesk, who alluded to some secret negotiations that were not in the mission profile. Loran quickly rigged a disguise and pretended to be \"Lieutenant Narol,\" a bridge officer on Night Caller. Using his skills as an actor, Loran was able to get an idea of what Velery's governor had previously negotiated with Zsinj via Darillian. Apparently, Zsinj had arranged to buy land and exports from Velery under a pseudonym in exchange for protecting the agrarian world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After leaving Viamarr 4, Night Caller journeyed to the rendezvous point at Doldrums, only to find that Admiral Ackbar's Home One was there waiting for them. The Mon Calamari admiral announced that the squadron was fully operational. While they did not receive a replacement for Phanan's ruined starfighter, they did receive additional equipment, including an X-wing simulator and a crew complement to take over running the ship. The Imperial prisoners were also offloaded at this time. After witnessing a holographic overlay of the late Captain Darillian for Loran to use in impersonating the captain, Ackbar approved Antilles' plan to use the corvette in a massive deception."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the crew and pilots settled into their new routine and performance, Tainer, Thri'ag, and Phanan went to encourage Tyria Sarkin, who had been working obsessively to improve her piloting, to relax. When Thri'ag, the unit slicer, made a joke about improving her scores by altering the data, Sarkin reacted negatively and attacked the Bothan slicer. Just as Tainer and Phanan pulled Sarkin away from Thri'ag, Janson and Antilles entered the pilots' mess. Antilles, furious, placed Sarkin on report after she refused to explain her actions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Phanan and Tainer went to discuss the incident with Sarkin, who reluctantly told them about how she had been blackmailed into keeping silent about a starfighter theft scam during her academy training. Sarkin had been close to failing her training when a corrupt colonel named Atton Repness had tried to get her to allow him to sell a starfighter in exchange for boosted scores. Sarkin confronted him, but Repness had stalled for time so he could make accusations of his own against her. Rather than wash out of training, Sarkin had accepted a reprimand from the colonel after agreeing to keep silent about the scheme, and she graduated at the bottom of her class. The guilt had plagued her since then, and Thri'ag's jesting suggestion had been enough to drive her over the edge. After hearing her story, Tainer and Phanan took Sarkin's secret into their confidence, as it would spell the end of her career."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Continuing with their missions, the Wraiths next took Night Caller to the Outer Rim world of Xartun. Loran, disguised as a naval lieutenant, journeyed down to the surface to meet with the governor, Nojin Koolb. The other Wraiths infiltrated the surface separately, awaiting Loran's data. Loran received a tour of a secret transparisteel manufacturing facility in an underground bunker. Before he, accompanied by Daine in the Narra, returned to the waiting zone, Loran sent the other Wraiths holographic data of his tour, as the majority of the squadron, led by Tainer, waited to launch a sabotage mission. While they waited for nightfall, Thri'ag discovered that there was an extra layer of security present in the complex. Jesmin Ackbar had recorded the earlier transmission from Loran that showed the security code sequence being entered, allowing them to bypass the alarm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wraiths easily penetrated the bunker's security and discovered an additional level to the facility that contained finished transparisteel products. Thri'ag transferred all the data in the operations console from the facility, but then the mission ran into a snag. Two Imperial probe droids located and attacked the intrusion team. Realizing that they were compromised, Tainer destroyed both of the droids with his explosives, after Antilles distracted one to allow Tainer to plant his charge, and Sarkin pinned the second one in place with a loaded cart of transparisteel windows."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Tainer finished planting charges to destroy the facility, Janson, saBinring, and Sandskimmer, left waiting in the upper hangar, came under attack by about thirty local militia troops, accompanied by a pair of TIE Fighters.

Realizing it was time for their egress, the Wraiths remotely piloted a decoy landspeeder out to lure many of the troops away from the hangar. While their adversaries were distracted, the Wraiths piled aboard a cargo skiff and charged out toward the nearly grounded pair of TIE Fighters. Sandskimmer rammed the first fighter, sending it temporarily out of control, while Antilles and Tainer grabbed the two fighters with the skiff's load lifter electromagnets. Dragging the fighters along, Sandskimmer brought the skiff outside of the hangar, gained some altitude, and then dropped the fighters into the forest below, tumbling to their destruction. As the facility exploded from Tainer's charges, the Wraiths returned to the Narra and then from there back to Night Caller."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Based on their findings, the Wraiths concluded that Zsinj was forming a cell-type underground financial empire to funnel funds and mat\u00e9riel to his war effort. In exchange for these businesses and profits, Zsinj provided the governors with technology and weapons. Another anomaly they analyzed was a group of cube-shaped cells that had been in the Xartun complex. saBinring informed the squadron that they were habitation cells, such as the one he had grown up in at Binring Biomedical. Antilles decided that they would continue to get in touch with Zsinj's planetary governor associates in an attempt to determine what collaborations Zsinj had set up. Then, after any connections had been ferreted out via Loran's interactions or Thri'ag's slicing, the Wraiths would attempt to destroy or sabotage Zsinj's business, though only after Night Caller had already left the system, so the vessel could not be blamed for the sabotage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Belthu was their next stop. On that world, the Wraiths, courtesy of Loran, learned of a durasteel production foundry controlled by Zsinj.

The loss of Shiner, who was in Donos's perception the last remaining member of Talon Squadron, rendered him psychologically incapable of anything but simple flight. As Ackbar plummeted toward the surface of the moon, Tainer attempted a maneuver by which he used the hull of his starfighter to nudge her craft back up into a trajectory away from the moon.

During their boarding, they advised the shaken Captain Rhanken that while they were reasonable businessmen with no desire for fatalities, they also were short-tempered, and resistance would be dealt with harshly. With that threat leveled, the Wraiths received no resistance from any of the crew. Before leaving, they broadcast an emergency signal so the crew could be rescued."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after their first raid, the Wraiths again struck Barderia, as Donn had obtained the ship's listing of destinations on their first raid and had correctly anticipated which location Rhanken would journey to next. Rhanken was even less than pleased to see them than the first time, but once again was forced to surrender a large portion of his cargo\u2014including replacement parts for their stolen TIE interceptors\u2014to the Wraiths. Eventually, though, eight of the Wraiths in X-wings returned to Mon Remonda for at least one mission, in order to maintain the illusion that the squadron was still stationed on the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser with the rest of Han Solo's anti-Zsinj task force. Remaining behind to continue the Hawk-bat illusion were Donn, Phanan, Tainer, and Ekwesh. Exploiting a gap in Halmad's sensor coverage, the four pilots strafed a marina filled with expensive pleasure vessels and also robbed a bank. Also, thanks to Donn's skills, the pilots were able to obtain sensor and satellite feeds from the planet and discreetly route them to inform the Wraiths if there was an incoming ship or attack. By the time Antilles and the rest of the squadron returned, the four pirates had done quite well for themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the eight Wraiths who flew to Mon Remonda in their X-wings, the agenda was quite different. After analysis of how the task force centered around Mon Remonda had been responding to various moves of Zsinj, Nelprin concluded the responses were all too predictable, which would eventually result in a trap being laid by Zsinj. Instead, Antilles and Solo worked to incorporate Wraith and Rogue Squadrons in a more unconventional response on the industrial world of Lavisar, which had a large presence of Zsinj's elite forces, known as Raptors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Also, by the time they arrived on Mon Remonda, the sting operation involving Notsil had been concluded. As planned, Notsil had entered training and done her best to stay below desired levels of performance. While she at times maintained the emotional detachment desirable on a mission for Imperial Intelligence, Notsil eventually developed some camaraderie for some of her fellow pilot candidates. Just as expected, she was approached by Repness, who told her that in exchange for graduating as a pilot, she could help him steal an A-wing fighter which he would sell on the black market. Although Repness carried a device that was supposed to block anyone monitoring their conversation, he did not know that Notsil had already broken into his quarters and altered his device to record the conversation instead. Furthermore, she had sliced into his records and obtained the names of all his contacts in the black market ring. During their conversation, however, she feigned reluctant cooperation. After she had concluded her talk with Repness, she took the recording from the device and the files that she had obtained and anonymously sent them to New Republic Intelligence. Knowing that Repness's downfall was imminent, she confronted him, but was surprised when the irate officer assaulted her and knocked her unconscious until he could deal with her later. However, New Republic Intelligence acted first, arresting Repness and rescuing Notsil, who then requested an opportunity to show her true merit as a pilot. Given a second chance, she showed considerable ability in the cockpit of an X-wing and not only did she graduate, but she was accepted into Wraith Squadron; even though its ranks were full, she joined the squadron on Mon Remonda shortly before the raid on Lavisar, using the X-wing that had previously belonged to Repness. However, her own loyalties to Zsinj remained secret and she discreetly notified the warlord of her placement in Wraith Squadron. After Notsil was welcomed into the squadron, though, Sarkin approached Antilles and revealed how she had been blackmailed into protecting Repness. In response, Antilles asked her if she would ever bow to Repness again if he approached her and she said she would not. With that, Antilles placed her under direct orders not to speak about her involvement in the scheme before he had been notified. To protect Sarkin, Antilles decided to fabricate a story where he had learned about her unwilling involvement in Repness's scheme and assigned Phanan and Loran to find someone as bait to bring down Repness.

To vary the response, they decided to use a dud of a bomb in the assault on the sensor station but launch the starfighters as planned. Then, when fighters from Lavisar launched to defend their world, the New Republic craft would turn tail and run. Later, the team that had planted the fake bomb would approach Carmal, the planetary governor, and inform him that he had been set up by Zsinj to take the New Republic hit, hopefully persuading him to join the New Republic or at least not ally himself with Zsinj.

The Wraiths engaged the lunar garrison in a swift melee, eliminating all but five of the dozen TIE fighters and all of the accompanying Lambda-class shuttles before they left. During the engagement, Notsil had the opportunity to eliminate Antilles, but decided not to, as she felt the attack would be treacherous. Instead, she protected Antilles and even shot down one of the Imperial fighters. After the lunar garrison was defeated, the Wraiths withdrew, having sustained only minor damage to some of their fighters.

Thoroughly angry at Zsinj for shattering the existence she was trying to make as Notsil, she went to a remote area of Hawk-bat Base and had an emotional outburst. Eventually, she considered her options, concluding she had no desire to return to Zsinj's or Imperial employ but that confessing everything to Antilles would only result in her being expelled from the squadron she had come to value.

Furthermore, a massive capital ship, later determined to be Zsinj's flagship, Iron Fist, began using tractor beams on Bastion, hauling it in. The Wraiths immediately aborted their mission. The starfighter group engaged the hostile fighters briefly, and then retreated, destroying numerous TIE fighters and interceptors. However, in the frantic retreat, Phanan was shot down. The Wraiths in Bastion ordered Sarkin and saBinring away and prepared to launch in the Narra.

While it was not the great success Loran had hoped it would be, Antilles commended his pilots on their invention and encouraged them to develop it further."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, their leave was soon to end, as Mon Remonda was returning to space to battle Zsinj's forces and the Wraiths were officially stationed onboard the cruiser, despite conducting numerous detached missions.

Antilles also introduced Elassar Targon, a medical corpsman and the newest member of the unit. Finally, Loran was promoted to brevet captain and placed in charge of Wraith Squadron, as Antilles was returning to Rogue Squadron while acting as overall commander of all four squadrons stationed aboard Mon Remonda. The Wraiths spent their last few hours of leave in various ways. A group of them, including Donos, Loran, Targon, Notsil, and Passik, went to see the Galactic Museum's new display on Old Republic and Imperial Intelligence.

As Solo's fleet arrived and deployed its starfighters in a search-and-rescue operation, Zsinj dropped three groups of his fleet, including Iron Fist, into the system to engage Solo's fleet. In response, Solo blasted straight at Zsinj's main group, seeking to fly through Zsinj's ships and withdraw from the engagement. The Wraiths and Rogues were ordered to escort Nova Squadron to attack Iron Fist, while the A-wings assisted in engaging Zsinj's fighters. The three squadrons damaged Iron Fist's portside engines with proton torpedoes, and while the Novas continued to use their ion cannons on the Star Dreadnought, the Wraiths set about dealing with one of the two Carrack-class cruisers that Zsinj had in his main group. Expending the last of their torpedoes, they damaged the vessel badly as Rogue Squadron gave the same treatment to another cruiser. Janson was hit by an ion cannon during the attack run, but a shuttle from Mon Remonda was able to retrieve him. The Wraiths, along with Solo's other starfighters, then returned to Mon Remonda. With another Mon Calamari cruiser in close formation, Mon Remonda was able to shrug off the brief exchange of fire between it and Iron Fist before Solo's fleet fled to hyperspace.

That the warlord had determined their pattern of response and had enough forces readily available to directly engage Solo's fleet was disturbing. In response, Rogue pilot Inyri Forge suggested using Solo\u2014or more accurately, a fake Millennium Falcon\u2014as bait for Zsinj, as the two had become personal enemies. To the pilots' surprise, Solo was not only present in the pilots' lounge as this discussion was taking place, but liked the idea and authorized it.

Setting down in a remote location, the Rogues remained with their fighters while the Wraiths made their way toward the city. There was a brief period in between landing and the Wraiths' approach on Lurark, and Donos took that opportunity to express his attraction to Notsil. Little did Donos know that Notsil had aided in the destruction of his previous command in her previous identity as Petothel, back when she served in Imperial Intelligence. Nevertheless, he felt strongly towards her and she reciprocated, to some extent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To gain access to Lurark, the Wraiths had one of their number lie down on a road. As a passing civilian speeder slowed to a stop to investigate, they emerged from behind cover and seized it for use as transport to get them into Lurark. They quickly located the Binring Biomedical facility, a sprawling complex at least two square kilometers in area, and spent most of the day observing it discreetly. In the afternoon, Loran, Janson, Notsil, Donos, Nelprin, Tainer, and Sarkin met at a local tapcafe to discuss their results and between them narrowed down which entrance was a likely location for Zsinj's special facility within the compound. Notsil pointed out that the areas she specified lacked power meters, meaning they had their own generators to supply power. Janson's criterion for eliminating several of the sites Notsil had mentioned were that most of them were not defensible and were too obvious as locations to house a secret facility. As the first two Wraiths' analyses had eliminated all but two entrances, Nelprin slimmed down the list even more by pointing out that one entrance, on the east side of the complex, opened onto a major thoroughfare and looked more like a private entrance for executives based on the speeder traffic in and out of it. Sarkin confirmed that the one remaining entrance, on the northwest side of the complex, loading area two, was the proper location. When asked how she determined that, she explained that it had been a sensation in the Force.

They approached the ground level and quickly detected both a set of holocams and a gap in their coverage. However, Sarkin informed them that there was a redundant, harder to detect layer of surveillance pointed at the gap, based on her Force senses. Rather than risk walking into a trap, Loran opted for an alternate approach. Scaling a nearby rooftop, the Wraiths used a small projectile cannon to fire a grapple connected to a fibra-rope at the roof of the Binring facility.

While Notsil was laying down markers, Targon located a second, hidden layer of security that had been laid down in the roof, in the form of pressure sensors.

As it did, the floor and ceiling began to ignite, and the Wraiths knew they would all be burned to death in a short amount of time.

Under fire, the stormtroopers charged the two Wraiths on the roof, and Notsil and Targon were forced to withdraw.

Knowing that she could not risk compromising the Hawk-bats, Nelprin rushed at Netbers, and the Wraiths followed. The foolhardiness of their maneuver caught the stormtroopers by surprise, allowing the Wraiths to quickly take them down, though Janson sustained a blaster graze after single-handedly killing five stormtroopers. Although Nelprin attempted to fire at Netbers, her blaster malfunctioned, leaving her to face him unarmed. Already injured, she was quickly knocked to the floor by Netbers. However, Ekwesh grabbed Netbers and slammed him into a wall with enough force to break his neck, killing the man and preserving the Hawk-bats' secret. As the stormtroopers withdrew in the face of the Wraiths' fire, the Wraiths managed to capture the civilian, Doctor Edda Gast, one of the scientists behind Zsinj's work at Binring Biomedical. Gast, knowing Zsinj would execute her for her failure, was cooperative and showed them through access tunnels that gave them an escape route.

Loran stated that the Wraiths had entered an environment specifically fashioned to kill them and all of them had emerged alive, which he saw as an impressive statement not only to the unit's deadliness, but also the fact that they were enough of a threat to merit such a response from Zsinj.

Konnair flew cover for the Millennium Falsehood until the rest of the Wraiths arrived, while the remainder of the fake construction, which was actually a bomb, slammed into the Reprisal, leaving it vulnerable to a coordinated volley of proton torpedoes by Wraith Squadron. The fourteen torpedoes were too much for the ship to absorb, and the Dreadnaught broke up, even as the Wraiths continued to sow heavy casualties among the two squadrons of TIEs until the Millennium Falsehood was clear.
