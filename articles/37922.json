Later, she would confide to squadron mates that she partially resented other Twi'leks for betraying her to slavers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fiercely intelligent and cunning, Passik learned to fly starfighters and other spacegoing craft by enticing mercenary pilots to instruct her. After sufficient practice, Passik stole a shuttlecraft and (after overriding the shield controls) shot down the Violet Hem- her first combat action."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She eventually made her way to New Republic space, joining Wraith Squadron in 7 ABY. She replaced Falynn Sandskimmer as the Wraiths' vehicle specialist, and was very knowledgeable of various criminal organizations. During the Wraith's infiltration of Zsinj's operations, Passik posed as the pirate Captain Seku of the Hawk-bat Independent Space Force, alongside Kell Tainer, Garik Loran, and Shalla Nelprin. As a test of loyalty, Zsinj requested the ersatz pirates execute Wraith Castin Donn, who had sneaked aboard. Passik shot Donn's already-deceased body with a blaster, allowing the group to complete their infiltration. She later flew into a rage of grief and self-loathing over the action, nearly killing herself before being talked down by Garik Loran, who convinced her she saved his life in doing so."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Passik served honorably with the Wraiths and the Han Solo-led task force through the Zsinj campaign.
