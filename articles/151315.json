However, Karr discovered her plan and talked her out of it, sending Jedi Knights Ulldin and Zylixx in her place to wait for the Sith and end the threat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Sith boarded the ship, Ulldin and Zylixx stood ready. Ulldin warned the Warrior that he could not prevail against two Jedi Knights and demanded that the Sith surrender. Zylixx, however, expected the Warrior to engage them in battle, as all the Sith they had faced did. Rather than draw his lightsaber, the Warrior chose to goad Zylixx into giving into his anger and lash out, forcing Ulldin's hand. The two Knights engaged the Sith in a duel, but were easily defeated. Zylixx was the first to die when he was nearly close to the dark side, leaving Ulldin badly injured. Ulldin expressed shock at how his friend was unbalanced and at how the Sith was quickly able to goad him. The Warrior proclaimed the fate that awaited all Jedi was either to fall into darkness or to fall to a Sith's blade. Ulldin promised that Karr would prove those words false and readied himself for death and became one with the Force as the Wrath slew him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ulldin is a character in the 2011 Star Wars: The Old Republic in Chapter I of the Sith Warrior's storyline."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fate"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Depending on the player's choices, Ulldin's fate can be decided many different ways:"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
