The store was set up as a cover for Vengeance's mission to bring down Bothawui's planetary shield before a battle at Bothawui. The shop was near the planetary shield generator. In order to avoid too much attention, they kept polpians, which many Bothans were allergic to, in stock. They also sold mawkrens, which they used to destroy the shield generator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
