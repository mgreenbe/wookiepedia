Mant\u00edcore was well-considered by the critics, and it had two sequels, a mini-series and a one-shot. Bachs remembers well this work, saying that he learned much while doing it, and he would like to take the character again, some day."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After that, he would do some works for the Spanish market, including Yinn (four-part series for Laberinto) and its prequel, Castor y P\u00f3lux (one-shot for Dude), both written by Josep Mar\u00eda Polls.

However, Bachs usually complains because he is not provided with real material to base his work in, except for well-known books and a few images from ILM. Even as he had to work with the character of Quinlan Vos, he was not provided with the image of Vos in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace where Vos appears as a background character. Similarly, Bachs illustrated Starfighter: Crossbones, including many characters from the video-game Star Wars: Starfighter, but he was denied any access to the game."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He considers that Jedi Vs. Sith is his best Star Wars work and he usually says he would like to work again with Jedi Vs. Sith writer Darko Macan."}]}
