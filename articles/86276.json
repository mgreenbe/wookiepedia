Mander was able to use telekinesis, Force speed, and mind tricks, but was also susceptible to the latter, following his apprentice's suggestion to lower his blade. Juxtaposed to this weakness, he was very knowledgeable about mind tricks and how to counter them; with Empty Meditation. He wasn't the best at blast deflection, nor lightsaber dueling for that matter, being quickly disarmed by the inexperienced Mika the Hutt. Many even noted that he was not what they expected, when meeting him, further feeding his feelings of self-doubt. However, Mander was described as strong in the Force, and after he defeated Mika, erased his mental hang-ups and felt his former apprentice's blue lightsaber in his hand as an extension of his own."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
