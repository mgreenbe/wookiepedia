It also served as a prison and was where the Galactic Empire kept Mon Calamari King Lee-Char as a prisoner. Princess Leia Organa and her team captured Imperial Moff Tan Hubi in order to gain access to the base and free Lee-Char. When they arrived at the base, they discovered that Lee-Char was severely injured, only being kept alive by machines at the base, before he was gunned down by stormtroopers after recording his final words to his people."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
