As they had for centuries, rival clans of the Er'stacian species were battling over possession of the Venerable One, or Megalith\u2014a giant, stone statue representing the mythical forebear of the species. The two clans wore armor signifying their allegiance: red for one side, and green for the other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The war reached such pitched status that the Jedi Council feared the participants might commit genocide against their rivals. They therefore dispatched Jedi Master Mace Windu to the world to stop the hostilities. On the world, Windu finally negotiated an uneasy peace by dicing the Venerable One statue into pieces using his lightsaber, and thus forcing the enemy sides to work together to either divvy up the pieces or reconstruct the monument."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
