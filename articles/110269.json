The ship's speed was similar to a TIE Interceptor, but it also included hyperdrive capability. With shield and hull strength similar to that of the Z-95 Headhunter, this craft would not last long if it was hit accurately by even a medium-power salvo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It had three H-K 5J Mk.II afterburning ion engines and was armed with light laser cannons and proton torpedo launchers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maneuverability was another disappointment to its designers, as it was less maneuverable than the A-wing. As per the A-wing, weapons were light, with only dual laser cannons being fitted in order to maintain maneuverability.
