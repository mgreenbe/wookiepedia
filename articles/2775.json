It consists of 162 cards dividing into 81 Dark Side and 81 Light Side cards, and was introduced in July of 1996. This set consists of 54 rare, 54 uncommon, and 54 common cards. This set introduced many of the classic characters from Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope that were not included in the original base set, Premiere Limited. Some of the notable cards include Chewbacca, R2-D2, Greedo, Wedge Antilles and the Death Star. This set also introduced the first epic event cards, such as \"Commence Primary Ignition\" and \"Attack Run,\" to the game. A complete list of the A New Hope Revised Unlimited set may be found on an archived copy of Decipher's webpage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because this is an expansion set, it bears an expansion-set symbol, which is located near the top right corner of the card, to the right of the lore and below the destiny number. The symbol for this set is two lightsabers crossed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This set was sold in nine-card expansion packs and thirty-pack expansion boxes. Each pack include one rare card, three uncommon cards, and five common cards. Starter decks were never produced for this set. The set was printed until Decipher lost the license to produce the Star Wars Customizable Card Game. This set is nearly identical to the A New Hope Limited expansion set except for some minor game text changes and the fact that it has white borders instead of black borders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External Links"}]}
