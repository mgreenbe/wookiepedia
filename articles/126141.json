Like other Sith Temples, it had a triangular opening at the front and it tapered into two spires at the top. When the ancient Jedi artifact Vor'Na'Tu was found on Krant, the planet Geddes orbited, it was stored at the Sith Temple. In 0 ABY, the research base was assaulted by a Rebel Alliance strike force intent on recovering the artifact. The Temple was destroyed and the Jedi Echuu Shen-Jon took the Vor'Na'Tu, although he was forced to shatter it when Darth Vader arrived."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This Sith Temple appears in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds.
