It was operated by agents of the Hutt crime lord Sinasu and lay within the territories of Sinasu's rival Hutt Jabba. During the Galactic Civil War, the Rodian hunter Jora assembled a cargo of Krayt dragon eggs and a junior Krayt dragon at Vapor Station, which was to be smuggled to Sinasu on the moon Nar Shaddaa by a group of individuals who were indebted to the Hutt. However, just as Jora briefed the agents for their upcoming assignment, the outpost was raided by a band of Tusken Raiders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
