His blade was very similar to other Sith war swords of the time, but was strongly infused with dark side energy using Sith alchemy. This blade was used against Naga Sadow while the two disputed who was to be the next Dark Lord of the Sith. Later, once again during an argument with Naga Sadow over who was more qualified to be the next Dark Lord of the Sith, he slammed his sword upon the ground and destroyed the nearly-indestructible weapon as a show of his disapproval."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, the sword makes an appearance as a double-bladed weapon in the Tomb of Ludo Kressh, despite being single-bladed and having been destroyed in Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Golden Age of the Sith.
