Obi-Wan would later build himself a replica of this weapon that he would wield as a Jedi Knight until the start of the Clone Wars, after which he would use a new lightsaber of a completely different design."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This lightsaber was powered by a diatium power cell, which was surrounded by the notched hand grip."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his Mission to Pijal, the kyber crystal which powered the blade of the weapon was briefly swapped with a kohlen crystal.
