Not willing to succumb to the Empire, Roche spread the factories throughout the asteroid belt, hiding them deep in asteroids which appeared abandoned from the surface. When the Empire learned of the defiance, a fleet of Star Destroyers blasted several heavily populated Verpine asteroids to dust. Even after the punishment, Roche continued to produce new IX-6 units and smuggled them to anyone who could afford them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In combat, the IX-6 model sometimes served under LON-29 battle droid commanders.
