Shortly thereafter, during the Great Hyperspace War, a group of Sith were forced to crash-land on the planet in their starship, the Omen. The Lost Tribe of Sith, as the survivors of the accident became known, conquered the Keshiri\u2014as the natives believed them to be their gods\u2014and helped them to drive away and domesticate Kesh's native beasts. Tahv then became a decorative city, focusing mainly on workings of art, often created by Sith artists using the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lost Tribe of Sith quickly took command of Tahv and the planet's government, and often forced the native Keshiri to work for them. Although the Sith moved into a newly-built Temple in the nearby Takara Mountains, they soon returned to live in Tahv. Many of the Sith lived toward the center of the city, while the Keshiri lived in the outskirts, or as servants to the Sith. By 3960 BBY, a stadium, the Korsinata, had been built in Tahv to hold rake-riding sporting events. However, in the following centuries, the Tribe was beset by infighting and Tahv fell into decay. By 41 ABY, the class difference between the Sith and the Keshiri had narrowed, although the outskirts of Tahv remained inhabited mostly by the less wealthy Keshiri. By that time, the Tribe's ruling body, the Circle of Lords, convened in the Circle Chambers in the capitol in central Tahv. In 44 ABY, the dark side entity Abeloth was brought to Tahv when she offered to ally with the Sith to defeat the New Jedi Order.

The city itself was decorated with various workings of art, created through the Force by Sith artists, including levitating fountains, trees sculpted and shaped by the Force, and glass sculptures which gave it the nickname \"City of Glass.\" The city was also home to at least one pauper's tavern, which was decorated extensively with ornately carved glass. Sometime after 4975 BBY, a facility was created for housing the various wild species on Kesh, including the flying uvak used for transportation on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tahv had an extensive aqueduct system that was originally constructed by the indigenous Keshiri species and later improved upon by the Sith; the aqueducts were typically monitored by one Sith Saber and the Saber's apprentices.

Toward the center of the city, the area known as the Circle, Tahv grew more appealing and luxurious. Within the Circle was the capitol building and the Circle Chambers, in which the Circle of Lords, the planet's governing body, convened.

The Great Calamity was triggered by the arrival of two parties of offworld Dark Jedi and Jedi who had become stranded on Kesh following a galactic-wide pursuit. After the two rival Force-orders made peace, the Jedi hid a hyperspace-capable starship, the Last Hope, within the Keshiri burial cairns. In return, the Dark Jedi sealed their most powerful weapon, the Sith Lord Remulus Dreypa, within an oubliette, a stasis casket used to keep individuals in suspended animation. These Dark Jedi and Jedi then migrated to Kesh's South Pole, Eshkrene, where they founded the Doomed, a Force community committed to finding a balance in the Force and watching over the native Keshiri people. These offworlders gave rise to the Keshiri legends of the Protectors and Destructors. When the Neshtovar, a religious aristocracy which rode uvaks, came to power, they phased out these legends in favor of a creation story based around a Great Battle between the Skyborn and the Otherside, which was associated with any resistance to their religious order. When the Sith came into power, they reversed this cosmological order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The city was first built by the Keshiri people sometime before 5000 BBY. The walls of the city served mainly as protection for its inhabitants from the many dangerous animals that roamed the planet. In 5,000 BBY, during the Great Hyperspace War, the Omen\u2014a Sith starship carrying a shipment of Lignan crystals to Sith Lord Naga Sadow\u2014was knocked off-course while attempting to execute a hyperspace jump, and it crash-landed on Kesh in the Takara Mountains. The survivors of the crash made contact with a Keshiri woman, Adari Vaal, who told them of the city of Tahv. The Keshiri believed the Sith to be their gods, the Skyborn, and befriended them. Shortly after the Sith arrival, it was decided by the councilor Izri Dazh\u2014leader of the Keshiri the Neshtovar, the Keshiri uvak-riders\u2014and the city's governing body that all of the Keshiri in Tahv would be moved to humbler homes so that the \"Skyborn\" could live in luxury and the Keshiri could serve them.

The Sith did not spend long in Tahv; within fifteen years of their arrival, they had left the city in favor of a Temple in the Takara Mountains. However, just ten years later, Grand Lord Yaru Korsin was killed, and in his honor, Nida Korsin, his daughter and successor as Grand Lord, ordered the Sith and their families to return to live in Tahv. Every twenty-fifth anniversary of Korsin's death the Sith held Testament Day in Tahv\u2014a holiday that celebrated his final testament. Another holiday, the Festival of Nida's Rise, celebrated Nida Korsin's seventy-nine-year reign once every seventy-nine years. The two holidays converged for the first time in 3000 BBY, and several Sith and Keshiri alike attended."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Tahv, the Sith remained dominant over the Keshiri for thousands of years.

Sith artists began to influence the city, using the Force to shape trees and create impressive sculptures of glass formed from the planet's lavender sand. Windows, jewelry, domes, spires, and even weapons were fashioned with great care and sophistication. The Sith eventually formed three rival guilds that competed mercilessly for control of the craft of shaping sand into glass. It was not uncommon for such artisans to employ bodyguards to protect themselves from assassination attempts. The shikkar, a delicately crafted knife made from glass, was often used by the guilds to murder rival guild members. Meanwhile, the Keshiri became second-class citizens, and were even employed as servants and slaves of the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 3960 BBY, over a millennia after the arrival of the Sith, a stadium, the Korsinata, had been built in Tahv.

In that year, an assassination attempt on Grand Lord Lillia Venn was made during a rake-riding event. The attempt failed, however, and resulted in the deaths of two of the Tribe's High Lords, Pallima and Dernas, as well as the framing of High Lord Candra Kitai and her daughter, Sith Saber Orielle Kitai, who were believed to be behind the attack.

It soon became somewhat of a tradition amongst the Sith for one faction to subjugate Tahv and kill the Grand Lord, only to have the new rulers begin to turn on each other and have the process repeat. The Sith lore Caretaker Varner Hilts created the term \"The Time of the Rot\" for that period of time. From about 3,600 BBY to 3000 BBY, none of the Grand Lords lived in the capitol building, which fell into ruins and disrepair. Too, due to the frequent attacks and shifts in power, much of Tahv decayed into ruins. The streets began to decay and the aqueducts grew congested, causing spillage and collapses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Also, the Sessal Spire volcano became very active, and on one occasion erupted so powerfully that it collapsed part of the Korsinata. By 3000 BBY, Varner Hilts had a museum in Tahv that housed ancient maps of the deserted Sith Temple. On the Testament Day holiday in 3000 BBY, the Sith rediscovered the fact that their Human ancestors had been servants to a member of another species, Naga Sadow. The revelation caused many Keshiri to realize that the Humans were not the most important or powerful beings in the galaxy, and deadly riots broke out all over Kesh, including Tahv.

Hilts had discovered a large map at the Kesh Sith Temple, which revealed the existence of this unknown continent. For the next twenty-five-years, the Tribe's chief engineer Edell Vrai experimented with long-distance uvak flights and boats before settling for airships, which were held afloat by hydrogen and propelled by uvaks. Grand Lord Hilts rebuilt the city's aqueduct system and also restored the Kesh capitol building to its former glory and splendor. It remained the residence of the Grand Lord and his Consort for the next millennia. Several thoughtcriers were also stationed in Tahv to facilitate long-distance communications across the continent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the invasion of Alanciar in 2975 BBY, Grand Lord Hilts arranged for the Alanciari Keshiri signals officer Jogan Halder, who had been taken captive during Edell Vrai's reconnaissance mission to that continent, to be brought as a guest of the Tribe to Tahv. Hilts intended to conquer Alanciar without incurring heavy casualties on the side of the Tribe by winning over the \"hearts and minds\" of the Alanciari. Hilts wanted Halder and his Alanciari brethren to believe that the Sith were actually the Protectors. Thus, he staged a \"grand deception\" operation in Tahv which involved bringing the Tribe's most loyal Keshiri subjects onto the streets of Tahv to create a carnival atmosphere. These included artisans, painters, sculptors, musicians and singers who created the impression that the Keshiri living in Keshtah lived happy and carefree lives, as opposed to the militaristic drudgery of the Alanciari."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the Sith withdrew from public view to reinforce the impression that they did not lord over the Keshiri but rather stayed within the capitol building where they meditated in quiet contemplation. During his visit, Halder was greeted by many Keshiri who convinced about the benevolence of the Protectors. Hilts was then allowed to visit the Kesh capitol building where he found the Sith in quiet contemplation. He was then allowed to visit the Circle of Lords, which appeared to be an egalitarian council where no man or woman ranked above the other. While the Sith Lords acknowledged that Adari Vaal, the Herald of Kesh, had been right about the presence of the \"servants of Destructors\" among the Sith, they claimed that they had put down these \"evil ones\" one day after Vaal had left for Alanciar. Thus, the militarization of Alanciari society had been unnecessary."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jogan was also told that a servant of the Destructors known as Korsin Bentado had risen from among the Sith recently. Following his exile from Keshtah, this \"servant of the Destructors\" built airships and set out to conquer Alanciar. In reality, Korsin was a High Lord who had been tasked with leading the Ebon Fleet, the invasion fleet that would attack Alanciar. Hilts regarded the ambitious Korsin as a threat to his rule and had thus used the invasion as an opportunity to eliminate him, knowing full well about the military capabilities of the Alanciari. Finally, Jogan was told that Edell Vrai, the man who had kidnapped him, was a trusted friend of the Protectors who had come in search of Bentado and to make sure that the Alanciari did not serve the Destructors. Thus, the Sith were able to win over Jogan to their cause and he became their \"ambassador\" to the Alanciari. Following the defeat of Korsin, Jogan was able to convince the Alanciari about the benevolent intentions of the Sith and they submitted willingly to Sith rule."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Return of Dreypa"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That same year, the Testament of Varner Hilts was read for the first time on Testament Day. It replaced the older Testament of Yaru Korsin and explored the Tribe's Tapani origins and acknowledged their servitude to the Red Sith. As before, only Humans were allowed to attend the reading and the Keshiri were only allowed to read a censored version. In 2974 BBY, Hilts' daughter Takara Hilts pursued the Sith brigand and outcast Parlan Spinner into the Keshiri Burial Cairns beneath Tahv's Circle Eternal plaza. However, Spinner evaded capture and later attempted to assassinate Grand Lord Hilts during the Founding festival which commemorated the arrival of the Tribe on Kesh. This time, Takara Hilts foiled his plot and apprehended the \"Death Spinner\", who was brought before the Grand Lord himself. However, Hilts decided to spare Spinner's life and sentenced him to servitude aboard the Alanciari sailing ship Southern Star, which was captained by Captain Chegg."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Spinner allied himself with the ancient Sith Lord Remulus Dreypa, who he had freed from an oubliette after four millennia of suspended animation. While Dreypa was more preoccupied with reaching the stars, he agreed to lead a slave revolt against the Tribe and march on Tahv in order to overthrow the Tribe, whom he regarded as \"heretics\" who did not adhere to the Sith Code. However, his forces were routed at the Marisota Floodplain and the Sith Lord was forced to retreat to the volcano Sessal Spire where he unleashed leviathans, Sithspawn capable of draining the life energies of sentient beings. Prior to her death, the Doomed's leader Kaliska revealed that an ancient Jedi starship known as the Last Hope was hidden beneath the Circle Eternal.

Much of the city was damaged and destroyed during the attack. Many buildings were destroyed and many of its inhabitants were killed. In response, the Tribe rallied all able-bodied Sith, Keshiri, freemen and slaves to defend their city. The Grand Consort Iliana Hilts led several Sith Sabers in the defense of Tahv while her husband Varner attempted to evacuate the capitol building's scrolls. One Leviathan breached the Kesh capitol building and attempted to devour Varner but was destroyed by Spinner, who had taken the Jedi Starship on a joyride above Tahv. During this joyride, Spinner accidentally destroyed the city's waterworks, disrupting Tahv's water supply. He then proceeded to destroy Dreypa's leviathans while Takara Hilts used Force lightning to kill Dreypa's last remaining Leviathan. Ultimately, Dreypa was killed when he was lured into the Jedi Starship, which was then sent on a one-way trip into the volcano Sessal Spire.

In that year, Ship, a Sith Meditation Sphere, arrived on Kesh to assist in the training of the Tribe's apprentices.

As Khai and Abeloth arrived in orbit, Grand Lord Darish Vol called for a meeting of the Tribe in the Circle Chambers in Tahv.
