Jedi Master Tera Sinube taught a class of younglings there when a lightsaber duel broke out between Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and the rogue Padawan Barriss Offee, whom Skywalker was attempting to take into custody after learning that she had bombed the Jedi Temple due to her belief that the Jedi High Council had become corrupt due to their leadership over the Grand Army of the Republic in the war. Skywalker disarmed the Padawan and used the Force to telekinetically slam her into the ancient tree, at which point she was taken into custody."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, Skywalker spoke to Grand Master Yoda in the courtyard regarding the latter's belief that he was communing with the deceased Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. Skywalker, who briefly heard Jinn's disembodied voice through the Force, expressed skepticism, but Yoda was convinced and began a journey to learn the secrets to retaining his consciousness after death. As part of this quest, he saw a vision of a peaceful Jedi Order, one untouched by war. This vision placed him in the Jedi Temple training ground, where he saw many Jedi, including those who had been killed and had fallen to the dark side of the Force, happily speaking to one another. Upon his return to the Jedi Temple, Yoda spoke with fellow Jedi Council members Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi about his experiences, telling them that he was uncertain if it was possible for the Jedi Order to win the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The end of the Clone Wars saw the destruction of the Jedi Order at the hands of the Sith. After declaring himself Emperor and transforming the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious transformed the Jedi Temple into the Imperial Palace. He removed the ancient tree from the courtyard and, over two decades later, its two remaining fragments were located in an Imperial research lab on Vetine. They were retrieved by Luke Skywalker, the last known Jedi Knight and the son of Anakin Skywalker, and Lieutenant Shara Bey of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Skywalker kept one of the fragments for himself and gifted the other to Bey, who planted it outside of her home on Yavin 4."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The training ground was first created for and seen in \"The Wrong Jedi,\" an episode of the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars.
