It was home to a wealth of sentient species: the Mon Calamari, the Quarren, the Moappa, the Amphi-Hydrus, and the Whaladons. Mon Calamari was the name given to the planet by Human explorers from the Galactic Republic who first discovered and revealed the world to the rest of the galaxy. The native species referred to the planet as Dac. The planet was a shining bluish-white orb from space, due to its ocean-covered surface.

While Yos Kolina, the eighty-second and current King of Mon Cala, mediated the dispute, the Separatist leader General Grievous prepared an invasion of the Calamari system. Dac held strategic importance to the Republic's war effort at this time, due to the planet providing Republic shipyards with a special ore to strengthen cruiser armor plating. As part of their invasion plans, the Separatists sent Commander Riff Tamson to assassinate Kolina and push the Mon Calamari and Quarren towards civil war. In the wake of Kolina's death, the Quarren began a dispute with the Mon Calamari regarding their sovereignty and the monarchy's line of succession. Hoping to break free from the rule of the Mon Calamari, the Quarren challenged the monarchy, wanting one of their own on the throne instead of the heir apparent Prince Lee Char. As the diplomatic crisis continued to unfold, Gial Ackbar, captain of the Mon Calamari Guard, asked the Republic to send representatives to help mediate the situation. Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Jedi General Anakin Skywalker were sent to Dac, but the Quarren Chieftan, Nossor Ri, responded by asking for an envoy from the Separatists' side to be present for the negotiations as well, a call that was answered by Tamson. Exploiting the tensions between the Quarren and Mon Calamari, Tamson convinced Ri to side with the Separatists so that the Quarren could claim control over Dac. Unbeknownst to the Quarren, however, Tamson had made a deal with Dooku to become Dac's ruler after the planet fell under Separatist control."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the failure of a peace conference, the Separatists, led by Tamson, and the Quarren, led by Ri, began a combined assault on Dac's capital, Coral City. The Mon Calamari and their Republic reinforcements continually lost ground, with all of them eventually being captured by Tamson and put to work in prison camps for Dooku and the Confederacy. Tamson then took Kolina's throne for himself, much to the shock of Ri and the Quarren, who began to regret their alliance with the Confederacy. When Lee-Char and his Jedi protector, Padawan Ahsoka Tano, were the only ones who had evaded capture, Dooku sought to finish what he had begun with Kolina's assassination: the termination of the royal bloodline through the execution of the prince. Despite the fear of living up to his father, Lee-Char took his place as leader of the Mon Calamari, using his father's old friendship with Ri to convince the Quarren to re-side with them and the Republic. This led to the defeat of Tamson and the removal of the Separatist presence on Dac, and Lee-Char succeeding his father as Dac's ruler."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Republic loyalty of the planet was cemented, the Loyalist inhabitants agreed to a new arrangement: dual representation in the Senate, with Tundra Dowmeia representing the Quarren and Meena Tills representing the Mon Calamari.

Eventually, Emperor Palpatine ordered three of the planet's floating cities to be destroyed in reprisal. Regardless, the Imperial attack did not succeed in breaking the Mon Calamari spirit. Instead of extinguishing the resistance, it pushed the world's natives into open rebellion when the Mon Calamari joined the Quarren against the invaders in a grand and secret military effort which finally repelled the Imperials and pushed them off their planet, their system and indeed the entire sector. Shortly after the uprising, while preparing the planet to join efforts with the Rebel Alliance, the Imperial Senator Timi Rotramel attempted to bring other species and systems into the Rebellion against the Empire; unfortunately for Rotramel, shortly after failing to convince the Tiss'shar to join a Sector rebellion, he was killed on Tiss'shar by Darth Vader, who discovered his secret rendezvous with Tiss'shar President Si-Di-Ri."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial propaganda did not wait to attempt to discredit the Mon Calamari, as the Imperial sentientologist Obo Rin, working under the direction of Lord Vader, wrote the Catalog of Intelligent Life in the Galaxy.
