The transfer was interrupted by a raid from Rebel Alliance starfighters bound on destroying the TIE Advanced fighters while they were flown to the Dauntless by untrained workers. If the Rebel starfighters are unsuccessful in destroying enough \"TIE Advanced\" then their last option is to send in the frigate Rehz'nor which will send X-wings and Y-wings in an attempt to destroy the Dauntless."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Commanded by Captain Orsk, it additionally served as flagship to Lira Wessex."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the occurrence of the space battle depicted in this mission, as well as the participants, is C-Canon, the outcome depends on the actions of the player and is therefore indeterminate.
