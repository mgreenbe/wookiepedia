They were grown in large numbers in underground farms of Balosar. Although unconfirmed, it was possible that Sebolto grew his own mushrooms on Malastare, which would explain how he was able to produce death sticks. During the time of the New Republic, balo mushrooms farms were threatened by the encroaching pollution from the surface of Balosar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
