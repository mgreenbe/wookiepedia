A Pantoran vendor sold the snack from a stand for seven credits a carton. The fugitive clones Wrecker and Omega, whose team began working for the local informant Cid as mercenaries, developed a tradition of going out for cartons of Mantell Mix after missions, charging the cartons to Cid's tab instead of paying for them directly. By the time the squad returned from a mission to steal a lizard from the Rhokai gang, the two had incurred a debt for a total of twenty cartons, which was included on a list of expenses that Cid showed to squad leader Hunter. Having not known about the Mantell Mix, its inclusion on the list was particularly surprising to him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Omega kept some Mantell Mix in her pocket when the Bad Batch traveled to Bracca so the clone commandos could have their implanted inhibitor chips, which had been used to turn the clone army against the Jedi in Order 66, surgically removed. However, before his operation could begin, Wrecker's chip activated and he attacked the other clones as traitors, cornering and nearly killing Omega before he was subdued. After his surgery was successfully carried out, Wrecker apologized to Omega for his actions under the chip's influence. As a sign of forgiveness, she offered the mix in her pocket to him, saying that as the mission was over they could not break tradition, and they shared the snack together."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Batch returned to Ord Mantell after a skirmish with Imperial forces and Omega's rescue from a bounty hunter who had kidnapped her, Omega and Wrecker shared a carton of Mantell Mix.
