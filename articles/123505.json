Tarkin contacted the Council with his belief that Tano was guilty, accusing her of sedition which provoked a shocked reaction from several Council members, including Ti.

While the High Council permitted this method, both of Ti's Padawan suffered from their lack of experience, dying not long after they were knighted. With a subtle sense of humor, Master Ti sometimes seemed cold and unfeeling; something that was not helped by her naturally pointed teeth which, when bared, appeared as a sinister snarl. Naturally patterned to blend into the wilds of Shili, Shaak Ti was capable of stealing up behind an opponent or adversary and catching them unawares."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite being trained as a Jedi Consular, Ti's reputation with a lightsaber was well known throughout the Order. Regardless of her reputation, Ti remained humble and preferred to spar with words rather than her lightsaber. Reflective and contemplative, Ti was deeply troubled throughout the Clone Wars, as she was unable to properly reflect on the Order's place in the conflict. Indeed, while a member of the High Council, Ti was often quiet, reflecting on the words of her peers and occasionally interjecting a few soft words into the discussion. On the matter of Anakin Skywalker, Ti was in the minority when she voiced doubt in the young Human's nature and his readiness to be a Knight. She was thus overruled by the other Masters, though she held close to her opinion.\nWhen the war was ended and the Republic and the Jedi Order collapsed at the feet of the new Galactic Empire, Ti exiled herself, fading away amongst the stars and biding her time until she could act out against the Sith. Remaining active in her role of peacekeeper, Master Ti resided on Felucia as Chieftain of the Felucians and guardian of the distraught Padawan Maris Brood. For nearly two decades Ti trained the Felucians and tempered their dark side nature. Training them to repel the Empire, Ti believed that her destiny had not yet been fulfilled, and that only the guidance of the Force, not her own desire to strike back at the Empire, was the true path to success."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Regarded as a Master of legendary power and strength in the Force as well as among the finest and most cunning swordsmen of her time, Shaak Ti, despite her humbleness and preference on studying the fields of diplomacy and healing, was an extremely powerful and accomplished master of the Force and exceptional lightsaber duelist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Well-trained and skilled in all forms of lightsaber combat, Ti was particularly accomplished in the use of both the Makashi and Ataru forms. Highly well-regarded for her tremendous grace, which was further amplified by her exotic pigmentation and coloring, Ti's skills were even compared to that of Count Dooku. Combined with her mastery of Ataru, Ti was effortlessly capable of launching swift barrages of saber strikes while traversing around the battlefield gracefully, as displayed by how she pressured Marek's usage of Soresu while leaving barely any openings to counter, forcing the apprentice to use the Force to best her. She was also well-versed in dual-blade combat, making effective use of both her lightsaber and an electrostaff in an improvised form of Jar'Kai to defeat all the Magnaguards she faced during the Battle of Coruscant. Infusing her weapon with the Force, she would throw her enemy off their feet by plunging her sabers into the ground and sending Force tremors through the soil. Easily fighting in crowds, Ti was aided in clearly perceiving her surroundings by the hollow spaces in her cranial horns, or montrals. Gathering information ultrasonically, they allowed her to speed up her movements faster and with more accuracy than most other Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of Ti's greatest gifts was her ability to commune with nature more deeply then most Jedi of the era. Particularly accomplished in the art of controlling fauna and direct them with her will, which she combined with equally potent mastery of the Consitor Sato technique, her mastery of both techniques of controlling the sentinent aspects of nature were so great that she could command the entire flora and fauna of Felucia when fighting Marek and was able to easily stop the Sarlacc from devouring her and command it to attack Marek. In addition, Ti was capable of altering the environment to cause thick fogs, blast away enemies with powerful whirlwinds, and freeze the surfaces of water bodies. . Shaak Ti was capable of using telekinesis and would use it in conjunction with the environment against her foes. Her mastery of Telekinesis was even praised by Plo Koon, himself described as a \"telekinetic savant\", and proved capable of moving large objects without even using hand gestures or looking in their direction and even while exhausted, flinging large objects at extremely high velocities with simple hand gestures. She was able to easily deflect the telekinetic assault of Galen Marek. Proficient in the use of Force Barriers, Shaak Ti could hold back a flood on Tipoca City on Kamino and create a shield strong enough to repel the efforts of Marek despite his extreme power and skill in the Force. She could also use Tutaminis proficiently, as she not only deflected blows from Electrostaffs but even repelled a glancing lightsaber blow. Shaak Ti was able to concentrate lightning into a powerful attack she could throw at foes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Portrayal"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shaak Ti's appearance was derived from concept art by artists Dermot Power and Iain McCaig, who designed her as a Jedi for use in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.

Once again though, promotional images were taken with slight differences in her make-up, and used in guidebooks and on other products.

This was George Lucas' original idea, and appeared in storyboards and early drafts of the screenplay. In fact, this scene was completed and included on the DVD release of Revenge of the Sith, but is to be regarded as non-canon. When it was planned for her to die aboard the Invisible Hand, her seat on the Council was going to be given to Tsui Choi, an Expanded Universe Jedi. Originally the Revenge of the Sith Shaak Ti action figure had a hole in its chest all the way through its back, to reflect this death; in the final released version it was filled in.
