Jedi Masters Kit Fisto and Plo Koon arrive to sort things out. The prisoners immediately unite against the two Jedi, and lightsabers are drawn. During the battle, the Jedi realize the difference in their views: while Fisto believes in the value of all life, Koon argues that \"scum like this can't be rehabilitated\". Defeating the rioters using their own personal methods, the two descend into the sewers, where they meet a two-headed thug divided into two personalities: one peaceful, one argumentative. Koon finally gives in to Fisto's arguments and chooses to knock the two out cold rather than kill them. Their escape is broken short, however, when the bounty hunter Durge appears, explaining that it was he who started the riot in order to lure Jedi into his trap. He is temporarily defeated when a boulder falls upon his head, an event triggered by the actions of the two-headed prisoner. Realizing that not all condemned are evil, Koon leaves the escape plan up to Fisto, who remarks that the prisoners should tag along to \"watch our backs and earn time off for good behavior\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
