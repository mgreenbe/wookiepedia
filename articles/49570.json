Designed to be sprayed into cracks, dents, holes or other spaces, the foam expanded and quickly hardened upon application, becoming indistinguishable from its surroundings once dry and possessing the strength and wearability of plastcrete. For 25 credits, the foam could be purchased in a tall can equipped with a trigger activated applicator and a long narrow tube that allowed for precision application."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the new Star Wars canon, foamcast was mentioned in the 2018 roleplaying supplement Fully Operational, which was released by Fantasy Flight Games as part of Star Wars: Age of Rebellion.
