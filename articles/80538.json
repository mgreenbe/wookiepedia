Between 0.5 ABY and 2 ABY, the Bothan spy Utric Sandov and Krantian Resistance members retreated to the island after Imperial Strike Force Alpha seized the Rebel Alliance's Ghost Base. The survivors established another base on Le'Roche, complete with a Command center, Prefab Shelters, a troop center, a War Center, and a water-based shipyard. R2-D5 labor droids gathered resources for the base. After a Rebel army led by the emissary Leia Organa and the exiled Jedi Echuu Shen-Jon liberated Ghost Base, the Krantian Leader sent two transports to take Organa to meet with Sandov on Le'Roche. Sandov then informed them that the Empire had captured a Jedi artifact, the Vor'Na'Tu, and Organa and Shen-Jon departed Krant to recover the artifact."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Le'Roche was first mentioned in the strategy guide to the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds.
