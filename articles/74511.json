It was the sole colony world of the Miraluka, a Force-sensitive race that was only able to see through the Force. Although its continents were almost entirely covered by mountains, it had rich flora and fauna, including birds and trees. The Miraluka of Katarr built their cities with a distinctive, round-shaped architectural style."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All life on Katarr was devoured by the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus in approximately 3952 BBY. The attack was directed at a Jedi meeting being held on the planet. From the entire planetary population, only one being, a Miraluka named Visas Marr, survived. Sometime after the destruction of Malachor V, Visas returned to walk across the surface of Katarr. Although the primary motivation behind Nihilus' attack was obviously to devour the Jedi, the fact that Katarr was located almost half-way between Onderon and Dantooine, two key Republic worlds, led some to believe that the Sith wanted to blind that section of the galaxy to the Force, possibly to allow them to make it easier to hide their movements from the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
