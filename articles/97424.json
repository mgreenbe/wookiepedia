Most of his time was spent in the Iziz Cantina, drinking and playing pazaak with his friends and fellow patrons. When a former Jedi Knight by the name of Meetra Surik visited the cantina in search for clues to clear Dr. Dhagon Ghent of the murder of Captain Sullio of the Onderonian military, she spoke with Nikko, a friend of both Ghent and Sullio, about the incident. He did not believe that Ghent would hurt Sullio, and stated that both he and the doctor respected her and admired her sharp wit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following further investigation, Surik learned that on the night of the murder, Ghent and Sullio had gotten into an apparently heated argument. When asked about this, Nikko explained that after too much juma juice, the two often engaged in an exchange of creative insults, but he insisted that it was all in good fun. Nikko also recounted that just after the murder, he had witnessed Ghent coming from his office across the courtyard outside of the cantina. Upon inspection of the crime scene, Surik was able to obtain a recording of the murder from the memory core of S-0D3-GE3, a service droid from the cantina that had been found near Sullio's body, and learned that the kill shot had come from the opposite direction of Ghent's office. After Nikko watched the recording, he and Surik took it to the authorities holding Ghent, who agreed that he could not have committed the crime and set the doctor free."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nikko was a friendly person, always eager to have a drink and play a game of pazaak with any willing patron of the cantina.
