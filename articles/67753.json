The starships looked like giant stones covered in moss; which were spherical but with a surface that was covered with numerous irregularities making them hardly look round. From the ship's rear jutted a plane housing the engines, with large supports holding them in place. Chunks of machinery and equipment intermittently sprung from the starship's surface at random intervals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
