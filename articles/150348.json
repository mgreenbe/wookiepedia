While they were absent, Sab\u00e9 (in the guise of Queen Amidala) received a message from Governor Sio Bibble, pleading her to contact him on Naboo. Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Padawan of Jinn, cautioned against this, a warning she heeded. At any rate, she could not act without the Queen's authority, but still found the situation she was in to be highly taxing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While biding their time, Sab\u00e9 was captured by Tusken Raiders and taken to the war chief. Kenobi tracked them through their extensive canyon dwellings among old scavenged wrecks, and was forced to journey through a communal Tusken burial site in search of her. He located the decoy Queen being held in a derelict craft that they used for shelter and was led into a confrontation with the war chief, whom he subsequently defeated. In an odd move for the Sand People, the remainder among them solemnly and ceremoniously conceded defeat after Kenobi demanded to be allowed to return to safety with Sab\u00e9. Having slain the Tusken war chief and successfully rescued Sab\u00e9, the duo returned to the ship and awaited their companions return."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, while in hiding on Tatooine, Kenobi would recount of this incident in a meditative conversation with the Force spirit of his former Master, Qui-Gon Jinn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tusken war chief was a boss in the game Star Wars: Obi-Wan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
