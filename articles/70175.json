The rival groups fought one another on the world, but their actions brought untold harm to the native Keshiri species, an event that came to be know as the Great Calamity. All but one combatant, the Sith Lord Remulus Dreypa, agreed to end the hostilities for the sake of the Keshiri. For his recalcitrance, Dreypa was sealed in an oubliette.
