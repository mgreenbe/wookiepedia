They had been known to disassemble pieces of technology quickly and rapidly discern its function. They then adapted the new technology to their own.

They had short, squat bodies covered in thick fur including their tail. They had two short arms ending in clawed hands, and two legs with large clawed feet. In addition, they had a long tail that allowed them to balance well where others would have been precarious. Chikarri were exceptional climbers and extremely stable on their feet. Having developed in the forest canopy of their world, they were known to be at home in high places."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chikarri had a high metabolism, which required them to eat a large quantity of food daily. This metabolism also affected their speech and movement as they spoke very quickly and their movement was fast and jerky."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Early on in the history of their species, Chikarri quickly became fond of technology. Their evolution from fire and the wheel to nuclear power and space flight spanned just over 1,000 years. Once they expanded out into the galaxy, they became fixated on the technology available to them and quickly incorporated into their own. Despite their aggressive technological prowess, Chikarri well understood the connection between the planet and themselves. As such, their technology generally aimed towards making no impact on the biology of their homeworld. This advancement had led to their standing as makers of low radiation starship drives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chikarri evolved on the planet Plagen, a forested world with a large number of lakes and plateaus.
