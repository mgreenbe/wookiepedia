It was designed with the protection of Techno Union and Confederacy of Independent Systems footholds in mind. Because of this, and its ability to be constructed from whatever materials happened to be present on a world, the Mankvim was extremely lightweight. The fighter was constructed with a thin frame that made it very vulnerable, but fast. The Mankvim did not have a hyperdrive, and relied on a small ion drive built inside its frame along with maneuvering fans to get around. While the Mankvim was not very heavily armed, it made up for this in speed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mankvim-418 interceptor was designed by the Techno Union sometime prior to the Battle of Utapau."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mankvim-814 interceptor, also known as the Techno Union Fighter, first appeared in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.
