Although she cared for injured clones even when Separatist forces threatened her life as well as her soldiers, Nala Se had a ruthless side to her, insisting to Jedi General Shaak Ti that clone troopers were Kaminoan property, and therefore, disposable assets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She was also one of the few individuals that knew about Clone Protocol 66, a secret directive encoded into the behavioral modification biochip of every clone in the Republic Military. Believing the chips acted as a safeguard against renegade Jedi, Nala Se went to great lengths to preserve the secrecy of Protocol 66 during the galaxy-wide Clone Wars.

As the Chief Medical Scientist of Kamino, Doctor Nala Se was one of the primary engineers of the clone troopers\u2014genetically identical soldiers bred from a human template, the bounty hunter Jango Fett. Sifo-Dyas would die shortly after his army's inception, however, leaving Nala Se and her people with a new benefactor: the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus. At Tyranus' behest, Nala Se oversaw the installation of an inhibitor chip in the brain of every clone trooper in development. She was told by Tyranus that the bio-chip and its directive, Clone Protocol 66, served as a safeguard against betrayal from renegade Jedi, although its true purpose was to fulfill the Sith plot of exterminating the Jedi Order. As a contingency plan, Protocol 66 was classified information that Nala Se guarded in accordance with Tyranus' instructions. Shortly before the Clone Wars began on Geonosis in 22 BBY, Nala Se was supervising the secret implant of inhibitor chips into the clones' brains when the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi visited Tipoca City to find Jango Fett."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Off-world duties"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the First Battle of Geonosis, Nala Se became an asset to the newly-formed Grand Army of the Republic due to her close involvement in the creation of clone troopers. As a doctor, she served on multiple Haven-class medical stations where her medical skills were put to use for the treatment of injured clones.

While coordinating the evacuation of the station's staff and patients, she was informed by Admiral Wullf Yularen that the Separatist attack was imminent\u2014making it impossible to completely abandon the facility in time. However, the Kaliida Shoals station was saved through the actions of the Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and his apprentice, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, before Grievous could destroy it.

With Geonosis reconquered from the Separatists, the crew of the Pelta-class frigate TB-73 was assigned the errand of delivering medical supplies to the Ord Cestus station. However, the frigate became infested by numerous brain worms\u2014parasitic lifeforms native to the Geonosian homeworld. The incident aboard the TB-73 almost resulted in the contamination of Nala Se's facility, but was ultimately prevented when Tano killed the worms."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Clone Protocol 66"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the height of the Clone Wars, Nala Se returned to her homeworld, where she worked alongside Jedi General Shaak Ti. After CT-5385 fatally shot the Jedi Tiplar during the Battle of Ringo Vinda, the defective clone was taken to Tipoca City in order to undergo an extensive evaluation. As the chief medical scientist on Kamino and one of the cloning program's founders, Nala Se was tasked with discovering the cause behind the clone's malfunction. She subjected the clone to a hyper test which caused her patient to undergo extreme convulsions. The test's data revealed no signs of infection, but Nala Se recognized the clone's actions and aggressive behavior as signs of a premature activation of Protocol 66. Alarmed by this discovery, she communicated her findings to the Kaminoan Prime Minister Lama Su and Darth Tyranus, leading the latter to insist that they terminate the clone in order to protect the secrecy of the inhibitor chip and its true nature. However, the ARC trooper CT-5555 conducted his own test on CT-5385 which, despite its fatal consequence, led to the discovery of the chip."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ARC trooper's interference caused Tyranus to doubt the clone army's reliability in the event of an intentional activation of Protocol 66, although Nala Se assured him that the preemptive execution was an anomaly. As for the clones' growing sense of individuality, she believed that it was due to the Jedi's influence, yet remained confident that it would not interfere with the execution of the protocol. When CT-5555 discovered that every clone had a bio-chip in their brain, Nala Se claimed that it was a safeguard designed to suppress the more aggressive tendencies of the clones' template, Jango Fett."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Against the protests of Nala Se, Shaak Ti decided to take CT-5555 to the Grand Republic Medical Facility on Coruscant along with his bio-chip and that of the late CT-5835, believing the clone should have an audience with Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. Fearing that the Jedi would discover the true programming in the bio-chips, Nala Se accompanied them to the Republic capital, where she secretly drugged the clone in order to make him appear unstable and his testimony unreliable. At the medical facility she asserted that the ARC trooper was dangerous without his control chip, and that the death of Tiplar was the result of a virus that infected CT-5835. Despite her efforts, the secrecy of Protocol 66 was ultimately saved when CT-5555 attempted to assassinate Palpatine after learning of the chancellor's involvement in the conspiracy. Palpatine entrusted the bio-chips to Nala Se for safekeeping, knowing that the Kaminoan scientist would send them to his Sith apprentice, Darth Tyranus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nala Se made a holographic recording of her report on the situation, in which she stated that, as confirmed by an independent investigation, CT-5555's inhibitor chip had malfunctioned. While both the Jedi Council and the Senate committee accepted the investigation's conclusions, CT-7567 had filed a grievance report on the matter. When Chancellor Palpatine activated Protocol 66 later that year, now-former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano was targeted by CT-7567 and other troopers while traveling aboard a Republic attack cruiser. Before attacking her, CT-7567 managed to tell her to find \"Fives,\" CT-5555's nickname, prompting Tano to view Se's report as well as CT-7567's grievance report after she evaded the clones' initial attempt to eliminate her."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Era"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Defection of Clone Force 99"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Nala Se began utilizing the services of Omega, a genetically modified clone, in assistance to her own medical duties.

Nala Se later met with Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin, who had arrived at the facility to assess the viability of using clones in the newly formed Galactic Empire.

Nala Se offered to bring the mercenary's payment for Omega, but her personal interest in Omega prevented Lama Su from allowing her to go. The Prime Minister felt that Nala Se had endangered their operation, and therefore he sent his aide Taun We to retrieve Omega. Nala Se was then informed that she would be tasked with extracting the genetic material that the Kaminoans required from Omega before terminating her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Omega ultimately escaped from Bane as a result of the interference of Fennec Shand, a mercenary that Nala Se secretly hired to prevent the clone from being returned to Lama Su.

Her background in the development of the clone army enabled her to serve in the Clone Wars by caring for wounded clones and supervising their rehabilitation. Although she was willing to risk her own life to oversee the evacuation of injured troopers during a Separatist assault on medical facility near Kaliida Shoals, Nala Se possessed a ruthless side to her personality. She favored scientific methods that yielded the quickest results, such as hyper tests, and was unconcerned by their adverse effects on a patient. If an initial test failed to produce a satisfactory result, she would advocate for a more intrusive method such as surgery regardless of the risk to her patient's survival."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She held no regard for the lives of her clone creations beyond their usefulness to Kamino and the Galactic Republic. From Nala Se's point of view, clones were disposable assets and the property of their creators.

In addition to her disregard for the Jedi's moral views, Nala Se disapproved of their spiritual beliefs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, despite her lack of regard the lives of the clones she did show some concern for the female enhanced clone Omega. Nala Se cared enough about her young assistant to keep her safe through all means, including purposefully sabotaging the efforts of CT-9904 to subdue the child. Nala Se showed concern for Omega's welfare and safety, so much that she would go against Lama Su's orders to ensure that Omega would be protected. She hired the bounty hunter Fennec Shand to retrieve Omega and return her safely, and when Lama Su declared that he wanted her to terminate the young clone Nala Se called off Shand, believing Omega would be safe as long as Lama Su did not have her and agreed to pay the bounty hunter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nala Se was a Kaminoan female who possessed the average physical features of her people, including white skin and large black eyes with white pupils.
