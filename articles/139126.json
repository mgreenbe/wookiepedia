When Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi sensed something was wrong, they found an empty room and Tahl's lightsaber in a small bin. The lightsaber would briefly remain with Jinn, but was later passed down to Kenobi, whose own weapon was recharging. The young Padawan promised to keep it safe. When Tahl's body was taken to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant for a funeral, this lightsaber was presumably destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
