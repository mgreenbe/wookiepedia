They transported passengers and cargo. Though they were massive, they could reach speeds of forty kilometers per hour. Quednaks were also more intelligent than other Yuuzhan Vong creatures, and could minimally understand their orders. Occasionally, the Yuuzhan Vong would use them as war mounts, but this was rare, as they felt that the Warriors were more deserving of the honor of battle than mere beasts. They were used prominently by the Yuuzhan Vong at the Battle of Ylesia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
