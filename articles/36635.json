Some geneticists thought that they shared a long-lost common ancestry, while others believed they were bioengineered as slaves by some vanished master, though the Delphidians themselves were silent on the subject. The species were part of a brawling confederation founded centuries before the Galactic Republic discovered their stars. The individual Delphidian species spoke a vast number of dialects and relied on a common tongue that evolved for trade within the Delphidian Cluster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sidon Ithano was a Delphidian who hid his heritage by wearing a Kaleesh helmet.

The species was not identified in either source, but received its name in Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released in conjunction with the film. Hidalgo later stated on Twitter that another character who also appeared in Maz Kanata's castle in the film was also a Delphidian."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
