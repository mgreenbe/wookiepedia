At least two units of this droid were deployed to a New Republic Correctional Transport, the Bothan-Five where they were used to patrol the vessel until they were encountered by a crew of mercenaries attempting to rescue a Twi'lek prisoner named Qin. One of the mercenaries, a Devaronian named Burg, attacked the droids severely damaging one before throwing it into the other, causing an explosion which destroyed both units."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
