The breath mask had an adjustable strap that could be adjusted to fit on the user's head, covering their mouth and nose. The breath mask came with a built in comlink. A flexible tube connected the mask to a small portable cylinder that cleaned and purified the air, allowing the user to breathe in various environments. The device worked by using small scrubbers to filter out microscopic contaminants that cold be harmful to the user. Despite it's effectiveness at purifying the air, the breath mask could not protect the user from the vacuum of space or corrosive atmospheres.
