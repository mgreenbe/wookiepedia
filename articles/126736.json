The Imperial Navy would stop at nothing to bring down such a valuable resource, so the Alliance Council had plotted a course through the Kiax Nebula, where most spacefarer's avoided, in a gamble to avoid Imperial detection. The Nebula's thick cloud consisted of swirling, space dust, which wreaked havoc on sensor readings, though Han Solo told Mon Mothma that flying through the cloud was a bad idea."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pirates serving the Tech Masters attacked the Alliance forces using modified TIEs, which killed Duros pilot Jamman (Red Three), a newcomer to Red Squadron. Luke Skywalker (Red Five) was able to destroy three of the TIEs. The pirates used surprise hit-and-fade tactics by hitting the X-wings and then disappearing into the Nebula's thick cloud. Skywalker insisted on chasing after the pirates into the cloud, so Red Squadron followed him, leaving the Nema unprotected.
