As a consequence, the Lorrdians were forced to develop a system of subtle gestures, facial expressions, and body postures to talk to each other. Beginning as a simple battle tongue used to co-ordinate guerrilla groups, this eventually became a sophisticated language known as \"kinetic communication.\" This nonverbal form of communication would still be in use millennia later, during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They also learned how to interpret the body language of others to determine their emotional state and intentions with uncanny accuracy. By the Imperial era, Lorrdians also became among the galaxy's best mimics, able to imitate a wide variety of mannerisms and voices (even those of many non-Humans). Due to their experience as slaves under the Argazdan Redoubt, many were outspoken anti-slavery critics and activists who tried to ensure that the galaxy's populace did not forget the lessons of the Kanz Disorders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Kanz Disorders (3970\u20133670 BBY), the Lorrdians supported the Amaltannan resistance against Governor Myrial's Myrialites who had broken away from the Galactic Republic and established the independent Argazdan Redoubt. Under Argazdan rule, they were forbidden by their masters from speaking with each other and were forced to develop a system of subtle gestures, facial expressions, and body postures to talk to each other. Such communication allowed for the coordination of various Lorrdian resistance movements as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The totalitarian Argazdan Redoubt would last for three hundred years.

A Republic and Jedi task force under the Lorrdian Jedi Master Mari-Elan Nora defeated the Myrialites and recaptured Lorrd after dogged fighting.
