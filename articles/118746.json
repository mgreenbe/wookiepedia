It was the model used by the Galactic Empire on the forest moon of Endor to protect the second Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This shield projected an energy screen around the space station while being based on the moon and was efficient enough to do so indefinitely. The components of the SLD-26 included an emitter antenna, projection focusers, shield projector, focus dish, control stations, shield generator, and a large power core. The one drawback of the SLD-26 was that its large size and considerable tower height made it nearly impossible to conceal its location."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
