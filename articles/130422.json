Solo agreed and put together a posse formed from volunteers in the spaceport of Tun Aduban, ultimately finding six he dubbed worthy to join his cause.

When the shaman was killed in the crossfire, the behemoth went wild, threatening the Star-Hoppers and the village. Although one of his men was killed during the monster's rampage, Solo took up Kihotay's lightsaber and managed to slay the beast, saving Onacra.

The pair landed Solo's Millennium Falcon in the spaceport of Tun Aduban, and shortly afterward proceeded to the local cantina. However, once there, the pair found a new fight when they were approached by a local farmer named Ramiz. Ramiz's village, Onacra, had become a target for a ruthless swoop gang called the Cloud-Riders, led by an unhinged former pro swoop racer named Serji-X Arrogantus. Based in the hills near the farming villages west of Tun Aduban, the Cloud-Riders had set their sights on Onacra simply out of convenience, as it was the closest community to their camp. The Cloud-Riders periodically swept down upon Onacra, stealing crops and women, before the two sides settled on an uneasy truce in 3 BBY: the Cloud-Riders would leave Onacra alone in exchange for a yearly tithe of 9,000 credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The village had gotten tired of this arrangement after just three years, and instead decided to offer the entire 9,000 credit payment that would have gone to the Cloud-Riders to Solo, in exchange for saving the village from the menacing thugs. Sympathizing with the farmers' plight, Solo decided to take the job, and went about putting together a posse to join him in defending Onacra. Solo tasked Ramiz with spreading the word, and soon Solo had a line of spacers applying for the job in his rented room at the cantina. Although the first 10 interested parties disappointed Solo, he soon found his first team member in the enigmatic Spiner named Hedji, who impressed the Corellian with his ability to accurately throw his natural quills. Hedji's appearance sparked a run of successful applicants: first, Solo gave a spot to an old acquaintance named Amaiza Foxtrain, a renowned shootist and former pirate. Then, Solo added an elderly man named Don-Wan Kihotay, who claimed to be a member of the long-lost Jedi Knights and wielded a genuine lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Kihotay was added to the crew, a hulking Boltrunian named Warto\u2014who had been involved in a bar fight with Solo and Chewbacca earlier that evening\u2014attempted to jump the line and interview for the job.

Lastly, Solo granted a place to a local teenager named Jimm Doshun, a native of Onacra who brought along his own droid, FE-9Q. Although Doshun had no experience with a blaster, the young farmboy's moxie reminded Solo of his friend Luke Skywalker, convincing Solo to round out his crew with the boy and his droid. The next morning, Solo gathered together his new group to set out for Onacra, but before they could depart, they were set upon by swoops from the west. Led by Serji-X Arrogantus himself, a group of Cloud-Riders had come to attempt to bribe Solo to leave Onacra alone\u2014they had been tipped off by Warto, who had defected to the gang after being beaten by Jaxxon. Solo refused, and Arrogantus went on his way, promising that the next time they met it would end in violence.

Hours before the Cloud-Riders were scheduled to plague the village, the Star-Hoppers ended up in their first scrap, as they ran across a pack of vicious high-hounds in the maze-stalk fields surrounding Onacra. Using the avian predators as target practice, Solo and the gang fought off the high-hounds, with Solo personally saving a young girl named Merri from an attack from above. The Star-Hoppers proceeded on to Onacra, where they learned that Merri was the daughter of village spokesman Oncho Shen, who welcomed the group to the community. The group immediately set about readying themselves for the incoming attack, and during their preparations, Solo was approached by a village elder called the Old One. Oncho Shen's father and Merri's grandfather, the Old One told Solo of a local legend, the Behemoth from the World Below: a slumbering monster that lived beneath the earth, and that he claimed he could call forth to protect Onacra. The Old One asked Solo and his Star-Hoppers not to engage the Cloud-Riders, letting him and his supposed Behemoth to handle the threat themselves, an offer that a disbelieving Solo refused."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was soon afterward that the Cloud-Riders arrived, screaming down upon Onacra on their swoops and skyspeeders. The Star-Hoppers did not hesitate to meet the gang in battle, although they found themselves outnumbered and gave up the aerial advantage to the Cloud-Riders. Soon after the fighting started, Solo's posse suffered its first casualty: the droid FE-9Q, who used its telescopic arms to bring down several Cloud-Rider vehicles, was destroyed protecting Doshun from a blaster shot. The Star-Hoppers soon found themselves swarmed in all directions, forcing the elderly Kihotay to ignite his lightsaber and join the fray. Although Kihotay wielded the blade surprisingly deftly, Kihotay was soon incapacitated himself by a shot to the back. With two of their number down, things were looking bleak for the Star-Hoppers. Suddenly, however, the din of the battle was interrupted by piercing screams and loud chanting from the Old One, who was attempted to summon his Behemoth from below.

Desperate, Arrogantus made a speeder run on the Old One, hoping to take out the man controlling the monster destroying his forces\u2014the Behemoth killed them both with one giant stomp, freeing it from the shaman's control. Without the Old One directing it, the monster went wild, easily mopping up the remaining Cloud-Riders before turning its attention to the Star-Hoppers and the village. Solo's group was initially at a loss about how to deal with the monster: Jaxxon attempted to make a run at the creature, but the creature created a rockslide to stop the Lepi's charge, requiring Foxtrain to save him. Kihotay, who had recovered from his blaster wound, then took it upon himself to confront the creature, wielding his ancient lightsaber. Hedji charged in to rescue him, only to find his quills had no effect on the Behemoth, and the Spiner was almost immediately killed by the monster's forehead laser."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During that encounter, Solo noticed that the Behemoth reacted oddly to Kihotay's lightsaber, and took up the Jedi weapon, dodging the beast's attacks and stabbing the beast in the hand. After flying into a brief rage, the Behemoth suddenly began to disintegrate, destabilized by the lightsaber's energies. Having finally saved the village, the Star-Hoppers returned to Onacra for their payment. Having won the heart of Merri with his bravery in the battle, Doshun decided to remain in Onacra with her.

Some time after the fight with the Cloud-Riders, a bounty hunter named Beilert Valance\u2014an insane former Imperial stormtrooper commander\u2014launched a brutal attack on Anglebay Station, an unaligned medical facility on Telos IV. Valance had become obsessed with finding an unnamed \"farmboy\" who had participated in the Rebel rescue of Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan several months before, and by chance, he received a lead on his target in Anglebay Station. Don-Wan Kihotay was convalescing from his wounds in the station's in-patient bays, and in his senile ramblings, several of Valance's men overheard him mention Jaxxon in relation to Han Solo and an unnamed \"boy.\" As Solo was a known associate of Valance's \"farmboy,\" Valance immediately set off to Nar Shaddaa to track Jaxxon down, believing that the Lepi would be the key to finding his prey."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Nar Shaddaa, a group of Valance's hunters kidnapped Jaxxon and attempted to torture the Lepi, only to be surprised and gunned down by Amaiza Foxtrain, with whom Jaxxon had gone into business after Aduba-3.

Although Doshun initially did not believe that bounty hunters could be after him, Valance's crew had followed the Rabbit's Foot to Aduba-3, leaving no doubt that another fight had come to the plains of Onacra. Thinking quickly, the three former Star-Hoppers put together a trap. Jaxxon and Foxtrain took to the skies in the Rabbit's Foot, harassing Valance's ship and leading it down to Onacra. Valance and his men disembarked their ship, only to find that their quarry had taken up position in the neighboring hills. Then, Doshun and the villagers stampeded their banthas, and the massive pack animals trampled and killed most of Valance's men. Valance survived the bantha's charge, only to realize that Doshun was not, in fact, the farmboy he was after.

Doubtful of the documentary's veracity, Rebel historian Voren Na'al traveled to Aduba-3 to try to get the real story of the Star-Hoppers. Na'al was doubtful of every facet of the documentary's narrative, even the name \"Star-Hoppers\"\u2014which Na'al believed to be an invention of Tri-Nebula marketing executives\u2014and he faced significant difficulty finding anyone in the highly transient Aduban society who had been there long enough to have remembered the events firsthand. The Star-Hoppers themselves had long since dispersed, but Na'al managed to track down Jimm Doshun and his wife, who still lived in Onacra. Although Doshun was unwilling to meet with him, Na'al briefly interviewed Merri, but was dismayed to find that her story closely matched that of the holo-doc, down to the sudden appearance of a massive monster shooting a laser beam out of its head.
