They could fire a concentrated bolt of electricity that had the potential to short-circuit electronics and electrocute a human to unconsciousness. It could also be used to unlock binders. 3 years before the Battle of Yavin, the astromech droid named \"Chopper\" used his spark projector to free AP-5 from his restraining bolt, as well as electrocute an Imperial officer to render him unconscious."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
