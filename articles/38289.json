Situated close to the Galactic Courts of Justice and the City Municipal Authorities Building, the hotel catered to a galactic clientele, and offered its guests simulated atmospheres to suit their individual preferences. With a floor at level 5120 and its peak visible above 5127, the current surface level of its time, it spanned at least seven levels. At one point, Admiral Garrick Versio of the Galactic Empire's Imperial Security Bureau booked a suite for the members of the freshly minted Inferno Squad. The suite's room had controls to wake its occupant with gradual light, with an illumination range from 1 to 10. Some rooms light up automatically when entered, and the lights could be turned off, when the guest spoke a verbal command. Iden Versio encountered all of these features when staying at the Diplomat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
