A year after the establishment of the Empire, Black Sun took notice of pilot Ahsoka Tano\u2014although they only knew her by her alias of \"Ashla\" and did not know she was a former Padawan\u2014after she intruded in their sentient trafficking, as the secret Force-sensitive had taken to helping the people of the Outer Rim. Learning that \"Ashla\" had been hired by the Fardi clan, Black Sun knew they could pay her more than the smaller group, though they also wanted her to work to make back the thousands of credits she had cost them. Thus, Black Sun ordered their agents to either hire or kill the pilot.

After boarding Tage's ship and reuniting with astromech droid R2-D2, Tano rested aboard her ship when she arranged for it to float above a nameless moon that orbited the planet she had fought the agent on; even though she figured the agent would be repairing their ship, she was certain they were not hiding where she was."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Age of the Empire, Black Sun owned a Pantolomin cruiser.
