Some types of chance-cube could only give two results after being thrown, as three of their sides were one color, while the other three were another color. Toydarians like Watto or King Katuunko were known for using such chance-cubes. Imperial cadets Pandak Symes and Nazhros Oleg used a chance cube to decide who would get the bottom bunk in their barrack, with Symes winning the roll."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another variant had the cube marked on each face with from one to six spots. Han Solo had a pair of such cubes decorating the cockpit of his starship, the Millennium Falcon.
