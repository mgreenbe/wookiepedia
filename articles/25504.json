The battle armor resembled the construction of the Desolate and appeared as an organic stone like construct. It was remarkably adaptive allowing the creator to mold it to the users form. Furthermore, it was capable of being shaped into weapons such as blades and clubs that would protrude from the armor. In addition to that, it was common for a hand held plasma cannon to be attached to the armor. Finally, a unique biological sensor allowed the user to acquire their targets even if they possessed cover from the environment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
