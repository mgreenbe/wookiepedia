To male Human smuggler Zeerid Korr, it looked much like a legless beetle with its landing ramp stuck out of its belly like a tongue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The starship was on the planet Ord Mantell when Arigo was waiting for a munitions drop from Zeerid Korr. A rival group of criminals, later assumed by Korr to be either pirates or hired mercenaries, took over the Doghouse at the drop point and waited for Korr to show up. When the smuggler arrived, the imposters tried to trick Korr into giving them the drop instead of Arigo. Korr surmised that they were not the ones who were supposed to pick up the cargo, and a short battle ensued. The ship was left behind as Korr killed the other criminals and escaped on Fatman."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Doghouse first appeared in Paul S.
