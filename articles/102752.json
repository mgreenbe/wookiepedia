A Padawan's master was meant to choose their apprentice, although, during the galactic Clone Wars, the Jedi High Council began to assign Padawans.

At the end of the war, however, Order 66 was enacted by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, forcing the clones to turn on the Jedi Order. Still, some Jedi survived and, under the guidance of two survivors, Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, Luke Skywalker was trained as a Jedi. Skywalker attempted to rebuild the Order, but the majority of his apprentices were killed and Ben Solo turned to the dark side of the Force. Years later, Rey, a scavenger from the world of Jakku, became the apprentice of Skywalker and later Leia Skywalker Organa Solo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Overview"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Padawan was a Force-sensitive who trained in the Jedi Order to one day become a full-fledged Jedi. Padawans were known as Jedi younglings at first, and trained in classroom settings with multiple students and a teacher. Once they were ready for combat training and intensive study and reached a certain age, Padawans were normally apprenticed to a Jedi Knight or Jedi Master, beginning their one-on-one training. While a Jedi was meant to choose the Padawan whom they wished to train, it was nevertheless part of their responsibility to train the next generation of the Order. Apprentices would often go on missions with their masters as part of this one-on-one training. The Code forbade a Jedi from training more than one Padawan or apprentice at a time. Most of the Padawans were known to grow or wear Padawan braids to symbolize their rank. After completing the Jedi Trials, a Padawan would be promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the High Republic Era, a common training experience for Padawans was to be placed at a Jedi outpost alongside their master in the Outer Rim Territories, helping to uphold justice in the yet to be explored region. Nevertheless, they were sometimes given off-world assignments that took them away from the outpost. Padawan Bell Zettifar and his master, Loden Greatstorm, were stationed at the Elphrona Outpost. When they were meant to be rotated back to the capital of Coruscant, Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh established a hyperspace blockade due to the Emergences, forcing the two Jedi to stay on Elphrona for some time. During the Nihil pirates' raid on Elphrona, Greatstorm informed his apprentice that he was worthy of the title of Jedi Knight, but\u2014after Greatstorm was captured by the Nihil\u2014Zettifar refused to go through the Jedi Trials until he was rescued, wanting his mentor to attend the ceremony."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the Jedi High Council began to assign Padawans to Jedi Knights, instead of allowing them to choose. During the war, Padawans were trained in combat and forged into officers of the Republic Military partly because of a lack of military leaders. Padawans held the rank of Jedi Commander and could lead forces of clone troopers as large as a regiment. This led to cases where young and inexperienced Padawans, many of them still teenagers, outranked clone troopers with far more experience in combat. At the end of the conflict, in 19 BBY, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, issued Clone Protocol 66, forcing the troopers to turn on their Jedi Generals and Commanders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the establishment of the Galactic Empire, a few ex-Padawans that had survived Order 66 or left the Jedi Order before the purge joined the nascent Rebel Alliance. This was the case of Anakin Skywalker's former apprentice, Ahsoka Tano, as well as Depa Billaba's former apprentice Caleb Dume, who became known as Kanan Jarrus and later took on a Padawan of his own, Ezra Bridger. By 0 BBY, Luke Skywalker, the son of Anakin Skywalker, began training under Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and later Yoda."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, which saw the deaths of both Emperor Palpatine and his apprentice Darth Vader, Skywalker attempted to rebuild the Jedi Order. However, his new generation of Jedi were killed by his nephew, Ben Solo, who fell to the dark side of the Force. Following this, Skywalker isolated himself on the Temple Island on the distant planet of Ahch-To. In 34 ABY, Rey, a scavenger from Jakku, arrived at the island to enlist him in the Resistance's fight against the First Order, and later became his apprentice. Despite his misgivings about the Jedi Order, Skywalker trained her on the Temple Island and had his faith in the Jedi restored after a conversation with Yoda's Force spirit. Following the Battle of Crait, General Leia Organa referred to Rey as having been Skywalker's apprentice to Ambassador Yendor of Ryloth. By the time of the return of Darth Sidious, in 35 ABY, Rey had begun training under Organa on Ajan Kloss, where the Resistance had established a secret base. Using her training, Rey would eventually go on to redeem Ben Solo and defeat Darth Sidious once and for all."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The term \"Padawan\" first appeared as far back in George Lucas's first story treatments for the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.[source?] It wasn't heard, however, before the filming of the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, the first installment of the prequel trilogy.
