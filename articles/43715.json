In 43.5 ABY, Galactic Alliance Chief of State Natasi Daala decided to have the retired Admiral Cha Niathal put on trial for dereliction of duty during the Second Galactic Civil War, to prove to the public that the Galactic Alliance government was treating military officials the same way that they had treated the Jedi Luke Skywalker, whom they had put on trial for the same reason.
