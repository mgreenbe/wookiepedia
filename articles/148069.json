Following the Battle of Endor, the junk dealer Temmin Wexley stole a crate from a transport belonging to the crime lord Surat Nuat, that had crashed on Trabzon Road. As a result, Surat sent several of his henchmen to punish the youth. However, Temmin and his B1-series battle droid Mister Bones defeated the henchmen.
