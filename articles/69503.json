While Fett and Wesell argued about the bounty on Bendix Fust, a Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft appeared and fired upon the ship, destroying it. In need of a new ship, Jango himself stole one of the prison's prototype Firespray class patrol craft, which he then used to destroy the remaining Firesprays in the hangar bay, and eventually named Slave I."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
