The theme reappears in Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, when Luke discusses how Han Solo and Leia left their son, Ben Solo, under his tutelage. The motif then transitions to \"Han Solo and the Princess.\" A full statement of the Skywalker siblings' leitmotif returns when Luke and Leia reunite at the Crait outpost. \"Luke and Leia\" is also played in The Rise of Skywalker, in the track \"Reunion.\" The beginning of the track is a faster rendition of a phrase from \"Luke and Leia,\" which transitions into the \"Star Wars Main Title\" and later \"The Force Theme\" as starships of the citizens' fleet gather on Ajan Kloss. After playing several other themes, the melody of \"Luke and Leia\" is played, at which point the screenplay depicts Landonis Balthazar Calrissian and Jannah conversing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The theme is also played in the Bond Unbroken music video on the Star Wars: A Musical Journey DVD.
