The production team for A New Hope referred to at least one of these Lutrillians as the Colonel, and at least one as the Hare Mouse. One or both of these characters was intended to be named Ownellco. However, in Star Wars Insider 130's Rogues Gallery: The Usual Suspects: Who's Who in Mos Eisley, published in December 2011, it was retconned that both of the Lutrillians seen in A New Hope were in fact Ownellco and Atheloe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the Lutrillian masks was later used in the cantina scenes in The Star Wars Holiday Special, marking Solomahal's first appearance.
