Sei'lya was present on Kothlis when their clan was assaulted by a rival clan using a reprogrammed 850.AA Public Service Headquarters that deployed Arakyd Industries Seekers. The Seekers slammed into the building's defenses and detonated. Sei'lya related on the entry for the droid that there was only circumstantial evidence that a rival clan was involved, and requested that anyone with evidence of who was behind the attack contact them at Margath's on Elshandruu Pica. The Bothan was offering a reward for any reliable information."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
