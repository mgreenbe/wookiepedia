At that time, the galaxy was facing the Yuuzhan Vong War, in which the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong species invaded the galaxy in order to conquer it. Although the Yuuzhan Vong initially ignored the Imperial Remnant, in 28 ABY the invaders assaulted the Sartinaynian system, which included the Imperial capital planet of Bastion, in the Battle of Bastion. During the battle, after the Imperial forces were forced to retreat from Bastion, the Superior and the Star Destroyer Chimaera, commanded by Imperial Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, fought a substantial Yuuzhan Vong group amongst the moons of a gas giant in the star system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although aided by multiple Imperial support vessels, the Superior and the Chimaera sustained heavy damage. Due to the Yuuzhan Vong forces arrayed against them, the pair of Star Destroyers could not make it to the planet Yaga Minor, where the Imperial Remnant was regrouping. With the Superior's hull holed with craters and in flames, Pellaeon ordered the warship's evacuation, and a medical frigate was used to transport the Superior's survivors to safety. On its journey to Yaga Minor, the medical frigate escaped the Sartinaynian system unscathed by using the wreckage of the Superior for cover as the dying Star Destroyer succumbed to the gravity well of the gas giant and plunged into its atmosphere."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Superior appeared in Force Heretic I: Remnant, a 2003 New Jedi Order novel written by Shane Dix and Sean Williams."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
