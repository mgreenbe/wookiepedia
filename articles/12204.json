They were native to the ruined world Balosar. Shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, the Balosar Elan Sleazebaggano attempted to sell the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi death sticks in the Outlander Club on the planet Coruscant, but the Jedi mind tricked the dealer into going home and rethinking his life. At around this time a male Balosar also served in the Jedi Order. During the reign of the Galactic Empire on the planet Lothal, the street urchin Ezra Bridger spotted a Balosar woman wearing a shimmersilk scarf around her antennapalps, which he valued at least one thousand credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
