In 0 ABY, shortly after turning 21, Nanda was appointed by Darth Vader, the Emperor's second-in-command, as the commanding officer of a squad of six elite stormtroopers, whose purpose was to deal with the mysterious slicers who had inserted a Rebel Alliance spy, Kell Bircher, into the Imperial Navy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Vader's mission of vengeance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nanda's first task was to fly their shuttle to the Data Center on Coruscant.

When Vader came back from his personal quarters, the Sith Lord ordered Nanda to set a course for the Alderaan system where, according to Intelligence reports, a X-wing starfighter would have been spotted along with an old Star Destroyer. Doubting the veracity of this information, Nanda tried to convince Vader that it was probably pointless to go there. She eventually complied when the Sith Lord insisted to go to the system \"at once.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon their arrival to the Alderaan system, Nanda detected the Audacity, a Venator-class Star Destroyer with a former Imperial scientist named Tag Rogaren on board.

When the six troopers came back with their new prisoner, they suddenly turned on Vader, who immediately attacked them with his lightsaber. However, exactly as Nanda feared, the ship's hull was damaged during the fight. After having taken care of the treacherous troopers, Vader ordered Nanda to maintain course while he would repair the damages. When the Sith Lord was done with sealing the hull and torturing Rogaren, he told Nanda to set a course for the Chandrila system, as he had noticed that the traitor Bircher had a slight Chandrilan accent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ensign Nanda was then sent by Vader to Bircher's childhood home on the planet of Chandrila.
