The ZZ-class freighter Mingula was to deliver Volpau's remains to Coruscant for ritual incineration; however, the fleshborers, still inside of Volpau's body, burst out of the casket and attacked the Zylurian crew, killing all four members; the Mingula was immobilized in outer space, its journey cut short."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later, the infamous bounty hunter Boba Fett discovered the lost ship and, looking for precious cargo to salvage, boarded it.
