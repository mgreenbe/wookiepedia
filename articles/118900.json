It could incapacitate even the toughest, most persistent malcontent, equipped with a powerful acoustic generator to fire a concentrated beam of sound waves that were similar in power and performance to particle-beam packets fired by other blasters. When used on sentient beings, it was capable of affecting a target's hearing and sense of balance, staggering them and shorting out their fine-motor centers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lightsabers were incapable of deflecting sonic energy and consequently made Jedi vulnerable to sonic weaponry, making the rifle popular among bounty hunters and the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
