J'Quille was played by mime artist Tim Dry, who was not credited. At the time, Dry was one half of the mime duo Tik and Tok with fellow mime artist Sean Crawford, and neither had ever appeared in a film before.

The entire outfit was fairly heavy to wear and extremely warm inside, meaning that Dry had to remove the head in between takes so that he could be cooled down with hair dryers to prevent overheating. This was particularly an issue during the filming of the sail barge scenes, which were shot in the Arizona desert."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The positions of J'Quille and each of the other extras in Jabba's Palace was chosen by first assistant director David Tomblin, who placed Dry and Crawford seated together in one of the palace's booths for their first scene.

Between the takes of this scene, Dry and Crawford befriended Luke Skywalker actor Mark Hamill, who was a similar age to them."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Naming"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Tooth Face\" first received the name J'Quille in the short story \"Let Us Prey: The Whiphid's Tale,\" written by Marina Fitch and Mark Budz, and included in the 1995 Star Wars Legends anthology book Tales from Jabba's Palace. The character's name was brought into the new Star Wars canon by the mobile app Star Wars: Force Collection, which was released on September 4, 2013. Although its release predates the reset of the Star Wars canon on April 25, 2014, following The Walt Disney Company's acquisition of the franchise, Lucasfilm Story Group member Leland Chee later confirmed that the game was kept updated to fit with canon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
