The campaign occurred when the Confederacy was pushed back to the spiral arms of the galaxy. Although the Republic continued to keep the pressure on the Separatists in these territories, the sieges also encompassed when General Grievous, the Supreme Commander of the Separatist Droid Army, launched an offensive, pushing the Republic Military to the brink. In response to the assault, Jedi Generals were deployed to help the Grand Army of the Republic. Although there was a stalemate for a time, the sieges ended up turning the tide of the war in the Republic's favor, making the Confederacy fear they would lose the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The sieges"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the Confederacy was initially successful in stretching the Jedi and clone armies thin throughout the Outer Rim, the strategy ultimately proved costly to the Separatists as the Republic continued to gain ground. Grievous' offensive resulted in the death of Admiral Trench on Anaxes, and the severe diminishing of the droid army and the Separatist fleet as the war entered into its final days. In addition to continued losses in the sieges, the loss of Count Dooku and much of the Separatist armada at Coruscant would continue to diminish not only the Separatist's ability to wage war in the Outer Rim, but also morale among the Separatist leaders, including Viceroy Nute Gunray, and lead them to doubt the Confederacy's chances of winning the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the campaign, the homeworld of Count Dooku, Serenno, became a focus for the Republic, but multiple attacks against both the D'Astan sector and the Serenno system itself failed to take the world. The sieges continued to take place until the final days of the Clone Wars. Battles that took place during the Sieges included the Battle of Anaxes, Siege of Saleucami, the Fourth Battle of Mygeeto, the Battle of Felucia, Conquest of Kaller, and the Battle of Yerbana. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker fought in the Outer Rim Sieges before being recalled for the Battle of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the rescue of Chancellor Palpatine, Grievous retreated to the Outer Rim world of Utapau, where he deployed the already severely depleted droid army across numerous systems in hopes of pushing the Republic back. However, his eventual defeat on Utapau would bring further destabilization of the Separatist command structure, and following Order 66 and the execution of the Separatist Council on Mustafar and the deactivation of the droid armies, the sieges, and the war as a whole, came to an end."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
