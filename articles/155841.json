During one adventure, the bounty hunter had to rescue a child who wrestled a pirate out of an airlock. Using a parachute and an ablative heatshield, the hunter dove from orbit over the planet Dantooine to the surface to save the kid. They parted ways sometime after. Later, while on the methane planet Farstine, the hunter encountered another child. Orphaned, homeless, and penniless, the child was down to his last fifteen minutes of oxygen. The hunter, reminded of a brother who had died young, took the child under their protection."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
