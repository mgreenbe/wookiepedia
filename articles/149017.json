Hailing from Secundus Ando, he acquitted himself in engagements with the Galactic Republic, all the while savoring the terror he struck in his enemies. Years after his purported death at the Battle of Malastare Narrows, he resurfaced during the Clone Wars, becoming a key officer in the navy of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. From the dreadnought Invincible he oversaw the Confederate blockade of Christophsis, which brought him into conflict with a Republic battle group led by Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker along with an old foe, Admiral Wullf Yularen. When Skywalker and Yularen attempted to use an experimental stealth ship to breach the blockade, Trench began a deadly game of cat and mouse with them. Though Skywalker outwitted him by redirecting a volley of tracking torpedoes at the Invincible, Trench managed to survive his flagship's demise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Ringo Vinda, Trench captured clone trooper Tup\u2014who had mysteriously gunned down Jedi General Tiplar\u2014and tried to send the clone to Separatist leader Count Dooku for examination, though a Republic team intervened and rescued Tup. In the Battle of Anaxes, Trench besieged the Republic shipyards at Anaxes for weeks on end, exploiting the Techno Union's secret access to a Republic strategy algorithm. Even as the tide of battle began to turn, Trench remained intent on annihilating the Jedi and their clone infantry. Though he activated a bomb beneath the assembly complex on Anaxes, Skywalker infiltrated Trench's flagship and forced the admiral to divulge the sequence to disarm the device. When Trench tried to retaliate, Skywalker drove his lightsaber through his chest, inflicting a death that even the hardened Harch could not escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A remarkably tough male Harch who hailed from Secundus Ando, Trench saw service in multiple battles throughout his military career, mostly in cruiser-to-cruiser action. In some of these battles he would fight against forces utilizing cloaked starships, defeating them through the use of tracking torpedoes fixed on the vessels' magnetic signatures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trench would eventually rise to command a corporate fleet that blockaded the planet Malastare. Trench was able to hold his lines against a Republic fleet led by Wullf Yularen sent to break the blockade, tearing their ships apart. However, a Jedi-led taskforce commanded by Master Kep-She was able to defeat Trench, vaporizing his flagship and seemingly killing him in the process. In reality, however, Trench survived the battle with the help of the Harch's hardy biology as well as a damaged pressure suit."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Blockade of Christophsis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trench, along with his tactical droid, TI-99, were then sent to Christophsis to assist General Loathsom and Count Dooku's assassin, Asajj Ventress in seizing the planet for the Confederacy, and blockading the planet to tighten their grip of the system. There, he commanded the blockade from his war-painted flagship, the Invincible, to prevent Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan and other republic relief forces from being resupplied and to cripple any attempts to penetrate the blockade. Trench then held his lines against Jedi General Anakin Skywalker's fleet. Trench then watched as the Republic fleet retreated by the moon and had his force recharge their cannons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Jedi retreated and regrouped, Trench felt that he had won the first round. His tactical droid was puzzled and asked Trench if they should pursue. The Admiral instead ordered his troops not to follow the enemy, as per the commands he was issued by higher authority; after which, Trench commanded his droids to recycle the ship's shields and allow the cannons to recharge to full power. The Admiral, satisfied with the proceedings, seated himself at the bridge and awaited for the return of the enemy ships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Trench's old adversary from Malastare Narrows, Admiral Wullf Yularen, was also present with Skywalker at the battle. After recognizing Trench's trademark insignia painted on his flagship, Yularen studied everything Republic Intelligence had provided on the Admiral's tactics, allowing him to plan a counter-attack. This came in the form of an experimental stealth ship, piloted by Anakin Skywalker himself and Admiral Yularen as an adviser. Unaware of the existence and capabilities of the cloaked ship,Trench then grew impatient with the Republic fleet and to put pressure on the Republic fleet to attack, Trench sent a squadron of Hyena bombers to attack Organa's refugee camp, particularly the command center as a plan to draw out the Republic on the surface who Trench viewed as \"cowards.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Republic fleet did not attack, Trench understood that something odd was happening. Trench then spotted a cloaked ship moving to attack him. Trench and his crew were then able to raise the Invincible's thermal shields. Trench fired torpedoes at the stealth ship, but missed. Trench then ordered a volley of lasers to be fired at it, and since no shots landed, Trench was able to deduce that the pilot was a Jedi, not a clone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trench sent a message to Skywalker, telling him that he has dealt with cloaked ships before. He also gloated that Christophsis' citizens and resources would join the Separatist Alliance. Trench also told Skywalker to retreat, for he was his doom. Trench prepared himself for the Jedi's inevitable second offensive. Eventually the cloaked vessel revealed itself, but this time, the crew had knowledge of Trench's tactics when dealing with ship cloaking devices."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Skywalker attacked, Trench was able to track the ship's magnetic signature using tracking torpedoes so he could follow and destroy them. At first, Trench's tactic worked. However, he would be forced to lower his shields to do so and the droid advised that such a maneuver would be unwise. In a moment of compulsive anger (and against his droid's advice), Trench gave the order and the torpedoes were launched. He noticed that Skywalker was leading the torpedoes back to the Invincible's bridge. Trench tried to raise his shields, to no avail. Trench accepted his fate, but was able to survive once again. However, he lost his left eye and several of his appendages."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Battle of Ringo Vinda"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trench, alongside the super tactical droid Kraken, later commanded the Separatist forces on the space station at Ringo Vinda against Jedi Generals Tiplee, Tiplar, Skywalker, and their clone forces. As the Republic came close to breaking his lines, Trench witnessed one of the clone troopers kill General Tiplar. Trench then contacted Count Dooku and described his observations, telling him that the clone looked \"like he was in a trance of some kind.\" Trench's observation for minor details proved vital as it allowed Dooku and his Sith Master, Darth Sidious, to create a cover-up before the Jedi Order could discover the existence of Protocol 66 prematurely. Trench then had Kraken capture and deliver the clone to Dooku, despite the Republic's blockade. After successfully kidnapping the clone trooper \"Tup,\" the Count applauded the Harch's success, Trench then tasked Kraken to personally escort the captured Clone to Dooku himself. However, the mission failed as the Republic recaptured Tup and Kraken was decapitated by Anakin Skywalker. Following the recapture of Tup, the Republic eventually withdrew its forces from Ringo Vinda."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Battle for Anaxes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the Clone Wars, Trench, now on the offensive, commanded the Confederate forces during the Battle of Anaxes, fighting for the Republic's vital shipyards on Anaxes in a campaign which lasted for several weeks. Trench used his own tactical acumen, as well as using Clone Captain CT-7567's strategy algorithm against them using the Techno Union's test subject on Skako Minor, a captured ARC trooper named \"Echo\". Trench was killed by Skywalker after Clone Force 99, Rex, Anakin Skywalker, and Echo boarded his ship as Trench primed a bomb planted on the planet surface. Echo was able to decipher all but the final sequence for the bomb, forcing Anakin Skywalker to ambush Trench. The Jedi Knight destroyed Trench's super tactical droid and BX-series droid commandos, and then threatened the admiral's life to get the final sequence for the detonation code. While Anakin was preoccupied giving Jedi General Mace Windu the final sequence, Trench took advantage of the Jedi's distraction by electrocuting him. This action prompted Anakin to retaliate, thrusting his lightsaber and impaling the Harch Admiral through the chest, pinning him against his chair, allowing Anakin to acquire the self destruct detonator of the flagship and indifferently bid the admiral a final farewell as Trench collapsed onto the floor dead. With Clone Force 99 escaping, they planted remote detonators along the corridors and activated them after leaving the ship, vaporizing Trench's body along with several of his ship and putting the end to the battles on Anaxes."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Trench's flagship, the Invincible, was destroyed by Anakin Skywalker in a cloaked stealth ship during the Battle of Christophsis, some of the flagship's modules were salvaged and used to modify a Separatist dreadnought owned by Berch Teller's rebel cell to attack the Empire's Sentinel Base in 14 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trench was a fearsome Harch admiral who was far larger than the average member of his species, as the arachnids seldom grew to such size due their exoskeletons not being able to bear the weight of the fur."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trench became a terror on the battlefield, as he held no mercy or remorse toward his opponents. He was a well-decorated military genius and his aggressive tactics and maneuvers in combat made him responsible for the destruction of many Republic fleets.

Trench often viewed his battles like a game and would often cajole and taunt his enemies as he made his moves, before leading them into a vulnerable position where he could eliminate them. However, his overconfidence nearly led to his own demise at the hands of Anakin Skywalker when he made an uncharacteristic oversight which left himself vulnerable to incoming missiles. Even when his death appeared imminent, Trench did not panic or show distress; he simply accepted his fate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following his defeat, Trench was immediately fitted with \"top-of-the-line\" cybernetics making up half of his limbs and face to ensure his quick return to service.
