Initially a mission by the Resistance to find allies and sanctuary on Batuu and an occupation by the First Order when it deployed the 709th Legion to occupy Black Spire Outpost and capture or kill Resistance fugitives, it erupted into a battle between the two factions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The loss of the Resistance base on D'Qar forced the Resistance High Command to evacuate their base.

While questioning the Ithorian shopkeeper, the sergeant inspected one of the relics\u2014the lightsaber of Jedi General Ki-Adi-Mundi, who fought in the Clone Wars until he was betrayed and executed by his clone troopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dok-Ondar interpreted the sergeant's questions as veiled threats and claimed he was nothing more than a humble proprietor, but the sergeant had heard of his reputation for selling valuable relics for the right price, which led him to believe that the Resistance would seek out Dok-Ondar in order to acquire the Jedi lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the stormtroopers could leave, having warned Dok-Ondar to report any contact with the Resistance or suffer the confiscation and destruction of property, the Ithorian took note of the sergeant's ignorance of galactic history and felt the need to explain how he procured the lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Supreme Leader Kylo Ren later arrived at Batuu on board the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer. While the bulk of the 709th operated within Black Spire Outpost, First Order Mountain troopers patrolled the mountain ranges surrounding the outpost for Resistance activity. On the surface, Ren confronted Resistance spy Vi Moradi. The Jedi Rey dueled Ren, but he was forced to leave when he was alerted to an \"incident\" on the destroyer."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Batuu"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Members of a Resistance group stationed at a base in the Black Spire Ruins on Batuu were briefed on a mission by Resistance operative Rey via a hologram projected by BB-8. The team boarded an Intersystem Transport Ship commanded by Lieutenant Bek and piloted by Nien Nunb. While being escorted by Poe Dameron in his X-wing, along with other X-wings, the transport crossed paths with the Finalizer, got caught in its tractor beam, and was brought on board. Dameron's fighters were forced to flee the scene in order to go for help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Resistance members were taken captive and scheduled to be interrogated before they were broken out of their cell by another group of Resistance operatives who had infiltrated the ship. They included Finn, who was secretly on board disguised as a stormtrooper. During their escape in a First Order Fleet Transport vehicle, the Resistance members crossed paths with stormtroopers, All Terrain Armored Transports, and Kylo Ren. The crew of the First Order ship was taken by surprise when a large group of Resistance starfighters, bombers, frigates and other vessels jumped out of hyperspace led by Dameron in his fighter, starting the attack. The Resistance fleet engaged the Star Destroyers, while starfighters attacked one another. During the engagement the fleeing recruits were nearly captured by Kylo Ren before a Vakbeor-class cargo frigate broadsided the Star Destroyer, but was soon destroyed by overwhelming attacks from the Finalizer's weapons emplacements. The recruits' transport then boarded an escape pod that traveled through the space battle and returned them back to the ruins on Batuu, where their pod and Bek's came in for a rough, but relatively safe landing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the heavy damage sustained by the Finalizer during the battle, Kylo Ren transferred his command to his new flagship, the Steadfast.

Similarly, delays in unloading transports after the return to Batuu will result in audio dialog of Finn arguing with the R5 units, which want greater compensation for their assistance, as well as comm chatter regarding the search for Bek's escape pod, the continued progress of the space battle, and additional pods coming in behind you."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
