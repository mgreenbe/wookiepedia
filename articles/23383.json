Republic Supreme Chancellor Dorian Janarus discovered this and thought that this fleet might undermine the Republic success on Corellia; so Janarus sent the Barsen'thor, supported by a fleet of the Rift Alliance, to intercept and destroy the Imperial fleet.\nWhile the Rift warships engaged the Sith fleet the Barsen'thor and his party boarded the capital ship to capture it. Unfortunately once on board he discovered that it was a trap, and the Javelin was rigged with enough explosives to destroy the Rift fleet; but the Barsen'thor successfully disarmed enough of the detonators on the ship to save saving the fleet. However, one of his companions stayed behind in order to download essential data that the Imperials tried to erase from the dreadnaught's computers. The Jedi's companion managed to escape from the ship before it exploded by using one of the escape pods to land on Corellia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unfortunately, the companion went missing after landing on the planet, so the Barsen'thor and his forces set course for Corellia in order to find his missing ally."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
