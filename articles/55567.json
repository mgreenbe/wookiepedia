They were popularly favored as food by many humanoid species (including on Tatooine), either dried, fricasseed, or roasted in manak leaves.

Different types of gorgs were eventually introduced to the populations of Naboo and its moon of Rori, where they evolved to become large, flesh-eating creatures. Gorgs were also known to be mutated by bio-engineers. One such mutation resulted in the successful growth of a chubafly. The chubafly was essentially a colorful gorg, but with wings that made it capable of flying."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometimes, during times of great drought on their native world of Tatooine, gorgs hibernate in burrows, encasing themselves in a cocoon of hardened saliva. Occasionally, these burrows that gorgs use for general shelter and hibernating could be within profogg \"towns\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Natural predators include worrts, which the gorgs themselves are somewhat similar to, but smaller and more ambulatory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Gorgs in the Galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gorg eggs were edible and were used, poached, as an ingredient in \"Hungry Hutt\" breakfast sandwiches on Nar Shaddaa and Coruscant in Dex's Diner.

Soon, the specimen would lay eggs, which would then hatch into tadpoles after several days. The gorgmonger would then separate these hatchlings from the adult (as adult gorgs will devour their young) and raise them to maturity. Only then could the amphibians be sold in the bazaar or marketplace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Gragra left Mos Espa to work elsewhere, this caused the gorg population in the sewers to grow considerably over the following years.

Shocked at the cost, Binks spat the gorg out, inadvertently ruining Sebulba's meal in the process and nearly being beaten to a pulp by an enraged Sebulba until Anakin Skywalker broke up the fight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gorgs were a favored food of Jabba Desilijic Tiure.
