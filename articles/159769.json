Veamon appeared again in Jedi Knight's 1998 expansion pack, Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith. Mysteries of the Sith introduced \"multiplayer personalities,\" a form of character creation that put different character models under different professions, with each profession having their own set of starting weapons for a match. In the game, Veamon was categorized as a scout. Veamon's species and gender were never specified in the character's appearances."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Veamon had blue colored skin, the character model had light-colored hands. While all multiplayer player models shared a right hand due to the in-game models used for displaying a held weapon, Veamon's left hand was also light-skin colored. Whether or not Veamon had light-colored hands or if the character was merely wearing gloves cannot be definitively determined from the games."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
