In 3642 BBY, they were stationed on Quesh during the Quesh war. After the Republic's Manka-class armored transport began to disrupt Imperial mining operations, Moff Dracen dispatched Bravo Team on the Operation Tripwire. The Imperials were ordered to plant proximity explosives, specially calibrated to cripple the Republic walker convoy, at checkpoints along a bridge on a walker route. However, Bravo Team was killed before they completed their mission, and Moff Dracen was forced to rely on other Imperial operatives to plant and detonate the explosives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bravo Team is mentioned in the Star Wars: The Old Republic during the \"Walker Tripping\" mission on Quesh."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
