Under Solo's orders, T-2LC followed the heavily pregnant Organa closely all the time to ensure that she did not fall over. Shortly prior to the Battle of Jakku, Senator Tolwar Wartol, a rival of Chancellor Mon Mothma, secretly installed a listening device inside T-2LC in order to spy on the chancellor and her circle of friends including Organa. When Solo once returned with a bag of jogan fruits, T-2LC was too slow to open the door and Organa was forced to do it herself. While Organa and Solo were talking, T-2LC reported that Organa had received a hologram call from the New Republic operative Norra Wexley."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "T-2LC was present when Norra's son, Temmin Wexley and the former Imperial loyalty officer, Sinjir Rath Velus visited Organa's domicile to inform her that the Imperial remnants had relocated to the planet Jakku. T-2LC remained in the background when Chancellor Mothma entered the room and questioned the informants about what they had seen on Jakku. T-2LC shadowed Organa when she and Solo allowed Temmin and Velus to borrow the YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon. Unknown to T-2LC and the others, Wartol was listening to their conversations. He leaked news about the Imperial presence on Jakku to the press and accused Mothma of being weak. Later, Wartol sent Senate Guards to prevent Temmin and Velus from leaving aboard the Falcon to head to Jakku."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Velus suspected that there was a listening bug in Organa's domicile, he contacted his former lover Conder Kyl to investigate.

He was programmed to serve as a nanny droid. T-2LC followed Han Solo's instructions to the letter to the extent that Organa sometimes almost tripped over his metal feet.
