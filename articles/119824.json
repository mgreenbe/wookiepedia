When he and his party stole into the Sand Peoples' enclave wearing robes taken from a dead ambush party, ostensibly on a mission for Czerka Corporation to destroy the Sand People, they were able to meet with the chieftain and discuss terms for a cessation of hostilities, thanks to HK-47's translation abilities. In exchange for providing the tribe with moisture vaporators so that they could build up supplies of water, the chieftain agreed to move the tribe further away from the settlement and reduce their attacks on miners. Revan asked for the attacks to stop completely, but the chieftain said it would never happen because outsiders were constantly desecrating their customs and they needed to respond accordingly. Revan agreed to the deal and promised to give him the vaporators. The chieftain said he would wait but he did not believe the Jedi would return."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Revan does unexpectedly return with the vaporators, the chieftain then agreed to release a trio of captive Jawas in addition to Griff, the elder brother of Twi'lek party member Mission Vao. Though the chieftain stated he still did not trust Revan, he presented his gaffi stick to the Jedi as a gesture of good faith. Eventually, the chieftain led his people to another part of Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In one alternate ending, the chieftain allows Revan and his party to free Griff Vao and the imprisoned Jawas in exchange for a krayt dragon pearl."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the dark side ending, Revan somehow gives the Sand People cause to attack him, thus resulting in the party killing the entire Sand People tribe.

You must first prove yourself as a warrior by killing a krayt dragon and bring back the pearl.

If you're not careful asking questions despite HK-47's warnings the whole tribe may attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
