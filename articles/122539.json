Smaller than the Galactic Senate Chamber, the Senate Hearing Chamber boasted 20 tiers, repulsorpods for several hundred senators, and seating for news correspondents and onlookers. As some beings observed, the chamber, due to the nature of the kinds of meetings that were generally held there, was not normally packed with overflow crowds. Senate Hearing Chamber meetings were usually \"so dull,\" according to Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, that \"no one attended them.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On occasion, however, such as occurred in 24 BBY, when a sensationalist hearing took place that heard witnesses testify against the Jedi Order for alleged abuses against the Republic, filling the pods, seats and tier aisles, beyond the Senators and their aides, were officials of the HoloNet news and curious Coruscant natives. Kenobi, accustomed to rather something different for this space, was therefore quite surprised at the turnout."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
