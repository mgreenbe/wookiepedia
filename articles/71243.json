A freelance scout by trade, Jobany was sympathetic to the Alliance's cause during the Galactic Civil War, and helped them scout many bases. However, his ancestry gave him a deep sense of nostalgia, and his scouting reports often read like travelogues. He traveled the galaxy in the modified Pathfinder-class scout ship Outward Bound."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
