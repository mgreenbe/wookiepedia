The HoloNet News section contains six news items and video clips that were progressively released in the build-up to the release of the game. These clips are accompanied by in-universe text blurbs in the form of news bulletins. The Train section contains two mini-games, Jedi Force Jump and Clone Weapons Training. These mini-games mirror the setting of the video game itself, and they also allow up to thirty players to join together in a platoon. The Holocomm section has a video briefing designed to link with a webcam. When entering the promotion, users generate a character by specifying a homeworld, droid companion, starship, race and other variables.
