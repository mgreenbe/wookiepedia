On the station, he ran Tasia's Tapcaf\u00e9, which specialized in food from his homeworld, on a hangar deck level. After the Empire's destruction of Alderaan, his restaurant turned into a rallying point for other Alderaanian survivors and those harboring hatred for the Empire. Brux feared drawing the ire of the Imperial Security Bureau and so discouraged open rebellion amongst his customers, focusing instead on collecting pieces of Alderaanian spirit and culture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brux was thin and bearded during the time he worked on the Wheel. Prior to the destruction of Alderaan, Brux was more concerned with the running of his restaurant than he was with any galactic politics. After the loss of his homeworld, however, Brux became sad and angry, commiserating with the other survivors and anti-Imperialists who frequented his tapcafe. His fear of trouble from the Imperial Security Bureau outweighed any wish for anti-Imperial action he had, and so he discouraged open rebellion amongst dissenters in his shop. Nonetheless, he hoped to one day join the Alliance himself, although he was unsure whom to trust with such matters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brun Brux was first introduced in Beyond the Rim, an adventure module written by Sterling Hershey in 2013 for the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game Star Wars: Edge of the Empire.
