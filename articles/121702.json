The plan worked perfectly and the Yinchorri fighters went after them, allowing the cruiser to evade them and land at a floating platform on gassy Yibikkoror. The Jedi barely escaped their Yinchorri pursuers, though they all managed to reach their destinations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Yitheeth and Yibikkoror, after brief confrontations with Yinchorri warriors, the two groups realized that the command center was not on their planet.
