These Gands did not possess lungs and therefore did not respire; they obtained their bodies' necessary metabolic ingredients through the ingestion of their food. The ingested materials aided in gas exchange and waste would be passed through openings in the exoskeleton. Unlike the breather race, lungless Gands could venture offworld without the need of respiratory equipment, though some would wear such equipment anyway, usually to maintain anonymity. Lungless Gands spoke their native language and did not possess the proper vocal cords to speak Basic. In order to do so, they required the aid of a muscular gas bladder that allowed them to draw in and expel gases at a controlled rate through the exoskeleton. Pieces of the exoskeleton would then vibrate to approximate speech."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ooryl Qrygg, a pilot with Rogue Squadron, was a member of this subspecies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
