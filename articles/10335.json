Zan Arbor had, along with deposed Romin dictator Roy Teda, escaped from an uprising of the Romin people aboard a star yacht navigated by con-artist Roper Slam and his gang. The Jedi tracked the criminals to the Mid-Rim planet of Falleen, near the Corellian Run, where they hoped to find and apprehend Granta Omega, with whom Zan Arbor and Teda were rendezvousing, for they'd discovered that the malicious trio were plotting a major operation against the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Believing themselves to be on the brink of finding Omega within his secret drug-manufacturing and -testing facility on the outskirts of Falleen's capital city, the Jedi teams were unexpectedly summoned back to Coruscant by Jedi High Council member Master Mace Windu, who informed them that the Galactic Senate, based on a growing tide of anti-Jedi feeling among its members, was considering withdrawal of its sponsorship of the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Windu and the Jedi teams met with Chancellor Palpatine, who informed them that leading the charge of the anti-Jedi faction was obscure Nuralee Senator Bog Divinian, husband of Kenobi's friend Astri Oddo. In speaking with Senatorial aide Tyro Caladian (also a longtime friend of the Jedi Knight), Kenobi began to believe that Granta Omega was behind the debate to withdraw Senatorial support of the Jedi and that the Senate argument was in some way connected to the major criminal operation the Jedi knew Omega had been planning with Zan Arbor. It was shortly thereafter that the Jedi found evidence suggesting that Omega and Zan Arbor were indeed planning a major treasury heist of crystalline vertex, to take place at the inaugural ceremony for the All Planets Relief Fund in the Bank of the Core Plaza."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, however, the heist\u2014carried out by the Slam gang\u2014served only to divert to the plaza all Senate security personnel from a massive assassination attempt of Omega and Zan Arbor's true target\u2014thousands of Galactic Senators with their top advisors, and Chancellor Palpatine, who was presiding over the full-Senate debate in the Galactic Senate Building on whether to bar the Jedi Order from further action on behalf of the Senate. Indeed, Omega proved to be the mastermind of the debate itself, for it was the result of a petition that originated with Omega's early sponsor, Eeropha Senator Sano Sauro and brought to fruition by Senator Bog Divinian and dictator Roy Teda. The conspirators hoped to eliminate both Jedi interference and Palpatine in a single day."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the evil plot was ultimately foiled by the Jedi, and Senate support of the Order was not only retained but strengthened, the attack on the Senate Building left 46 individuals dead, and Granta Omega and Jenna Zan Arbor managed, once again, to escape the reach of both the Jedi and Republic justice."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Flight to Falleen"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obi-Wan Kenobi felt as if he'd been chasing an elusive shadow for years. In fact, he had. A shadow in the form of one man\u2014Force Blank Granta Omega. The Jedi Master had vowed each time that the encounter would be their last. Two Jedi teams had sped from Romin to the Mid-Rim world of Falleen in their pursuit of Omega. The galactic criminal's flight with mad scientist Jenna Zan Arbor and Romin's deposed dictator Roy Teda begged a showdown, which Kenobi felt was near. But like the other encounters with Omega, Obi-Wan sensed that it wouldn't come in a manner of his own choosing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It had been a day since the Jedi had landed on Falleen and, dressed as travelers, they had continued their tracking of the three criminals through the booming center of commerce and industry that was Falleen Throne, the planet's capital city. Searching the three-tiered city packed with diverse beings, they could not pinpoint Omega's position, nor did they know why he was on Falleen. He seemed one step ahead again. Kenobi was in danger of repeating the scenario: bursting into an empty room, only to see an escaping transport take off. Obi-Wan's Padawan had somehow escaped this kind of haunting defeat, for Anakin Skywalker didn't contemplate the possibility of failure, though he was haunted by things so deep that they couldn't be shared at one time with his Master. Sometimes Kenobi even believed that Anakin's dark internal shadow had vanished, that he was finally at ease with his formidable gifts, and that he'd at last conquered his struggle to accept his role as the Chosen One."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin had been able to confront and release many of his fears while on Romin, where he'd been under the influence of Zan Arbor's secret drug, the Zone of Self-Containment. It could make beings feel blissfully, if dangerously, content, allowing them to forget their cares, or any need to take action. Even so, the criminal scientist hadn't yet learned how to transmit the drug to more than a few individuals at a time. Now, Omega, Zan Arbor, and Teda, with the enlisted help of the Slam gang, were poised to execute a major criminal operation in the Core Worlds, and the Jedi suspected they would use \"the Zone\" to do it. Along with Siri Tachi and her Padawan Ferus Olin, the Jedi were now in the process of investigating the origins of Falleen's thriving businesses and major corporations, hoping to find any ties to Omega, but weapons merchants hid so often behind other companies that the Jedi weren't investing too much in actually tracing who owned what. Even so, they wanted to investigate a new factory\u2014Blackwater Systems, beyond the city outskirts\u2014already marked by a bad reputation among the Falleens because it had been built so quickly and was the worst on the planet for hiding its illegal practices and making bribes to the government to overlook safety violations and keep inspectors away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hopping on a cloud bus, they arrived at their destination, exiting at the last available stop, then walking the rest of the way in the bitterly cold wind that howled off the plains from distant mountain ice-sheets. They were in the Yellow District\u2014so named for the constant haze of color that hung in the sky from factory-belched toxins. The Blackwater Factory, windowless and built of black durasteel and stone, was at line's end, more than two kilometers from the last cloud-bus stop. Almost immediately, Master Kenobi felt a surge in the Force: the Jedi were being tracked by surveillance droids. From the facility's main walkway, they darted into a narrow side alley and began to run. They had passed several smaller outbuildings when Skywalker's Force-sensitivity picked up something, and he bade the group follow him through a maze of gravsleds and durasteel bins marked as waste. The entire area was barren, void of life\u2014no living creature would linger in such a place. A lofty stone wall brought the Jedi to a halt; they could hear a crowd of beings on the other side of it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Activating their cable launchers, the Jedi scaled the wall and saw a female Falleen speaking passionately through an amplifier headset to a crowd of on-lookers. Jumping down, the Jedi moved quickly and covertly through the crowd. Having doubled back in their race to lose the droids, they were now outside the factory's main gate. They learned from the Falleen's interaction with the crowd that no one apparently knew what the wastes produced by the company were, nor how they were disposed of; that unknown experiments were being conducted in the factory's secret wing; that four factory workers, over a period of three months, had died without any reports filed on their deaths; and that the protesters were committed to making the company obey their world's laws, even if their planetary leaders failed to do so: they were prepared to enter the facility by force, if necessary, to obtain their evidence against Blackwater Systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the Falleen's signal, a small explosive charge broke open the company gates and the crowd surged forward with a great shout. The Jedi were caught in the midst, moving forward with them. But suddenly, attack droids flew out of the facility, and the crowd\u2014understanding that these droids were programmed to kill, not stun\u2014retreated in a panic as the Jedi continued forward towards the droids. The Falleen leader didn't retreat but instead broke toward the alleys, pursued by two droids. Obi-Wan and Anakin followed; both understood the need to speak with the Falleen. Anakin moved with astonishing speed and took down the trackers with his lightsaber, leaving them in smoking ruins. Siri and Ferus joined them and they raced to the wall, where they saw the Falleen trying, without success, to scale it. Setting her at ease by telling her that they weren't from Blackwater, Siri reported that the pursuing droids had crashed into each other and were destroyed. The Falleen advised her mysterious would-be rescuers that they not linger, as Blackwater had her vitals and would soon find her. Admiring her bravery, they told her the wall wasn't a problem: within moments all four Jedi and the Falleen had scaled it with cable launchers and dropped to the other side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Introducing herself as Mazara, the Falleen told the Jedi she knew a back way to the cloud-bus stop, which they then took behind the factory, having to scale the locked gates between properties to reach the un-monitored plains. Mazara stated to them her disgust of Blackwater, but also the disgust she felt for her fellow Falleen, who, while growing distressed with the situation, were not doing anything about it. Mazara wasn't a natural activist\u2014she'd started out as a journalist before being fired for writing an article on Blackwater\u2014but both sky and land were turning into dumping grounds, and she could not watch happen to her homeworld what she'd seen happen on other worlds. Mazara had targeted Blackwater because they were the worst offenders of all the planetary corporations. Whenever an investigation into a death was done, the results always put the worker at fault. When the Jedi asked Mazara if she knew who the company owners were, she said her investigations had come up empty\u2014Blackwater was murkier than most when it came to the game of companies hiding behind companies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mazara, of course, was too shrewd to swallow their explanation about the crashing droids. She knew they weren't factory workers and guessed that they had taken down the droids themselves\u2014that they were, in fact, Jedi. There was word on the streets, moreover, that those who identified Jedi would be paid for it. Now it was Mazara's turn to put the Jedi at ease, by telling them they could trust her. In reply to her query if they'd come to help the protesters' cause, the Jedi said that they'd come to investigate several of Falleen's factories. Mazara welcomed the news, as now the Galactic Senate might be informed of their plight. The Jedi knew that the Senate, of course, was ill-prepared to come to Falleen's aid, however, roiled as it was in its own problems with the new Separatist movement that frayed old loyalties as it created new alliances; legislative procedure was blocking petitions from needy planets in a bureaucratic quagmire of the Senate's own making."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though she wasn't familiar with Omega's name, Mazara knew who the ousted Teda was, lamenting that her planet seemed to be attracting the galaxy's worst, these days. The deposed tyrant was staying at a reclusive hotel reserved for the ultra-rich, but no one was staying with him, meaning that he and Zan Arbor had probably parted ways, at least in the strictly physical sense. Beyond the deaths at Blackwater, Mazara also disclosed that there had been illnesses as well, which couldn't be diagnosed, but which resulted most likely because the Falleen were forced to work in the factory's water tunnels (their species had a natural ability to be submersed for long periods of time). The mention of water tunnels raised warning flags for the Jedi, as Zan Arbor was still working to perfect mass-transmission of her drugs through water, particularly her newest, the Zone of Self-Containment. The transmission experiments were reserved for the factory's secret wing; workers were forced to sign a statement of confidentiality in order to work there. Obi-Wan asked Mazara if she could get them inside the factory to examine the secret wing. She told them, with a Falleen working in the employment office, she could, but that after that, they were on their own."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Escaping Blackwater"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Siri and Ferus went to investigate Teda's hotel holdout early the next morning, Mazara was able to get Obi-Wan and Anakin into the factory as workers. In the frigid morning air, Skywalker joked with Olin, asking him why he got to hang around a luxury hotel while Anakin had to freeze on a factory floor. Kenobi was encouraged by the Padawans' easy banter and exchange. While on Romin, Ferus had spoken to Obi-Wan and unburdened himself of his fears about Anakin. Though Kenobi had been both irritated and alarmed by Olin's insights, the mere expression of his worries seemed to have freed Ferus to relax a bit more around Anakin, and the tension between the two of them had eased considerably."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obi-Wan and Anakin soon were off with the other workers to begin their day at the Yellow District factory. Their job interview with Wanuri, the employment officer, was a mere formality, and they were immediately issued passes to the main factory floor. Though they'd wanted assignment to the secret transmission wing, Wanuri told them he couldn't manage that even for Mazara; they would have to settle for their regular shift, which ended precisely at six, as the night shift had been canceled. As the last hire always swept the factory floor, Kenobi and Skywalker were to ensure that they locked the hydromop and repulsorbroom back in the utility closet and that they not stay, as the security droids made a sweep of the facility every fifteen minutes thereafter. But Wanuri's last instruction was, again, a stock formality, as he well knew why they were there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clipping their security swipe cards to their red unisuits, the two Jedi were split up by their assigned manager to different areas of the facility, with each area being sealed off from the next area. Kenobi could only guess that the canisters (for which he was checking injection levels) contained the Zone, but he had no way of knowing if it was packaged as liquid or gas or some other kind of suspended particle. Deeply carved troughs carried waste through the floors, which was then flushed to outflow valves: unfortunate was the worker who stepped or fell into a trough\u2014 without decontamination rooms like other factories had, there was no way to know if the substance was indeed toxic. The dull work was made less so by light supervision (the machines rarely made mistakes), but oddly, no central authority existed for work or quality control. This worried Kenobi somewhat, as it wasn't like Omega or Zan Arbor. At break he met with Anakin, who said he'd learned that all the managers had changed two weeks before, and the workers, to their relief, didn't have to work as hard. Obi-Wan's uneasiness continued until just before closing time, when he reunited with his Padawan to clean the factory floor. When the buzzer sounded for all to retire, the two Jedi headed to the utility closet to return their cleaning equipment, but then stayed inside the closet and didn't exit until they heard the last worker leave, the passing security droid complete it first round, and the building locks slam down for the night."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quietly exiting the closet, and with about eleven minutes until the next droid sweep, they headed for the restricted wing, where they were faced with a double-coded door lock; their cards would work if they could override the codes. Working at the keypad for several minutes with different combinations, the next security sweep was suddenly upon them, and, frustrated, they had to jump behind a gravsled before the droids swept by. Kenobi had studied codes with the great Jedi Master Nan Latourain at the Temple, but he now was faced by a lockcode beyond his abilities. Anakin made his own attempt at the lock, calling upon the Force; but as it grew, pulsed and shimmered around them, even with its added strength, the codes would not unlock. Suddenly there was Qui-Gon's easy smile in Obi-Wan's mind. Kenobi seized his lightsaber and slashed through the lock with one stroke, and the door swung open. Coming to another security door, Obi-Wan immediately buried his Jedi weapon in the durasteel until it peeled away in a glowing arc of light and smoke."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finding themselves in a laboratory, they approached its consoles hoping to find the information files they needed. Seeing valves that led to tunnels large enough to walk in, Kenobi suspected that Omega and Zan Arbor, despite the laws, experimented on the workers themselves. Anakin, reading the files, confirmed the suspicion, but also that they were indeed standing in Omega's factory: there were different levels set for the Zone, and the four worker deaths were from overexposure when they were trying to calibrate precise amounts for large crowds\u2014thousands at once. Although Zan Arbor had already perfected one-to-one transmission, she was now trying to infect a whole city. The science they were scanning was beyond their understanding and they realized they needed to get inspectors in. But their evidence was sufficient to go straight to the Supreme Chancellor with, which was, of course, the only way to get things done anymore, anyway. With six minutes left before the next droid sweep, they thought they'd check out the tunnel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Opening the valve, they stepped inside the vented tunnel, using their glow rods to light the way. Peering into one of the vents, Obi-Wan could see ducts and hoses through which, he suspected, the Zone must be administered. Stepping over to observe a schematic that was lasered onto the plastoid wall, he viewed an extensive system of kilometers-long tunnels branching out from the main tunnel, approximating an entire small city, it seemed. It was so detailed that Anakin wondered if it was based on an actual city system. Suddenly, they heard the sound of rushing water and looked up just in time to see it crashing upon them. Swept up and propelled forward, their bodies smashed up against the tunnel walls and somersaulted wildly against the water's power. Seizing and fastening their aqua breathers, they continued to careen down the tunnel with the current's force. Kenobi remembered the laser drawing: the tunnel had seemed to end in bedrock, which meant that they'd be killed instantly. But a worse noise was now heard behind them. The tunnel was imploding and they'd be crushed in the collapse even before hitting the bedrock."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Struggling through the water torrent that had both Jedi tumbling end over end, they sought a way of escape besides the vents, which were too small. Anakin, too, remembered something from the schematic, though he'd only looked at it briefly: there was a larger vent that came roughly a quarter-kilometer before tunnel's end, but it was coming up fast. Obi-Wan had remembered it also and yelled at Anakin over the rushing water's sound to grab onto the vent, which was closing at about 500 meters to his left. The collapsing tunnel's roar was now deafening; dust and debris filled the air, and the ground underneath shuddered. Kenobi sent out the Force to his Padawan to assist him to swim against the water's force, to feel the spaces between the water drops as the waves broke over him, allowing him to make headway against the water and reach the tunnel's side immediately behind his Master. Using their cable launchers, they were able to hook the vent and pull themselves to it. As the water pressure held the vent in place, they pulled at the grating with all their strength, just as the water began cascading over their heads. Chunks of plastoid and durasteel sailed past them as the tunnel continued to collapse. The vent grating popped off with the gathering Force and bounced away on the rushing, churning water as the Jedi pulled themselves up and in."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Master and Padawan crawled swiftly forward through the violently trembling pipe toward a dim, grey light\u2014it turned out to be a vertical ladder against the blackness. When they reached it, they began to climb, just as they heard the pipe beneath them collapse. They might be buried underground at any moment now. Stopping, they felt layers of durasteel above them, and Obi-Wan began to cut through with his lightsaber. Another stream of light joined his from above,as Siri,cut down towards them. The way now open, they scrambled up the ladder that was melting beneath them and were half-hauled up to the surface by the other Jedi. Speeding over the turbulent ground as it pitched and heaved, they reached the safety of the open plain, then turned back to look: the sight was astonishing as the ground swallowed the huge factory whole, caving in with a shower of fire and dust. The durasteel complex had completely imploded. Only a smoking crater remained where Blackwater had once been, with all evidence now sucked into the ground. Knowing Kenobi and Skywalker would be in the transmission wing, Siri and Ferus, seeing the collapse begin, and guided by the Force, had raced around the perimeter to find the glow of Kenobi's lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin rightly surmised that Omega had known the Jedi were there, and he destroyed his factory to silence them and cover his tracks. Since Teda had left the planet, Siri reported, she and Ferus feared Omega and Zan Arbor went with him. And since no flight plan was filed, they could be headed anywhere in the galaxy. The rising frustration was almost more than Kenobi could master; even his Padawan knew he was at the end of his control. Granta Omega had slipped from their grasp yet again. At that very moment, Kenobi's comlink signaled a message from Master Windu. Activating its holomode, Windu appeared in miniature holographic form, instructing them to immediately return to Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Recall to Coruscant"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Master Windu, on his way to a Senate meeting with the Supreme Chancellor, could not meet with the newly returned Jedi teams in the Temple's High Council Chamber, but the four Jedi were briefed by him as he strode down the Great Hall on his way to the Senate Building. Mace informed them that for some time they'd felt among the Senators a feeling of distrust toward the Jedi Council. Though not overly concerned, they were aware that Senators like Sano Sauro undermined them whenever they could. False stories had been spread and events twisted, to make the Jedi appear disloyal to the Republic, or as interfering in galactic political matters by making them worse. Of late, however, things had escalated with an active, influential Senatorial faction, behind which they sensed an unknown presence. Sensing the Jedi's fatigue and frustration, Windu conceded that Senate power struggles were not unusual. But the mission they'd just returned from, while important, was only one of hundreds in the galaxy that involved peacekeeping, saving lives, helping governments, fostering alliances. They all would be compromised, and the strength and effectiveness of thousands of Jedi decimated if this determined faction achieved its aim: the withdrawal of official Senate support for the Jedi Council. ref name=\"JQ:TFP\" />"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Allowing Windu's words to sink in, the Jedi better understood the grave nature of the situation; operating without Senate approval would make them rogue diplomats, undercutting their authority. The Jedi contingent, arriving at the Senate Building, waited patiently outside Palpatine's private offices. Skywalker was quietly offering sincere condolence for his Master's disappointment that their crucial mission had been cut short, but Kenobi seemed lost in thought. Obi-Wan suddenly asked Anakin if he could remember Teda's comment back on Romin about his and Zan Arbor's plan to go to Coruscant; the Jedi had not been able to decide then whether or not it represented a diversion. Anakin remembered that they'd not been sure if the tyrant was clever enough in the first place to create a diversion\u2014which was precisely Kenobi's point, as the current situation bore the hallmarks of Omega's style. Startled, Anakin asked his Master if he actually thought Omega was involved in this movement to discredit the Jedi. Unsure, but recognizing the need to be wary, Obi-Wan pointed out to his Padawan that the prospect certainly fit their arch-enemy's interests\u2014and that perhaps the Jedi's return to Coruscant was not an end to their journey, but rather a continuation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chancellor's senior aide, Sly Moore, entered from the interior room to usher the Jedi in. The Chancellor stood by a grouping of chairs when they entered. Anakin thought him imposing in his simple robes of muted colors. Skywalker suddenly realized that Palpatine was sacrificing his life to save the Senate from those intent on using it for their own ends. Thanking the Jedi for responding so promptly to his call, the Chancellor asked them to sit. Palpatine said that even the best of them had been unable to stop the growing tide of anti-Jedi sentiment. At a loss to explain it, he suggested that in their conflict-mired galaxy, some might turn to a scapegoat to advance their own plans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obi-Wan wondered if Sano Sauro was behind the machinations: he was, after all, a staunch enemy of the Jedi (and Omega had been his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 as a youth). The leader of the anti-Jedi faction, Palpatine said, was a formerly obscure Senator from Nuralee by the name of Bog Divinian. Kenobi started at this, for Divinian, whom he'd met on Euceron while on a mission during the Galactic Games, was married to his dear friend Astri Oddo, the daughter of Didi Oddo. Though not a Senator at the time, Bog, in order to protect the Commerce Guild, had lied in his testimony to an official Games Council investigation. With the makings of a politician, it didn't surprise Kenobi to discover Bog had succeeded in his career, no doubt rewarded for his lies by a grateful Commerce Guild. Obi-Wan, glancing at Mace, suddenly knew another reason why the Force had called him to aid in this new peril\u2014his acquaintance with Divinian as the husband of an old friend, which he disclosed now to those in the room.

The Jedi, of course, were involved in the recent coup of the planet's tyrannical government. Teda, who had lost no time, Palpatine said, in joining the anti-Jedi faction, had already given testimony that the Jedi were responsible for aiding and abetting the unlawful coup on Romin. Even so, the news was good news for Obi-Wan: it meant a chance to closely observe Teda, to learn more about Omega and how Teda fit into his larger plans. As Teda was not a bright creature, Kenobi had no doubt that such discoverable intelligence was within their reach."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chancellor, in conclusion, said that in the Senate hearing, Teda also made a claim that the Jedi were responsible for a factory implosion on Falleen\u2014a claim Teda had managed to get the Falleen Senator quite upset about, for the presented evidence held just enough weight to make it credible. As Teda had the right to petition for asylum on Coruscant, it was up to the Jedi Council to refute the charges. When Mace asked if the charges were formal, Palpatine replied that they were\u2014thus, the reason for the meeting. A hearing was set for that afternoon, and the Chancellor suggested a Jedi presence there was needed.

Mace Windu and Obi-Wan sat together in a mid-level tier. Kenobi was surprised at the turnout, as meetings like this one were usually so dull that no one attended them.

Kenobi found he could agree with Teda's last phrase, only because Teda himself had looted the Romin treasury. Windu, in full sympathy with the accused Jedi Knight sitting at his side, told Kenobi that truth had no place there, but that while this fabricated crowd didn't want to hear the truth, Obi-Wan must tell his truth anyway.

When Bog begrudgingly offered up the floor, Organa pointedly asked Former Ruler Teda if he had any evidence for his claims, to which Teda smoothly answered in the affirmative, saying, however, that the evidence was on Romin: because he was in exile, he couldn't reach it. Divinian pointed out that the Senate investigating committee on Jedi Order abuses had ruled that a subcommittee would be formed to investigate the charges.

Moreover, the procedure itself had been changed, Bail continued, by the same Senator who had been asked to investigate unfounded charges that suited his own agenda: it was the very definition of unfair, and an outrage. Organa, a shrewd Senator who extensively studied the bureaucracy, knew that the tedious work of keeping apprised of it netted real results.

When Bog asked Obi-Wan if the Jedi had secretly met with the resistance army on Romin, Obi-Wan said that members of the resistance movement captured two of their own, both of whom were Jedi. Kenobi was cut off when he began to explain that the Jedi presence on Romin was to pursue a galactic criminal.

Organa vehemently protested Divinian's statement, but Bog would not be deterred and called him to order, asking Kenobi again if the Jedi assisted the illegal takeover. Obi-Wan, hesitating because the Jedi help came only after the plans of Joylin's resistance were already in place, saw a flash of triumph in Divinian's eyes. Now in an impossible position to save the Jedi with truth, Obi-Wan had to answer the question affirmatively, and then face Bog's next question of whether the Jedi were involved in the reported factory implosion on Falleen.

When Bog tried to counter by suggesting that the Jedi were the only ones there during the implosion they claimed not to have triggered, Kenobi again embarrassed Bog by frankly stating that he didn't know if they were the only ones there. What Divinian saw before him, he announced with contempt, was arrogance and an utter lack of remorse at the destruction of property. Obi-Wan could see the slim, dark figure of Sano Sauro seated in a pod that hugged a dark corner of the chamber; looking back again at Bog, Kenobi sensed that Sauro, like a puppeteer, was controlling him\u2014feeding information and questions into Divinian's datapad. Obi-Wan remembered how Sauro had questioned him as a young Padawan, accused of murdering a fellow Jedi student at the Temple, twisting his words. He held Sauro suspect again today of crafting Bog's questions. Divinian promptly dismissed his witness, and the hearing adjourned."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Master Windu conceded that Obi-Wan had done the best he could under the circumstances. The Council had felt a darkness growing there, he said, surveying the chamber, but every time they looked again, they saw nothing at all.

Obi-Wan responded that he hoped not: standing and fighting in a Senate chamber was like shouting into the wind. Looking out over the crowded chamber, Obi-Wan wondered how it had come to this\u2014how so many were willing to believe the worst of the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the hearing, Kenobi endured a painful reunion in one of the Senate reception areas with Divinian and his wife Astri. Though Bog tried in vain to have Kenobi believe their relationship was a friendship, professing himself to be good friends with Obi-Wan, the Jedi Master obviously felt otherwise: Bog was as false a friend as they came, but as true a politician, speaking words that were hollow. Kenobi could only stare at Divinian incredulously as he ranted on in a one-sided conversation that even snubbed his own wife Astri, who truly had been Obi-Wan's dear friend. But something was not right with her. Though she looked and carried herself regally, there was a disgenuine aloofness in her face that caused Kenobi's heart to fall. He was happy to hear that her father, Didi, was now a grandfather, that they'd been blessed with a beautiful boy named Lune, who'd just turned three. But this was not the same Astri he knew as a Padawan to save her father and Qui-Gon. She'd gone from run-down caf\u00e9 cook to warrior. She seemed so different now, Obi-Wan felt he didn't know her anymore. Catching a glimpse of Teda leaving the area, Kenobi gave a crisp farewell to Bog, and followed the former tyrant out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin, meanwhile, had spent the time during the hearing with the Supreme Chancellor in his red-walled office, with Red Guards standing at attention outside."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When their conversation broached the topic of power, Anakin said that it wasn't power that he was interested in. Naboo's former Senator replied that Skywalker's was a very Jedi-like response but one that wasn't entirely true. For while the Jedi did not seek power, they still possessed it. When the Chancellor asked him why that was, Anakin responded that it was because the Jedi had the Force\u2014a source of power, but one they didn't seek, it was simply there. Palpatine remarked it was a Jedi's choice to use it. As the Jedi Council's biggest supporter, the Chancellor sought a way to effectively fight those seeking to strip the Jedi of their power and influence.

Palpatine explained that even though he had not sought his office, he was responsible for carrying out the burden of leadership. One of those duties was to recognize that what the Senate needed was a strong hand, just as children needed firm guidance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin struggled to grasp what the Supreme Chancellor was telling him, for it seemed to go against what he believed.

Palpatine then praised Skywalker for the power he saw in him\u2014his use of it. Anakin's connection to the Force gave to him clarity and boldness. The Jedi Order needed more like him. Then learn, Palpatine admonished, make the most of the opportunity he now afforded Skywalker to discover how to maneuver in Senate politics. For it might turn out to be the skill the Jedi Council needed most\u2014not the glory of lightsaber battles, but crucial nonetheless. The Supreme Chancellor invited Skywalker, when Anakin asked how he might achieve such an aim, to accompany him to meetings where Anakin might watch, listen, and tell Palpatine what he thought.

Compared to the suffering he'd pushed outside his capital city walls, the repugnant little man didn't deserve such ease as Kenobi saw him luxuriate in now. Teda finally came to a stop outside a small Senate caf\u00e9 tucked into one of its hallway-flanking alcoves, looked around, and darted in. Obi-Wan followed as Teda went to a table in the far corner to meet with Sano Sauro. Leaving behind all pretense and efforts of concealment, Kenobi confronted the two conspirators directly, telling Sauro he wasn't in the least surprised to find him to be the shadow behind the plots and the hearings to discredit the Jedi Order. Though Sauro shot out his customary declamations of having taken offense at Kenobi's words, even as he adamantly professed that Divinian, not he, was the power behind the Senate's anti-Jedi faction, Obi-Wan would have none of it: he'd caught Sauro meeting with the central witness against the Jedi, and he warned him that, though the preferred company he kept of thieves and murderers had carried him far, they would one day ensure his downfall. With that, the Jedi Knight turned on his heel and hurried down the Senate passageways to seek out Senatorial aide and close friend Tyro Caladian\u2014the one being with the most knowledge of Senate intrigue and the best political mind he knew\u2014to convene a covert meeting of his own."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the Senate Building's lowest level, at the descending end of a twisting corridor, he met with his Svivreni friend amidst his bins and boxes\u2014the telltale marks of his friend's political acumen and industry.

Kenobi mimicked the gesture, for with Tyro, he'd long since advanced to his friend's species' most affectionate codes of greeting and farewell (never \"good-bye\"). Caladian had been at the Divinian-led hearing and conceded that, though both Kenobi and Organa had done well, the house had been rigged to the brim with supporters of the anti-Jedi faction. Bog's questioning had, of course, been an outrage that manifested no inclination whatsoever to uncover the truth. While Tyro was ever anxious about the state of the Senate and the dispiriting devolution of the galaxy's moral consciousness, no matter how hard the Chancellor tried, he had never seen anything like the present uproar against the Jedi.

There had been another word earlier that had hit him similarly: demoralized\u2014Sauro had used it to describe the Jedi. And it suddenly came to him: Disruption + Demoralization + Distraction = Devastation. It was the formula for orchestrating evil to take root which Granta Omega's father\u2014Xanatos\u2014had devised. He'd engaged the full force of its power at the Jedi Temple, hoping to destroy it forever. Could it now be that his son was using the same formula to destroy the Senate? Was this Omega's real goal? For if he was indeed behind this current Senatorial effort, he had already succeeded in disrupting the Senate, demoralizing the Jedi, and distracting everyone. But, more pointedly, if all of this were actually the case, what was the coming devastation he was planning? Obi-Wan didn't know, but what he could sense, irrefutably now, was a sureness of what was initially an instinct: Omega was behind this."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "And if it were possible, Caladian now informed him, the situation had gotten even worse: Bog Divinian's committee had taken an unusual step, for instead of a recommendation, it had just entered an official petition to permanently ban the Jedi Order from further participation in Senate action. Even so, Senator Organa had discovered a clause that allowed him to appeal directly to the Chancellor in a separate closed-door session, which had already been placed on Palpatine's schedule for that afternoon: both Senators would be present, and the Supreme Chancellor would decide on the matter once and for all. That these new developments had all come about since the hearing, earlier that day, surprised Kenobi, as he knew the Senate to be ever slow in achieving any sort of effective action.

With more friends than enemies, the Jedi simply needed to remind their friends that they were still their friends. It was \"the Senate way,\" Tyro said. \"And what is that?\" Obi-Wan challenged, rather cynically. Talk, deals, bribes, corruption. Caladian would not be swayed by Kenobi's candid observation. While certainly true, yet Tyro held onto his belief in the Senate, which was, after all, the living symbol of the Republic. Until the Galactic Republic was formed, the galaxy boiled in chaos. The Republic was their only chance to bring peace to the thousands of worlds that couldn't manage alone.

He expressed to Tyro his amazement that, no matter how many times his heart was broken, Tyro yet kept faith in the Senate, ever toiling to find ways to make it better. Tyro assured Obi-Wan that, though his heart broke from time to time, his will never would, and that in that way, the two of them were alike. When Tyro pressed Obi-Wan to please disclose what was bothering him, Kenobi confessed that it wasn't this newly created petition, but what that petition might conceal that continued to trouble him. For this recent action to discredit the Jedi could be a mere diversion to draw attention away from something worse that might occur. Obi-Wan then suggested to Tyro that the two galactic criminals he had been tracking\u2014Omega and Zan Arbor\u2014could very well be the driving force behind this latest anti-Jedi scheme. The scheme, in fact, might be simply a smokescreen for the criminals' real objective. Caladian felt compelled to concede that Kenobi's suspicion certainly meshed with the way Omega operated. It made sense, and was even likely, since Sano Sauro (Tyro's own personal enemy) was involved, for he was Omega's longtime patron. It seemed for them abundantly clear now why Sauro kept to the background, for he didn't want investigators to connect him with the anti-Jedi campaign, else he knew that they would immediately make the connection to Omega."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "But Obi-Wan knew that they were still not seeing something. As the Chancellor was a great supporter of the Jedi, Tyro thought it highly unlikely that he'd approve the new petition. And while there was the possibility that Divinian and Sauro could manipulate that defeat into a call for a no-confidence vote in Palpatine, allowing them to propose Sauro as Chancellor (his ultimate ambition) and thereby give Omega control of the Senate, such a prospect was highly unlikely. Palpatine was far too powerful and skilled to be outmaneuvered. Besides, Caladian seriously doubted that Sauro could muster enough support for a vote of no confidence; for although he controlled the Viga alliance and the planets in the Commerce Guild, and could get several systems in the Mid-Rim, there was no way he could do so in the Core. Sauro was powerful, but he was actively disliked. Bail Organa's strong opposition faction, moreover, should not be discounted. And because Senators never engaged in such extreme measures unless they were sure of success, Tyro couldn't see the anti-Jedi faction attempting such a vote.

Their source told them that a couple, who claimed to be starting a business (though nothing yet had been done), had moved in a few days ago and, strangely, only exited at night, it seemed. Ferus had run a check on the parked airspeeders there and found out, from Coruscant Security, that ticket-records for illegally parked airspeeders revealed a standard Ralion B-14 recently bought at a speeder lot some 20 levels down.

Meanwhile, bright colors and holoprojections of scenes from popular vacation spots flashed about them: the famous shooting stars of Nantama, the mountains of Belazura, Dremulae's Sea of Translucency. But the deafening sounds smothered the whir of the seeker droids that were soon upon them. Blaster-fire and leaping Jedi crisscrossed the space until a dozen droids were reduced to smoking scrap. Siri warned Obi-Wan too late, when he strode over to a panel to shut down the holoprojection system: a secret blast door opened to reveal three deadly droidekas (combat droids) as they wheeled out and clattered to life.

But then Obi-Wan noticed a puddle of sauce on a plate; bending in close to sniff it, he discovered that it was Dexter Jettster's slider garnish. Siri suggested that Obi-Wan and Anakin head over to Dex's Diner in nearby CoCo Town and ask some questions while she and Ferus studied the water delivery system there on Coruscant, to see what damage their enemies might do. As the monorails were packed, and it was faster to walk, Kenobi and Skywalker hurried through the crowded pedestrian ramps. They crossed the Bank of the Core Plaza on their way to Dex's Diner, which was crouched between large, dilapidated industrial warehouses.

Anakin tried to lighten the suddenly tense situation and mood by engaging in easy-going banter, and Obi-Wan was relieved that his Padawan interfered so gracefully. But Kenobi was hurt and angry, for he'd expected better of Astri. She was at the present time, notwithstanding, engaged in relief work, because the economy of Nuralee, her adopted world, was failing. Kenobi surmised that it had probably fallen from its status of being prosperous when Bog took office. Astri was on Coruscant briefly, she said, to attend a meeting to request aid from the new All Planets Relief Fund and attend its inaugural ceremony. The Jedi team of Soara Antana and Darra Thel-Tanis were acting as couriers and protectors for a shipment of food and medical supplies to Nuralee, and Astri was set to return with them to her homeworld in two days, to ensure that it got into the right hands.

When he did so, he discovered there to be something terribly wrong: he sensed deep fear. She was afraid. But of what? Anakin casually, and in a jovial tone, asked her if Bog had seen what Dex had done to the old place, gesturing to the red stools and curved counter. Kenobi thought Anakin's question excellent, for it would give them the information they needed to know: was there a connection between Divinian and the safe house they'd just come from? Astri answered that Bog had indeed been there, yes. Obi-Wan could tell, however, that she was clearly not interested in the subject of her husband, but the Jedi now had the answer they wanted.

And then he remembered Ferus' words on Romin\u2014that Anakin wanted to control everything, and that his gift of seeing inside beings could turn dangerous if he tried to control the feelings he found instead of just observing them.

They were on the trail of some galactic criminals and believed that they had a taste for Dexter's slider garnish.

But things had been busy at his diner, of late, Dex said, and would get even busier the following day, when the All Planets Relief Fund Ceremony took place in the Bank of the Core Plaza, across the way. Many were coming, Dex said, just to see a fortune being transferred. Just being close to vertex and looking at it made people feel richer. The mention of crystalline vertex gave Kenobi pause. When he inquired more about it, Dex told the Jedi that, with every planet in the Senate donating, vertex would fund the central account of Palpatine's new imperiled-worlds project. After presenting the vertex to the Chancellor, his personal guard would bring it to the vault inside the Bank of the Core. Dex could already tell, for he knew them so well, that the Jedi were concerned about the security surrounding the event, but told them not to worry, because there would be security like they'd never seen, with both the Chancellor's Red Guards and Coruscant Security. Officers would be placed around the cordoned-off plaza. A HoloNet news journalist had even paid Dex, he said, to keep her airspeeder in the back alley so that she could leave the ceremony quickly for her vidcam studio hookup. But she parked it in front of Dex's food-delivery doors, so he got his pal Acey to break in, so that he could move it behind a dumpster.

It had been parked earlier over top the round cover to Dex's utility tunnel\u2014for his water delivery, he told them. The Jedi exchanged glances: every bit of this was adding up. Dex excused himself to check on his stew, but told them to come back when they had more time\u2014they knew, after all, how he liked to feed them. Kenobi guessed that the journalist must have been Valadon in disguise, that the airspeeder was for their getaway, and that the utility cover was one of the entry points for the Zone. As Obi-Wan opened the speeder's door to inspect it, a wisp of blue thread wafted down. Placing it carefully in his utility belt, he would send it to the Temple lab for analysis, though it certainly wasn't the septsilk or veda cloth that both the mad scientist and the gang members liked to wear.

The many restless tasks, for only a brief moment, seemed to crowd and jockey for position in Skywalker's brain, but then everything became clear and he knew what they must do. It was critical to contact Siri and Ferus and tell them all they knew, so that they could focus their study of the water system on the area immediately around the plaza. Master Windu next should be contacted, Anakin said, as the Council needed to come up with its own plans to protect the vertex during the ceremony. Obi-Wan thought his Padawan's strategy sound.

The Jedi would thus give them what they wanted in the beginning, but the Jedi, ultimately, controlled the outcome. But that, Obi-Wan said, would mean exposing thousands of beings to the Zone. It wasn't toxic, Anakin countered: the beings would have an extraordinarily pleasant morning, that's all. That, however, was something, Kenobi stressed, they simply couldn't know, for Anakin had experienced it early on. They didn't know what Zan Arbor had done to it since then. Also, was Anakin forgetting the four workers who died? But they had every reason to believe the system had been perfected, Skywalker pressed. Anakin could see, however, that he'd displeased his Master. And he, of course, conceded that they didn't know that for sure, and so they needed to guard the entry ports to the system in order to ensure that the Zone would not be deployed. Kenobi was in accord now with Anakin's final assessment, and they headed for the Senate, with Obi-Wan calling ahead to request an emergency meeting with the Chancellor. Meanwhile Anakin brooded over his apparent error. Sometimes he'd make mistakes, but often not be sure why they were wrong.

Security had to be increased, then, Kenobi insisted. Palpatine assured the Jedi that the best measures were already in place, and he had every confidence in the Order's abilities to forestall the villains. When Obi-Wan asked that the Chancellor order that the water system be shut off in the bank plaza quadrant, he again refused, for he would not disrupt thousands of lives by doing so: the system would be strictly monitored and guards placed on the Zone's schematic entry points.

With Palpatine at the head, and Senators Divinian and Organa at the center, on either side, Anakin sat quietly behind the Chancellor, to observe. Bog, after spouting off his official title and authority as committee head, announced that his committee had entered its findings and also delivered an official petition to ban the Jedi from future Senate business: they requested now an override of Senator Organa's counter-petition to stall their petition in a separate committee. Divinian's faction believed the petition must be debated in the full Senate and acted upon immediately. Palpatine then asked for Senator Organa's response to the new Senate petition. Senators from 200 planets had signed a protest, Organa said, and requested to investigate the petition committee for undue bias in its deliberations: until that investigation was concluded, he said, the Senate could hardly debate the committee's recommendations, let alone vote on the issue. Immediately, without further ado, the Chancellor said he'd reached a ruling. Both Senators appeared shocked. As Bog began to stammer out his protestations that the Chancellor had hardly had enough time to consider, nor he himself a chance to dispute, Palpatine silenced him with a raised hand, telling him to relax, for he'd ruled in his favor: the Senate could enter, debate, and vote on the petition to bar the Jedi Order from any further action on behalf of the Galactic Senate.

The boy was struck\u2014for he'd suggested (to his Master earlier) that the Jedi do the same for Omega: let him, for he'll fail. Though Bog didn't know it, Palpatine said, he'd just destroyed his career. Then Anakin suddenly realized that Palpatine had just done what he had done back on Romin, when he felt that surge of power and realized that the Force could allow him to see into motivations and consequences: many beings were transparent in their ego and greed, like Bog. Thinking several steps ahead was not that difficult\u2014and Palpatine had not gloated. He appeared simply to be rather ... satisfied. Did Anakin's Master understand this, like Palpatine? Obi-Wan was so cautious. Anakin looked at Palpatine, admiring his sure, confident stride through the Senate Halls. The Chancellor did not exaggerate his power, but neither did he diminish it: he accepted it and accepted the ways in which he would have to use it.

The Force moved in a boiling mass that caused the two Jedi Masters to jump to their feet on top of the cruiser, as Anakin hung in midair for the split-second it took him to slash through the viewport directly in front of a shocked Omega. The melted material that Skywalker jumped on top of (too hot to stand on) fell into a screaming Zan Arbor's lap. Kenobi, who found himself unable to track his apprentice's movement, had never seen such speed. Faster than sight, Anakin had, while balancing on the lip of the cruiser, reached in and grabbed the transmitter from Omega's clutches. Whoops, no more button, he hissed. Omega, crying out in rage, immediately triggered the powerful engines\u2014taking off in a burst of speed that caused the Jedi to slip off the cruiser and onto the ground. Clipping a wing as he exited, Omega knocked over a row of swoops and disrupted traffic in the nearest skylanes. Obi-Wan was again left stunned, forced simply to look on, when Anakin suddenly announced that the villain had lied: the transmitter was locked in position\u2014Omega had already programmed the droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fastest way to the Senate chamber was through the tunnels, Siri said. But they didn't know the way, Anakin reminded them. Ferus would know, Siri said. They all ran back to the vent, crawled through, then raced down the air tunnel. Siri comlinked Ferus, quickly filling him in. Olin hadn't seen any sign of trouble so far in the grand chamber, he reported. Tachi told him to stay with Palpatine and to contact Master Windu for reinforcements. But first, as he'd previously loaded the Senate utility tunnels onto his datapad, she needed Ferus to guide them through the tunnels to the chamber: she wanted him to bring them in on its middle tier. Once Ferus had relayed the instructions, the Jedi took off at top speed\u2014kicking in vents, as they swiftly navigated through the tunnel-maze, and using their cable launchers to vault a sharp upward stretch of two hundred meters. Kenobi took that opportunity to reprimand Skywalker for leaving the Chancellor, for now there were hundreds of seeker droids heading to the Senate and only one available Jedi to protect Palpatine and the Senators. Skywalker's mouth simply tightened: he'd grown less and less open to correction from his Master. It had been just the opposite for Obi-Wan: the longer he and Qui-Gon were together, the more he welcomed his Master's remarks, even when they were critical."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Siri heard unwelcome sounds coming from the vent ahead\u2014blaster fire, shouts, the random, terrible noise of violent chaos.

But the droids had the advantage, for they could fly. Kenobi could see that the Jedi needed an edge to even have a fighting chance. Leaping down to the next tier, he found a terrified Senatorial assistant hiding among the opulent drapery of planet Belazura's pod, which was still tethered to its docking point. Kenobi asked the aide where the main pod controls were. Hearing the durasteel in Obi-Wan's voice, the hesitant assistant quickly let him board, then dropped the pod 10 levels to show him the central controls for the repulsorpods (which overrode all individual-pod controls) that were set in a wall-panel on tier-level 125. Pushing several diagram indicators, Kenobi formed the pods in a schematic, shaping large blocs of them to take on a stepping-stone effect throughout the Senate chamber. Telling the trembling aide to remain where he was, for safety, Obi-Wan raced back to the tier entrance, where he could already see he'd been successful. Able now to cover more airspace, the Jedi were jumping from pod to pod, steadily decreasing the number of droids that were zeroing in on the terrified Senators.

But the Supreme Chancellor hardly noticed the Jedi protecting him, his bleak gaze instead sweeping the chamber and its dark chaos. Roy Teda, running for his life, was on the same tier as Palpatine: that a droid was tracking him was proof that Omega had betrayed Teda and wanted him dead. Kenobi was so far from the tier that he knew he'd never make it in time, but he had to try, never allowing his lightsaber a moment's rest as he made his descent. When he'd approached close enough to see, Obi-Wan guessed the murderous intent on Teda's snarling face: if the ex-tyrant was going down, it was clear he wanted to take the Supreme Chancellor with him. All around, the chamber was filled with shouts and screams, the smoke of blasters, and the unmistakable smell of fear. Teda was just steps from Palpatine when Ferus moved to take out the lead seeker droid that had been targeting Teda. Olin then turned to the other droids, Force-leaping upward, the bronze glow of his lightsaber a constantly moving presence. Of the concentrated droid squad, only one droid remained now, as Kenobi leaped the final meters toward Ferus. Teda drew a blaster to take out Ferus, but the droid Olin was fighting dipped suddenly, firing at Teda. Smoke rose from the exit wound in Teda's back as Ferus bent over the former dictator.

Half-shrouded in darkness, the Svivreni Senatorial aide darted forward from the back of his tier, straight into the path of a seeker droid homing in on Palpatine. Kenobi yelled for him to drop as Olin leaped, but just as the droid fired; Ferus deflected the fire from Palpatine, but it was too late for Caladian, who fell to his knees, riddled with blaster fire. An anguished cry ripped from Obi-Wan's chest\u2014this was a death he could not bear, not Tyro, not him, not this ... The Jedi shot forward toward his fallen friend, even as dread welled up inside him for what he knew the next moments would bring. An infinite sadness pooled in Tyro's eyes: unable to speak, his gaze spoke infinite regret. Lifting his trembling hand, he moved it toward Obi-Wan, allowing his opened palm to close into a fist, which he placed gently against Kenobi's heart. Looking up\u2014past Obi-Wan's shoulder, behind him\u2014toward the Chancellor, fear flickered briefly in Tyro's eyes before they went cold. And then he was gone. Opening and closing his own hand, Kenobi bent over Tyro and placed it against his beloved friend's chest, bowing his head in grief.

Disgraced on his own planet, Divinian found himself without supporters\u2014and those who once were demanded his resignation: everyone except Bog, it seemed, knew his political career was over.

The casualties of that fateful hour included 21 Senators, 14 aides, and 10 Senatorial guards, plus Romin's ex-dictator Teda, all murdered.

And, for the next day or so, the Senators seemed genuinely affected\u2014bound in a common grief.

Kenobi had clearly seen that his friend had been loved by multitudes. But it was among Tyro's beloved files and documents that Obi-Wan felt closest to him. Thinking himself incapable of bearing this particular death, yet he had, and he somehow knew that there would be many more to bear in the future. For the galaxy's growing darkness, which Master Windu had warned of, was now in his heart\u2014a darkness he could feel with each breath he took. The foreboding shadow Obi-Wan felt encroaching had even intruded into the last words Tyro had spoken to him. But he had searched now through Caladian's datapad and holofiles\u2014indeed, through everything he could think of\u2014and there was no record of what his friend had so desperately tried to tell him. Kenobi could not make sense of it. What were you going to tell me? He asked silently of his deceased comrade. What had truly shocked Obi-Wan to learn, however, was that the seeker droid that he'd assumed was heading for Palpatine had been programmed, that very morning, according to the Senate investigator, to hit Tyro instead.

It was Astri Oddo who appeared in the doorway. She had been told that she might find Kenobi in Tyro's office, and she offered her condolences for Obi-Wan's loss. And how was Astri doing? Kenobi queried. For her part, Astri and her precious two\u2014Lune and Didi\u2014were all good: thanks to Obi-Wan, she said in genuine gratitude. Bog had been stripped of power, useless now to both the Commerce Guild and Sano Sauro, which meant he was also powerless to hurt Astri and her loved ones ever again. When Kenobi asked her what she planned to do now, she was unsure, although she knew Didi wanted to return to Coruscant. But Astri, who hugged herself and shivered, said that the galactic capital had changed, that she didn't like it there anymore\u2014because she felt fearful while there, but didn't know exactly of what.

There, towering above the colorful, exotic flowers that ran in a square around the silver-barked trees, were twin horns of the bloodred claing bush, native to Sano Sauro's world\u2014and the ominous-looking thorns spawned young Skywalker's inquiry. He wondered why the Chancellor had awarded Senator Sauro the newly created position of Deputy Chancellor when the Jedi were certain that he was part of the plot to assassinate Palpatine: Anakin simply couldn't understand. The position was offered him, Palpatine professed, before the vote on the Jedi petition took place, and he therefore knew it was an offer Sauro couldn't refuse. Palpatine claimed foreknowledge that Sauro would betray Divinian: the assurance of a powerful office would be enough to abandon the risky prospect of staying true to a scheme that effectively had already been crushed by the Jedi's impressive thwarting of Omega's Senate Building attack. But Skywalker still couldn't grasp how Palpatine could have ever found it within him to reward Sauro for betraying him. Palpatine explained to the very talented, strongly Forceful Jedi Padawan that his generous gesture to Sauro had, in effect, made a friend of a bitter enemy, forever linking the Senator's fate with his own. Beyond that, the Chancellor would always know what Sauro was up to: Palpatine's action was done to keep this enemy of the Jedi Order and of the Supreme Chancellor close, as on a leash."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker, nodding, was beginning to understand: the shadows of his mind broke, albeit to a different kind of light. Anakin thought Palpatine a great teacher, and he would miss his talks with the Chancellor.

Palpatine told Anakin that he had asked him to his office to thank him for his efforts on that dreadful day of Omega's attack, wherein the Galactic Senate came very close to being utterly destroyed. Palpatine had intently watched Anakin's performance and was, quite frankly, surprised that the Jedi High Council failed to fully appreciate what he did that day. He hoped that Skywalker would not fault him for such candid disclosure, but Palpatine himself had witnessed how many lives Anakin saved. And he thought it outrageous and unfair that Ferus Olin was given a special commendation for what he did, whereas Anakin wasn't awarded anything. It was now Palpatine who didn't understand. But Anakin was incredulous: \"You don't?\" For Ferus had saved the Chancellor's life. \"Good of him, of course,\" Palpatine conceded, but it was no more than what Olin had been asked to do, whereas Skywalker always did more. Palpatine felt it a pity that the Council didn't see that, and suggested to Anakin that perhaps a Chancellor's talk with Master Yoda was in order. Anakin, of course, quickly declined the offer, for he knew well the Jedi Council\u2014and Yoda, in particular.

Olin had saved the Chancellor's life and dozens of other lives. But Skywalker, Palpatine astutely observed, saved more. It was not a contest, Anakin countered. \"No, it was a battle,\" Palpatine said. Sighing (as much to himself as for Skywalker), the Chancellor gazed back at the garden below, when suddenly, through the transparent screen that separated them, Anakin saw his Master enter the Chancellor's office. Seeing the two outside, Obi-Wan politely waited, not wishing to interrupt. \"I see your Master has arrived to fetch you,\" the Chancellor said, rising.
