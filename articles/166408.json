She was the guard that pretended to defect in order to aid Revan and Malak in killing the Emperor, but really deceived them, leading the pair to become servants of the Sith Emperor. She was the leader of the Purge of the Dark Council in 3950 BBY. She then dueled the Sith Lord Scourge when the latter, along with Revan and Meetra Surik, attempted to assassinate the Emperor; Scourge slashed her right hip, crushed her right hand with his foot, and beheaded her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
