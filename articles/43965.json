Each Hand believed they were the only one in service to the Emperor, therefore the center had several facilities so that more then one Hand could train with no knowledge of the others. The training center was highly secretive and not seen by members of the Imperial Court; besides the Emperor and the Hands themselves, it is unknown who else was aware of the area. In the years preceding the fateful battle over Yavin Prime, Hand Mara Jade trained at the facility, preparing to infiltrate the mansions of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and Governor Glovstoak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
