At the time of the Galactic Empire, Cadinth was a wealthy port and desert world in the Allied Tion sector. Its natural beauty was destroyed by industrialization, as was that of its neighbor, Lianna, leaving deserts of black sands and howling winds. Scattered in the wastes were the ruins of ancestral civilizations. Its population was concentrated in gloomy, sharp-featured cities that self-consciously evoked the distant past."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to 25,150 BBY, Cadinth was the capital world of one of the ancient Tion Cluster states: the Kingdom of Cadinth.
