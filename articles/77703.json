Based on the Rogue Shadow, they accompanied the general on his unsanctioned assaults against the Galactic Empire. The squad, save for Kota, were all killed when a battle at Cato Neimoidia resulted in their capture and execution at the order of Baron Merillion Tarko. Several days later, Kota reconstituted the squad by recruiting mercenaries on the planet Malastare, including Cerean medic Ni-Ke-Vanz. The new squad participated in the Battle near the Itani Nebula, and the Assault on Kamino."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
