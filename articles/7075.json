A large metal structure straddling the cliffs of a massive gorge known as the Chasm, the temple at Anil Kesh served as the Order's academy for the science and alchemy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the philosophers and scholars from across the galaxy first arrived on Tython, they were brought forth from the stars on giant pyramidal constructs called the Tho Yor. These nine massive ships scattered across the planet and landed in separate locations, releasing those held within to settle the planet. The Tho Yor themselves would serve as the very foundations for these travelers' new homes and places of study."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Perched high above the Chasm between three massive curved arms was a squat, armored cupola. The arms holding it aloft also curved over its summit like clutching talons, encasing it within it hard, metal grasp. Je'daii who studied within the halls of Anil Kesh sought to learn the mysteries of the Force through the application of science. The location of Anil Kesh was of deep fascination to its students; as one descended deeper into the Chasm, the touch of the Force was dampened and calling upon it for strength was near impossible. The greater strength in the Force an individual had, the worse the effect; indeed, some who descended into its open maw found only insanity and death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving at Anil Kesh, it was necessary for all Journeyers to undergo an orientation of sorts which provided them with the skills they needed to endure the adverse affects of the Force-storms raging beneath them at all times. The temple at Anil Kesh had a close working relationship with the Temple of Vur Tepe; a saying existed which claimed, \"whatever Anil Kesh can imagine, Vur Tepe can make real.\" The Je'daii Temple Master, the Je'daii who served as steward of the facility and oversaw its functions, would see that all students practiced safely and advised those who wished to descend into the Chasm. In 25,793 BBY Master Quan-Jang, a Human, was the Temple's overseer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Layout"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A masterpiece of Je'daii technical skills, the Temple of Anil Kesh straddled the cliffs of the Chasm with such strength that the violent Force storms which raged constantly within the massive crevasse did not effect its structural integrity. The Tho Yor around which the Temple was constructed floated around the Temple in a mysterious circle, held adrift and propelled by unknown means. Consisting of three massive support arms, a central structure, and three balancing arms, the Temple had an insectile appearance, with a heavy metal shell protecting the interior from the outside forces. Within each leg was a honeycomb of apartments for Journeyers and Masters alike. This system of construction allowed for the legs to support the weight of the building and withstand the adverse effects of the environment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within the central structure was housed the many laboratories, libraries, study rooms, gymnasiums, hangars and other facilities required to maintain the Temple of Science. The lower floors were dedicated to the hangar bays where drones and other equipment could be dropped into the Chasm, while a continuous stream of white energy was shot down into the bottomless ravine collecting samples and data long after every conceivable experiment had been conducted. The three arms which acted as counterbalance to the support legs housed multiple communications arrays which made it possible to communicate with the other Great Temples and Rangers in the field."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
