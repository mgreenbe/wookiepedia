The two planets, normally at odds, asked the Jedi Order for assistance in desperation, and Jedi Masters Laret Soveral and Simmix were dispatched with their Padawans, Orla Jareni and Cohmac Vitus. Lord Isamer, the leader of the Directorate, had been hired for the job by the Hutts, and he believed that they wanted to work with his syndicate to drive the people of the region into distrusting the Galactic Republic and Jedi. In truth, the Hutts intended the mission to destroy the Directorate, which would allow them to move their criminal operations into the region whenever they wanted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
