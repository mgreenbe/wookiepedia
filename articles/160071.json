During the Alliance's battle with Hurrim pirates, all six ships from Vemmer were captured off-screen by the Hurrim and taken to the Hurrim Base. When the Rebel Alliance and Dunari launched an assault against the Base, Rebel ships from Storm Unit boarded and regained control of all six vessels, allowing them to escape to safety as the Hurrim base was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The capture of Vemmer and their presence at the Hurrim Base is left totally unexplained in the game, making their appearance seem somewhat random.
