They then encountered the same Unidentified Battle Dreadnought from the first skirmish over Sunrise, bearing the damage inflicted to its port side weapons and sensor installments. The Battle Dreadnought's commander demanded that the Chiss leave the area. He claimed that the planet below had been devastated by the \"evil\" forces of the Nikardun Destiny, and told the Chiss that the survivors of the Sunrise civil war \"begged\" him to protect their planet from the Nikardun and other \"scavengers\". Admiral Ar'alani did not believe this, and informed the commander that the Chiss were invited to the planet by the Magys."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A skirmish ensued using breachers, dibbers, plasma spheres, spectrum lasers, and the asteroid missile platform. The asteroid missile platform's outer shell detonated when it believed it came under attack. Ar'alani kept the Battle Dreadnought occupied with her Vigilant and led the enemy commander to believe the Grayshrike would be destroyed by the asteroid missile launcher. Ar'alani damaged the Battle Dreadnought from the Starboard flank, and Lakinda eventually attacked the already-damaged port flank."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ar'alani attempted to gain information from the damaged enemy, at which point he launched a missile that destroyed the asteroid missile platform. The enemy then initiated self-destruct, destroying his Battle Dreadnought into small pieces that did little damage to the Chiss warships upon impact."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
