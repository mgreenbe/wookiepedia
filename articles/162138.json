It was high-pitched and used clicking sounds and even skin color changes for punctuation. Species and droids physically unable to change color and click could understand Vratix language, but not speak it. However, the Vratix were a social species, trading with many other races. Thus, most Vratix were fluent in both Vratix and Basic, being literate in both languages."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Glossary of terms"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
