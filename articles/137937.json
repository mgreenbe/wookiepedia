Circa 1 ABY, Syndil Na'Marr bought the legs from a R2 unit to the junk dealer Watto. However, the droid was wanted by both Imperial Commander Barrezz and Rebel Captain Bastra and an Imperial Captain soon confiscated the legs. One of Syndil's friend, a Bothan pilot, later went after the Imperial Captain and managed to ambush and destroy the Captain's AT-ST in the Mospic High Range. However, the pilot was downed and unable to contact Syndil Na'Marr. When a spacer looking for the droid legs approached Syndil, she agreed to give them if the spacer was able to rescue her missing pilot friend. The spacer thus went to the mountains, found the downed pilot and finally recovered the droid legs from hostile Tusken Raiders in the area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Syndil Na'Marr was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
