Around the year 18 BBY, a Jedi Knight named Jax Pavan attempted to obtain a lightsaber crystal from one of Baron Vla\u00e7an Umber's Ves Volette light sculptures, suggesting that the baron could use pressure-treated halurium grains as a replacement power source. However, Umber angrily denied Pavan's request, since removing a crystal from one of the light sculptures would destroy it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Properties"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In its grain form, halurium was a substance that could be pressure-treated and used as an energy source."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the year 18 BBY, pressure-treated halurium grains were known to be useable as an energy source. Around that year, Jax Pavan, a Jedi Knight\u2013turned\u2013investigator, went to speak with Baron Vla\u00e7an Umber at the baron's Manarai Hills apartment on the planet Coruscant regarding the murder of the light sculptor Ves Volette. Upon Pavan's arrival, I-5YQ, the Jedi's droid companion, noticed that the baron's Ves Volette light sculptures utilized compressed energy crystals similar to those used in lightsabers, a traditional Jedi weapon that Pavan wanted to build. In the hopes of acquiring a crystal, Pavan asked for one and inquired whether the baron could replace one of the sculpture's crystals with another energy source, such as pressure-treated halurium grains or marilite. The baron refused Pavan's request and was appalled, as the light sculpture would be destroyed if its crystal was removed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Halurium was mentioned in Coruscant Nights II: Street of Shadows, a 2008 novel written by Michael Reaves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
