One notable contender was Taris, which earned the title in 4300 BBY, until trade lanes shifted in 4156 BBY, where it then suffered two hundred years of economic decline, before being razed to the ground in 3956 BBY by a Sith fleet under Darth Malak and Admiral Saul Karath during the Jedi Civil War. The heavily urbanized trade center of Eriadu in the heart of the Seswenna sector between the Rimma Trade Route and the Hydian Way also aspired to achieve this title."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By extension Muunilinst and its sister world Mygeeto, both also in the Outer Rim, had rivaled Coruscant economically. There were also several more urban worlds across the galaxy that rivaled the galactic capital politically, including Alsakan of the Core Worlds, the moon Nar Shaddaa and to a lesser extent its planet Nal Hutta of the Mid Rim, Empress Teta of the Deep Core and Denon of the Inner Rim."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
