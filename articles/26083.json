After being stranded in space near Catadra during the New Republic's campaign to take the Cerberon system, pilot Chass na Chadic was rescued by members of the cult. Chadic decided to join the cult, suspecting they had another New Republic individual. She was incorrect, however; the cult had in fact rescued the Imperial pilot Palal Seedia. Chadic and Seedia begrudgingly worked together in effort to escape Catadra, locating the cult's starships. Seedia turned on the New Republic pilot and left her behind, though Chadic was able to recover her B-wing starfighter and escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Children of the Empty Sun appeared in the 2020 novel Shadow Fall, written by Alexander Freed as the second installment in the Star Wars: Alphabet Squadron trilogy.
