They were native to the crystalline world of Mygeeto and also had a settlement on Maridun.\nSome Lurmen had the ability to curl up into a ball and roll along the ground, such as Wag Too. Lurmen were able to cover large amounts of ground at great speed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lurmen were a lemuroid mammalian species, far smaller than a Human. Their bodies were covered entirely in fur, which ranged in color from a dark brown to a white-gray, though they did wear garments. The Lurmen had heads protruding perpendicular from their chest, with two large golden orange eyes, a nose and a mouth. Each Lurmen had a tail, and they communicated through speech; Lurmen were able to speak Basic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They stood on two legs and had two arms, with five digits on each hand and foot. They could walk either upright on their two legs, and could also use their arms and legs for faster movement. Certain Lurmen had the ability to roll themselves into a wheeled shape; this allowed them to cover distances at great speed. They may have learned this ability from the native Amani on Maridun, on which a settlement of Lurmen was established. Wag Too was one Lurmen who possessed this rolling talent."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mygeeto"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lurmen found on the planet Mygeeto lived in groups within the natural crystalline towers that covered the surface of the planet. Despite their prosperity, the Lurmen of Mygeeto were enslaved by the Muun of the InterGalactic Banking Clan, a faction of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, when it took over Mygeeto. Mygeeto then became a planet within the Confederacy, before it came under attack from the forces of the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Maridun"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The war comes to Maridun"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, a group of Lurmen escaped war in known space and colonized the planet Maridun, a world that was uncharted at the time. After being attacked by the native Amanin, they were forced to abandon their ship, which was their only way off the planet. The Lurmen's reason for this was that they would have to fight to get the ship back, the Lurmen cultural ethos being pacifist in nature."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Generals Aayla Secura and Ahsoka Tano with Ahsoka's master, Anakin Skywalker, crash landed on Maridun after their ship was heavily damaged by Separatist forces. Several clone troopers were also with them. With Skywalker badly injured, and the group having come under attack by numerous mastiff phalones, Secura, Tano and several clones arrived in the Lurmen camp. Requesting aid and healing for Skywalker, the Lurmen leader Tee Watt Kaa refused to have anything to do with the Clone Wars, or violence in general."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Watt Kaa demanded that the Jedi leave before they bring violence to his village and people. Tano, desperate for Anakin to survive, pleaded with Watt Kaa to help Skywalker. Relenting, Watt Kaa sent his son, Wag Too, to heal Skywalker. As a gesture of faith, Watt Kaa demanded that a Jedi stay behind, to prove also that Wag Too would not be kidnapped. Agreeing, Secura stayed behind. Watt Kaa also made clear that no clones and their blasters would be tolerated. As they returned to the camp, they found the camp under attack by two mastiff phalones. Wag Too, staying true to the Lurmen pacifism ethos, tied the creature up and stopped Tano from killing it. Taking Skywalker to the Lurmen camp, Wag Too began his healing process on Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Separatist occupation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lok Durd, General of the Confederacy, eventually came to the planet with a number of troops and announced the occupation of Maridun. Hiding Skywalker and his allies, the Lurmen refused to fight or use any form of violence against the Separatists, despite the Separatists ransacking their village. Watt Kaa and his Lurmen were informed by Durd that such searches for Republic contraband may happen again in the future. Despite his father's wishes to remain neutral, Wag Too assigns a Lurmen scout, Tub, to aid the Jedi in getting off world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite having already searched the village, the Separatists returned soon after their initial visit. The Separatists, under Durd, intended to use the Lurmen's known pacifism as a means to test an experimental weapon. As well as Skywalker, Secura and two clones soldiers, Rex and Bly, Wag Too and Tub witnessed the weapon's test firing. Skywalker recognized that the next target for the Separatists would be the Lurmen. Tub, having seen this and the Separatists returning to the village, sent word to Wag Too. Tee Watt Kaa, when he heard of this, stated that there was no reason to believe that the Separatists would attack them, to his son's frustration."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic forces on the planet, having stolen a Separatist shuttle, arrive at the village and inform Tee Watt Kaa that the Separatists are planning to destroy them. Watt Kaa, however, refuses to use violence to fight them off, instead stating that he and the Lurmen would rather die than resort to violence. Despite Watt Kaa refusing to allow the Lurmen to fight, the Republic built defenses out of seed pods around the outside of the Lurmen village. Despite Watt Kaa's stance, many of the Lurmen, including Wag Too, wanted to fight. After the Separatists fired their weapon, Skywalker and the Jedi raised a shield around the village, preventing the weapon from causing damage. Durd, having seen this, orders the battle droids of the Confederacy to attack. The Lurmen, still remaining without violence, watch as the Republic defends their village."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As droids fight past Skywalker and his allies, however, the Lurmen became vulnerable to attack. Wag Too, gathering those who did not believe in Watt Kaa's absolute pacifism, attacked the droids and tied them up for the Republic to destroy. The droids, having been defeated, left the village. Despite his ideals conflicting with those of his son's, Watt Kaa thanked the Jedi. Wag Too and the rest of the Lurmen did the same."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lurmen that emigrated to Maridun used fallen seedpods from the giant trees as shelter and home. Living near the trees proved too dangerous, as the falling pods could be deadly. Instead, the Lurmen dragged the pods into a clearing and used them as huts. They also extracted essential oils from the pods for nutrition and healing medicines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most Lurmen were pacifistic by nature and refused to fight or run even in the face of death. They often would hide instead of using violence. As pacifists, they carried no weapons but carried farming tools or ropes. When some Lurmen fought the Separatists, they refrained from ever destroying or killing the enemy. Their farming tools were used mostly as a leverage tool in these tactics and to provide something to tie the rope to, though sometimes they were used as a weapon for striking an enemy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The greatest native threat to the Lurmen on Maridun were the Amani and the mastiff phalones, raptor-headed quadrupeds that hunted in groups. However, even in defeating these beasts the Lurmen attempted to remain true to their pacifist ideals, and not inflict any injury to the creatures. Instead, when cornered by a mastiff phalone, an agile Lurmen would try to unbalance the creature by tying a rope around its stout legs. For speedy movement, Lurmen could curl into a wheel-shape and roll along the ground."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lurmen on Mygeeto had the intelligent ability to be able to make profit and be prosperous, until the time of the invasion and occupation by the Banking Clan and, later, the Separatists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia states that the Lurmen were a lemur-like species, which seems to point out that the Lurmen were in fact derived from concept art for lemur-like inhabitants of Mygeeto that were slated to appear in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, but were ultimately cut. This is validated by the Databank entry for Lurmen, which claims they were carried over from Utapau and Mygeeto as an unused concept. Additionally, there is a brief mention in the Star Wars: Complete Locations about the lemur-like inhabitants of Mygeeto being made into slaves by the Banking Clan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lurmen in \"Jedi Crash\" and \"Defenders of Peace\" speak with Irish and Scottish accents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
