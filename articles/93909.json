Introduced during the Clone Wars for the Confederacy of Independent Systems, once the frigate's capabilities became more apparent, several sub-variants were created. The C3 frigate differentiated from the original by trading in some of its powerful weapons systems for more effective sensors, sophisticated communications suites, and extensive hangars filled with vulture droid starfighters. The C3 frigates were equipped with the powerful and sophisticated C3 suite, which were considered state-of-the-art. The C3 suite allowed for the ship's commander and officers to receive a steady stream of battlespace data to allied starships and ground forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under the Alliance to Restore the Republic, the C3 frigate was extensively refitted, replacing their droid systems with and equipping it with pressurized, gravity-controlled compartments that were suitable for organic conditions. As such, it was crewed by 1,100 officers, pilots, and enlisted crew, and held up to 850 troops and support staff, depending on configuration. It featured a class 1 primary hyperdrive, with a class 10 acting as a backup, and was complemented by a navigation computer. Due to its capabilities, it had a long-range sensor array. It usually had a complement of twelve to thirty-six starfighters, depending on the configuration, as well as assorted shuttles. The frigate held two years of consumables and cost 12,300,000 credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For armament in Rebel-owned C3 frigates, the frigate was armed with two forward-mounted turbolasers, two forward-mounted long-barrelled ion cannons, thirteen port and thirteen starboard twin light turbolasers, ten port and ten starboard turret-mounted ion turbolasers, four port and four starboard medium flak cannons, and forty turret-mounted retractable light laser cannons equally divided to the dorsal, ventral, port, and starboard sides."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to their extensive C3 suites, the Munificent-class Comms Frigate served as fast reconnaissance vessels, advanced warning pickets, fleet communications vessels, and command ships for small CIS Navy formations.
