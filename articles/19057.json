He was opposed to Naboo's full intergration into the Galactic Republic, and was supported in his campaign by Cosinga Palpatine, ostensibly to protect Naboo's plasma reserves from being exploited by corporate entities. Cosinga's son, however, regarded it as a crude, transparent attempt to grab power, as his father was engaging in an extramarital affair with the man's sister. The younger Palpatine leaked details of the opponent's plans to Tapalo's camp, ultimately drawing Damask Holdings to Naboo and destroying the campaign, and resulting in Tapalo's election as King of Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
