When Kazuda Xiono first arrived on the platform, Narb was fighting with two DUM-series pit droids. Shortly after, he and his brother, Nod, were at Aunt Z's tavern. During their visit, Xiono got into a commotion with the Klatooinian Bolza Grool. The Aleena Grevel, who Narb worked for, tried to intervene and collect some credits Xiono owed him, but Grool tossed him away, and he fell into Nod's arms. Grevel then threw a cup at Grool, who threw Xiono into a serving droid. A cup flung out of the droid's hand and into the Rodian Glem, causing him to start throwing cups at Nod. Both now aggravated, Nod and Narb joined the commotion and an all out bar fight broke out until Jarek Yeager silenced the chaos with his blaster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after, the Nikto Neeku Vozo rushed into the tavern, announcing Xiono as a new challenger for the next race on the Colossus.

Xiono ran and the two Snivvians chased him through the Colossus marketplace. Grevel pushed a box in front of Xiono, tripping him over, and Narb and Nod picked him up. Grevel led them out of the open area to deal with Xiono. Grool passed the confrontation and Xiono's droid, BB-8, electrocuted him. In his moment of shock, Grool threw his crate of gorgs in the air and the gorgs landed on Grevel and the Snivvians. Xiono used this to his advantage and escaped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later, Narb was in the market place talking to Nod and another individual.
