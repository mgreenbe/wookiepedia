The headband was a cybernetic construct used to force its wearers to maintain focus by striking them with electrical shocks should their attention waver. This allowed a boost in mental abilities, but the crudity of this method was a cause for concern for the Galactic Republic. Nevertheless, the Verpine were free to manufacture them as they were not subject to the Republic's regulations regarding such equipment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The headbands saw use during the Jedi Civil War.
