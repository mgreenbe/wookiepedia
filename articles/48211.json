During the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, he traveled the conflict's battlefronts as a holographer; however, after sustaining a traumatic injury he was left dependent on cybernetics. The injury solidified his view that the Alliance was a destructive force, and following the Battle of Endor he executed on a concept put forward by Imperial chief informational officer Ferric Obdur to create the propaganda poster Who's Pulling the Strings?. The poster implicated the New Republic the Alliance had formed into as collaborators with the criminal Hutt Clan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Filris Parbert was first mentioned in the reference book Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released on October 25, 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
