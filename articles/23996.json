Mateil was often considered to be somewhat egotistical; she would refuse to sign personal autoprints, instead the autoprints would be created, and fans had to pay for them. She held second place at the Ahto City swoop track until Revan helped Queedle Molto enhance his swoop to become Sector Champion. Mateil's time fell to third place, and Hukta Jax was moved to second. Mateil was bumped down to fourth place once Revan became Sector Champion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
