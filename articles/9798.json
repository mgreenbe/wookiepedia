Throughout galactic history, cartographers and scouts traveled between star systems in search of more reliable and safer hyperspace routes free of dangerous obstacles, advancing the science of astrogation. Traveling through hyperspace required a navigation computer to make precise calculations in order to follow these lanes and avoid crashing into \"mass shadows,\" the gravitational wells surrounding massive celestial bodies such as planets. Often, ships had to navigate by way of hyperspace buoys or stop at waypoints to calculate another hyperspace vector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
