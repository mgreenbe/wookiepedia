A vocal critic of the Galactic Empire, Fair was known for her probing interviews with Imperial officials and her editorials criticizing Imperial policies and the Emperor Palpatine. During the Antar Atrocity of 18 BBY, Fair reported extensively on Imperial atrocities. Her reports were supplemented by holographic reenactments of arrests and executions, produced and directed by her Zygerrian colleague Hask Taff. Their primary source was Berch Teller, a disaffected Republic Intelligence officer who was outraged by the indiscriminate slaughter of Gotal and Koorivar loyalists he had trained during the Antar Atrocity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to their coverage of the Antar Atrocity, the Imperial Security Bureau targeted Anora and Hask for assassination. However, the two managed to escape into hiding with the help of Teller, who formed a rebel cell dedicated to resisting the Empire. Teller's rebel cell consisted of many survivors and witnesses of the Antar Atrocity who bore a special hatred for Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, the architect of the Antar Atrocity. Teller's cell was secretly aided by the Imperial Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit, a rival of Tarkin and Director of the Naval Intelligence Agency. Rancit used his high-level intelligence and underworld connections to supply the dissidents with Clone Wars-era weapons, starships, communications equipment, and intelligence."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Theft of the Carrion Spike"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY, following the failed attack on Sentinel Base, Anora along with Hask, Teller, the Gotal pilot Salikk, the Koorivar operations specialist Cala, and the Mon Calamari engineer Dr. Artoz took part in a mission to steal Moff Tarkin's stealth corvette Carrion Spike. Teller intended to use Tarkin's starship to stage attacks on Imperial targets across the galaxy. To inspire rebellion, Anora and Task were tasked with producing holovids of the attacks that would be broadcast on HoloNet, mimicking the Separatist Shadowfeed broadcasts of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The insurgents were aided by Rancit, who planted a communications cache on the planet Murkhana.

While traveling through the Murkhana system, Anora asked Artoz which of the controls emptied the toilets. She and Hask then argued over who was to blame for the damaged airlock until Teller intervened. When Anora asked if all of the Emperor's Moffs had advanced starships, Teller responded that Tarkin was the only known Moff to be afforded such a privilege. Hask also corroborated Teller's account that Tarkin had been designing ships for his homeworld of Eriadu's Outland Regions Security Force when he was nineteen years old"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anora also asked Teller why Tarkin named his ship the Carrion Spike but the former intelligence officer admitted his ignorance on the matter. When Hask referred to Darth Vader by his adoptive name, Anora dismissed Vader as a machine and a terrorist.

Using the Carrion Spike's cloaking systems, the insurgents attacked the station, inflicting considerable damage and casualties. Since the corvette was cloaked, the defending V-wing and ARC-170 starfighters were unable to hit the Carrion Spike. Tarkin and Vader soon resurfaced aboard the Parsec Predator and managed to inflict some damage on the rogue corvette before being disabled."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their successful raid, the Carrion Spike sustained damage. When Anora reported that the airlock controls for the escape pods were fried, Teller responded that they would not need the escape pods. Before fleeing into hyperspace, the rebels ejected Vader's meditation chamber and destroyed Galidraan's hyperspace buoy. The insurgents then traveled to Lucazec where they raided the TaggeCo mining facilities on that planet. Anora and Hask also produced holovids that were broadcast on the Imperial HoloNet.

Teller responded that if the Emperor had his way, artists would the first targeted for eradication. Before the trade, Teller also asked Anora about how he looked in a red wig."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite Teller's precautions, the Phindian administrator was suspicious about \"Commander LaSal\" and alerted Tarkin and Lord Vader. Before the Carrion Spike had finished refueling, Tarkin and Lord Vader arrived with the Imperial escort carrier Goliath and the V-wing Yellow Squadron. While waiting for the hyperdrive to load, the Carrion Spike ran circles around the tanker to make it harder for the Imperials to target their ship. During a brief dogfight, the Carrion Spike also managed to shoot down several of Vader's V-wings.

She doubted that their transmission reached more than six systems. Teller reassured her that they only need to reach one for the holovid to spread to other sectors. Anora and the others listened as Teller recounted Tarkin's ruthless rise to power on Eriadu and their struggle against the Emperor's plan to winnow the galaxy into submission.

Knotts aided the insurgents by hiring a crew to travel on the freighter Reticent to the Obroa-skai system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Acting on this disinformation, Tarkin and Lord Vader deployed substantial forces including three Imperial interdictor vessels to intercept the Carrion Spike. However, one of the interdictors, an Immobilizer 418 cruiser, malfunctioned, causing a massive hyperspace accident that claimed 1,100 lives. Despite the diversion, Tarkin and Vader managed to interrogate the crew of the Reticent and learned about Knott's involvement.

Anora confided that she did not envisage living the life of a revolutionary. Teller disagreed and pointed out that she was fighting the good fight with words when he found her. Anora responded that writing was different from firing laser cannons at other beings or letting others take the fall for them.

When Tarkin quipped about expecting an apology for the damage to his starship, Anora contorted her shackled hands into an obscene gesture.
