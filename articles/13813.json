The Mandalorians campaigned to take control of the Core World of Duro that year, an offensive they dubbed \"Mandalorian Triumph.\" The charge consisted of two forces advancing Coreward, with one originating from Mandalorian territory that conquered several worlds before it passed through the Zel system and to Commenor. Once the Mandalorians defeated a Republic task force stationed on Commenor and took the world, they moved on to the Quellor system, then the Exodeen system, before finally taking Duro."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle was referenced in The Essential Atlas (2009).
