During the year 22 BBY, Miin traveled with Mai to the planet Geonosis, where they pledged their allegiance to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a group of conglomerates and star systems who were departing the Republic. Shortly afterwards, the first battle of the Clone Wars broke out in a Geonosis arena. Miin stayed by Mai's side throughout the war, and eventually followed her to the planet of Mustafar along with the rest of the Separatist Council, under the orders of the Kaleesh cyborg General Grievous. On Mustafar, the council awaited the arrival of Darth Vader, the new apprentice of the confederate leader, Darth Sidious, believing Vader would protect them during the last stages of the war. Miin was killed when Vader instead executed the Separatists, under Sidious' orders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A female Gossam, Cat Miin hailed from Castell, although it was not the homeworld of the species. Miin began working for the Commerce Guild, where she worked her way up the company ladder until she became the administratress of the guild Presidente, Shu Mai, another female Gossam. As chief aide, Miin worked closely with Mai. During the year 22 BBY, Mai was invited to the planet of Geonosis, located in the Outer Rim Territories. Miin traveled with the Commerce Guild leader, where they secretly conversed with the recently formed Separatist Council, led by the fallen Jedi Count Dooku, which was made up of several conglomerate leaders professing their dissatisfaction with the Galactic Republic, which dominated the galaxy. Although Mai knew that siding with the Separatists would be an act of treason against the Republic, she ultimately pledged the support of the Commerce Guild. Ultimately, the Confederacy of Independent Systems was formed, and an event known as the Clone Wars erupted only a little while later when an army of Jedi arrived at a Geonosis arena and engaged droid forces. Both Miin and Mai were able to escape from Geonosis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Miin was eventually assigned to overlook the handling of raw materials that were being used to sustain the droid armies of the Separatists, and continued to travel with Mai to many secret meetings and confederate gatherings. By 21 BBY, Mai was involved in a propaganda project known as the CIS Shadowfeed, which spread news and information to worlds controlled by the Separatists. Miin was at Mai's side when the Gossam Presidente made an official statement about a battle that occurred on the planet of Bassadro, stating that the confederate major in charge, Domb Treetor, only surrendered to Republic forces in order to preserve the lives of civilians. In reality, Treetor had killed numerous civilians in an attempt to wipe out the Republic troops."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the final year of the war, 19 BBY, the Separatist Council was eventually ordered to hide on the planet of Utapau, where they were to await further instruction from the mysterious confederate leader, Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord. Eventually, the cyborg General Grievous, who had been leading the droid armies throughout the war, arrived on Utapau after the unsuccessful kidnapping of the Republic Supreme Chancellor. Grievous was immediately contacted by Sidious upon arrival, and ordered that the Separatist leaders move to the lava world of Mustafar, which would be safer for them. Grievous relayed the information, much to the frustration of certain council members."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Miin and Mai, along with the rest of the leaders, obeyed. The Battle of Utapau occurred shortly after, in which Grievous was killed. Sidious, who was actually the Republic chancellor, Palpatine, then issued Order 66, a directive that ordered all Republic clone troopers to execute their Jedi generals. Sidious then ordered his new pupil, Darth Vader, to attend to Mustafar. Sidious explained that with the onset of confederate victory, Vader would protect them as the war finally ended. However, when Vader arrived, he began to execute the council members, under Sidious' orders. Miin was killed by Vader, while Mai was decapitated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cat Miin was trusted by Shu Mai, under the fact that Miin was allowed to attend many secretive confederate meetings with Mai, including the meeting where they pledged their allegiance to Dooku. Otherwise, Miin was often silent, patiently observing Mai's duties. Miin was also entrusted with the observing of deliveries regarding the raw materials needed to create the Separatist's droid armies. Miin had blue colored skin, and eyes with black irises. During 22 BBY, Miin's skin was a light blue color with some hints of a beige color, but as the war progressed and as Miin grew in age, her skin color notably darkened, and the beige traces disappeared."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cat Miin was created for a brief appearance in the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, which was directed by George Lucas. In Clones, Miin had noticeably different appearance than Shu Mai, including a different head shape, lack of a headdress, and lighter skin. Both Gossam characters were fully generated with computers. Miin later appeared in Clones's 2005 sequel, Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. For her second film appearance, Miin was realized as a re-coloration of the existing Mai graphic. Whereas Mai was seen unchanged from her earlier appearance, her model was given blue clothing and darker skin in order to portray Miin. This version of Miin was used as a basis for an action figure produced by Hasbro Inc. that was distributed during the release of Sith. Similar to Miin's second film appearance, her first action figure was actually a repaint of an earlier released Shu Mai figure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
