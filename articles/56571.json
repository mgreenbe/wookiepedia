When Palpatine issued Order 66, Brood and her master were in the Outer Rim Territories, and thus not immediately affected by the initial purge. However, her master did feel the ripples in the Force caused by the sudden deaths of so many Jedi. After meeting only silence with every transmission he sent from the Pilgrim to the Jedi Temple, Brood's master took his personal starfighter in search of answers. He never returned, but his last message to the Pilgrim revealed that the Jedi Order had been all but destroyed by a Sith Lord named Darth Vader. Seeking revenge, Maris set off, presumably in the Pilgrim, in search of Vader. On her way, she encountered Jedi Master Shaak Ti, who convinced the angry Padawan to disappear into hiding on the planet Felucia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
