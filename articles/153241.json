In 9 ABY, he piloted an Imperial Gozanti-class Assault Carrier, alongside a security officer. One day, the Gozanti assault carrier began departing the estuary moon Trask when it was attacked by four Mandalorians.

Hearing the severity of the Gozanti assault carrier's situation, Gideon implicitly ordered the captain to destroy the assault carrier. The pilot and the security officer exchanged glances in fear, and the captain complied with the moff, shooting the pair with his blaster.
