He tended to tour Coruscant's nightclubs to sell his addictive death sticks. In 22 BBY, shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Sel'Sabagno was present in the Outlander Club and attempted to sell his death sticks in the drinks bar to Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was searching for the Clawdite bounty hunter Zam Wesell. Kenobi used a mind trick to convince Sel'Sabagno that he did not want to sell the Jedi any death sticks and instead wanted to go home and rethink his life. By the time Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker were assisting Wesell at the back of the establishment, Sel'Sabagno had already left the club to go home and think over."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Imperial Era, Sel'Sabagno, by then with a child of his own, passed by a conversation between Leia Organa and Forzaa on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Always searching for credits, Elan Sel'Sabagno made his living selling death sticks to patrons of the Outlander Club and other hot spots in the underlevels of Coruscant, targeting both desperate addicts and unwise thrill-seekers.
