Two years after the war, the Galactic Empire launched a military offensive to suppress the influence of the separatists on Ostor. Veer and the other separatist leaders helped establish a defense strategy. This allowed the separatist general Atticus Farstar to almost completely wipe out a first wave of the Empire. However, the defense did not stand up to a second wave of attacks. Veer and the other leaders were killed in the course of the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
