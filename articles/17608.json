As of 27 ABY, Blackmoon Eleven was Koril Bekam. He was in a bacta tank during the evacuation of Borleias, however, and Wedge Antilles used his fighter to escape the world. Its comm unit was damaged such that it could broadcast its transponder signal, but no voice traffic. Thus, Antilles flew anonymously in the battle, in which he engaged and defeated more than a squadron of coralskippers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
