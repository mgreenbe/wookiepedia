In order to root out these Imperials, the New Republic sent a gunship carrying New Republic soldier Jom Barell and others to the world on an operation to stop them. The gunship was forced to fly through an electrical superstorm to reach the Imperials, but Barell managed to survive the mission despite being sure that they were dead before they even landed. When he was later tasked with performing a suborbital drop into battle on the planet Akiva, Barell reflected that he would rather be back in the electrical superstorm on Geonosis, as he detested jumping out of starships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Barell's operation on Geonosis was first mentioned in the novel Aftermath, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released on September 4th, 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
