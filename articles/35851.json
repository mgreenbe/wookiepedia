Once a life ended, its spirit would ascend to a different plane of existence and become one with the cosmic Force; however, some Jedi were able to maintain their conscious individuality beyond death by learning the secrets of the Living Force. Certain individuals who were not followers of the Jedi teachings often referred to the different plane where the dead reside as the \"other side.\" Many individuals also sought a way to forestall death or even avoid it entirely. Darth Sidious was even able to return from the Netherworld through the power of the Dark Side of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mass death created disturbances in the Force, perceivable galaxy-wide by Force-sensitive individuals. When the planet Alderaan was destroyed by the Death Star, Obi-Wan Kenobi was visibly distressed and revealed to Luke Skywalker that something terrible had just happened, as if millions of voices cried out in terror and were then silenced. Nineteen years earlier, Jedi Master Yoda dropped his staff and became distressed as he sensed the death of many Jedi at the execution of Order 66."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Causes of death"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Death could be caused by combat or injuries sustained from combat. Combat-related causes of death could include the Force, lightsaber strikes, blaster fire, and being crushed under vehicles.

The deadly Blue Shadow Virus was purposely driven to extinction, though it was reintroduced to the galaxy by Separatist Doctor Nuvo Vindi. The Lasat species was driven to near-extinction by the forces of the Galactic Empire. The Galactic Empire drove the Geonosian species to extinction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Manipulation of death"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Project Blackwing sought to find a way to conquer death but instead created a virus that would kill and then reanimate those it infected.

Anakin Skywalker, desperately seeking a way to prevent what he had seen come to pass in his vision of the death of Padm\u00e9 Amidala, was entranced when Darth Sidious told him a tale of this; Skywalker's inability to let go of Amidala led to his fall to the dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nightsisters of Dathomir kept their dead close by, suspended in pods near their village, so that no sister ever truly left the clan. They believed that the dead could share in the emotions of the living, and with a magical chant could temporarily be reanimated in the form of undead warriors. The Nightsisters resurrected their dead to fight the Battle of Dathomir, but they were ultimately destroyed by Grievous."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the body of the Nightsister Asajj Ventress was laid to rest in the pools of the village, a green mist arose as the voices of her sisters welcomed her home. After death, the spirits of the Nightsisters were tethered to the altar in the Nightsister lair. Several years later during the Rise of the Empire, the Nightsister Merrin, the sole survivor of Grievous's attack, used the undead Nightsisters to attack the Jedi Knight, Cal Kestis. She believed that the Jedi had orchestrated the attack because of the lies of the former Jedi Master, Taron Malicos. Years later, the Nightsisters' spirits were awoken by Ezra Bridger and Maul. Two Nightsister spirits possessed two of Ezra's friends, Sabine Wren and Kanan Jarrus, in an effort to return to the physical world and rebuild their clan and as \"price\" for their aid to Maul and Bridger. However, Ezra destroyed the altar, and consequently, the spirits dissipated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although dying while on Mortis, Ahsoka Tano was revived back to life by the Daughter, who transferred her life form to Tano after being stabbed by the Son."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The death of Han Solo left his son, Kylo Ren, conflicted with his choice of the dark side of the Force, as he initially thought killing his father would relieve him of any emotional hindrance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke Skywalker's death resulted in the disappearance of his physical body as he became one with the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After killing Darth Sidious, Rey died, but she was resuscitated from death by a redeemed Ben Solo. This act was accomplished by him pouring his own life force into Rey. As a consequence, Solo's physical body disappeared into the Force.
