The group named themselves after the former owner of the Laughing Sullustan, Quentin Bartog. The denizens of the Anchor likened the Bartog Syndicate to a carnival troupe filled with gamblers, rogues, thieves, forgers, renegade droids, and failed bounty hunters. The Bartog Syndicate would often hold noisy parties, and engage in other activities that would annoy Defensus Solar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
