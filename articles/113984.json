They were effective for scything down waves of advancing infantry, and some models had the capability to fire high intensity blasts which could destroy light vehicles. Certain repeating blaster cannons also had the capability to fire slower, high intensity blasts. Repeating blaster cannons were built into the arms of the Droideka, the E4 baron droid, and the AT-RT walkers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
