It was named for the massive Rakata machine that occupied the center of the cavern; one of the machine's supports had collapsed and sent the structure crashing to the ground by the time of the Galactic War. The Sith Empire established the Imperial remote post there in their efforts to locate the Dread Masters in Vault 914, which was located in the cavern, but the Imperials at the post were wiped out by the Esh-kha."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
