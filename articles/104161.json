It specialized in the production of aquatic vehicles for use on the water world of Pelagon and the worlds of the Tapani sector. The company was created by a group of engineers from Sienar Fleet Systems. The engineers were lured away from Sienar by House Pelagia to produce a local vehicle manufacturing company near their realm of influence. After the fall of House Pelagia from the efforts of House Mecetti, PACC was able to stay in business. This allowed House Pelagia to retain some of its power after its downfall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
