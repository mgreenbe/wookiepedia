The Valahari forces led by Tofen Vane destroyed the Republic blockade of the planet. The Republic blockade of three Venator-class star- destroyers and their fighter complement would normally be able to defeat a small local fighter wing, but Tofen Vane's piloting skills allowed the confederate forces to destroy the defended V-19s. The remaining Valahari fighters proceeded to use proton torpedoes to obliterate the command bridges of the Republic cruisers, incapacitating them. Soon after Tofen Vane dogfight-ed and eliminate an unnamed Mon Calamari Jedi, while the Valahari fighters mopped up the star destroyers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
