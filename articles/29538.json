Utilizing simple yet effective concealment techniques not seen since the Rebel Alliance, the entrance to the base was a simple holoprojector masking a magnetic containment field. Any ship wishing to gain access simply had to know the location of the hidden entrance, and pass through the \"ground\" into the massive hollow below."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
