In 22 BBY, the Jedi Master Mace Windu came to the planet to investigate a hologram depicting a slaughtered group of jungle prospectors and a recording that connected his former Padawan, a Chalactan woman named Depa Billaba, to their deaths. Windu later learned that Billaba had worked with Korun leader Kar Vastor to stage the scene so that Windu would come to the planet looking for her. He wrote in his journal wondering what kind of man could convince his followers to leave the bodies of civilians, especially the women and children, to be consumed by the likes of screw maggots and other scavengers such as jacunas and carrion flies. He found the idea revolting and quickly moved on in his thoughts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The screw maggot was mentioned in the 2003 novel Shatterpoint, written by Matthew Stover."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
