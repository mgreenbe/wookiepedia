Having crashed or been shot down numerous times, Shen was forced to have extensive cybernetics to survive, but was still determined to serve the Empire. Shen once lost two vertebrae when he was shot down in an encounter with Anvil Squadron. Also, he said he broke his neck five or six times, not knowing the exact number of times.
