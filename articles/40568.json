They were used in a variety of roles and environments, often those considered too menial or too dangerous for other species, but also in fields that required extensive specialization and knowledge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The earliest origins of droids were lost to history, and, by the time of the New Republic, it was unknown exactly when the first droid was created, though some historians, only taking into account the more advanced worlds, placed the origin of the first droids to approximately 30,000 years before the Battle of Yavin. Nevertheless, for millennia, droids served in galactic society alongside organic beings. According to the B1-series battle droid R0-GR, the bond between organic and mechanical lifeforms were tenuous with the former fearing that droids would rise up against their masters. Though several droid revolts took place, Roger claimed that an \"unspoken understanding\" between human and droid cultures kept everyone working on the same team throughout the ages."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Droids existed as far back as the earliest days of the Jedi Order, which was founded over 25,000 years before the Clone Wars. One such ancient droid, Professor Huyang, served the Jedi for several millennia. As a result of this ancient coexistence with living beings, the galaxy often had an uneven relationship between organics and mechanicals. Records of uprisings and clashes between droids and their organic overlords became increasingly common as droids slowly became more important in galactic society. During the High Republic Era, the Nihil deployed blaredroids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the pan-galactic conflict known as the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems used a variety of battle droids in its fight against the Galactic Republic. This mass use of droids in combat cemented the idea of the \"droid as an existential threat to biological life\" narrative in the minds of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, the Republic won the war and was replaced by an authoritarian Galactic Empire. Under the new regime, many people in the galaxy were afraid or otherwise distrustful of droids, due to their bad memories of the conflict. The Galactic Empire fostered anti-droid sentiment, treating droids as property. Many sentients continued the Clone Wars policies of wiping droids' memories, fitting them with restraining bolts, and curtailing their movements. Several establishments also excluded droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel Alliance, which opposed the Empire, treated droids not as property but as sentient beings. Several droids were encouraged by the Rebellion and carried out acts of resistance such as bypassing repressive programming, deactivating restraining bolts, and demanding freedom. The Rebellion's acceptance of droids as equals was continued by the New Republic and Resistance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Droids were not utilized by the Chiss Ascendancy by the time of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Definition"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Droids were mechanical constructs designed to assist organic lifeforms in various tasks. Depending on the nature of the work they performed, they possessed various degrees of artificial intelligence. Most droids had hard-coded restrictions against harming organics. Notable exceptions included security droids and assassin droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Droids came in all sizes and shapes, and many of them resembled humanoid organics, possessing an upright posture, two arms, two legs, hands, feet, one thorax, a neck, and a head. The B1 battle droids were designed to resemble their insectoid Geonosian creators. Likewise, the Colicoids designed the three-legged droidekas in their image. Some droids, like the LOM-series unit, were made to resemble the organics they served."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Contrary to organics, who were born and healed slowly, droids were easily built en masse, were less fragile, and could be repaired easily. They also did not have to learn skills (such as calculation abilities), as they were directly programmed with them. Most droids possessed a form of self-awareness, with advanced models even having emotions such as fear for their existence. Droids did not need to breathe, eat or drink. They were capable of surviving in a vacuum and underwater, and were immune to all poisons and toxins. They did not need to sleep, although they could be deactivated as a form of sleep and had occasional maintenance cycles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because they were not technically alive, droids could not access the Force, an energy field that connected all living things in the galaxy. The reprogrammed protocol unit Triple-Zero, however, theorized that the Force might flow through a droid equipped with a special engine driven by human blood. Additionally, not being alive, droids could not be sensed in the Force, though a skilled Jedi might sense their presence through the empty spots they left in the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Droids were usually completely obedient and precise, and normally followed their proprietors' orders. Some droids, however, were emancipated and fended for themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike mere machines or primitive computers, droids were capable of developing unique personalities by gathering experiences. They could form friendships, and experience emotions such as happiness, pain, and sadness. To avoid that, most droid owners performed regular memory wipes on their properties. However, memory wipes were not always perfect, occasionally leaving droids with vague recollections."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was the nature of less complex droids to assume that if a human acted as if they belonged somewhere, then that human did belong there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Classes of droids"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Droids could be entrusted with a multitude of tasks, ranging from running elementary diagnostics to performing complicated medical procedures, or sending communications to flying starships.

However, droids were Lucas' favorite people, and the filmmaker did not want droids to be cold or malevolent, just like how the robots in THX 1138 were \"very friendly.\" Lucas wanted to focus on droids and their issues in life, giving them equal screentime since they had endured much suffering over the years and had little to no opportunities to prove themselves.
