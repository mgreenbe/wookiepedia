General Grievous lured warriors from the Rokrul village by having them believe he was a prophesied figure out of Nelvaan mythology, as had been spoken of by their village shaman Orvos. Techno Union scientists then captured them, and physically and mentally altered them into cyborgs for the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grievous, who served as Supreme Commander of the Separatist droid army, had been appraised of the Outer Rim planet by Techno Union foreman Wat Tambor. Upon visiting Nelvaan, Grievous was very much impressed by the similarities between the spiritual Nelvaanian warriors and his own Kaleesh people and, in a twisted form of kinship, he intended to make them his 'new elite', harking back to his earlier days as commander of the elite 'Izvoshra' soldiers of his people's Kolkpravis warrior band. It was General Grievous who thus lured the male Nelvaanian soldiers away from their tribe by making them believe he was the Nelvaan mythology's prophesied figure in order to conduct -- via Skakoan combat engineers using 'unique microelectronics' -- a crude cybernetics experiment upon their bodies. But the perverse mutation project was ultimately sabotaged by Anakin Skywalker, who heroically freed the warriors from what otherwise would have been a hideous fate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After freeing the soldiers in what came to be known as the Battle of Nelvaan, Skywalker, who was referred to by the Nelvaan race as Holt Kezed (Ghost Hand in their language, because of his mechanical right arm), destroyed the Separatist base. Although initially frightened by the near-miraculous reappearance of their warriors, the Nelvaanian females and children came quickly to accept them, joyously welcoming them back into the tribe. Future generations of Nelvaanian males, however, retained the traits of their mutant progenitors, and as a result were larger than the females, who did not inherit the aforementioned characteristic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nelvaanians are loosely named after the Canadian animation studio, Nelvana."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nelvaan people first appeared in Star Wars: Clone Wars.
