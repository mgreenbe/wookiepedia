The conflict was the result of a Mandalorian blockade of the super-hyperroute, and was initiated by the Jedi Order in an attempt to open the Hydian Way for the shipping of Republic Military goods. The attempt proved to be unsuccessful, and the Jedi strike force was wiped out. The Mandalorians maintained their blockade until 3660 BBY, when the smuggler Hylo Visz led a group of smugglers into battle against the warrior clans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
