AT-AAs used flak systems, as did flak guns aboard various capital ships. The shells could use either proximity or timed fuses and exploded with showers of shrapnel. They could be highly dangerous to enemy combat airspeeders or starfighters, but much less so against other, larger classes of fighting ships. They were often used as a point-defense weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
