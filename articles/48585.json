Imperial forces suspected the abandoned cargo area was the result of transmissions from Rebel forces voicing their intent to destroy the loading area. Nonetheless, Thrawn intended to see this through."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn oversaw this operation from his flagship Victory-class Star Destroyer Stalwart, initially launching a single TIE Bomber piloted by Imperial Ace Maarek Stele to inspect the five groups of abandoned Cargo containers. Stele discovered various useful station parts among 5 of the containers, resulting in the launch of Heavy group Mule to pick up the equipment while Stele destroyed the empty containers. As the Heavy Lifters began to arrive to collect useful containers, Rebel Y-wings entered the area, heading for the Stalwart. TIE Fighter flight group Gamma was launched in response to the impending bombing runs, aided by TIE Bomber Alpha 1 having completed its inspections. Soon additional Rebel starships joined the battle, starting with a Stormtrooper transport Scouter, then CR90 corvettes Dragon, Beecon and Viper afterwards a Lambda-class shuttle Splinter arrived. The Stalwart launched additional TIE Bombers and Interceptors to counter the increasing rebel threat. The new arrivals succeeded in quelling the enemy corvettes, only to be answered by B-wings and X-wings emerging from hyperspace. As Imperial starfighters finished off the last of the Rebel raiders, all five Heavy Lifter from Mule had collected the containers that contained the cargo and returned to the Stalwart's hangar. A single A-wing arrived as a last ditch effort to inflict Imperial casualties, however Thrawn's mission was already complete."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn succeeded in acquiring all the materials needed to build a new space installation.
