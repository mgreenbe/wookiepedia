According to Cosinga Palpatine, in about 135 BBY, Houses Tapalo, Veruna and others hired a group of mercenaries to attack Naboo's native Gungans, as part of a ploy to gain access to Naboo's plasma resources. However, House Palpatine learned of their plot and a member of the House challenged a member of House Tapalo to an honor duel; Tapalo won.
