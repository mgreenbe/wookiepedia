It was written to the protagonist Rose Tico, and it plays over some of the character's appearances in the film. It is a two-phrase theme that conveys the innocence of the Resistance fighter. In the soundtrack, the theme is prominently featured in the track \"The Rebellion Is Reborn\" and makes appearances in several other tracks. The theme shares its first six notes with the first six notes of \"The Force Theme,\" and has the same opening chord sequence as \"Yoda's Theme.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}]}
