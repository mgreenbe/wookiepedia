He once destroyed a former apprentice, not for his clumsy scheming and attempts at betrayal, but for insulting one of Serevin's dinner guests. For these reasons, when the Empire was still smoothing over its short-lived attempt at invading Voss and a diplomatic envoy of immense skill was called for, Darth Serevin's poise and experience made him the ideal choice. He was also a close ally of Darth Malgus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his long tenure on Voss, Darth Serevin developed an appreciation for Voss art and architecture; so much so that he sent orders for his own lodgings on Dromund Kaas to be redecorated accordingly. He also came to see the potential value of the Voss people to the Empire; and of gaining an army of Voss commandos and Voss Mystics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Malgus revealed his plans for establishing a new empire, Serevin was among the many to flock to his ranks. He agreed with Malgus's beliefs that the Empire should not discriminate against alien species, such as the Voss. When an assembled strike team arrived to stop Malgus's forces from taking crystals for his stealth fleet, Serevin was present with two other Voss. One was a Mystic named Talsa-ko, who stated that her vision detailed that she would side with the victor. If he won the battle, Serevin believed, the Voss would join the new empire. However, Serevin was ultimately killed by the strike force, and the Voss were either imprisoned or killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Serevin was a charming character, able to gain the trust of the Voss not only for the Empire, but for himself as well. Though appearing an exceptional diplomat, he also fooled the Voss, as he made them believe that an agent of the Empire was the one who would fulfill a new vision of theirs. He was one of the few Sith who disagreed with the Empire's anti-alien policies, which was one of the main reasons he joined Darth Malgus. In fact, he had developed a deep passion for alien art, especially the Voss. Serevin appeared to be one of the few Sith who preferred manners over their natural aggressiveness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like many of his fellow Sith Lords who had gained the Darth title, Serevin was an exceptional fighter, both in lightsaber combat and in the use of the Force. He was able to hold his own against a strike team, displaying both his deadly lightsaber and his mastery of the Force. He proved to be a user of telekinesis while throwing Adegan crystals on the strike team. Furthermore, he frequently used lightning attacks, most notably a powerful lightning attack called Force Explosion, as well as Dark Blast. He was also able to utilize some sort of stealth, which he combined with a lightning attack that frequently stunned his enemies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the player choses to disclose information regarding the genetic relationship between the Voss and the Gormak on Voss, Ambassador Serevin becomes enraged with the player, questioning the player's decision once the hologram transmission with the Three has terminated.
