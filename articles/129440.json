The Sullustan was present in the pilot's lounge of the MC80 Home One type Star Cruiser for a conversation between Red Squadron pilots about their preferred Imperial targets, with Speedy mentioning his particular dislike for Assault Gunboats. A cultural divide separated the Sullustan pilot from Red Squadron, with his fellow Rebel pilots understanding neither his jokes nor his references to scarns."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite this, Speedy returned to the company of Red Squadron's pilots in 0 BBY after receiving special reconnaissance training due to his Sullustan navigational skills, witnessing Keyan Farlander's attempt to use a Force mind trick on Samuel Raider and recruitment of rookie pilots such as Casal Marskan with promises of power through the Force. After Marskan's death, Speedy, along with Raider and Marskan's brother, grew to distrust and hate Farlander, alienating him from his fellow pilots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
