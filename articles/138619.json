They were often reconditioned standard TIEs. TIE Light Duty starfighters had inferior components, lighter armor, and less firepower in order not to be too dangerous to novice pilots. This reduction in firepower also helped to put less stress on fragile reactors and superstructures. Some backwater planets had a navy partially composed of TIE Light Duty starfighters reconditioned to carry more lethal weapons.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
