Swamp worms were experts at moving through the thick mud of Veron's surface. They would often bury themselves in a few centimeters of mud and wait for a creature to walk by. Once the vibrations reached the swamp worm's soft skin, it sprang to life, attempting to kill with the stinger on the end of its tail."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Swamp worms were dangerous simply because they were usually not noticed until it was too late. They were found in the swamp-like regions of the forest floor.
