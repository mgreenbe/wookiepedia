At one point during the Galactic Civil War, it was staffed by a young Human female working for TransGalMeg Industries, Incorporated. She had to contend with the fact that the speaker on her side of the carbon glass partition was not working, meaning that she could hear information requests. TransGalMeg refused to replace the speaker or allow he to admit it was broken, leading her to pretend to fulfill information requests before replying that there was no information available."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
