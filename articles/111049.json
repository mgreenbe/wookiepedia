Using data already collected, the Rebels discovered that cargo shipments to a research station doing work on the Death Star were being sent from the Vergesso Asteroids.

While Captain Antilles led a team to attack the stunned defenses, a group of Rebel troopers managed to penetrate the station in RM-09 Alliance shuttles. But the Imperial defenses quickly recovered their ability to fight. Meanwhile, Rebel soldiers were delayed in the station by the Imperial infantry. They eventually managed to recover valuable data, just when the Star Destroyers began to engage the Rebel fleet.

However, this version of the event can not considered canon. A separate, conflicting account of Ackbar's liberation was described in Star Wars: X-Wing and Darksaber, in which Ackbar is rescued during an assassination attempt against Tarkin at Eriadu. This version has been upheld in several Star Wars reference books, including The New Essential Guide to Characters (2002), The New Essential Chronology (2005), and The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia (2008). Also non-canonical is the presence of Han Solo and Chewbacca, an option because they are not removed from play for this mission.
