After one midnight on Odacer-Faustin\u2014a frigid planet in the Outer Rim's Esstran sector\u2014in 3645 BBY, Human mechanic Pergus Frode sat back in the control booth of the Odacer-Faustin Sith academy's main hangar holding a reheated cup of Javarican espresso and a datapad showing the Hot Ships holomag. The mechanic, fearful of punishment, had felt obliged to stay up late to watch over the starship of a bounty hunter hired by Darth Scabrous, headmaster of the Sith academy.
