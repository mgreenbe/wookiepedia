As part of their programming, these droids would often dive into enemy planets and, upon passing through the defenses, they would begin ramming strategic locations to cripple the enemy. While a costly tactic, it proved to be remarkably successful and was actually used during the Battle of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
