It was constructed by the B'omarr monks and contained a circular stairway that provided space for the monks to wander, as they could move up and down the stairs while meditating. The tower was equipped with surveillance technology, a communication dome and a Hyperwave communication system which Jabba used to keep up with intrigues in the galaxy's underworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 2005 reference book Star Wars: Complete Locations claims it was Alkhara who added the tower, while The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia establishes that the tower was built by the B'omarr monks who constructed the palace.
