Made with the meat of the nerf species, small chunks of the meat were skewered in between a beige pastry along with red peppers on the side. It was made on a grill and edible by Artiodacs. Tuggs acknowledged that due to nerfs being common in the galaxy, they were not considered a gourmet option. Nonetheless, he hoped that his culinary flair and addition of Nerfsteak Seasoning would make the meat more enjoyable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tuggs included a recipe for Nerf Kebabs in his cookbook, The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, which he authored after the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY. In the book, he promised that after one tried the dish, they would wish to take up nerf herding in order to eat the kebabs each day. Tuggs served the dish at his restaurant, Tuggs' Grub, located in Black Spire Outpost on the planet Batuu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nerf Kebabs were introduced in the 2019 recipe book Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, which was authored by Chelsea Monroe-Cassel and Marc Sumerak.
