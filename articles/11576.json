Commissioned by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars, many surviving Y-wings would go on to serve with the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. Notable models included the original two-seat BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber; its successor, the BTL-S3 Y-wing Starfighter, and the single-seat BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early part of the Clone Wars, the Galactic Republic commissioned Koensayr to develop a combination starfighter and long-range bomber.  Their result, the original BTL-B model, proved so successful that additional variants were created, among them the BTL-S3 and BTL-A4 variants.  However, except for differences in their cockpit and gunner layouts, these all share the same characteristics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The BTL-B Y-wing consists of a cockpit section which connects via reinforced central spar and cross-wing to two large Koensayr ion engines.  The pressurized cockpit seated a pilot (and in some models a gunner) protected by a transparisteel canopy.  Some cockpit sections were modified so that they were fully contained, repulsor-powered escape vehicles, though most Y-wings incorporated traditional ejector seats."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each engine was fitted with four strong pylons that extended behind to support a long engine nacelle, at the end of which were disk-ventrals that redirected thrust for maneuverability.  A pair of thrust control jets were set in the aft central spar to give the Y-wing greater agility.  Repulsorlifts were fitted in the neck and wings to provide atmospheric flight.  A fuel recycling system gave the Y-wing extreme efficiency during long-range missions.  In the event that the craft would have to make a make an emergency landing, the pilot could dump its fuel from the engines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For weaponry the Y-wing was fitted with two forward firing laser cannons, either the KX5 or IX4 models.  These weapons, designed to penetrate battle cruiser hulls, could have devastating effect on lesser targets, collapsing a five-story stone building in just a few shots.  Backing up these were twin SW-4 or SW-5 ion cannons, mounted on a rotating turret controlled either by a dedicated gunner or by the pilot depending on the variant.  Lastly were a pair of MG7 proton torpedo launchers, each with a six-round magazine.  Besides proton torpedoes, these launchers could launch other weapons including concussion missiles, proton bombs and cluster missiles.  The starfighter was capable of unleashing a tremendous amount of firepower, especially when attacking in groups: a squadron of Y-wings could carry enough ordnance to glass an entire city, bathing the battlefield in blinding white detonations which scrambled sensors.  The Y-wing could also carry external ordnance mounted directly on its hull, such as an electro-proton bomb."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Y-wing was heavily armored with a titanium-reinforced alusteel hull and a Chempat deflector shield generator.  The generator, powered by the ion engines, was linked to shield projectors located across the Y-wing's hull. This allowed the pilot to angle the shields of maximum protection or cover damaged sections of the ship. The Y-wing could also use its cannons to shoot down enemy missiles, so long as the targeting computer remained functional."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For flight control, the Y-wing featured a Subpro Corporation NH-7 flight control avionics package and photonics communication system, as well as ANc 2.7 tracking computer linked to an SI 5g7 \"Quickscan\" vector imaging system, an ANs-5d \"lock track\" full-spectrum transceiver, Long range PTDA PA-9r phased tachyon detection array and Short range PTAG PG-7u primary threat analysis grid. A composite sensor dome was fitted to the forward end of each engine, while a rear-facing sensor was position on the cross-wing. A R2 series astromech droid, fitted in a dedicated socket behind the cockpit, carried hyperspace data for the R300-H hyperdrive motivator and could manage all other systems by itself. Y-wings heavily depended on the astromech being operational, due to the fact that hyperspace was impossible without one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The original Y-wing featured a plethora of additional equipment geared towards its mission of long-range strikes.  This included backup batteries, a secondary life support system, fresh water tanks, and an emergency flotation system. Because the Y-wing tended to run hot, a complex cooling system extended throughout the entire starfighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel Alliance sought to buy or steal as many Y-wings as they could to form their nascent rebellion. However, they quickly realized that the cooling system required extensive maintenance after every flight, necessitating the removal of armor plating just to get at it.  In order to ease this burden, it was decided to remove the armor plating, which was used to refit other ships (such as the T-47 airspeeder), with additional shield power added to compensate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Other changes included the removal or reconfiguration of various components to lighten weight.  This included removing the fuel reclamation system for all but some BTL-S3 models (which were utilized as couriers) and replacing the torpedo launchers' six-round magazine with a four-round model. The engine support pylons were also shortened to improve maneuverability during close combat.  While the resulting fighter looked spindly, overall integrity on the Y-wing was not compromised, and it resulted in a faster and more lethal starfighter than the original. The speed and maneuverability of certain models, in particular the two-seat BTL-S3, was still considered subpar, but they were regarded as reliable and well-armed nonetheless."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Models"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For decades after the Clone Wars, various Y-wing models saw combat in military conflicts, through the Galactic Civil War and up to the First Order-Resistance conflict. The Alliance modified their Y-wings by removing the hull and nacelle plating in order to increase ease of maintenance on the aging craft, which would enter the popular memory. Except for the cockpit variations, all ships in the BTL series were similar in design."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "BTL-B Y-wing"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber was the original model commissioned by the Republic Navy in the early stages of the Clone Wars, designed as a combination starfighter and long-range bomber that could replace the V-19 Torrent and Jedi interceptors. The model's distinguishing feature was its bubble-turret, which swiveled 360 degrees, providing a clear view of surrounding space for gunners. A mainstay of the Republic Navy, it was present at many of the major battles of the war, though most BTL-Bs were scrapped by the Empire after the conflict."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "BTL-A4 LP"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The BTL-A4 LP variant served as a long-distance reconnaissance vessel."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "BTL-A4 Y-wing"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Designed after the success of the BTL-B, the BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber variant served as a single-seat tactical strike spacecraft which lacked the gunner's position of other variants.

Despite their size, the two-seat starfighters were quite maneuverable, with clone trooper pilots routinely performing quick rolls while staying in formation. Their turrets and fixed guns allowed them to engage and destroy multiple targets simultaneously, making them effective in combat missions against enemy starfighters. This versatility made them suitable for a number of mission profiles, whether it involved attacking enemy capital ships or bombing ground targets. They were, however, considered \"buggy\" in atmospheric operations."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Kaliida Nebula"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shadow Squadron, a unit of clone trooper pilots, flew Y-wing bombers in the Battle of the Kaliida Nebula under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker.
