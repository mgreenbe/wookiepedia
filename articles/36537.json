To win back the freedom of his sister Djulla Tyerell, who had been sold as a slave to the Dug Sebulba, Deland competed in an illegal podrace at the Great Dordon Caves on the outskirts of Euceron City, held separately from but concurrent with the Galactic Games of 26 BBY. Sebulba, however, broke Deland's arm prior to the race, hoping to help his own son Hekula to win.

Even so, despite what also proved to be Vista's attempt to sabotage Deland's pod (intending it to careen into the grandstands filled with unwary spectators, resulting in sure death), Skywalker pulled through for the Tyerell brothers as he regained control of the vehicle: the young Jedi's win secured not only safety for the crowds, but also freedom for their sister."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Deland later founded the Ratts Tyerell Foundation (RTF), a group opposed to the dangerous game of podracing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
