The Mandalorian bounty hunter known as Din Djarin visited the space station to join a team of mercenaries, who had been tasked by Malk into rescuing the prisoner Qin from the Bothan-Five, a New Republic Correctional Transport. The team betrayed Djarin and left him for dead, but he escaped and returned to the station with Qin, the latter unknowingly carrying a tracker from the prison ship. Malk paid Djarin and let him leave, but ordered a gunship to shoot him down. However, a New Republic X-wing squadron followed the tracker's distress signal, and opened fire on the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
