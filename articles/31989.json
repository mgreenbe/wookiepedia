On Crait, crystalstorms were known to kick up crystals from beneath the planet's surface. When the Nupayuni Mining Consortium first charted Crait, the mining company erected several structures, including a blast door that could withstand crystalstorms. At some point during or prior to 3 BBY, the Rebel Alliance leader Bail Organa established a hidden outpost on the planet, which once bore witness to a crystalstorm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Crystalstorms were first mentioned in the 2017 reference book Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary written by Pablo Hidalgo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
