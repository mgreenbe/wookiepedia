The fleshborers spent the majority of their life cycle within the original host body, emerging only to find another host. Upon finding a suitable host, they shed their wings and burrowed into the creature's skin. Boba Fett encountered a swarm of fleshborers aboard the derelict Mingula, and his prisoner, Tsumo, was devoured by the creatures. Fett's other prisoner, an Ubuugan, found the fleshborers rather tasty,[source?] as the Ubuugan species had evolved biological defenses against the parasites and regarded them as a delicacy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
