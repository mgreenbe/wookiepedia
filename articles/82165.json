Lines were commanded by captains of the line. The line was generally intended to be comprised of four starships, although in reality, only seven percent of naval lines were made up of four ships. Lines could be as small as a single vessel, or made up of twenty or more vessels. A Star Destroyer was considered to be a line all by itself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
