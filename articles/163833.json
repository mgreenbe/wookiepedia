One type was the Sancretti Arms Whip, which was made of cables of bantha hide, which modeled a rather basic and typical whip. However, more unique types also existed, some consisting of metal cables and possessing stun and shock functions, like the shock whip and neuronic whip. Some possessed more unusual traits, such as the ability to freeze targets like the Rodian cryogen whip, or to cause burns, like the fire whip. Whips were even utilized by force users, by converted into the extremely dangerous - but difficult to master - lightwhip, which used energized cables to cut down foes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another type of whip was discovered in 1 ABY, alongside a unique type of hat called a fedora.
