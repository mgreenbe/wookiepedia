Resupply was present during the Capture and Defense of ZA-13 where the plant was being returned to Imperial control against rogue Grand Admiral Zaarin's insurrection and when the factory was supposed to be receiving upgrades and was attacked by a Rebel strike force during the process. The transport would then show up again at the operation to capture RS-32 to secure Mag Pulse warheads."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Resupply appears in Star Wars: TIE Fighter at Battle 8 Combats 4, 5 and 6.
