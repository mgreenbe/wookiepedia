Stricken with an obsession for obtaining immortality, Sidious had long considered bioengineering and cloning technology as potential routes along the path towards an eternal life. To that end, the Dark Lord tasked his underlings with the harrowing mission of creating and sustaining an organic being which would act as a sufficient vessel to house Sidious' dark essence. Numerous strand-casts were spawned within the unholy machinery of the laboratory, yet many resulted in disfigured abominations, unsuitable to carry the god-consciousness of Sidious. Much trial and error eventually had yielded a semi-successful case: the Force-sensitive entity known as Snoke, whom Sidious later installed as the puppet ruler of the First Order in his stead. Several cloned copies of Snoke were kept within the lab, housed in tubes of nutrient-rich fluid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith Citadel lab appears in the 2019 film Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, the third installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
