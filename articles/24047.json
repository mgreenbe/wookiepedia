On Carrick Station, Hun's friend and fellow Jedi Master, Nimi, often directed newly-arrived Jedi Knights to speak with the Twi'lek Jedi about undergoing training to become either a Jedi Sentinel or Jedi Guardian. Hun would teach those Knights about the two training paths, and he frequently gave his students an additional lightsaber if they chose to become a Sentinel, or additional armor if they chose the path of a Guardian. One such student in 3643 BBY was the former apprentice of Jedi Master Orgus Din, and the newly-Knighted Jedi spoke with Hun on either Coruscant or Carrick Station not long after departing the Jedi Order's homeworld of Tython."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A male Lethan Twi'lek, Cassa Hun had pinkish-red skin and green eyes, and the Jedi wore tan robes while carrying his single lightsaber.

Upon speaking with Hun, the player decides to pursue either the Guardian or Sentinel advanced class and then receives the chosen class's additional gear, and both of Hun's locations are marked in the Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide that was released alongside the game in 2011.
