A week later, Calrissian and his droid L3-37 arrived on Vandor, discovering the Falcon's location. Planning to rescue his ship, Calrissian decided to bide his time by playing a game of sabacc in the Lodge, using credits he had received from completing a recent mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the same time, Tobias Beckett and his crew had also landed on Vandor to carry out a heist on an Imperial conveyex train, in order to acquire coaxium for Dryden Vos and Crimson Dawn. They were assisted by Han Solo and Chewbacca, who had escaped Mimban on Beckett's stolen Y-45 armored transport hauler. The heist ultimately failed due to the interference of Enfys Nest's Cloud-Riders, who also attempted to steal the coaxium, leading Solo to drop the cargo in order to save the survivors of Beckett's crew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Vos' yacht First Light traveled to Vandor to personally meet Beckett, the crew planned a second mission to Kessel so they could retrieve coaxium to replace the cargo lost during the heist. Needing a ship that was fast enough to make the Kessel Run, the crew visited the Lodge, where they met Calrissian. At the Lodge, Solo joined a game of sabacc against Calrissian, hoping to win the Millennium Falcon. However, Calrissian's cheating led Solo to lose against him, but he eventually agreed to take Beckett's crew to Kessel aboard his ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vandor was sparsely settled, lacking the technological infrastructure that was present on other worlds.

Another inspiration for Vandor were the lavish landscapes of the American West by the 19th-century painters Frederick Church and Albert Bierstadt. The environment of Vandor was designed to evoke the landscape of southern Colorado's rocky mountains, as intended by screenwriter Jon Kasdan, who believed that it fit with the space-western feeling he and the film's crew tried to evoke."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
