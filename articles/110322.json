Placed in command of three other commandos, Boss led the elite special forces unit Delta Squad as their sergeant. When the Clone Wars broke out between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Boss took his place in the Grand Army's Special Operations Brigade under Jedi General Arligan Zey, and served alongside his clone brothers in Delta Squad on a number of battlefields, ranging from the deserts of Geonosis, the halls of the RAS Prosecutor, and the streets of Coruscant, to snowy Mygeeto and the plains of Haurgab.

A clone of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett, RC-1138 was created to serve in the Grand Army of the Republic as a clone commando and, following a course of flash training, was placed under the direct training of the Mandalorian Cuy'val Dar training sergeant, Walon Vau. As his training progressed, Three-Eight proved himself an incredibly capable soldier, consistently scoring the highest of his clone brothers in weapon and tactics training. During a test of his melee skills with his training sergeant, Three-Eight broke Walon Vau's arm. With these accomplishments in mind, Vau assigned RC-1138 to Delta Squad, one of the first commando squads established by the Kaminoans, where he would serve as its sergeant, and thus came to be known as \"Boss\" to his three squadmates, RC-1140, RC-1207, and RC-1262\u2014known informally as \"Fixer,\" \"Sev,\" and \"Scorch,\" respectively."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Geonosis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Grand Army would finally see action in 22 BBY, when Jedi Grand Master Yoda took the army to the Outer Rim world of Geonosis to rescue Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, his Padawan Anakin Skywalker, and Galactic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala.

The four commandos split up, each boarding a single LAAT/i gunship independently, with the intention of rendezvousing once on the surface of Geonosis. Aboard his gunship, Boss spoke with Clone advisor CC-01/425, with the latter introducing himself and reminding Delta Squad of its tasking, assassinating Geonosian Archduke Poggle the Lesser's chief lieutenant, Sun Fac.

Delta tracked Fac through the Geonosian catacombs, eventually catching up with him in Fac's private hangar as the Geonosian attempted to escape in his starfighter. Fac's escape was prevented by the timely actions of Delta Squad's sniper, Sev, who used the sniping attachment of his DC-17m blaster rifle to shoot down the starfighter, killing Fac. While hunting for Sun Fac, Delta Squad had engaged a number of spider droids while their fellow Republic commando unit, Theta Squad, blew through a door in the catacombs. Boss had been in contact with Theta's demolition expert, RC-1136, and had emphatically encouraged the commando to make haste. Once the door was down, Delta was given leave to enter and fire on the Geonosians inside, while Theta moved off to destroy a droid factory.

When Scorch and Fixer came under heavy fire from a small number of droidekas, Boss and Sev were able to rescue them without incident. Their primary objective, however, was the capture of vital launch codes housed on the ship's bridge. On the bridge, Delta came under heavy fire from numerous battle droids and stationary autoturrets, but still managed to acquire the codes before retreating down a branching corridor. By then, the squad's efforts to sabotage the Core Ship had come to full fruition, with several primary systems overloading.

Delta Squad had spent a substantial amount of time aboard the capital ship during the early portion of the war, and Boss had even come to think of it as their \"first home\".

While searching through the ship, Delta Squad came across few survivors, and several members were set upon by scavenger droids; Scorch was ambushed and incapacitated by the droids. Shortly after, the squad found that the Prosecutor has been attacked by Trandoshan slavers and mercenaries when Sev was attacked and captured at the starboard data core where Boss had been waiting to meet him, and Boss was forced to flee into the ship's maintenance shafts. Despite this, Boss was able to complete his original objective, battling through heavily armed and armored Trandoshan mercenaries and the ship's very own autoturret defenses that had been sliced by the Trandoshans, before rendezvousing with Fixer and proceeding to rescue Sev. Once Sev was free of the violent interrogation from his Trandoshan captors, the incomplete squad moved to retrieve Scorch from where he was being held in the Prosecutor's detention area.

While their advisor called for assistance, Delta Squad was charged with repelling the droid boarding parties and sealing the assault ship's hangars. By the time Boss and the others reached the final hangar, it was overrun with droids and the commandos had to resort to commandeering the roof-mounted mass-driver cannon of an AT-TE walker to deal with the droid threat. Following these events, the Separatist battleship opened fire on the Prosecutor, deciding to cut its losses and destroy the Republic warship before reinforcements could arrive. In an attempt to hold off the battleship, Delta Squad struggled to get the Prosecutor's turbolaser battery array back online amidst a continuing assault from droid forces already onboard. Reinforcements would come in the form of Republic Navy Captain Talbot and the RAS Arrestor, the only Republic force to respond to CC-01/425's calls for assistance. Between the combined strength of the Arrestor and Prosecutor\u2014even as the latter's hull integrity was compromised\u2014the Confederacy droid control ship was destroyed, shutting down the battle droids aboard the Prosecutor, and saving the ship and the lives of Delta Squad.

Omega was trapped aboard a damaged freighter at the Corellian\u2013Perlemian hyperspace intersection, with no power, limited oxygen, and a trio of prisoners suspected of terrorist activity, which they had captured during an earlier Traffic Interdiction Operation. With no other Republic forces close enough to provide the much-needed assistance, Delta Squad took it upon themselves to respond. Boss consulted with Jedi General Etain Tur-Mukan en route, discussing the best plan for extracting Omega with a Separatist ship moving on their location at the same time. Delta Squad arrived on scene and quickly set about rescuing their fellow commandos, while General Tur-Mukan arrived with the Acclamator-class ship Fearless just in time to destroy the enemy ship before it could attack. Once Omega was safely on board, Sev nearly provoked a physical confrontation with Omega Squad member Atin; Boss made no move to intercede, leaving it to Omega Squad's sergeant, Niner, to break up the budding conflict before it could come to blows.

Once they were finished\u2014although Skirata teased that they had only completed forty of the fifty he'd assigned\u2014the commandos of Delta and Omega offloaded the three prisoners into a waiting speeder piloted by Skirata's Wookiee associate, Enacca, bound for interrogation at the hands of Delta's former training sergeant, Walon Vau. A transport arrived soon after to take Delta and Omega back to Arca Barracks. At 1500 hours, Delta met with Skirata and Omega Squad in one of Special Operations Brigade Headquarters' briefing rooms, where Skirata attempted to ease the tension between the two squads, insisting that Atin and Sev leave behind their grudge and shake hands.

Over the following days, Boss and the other members of Delta Squad would take part in a rotating surveillance watch with the members of Omega, and despite conflicts between members of the two squads where their distinct personalities clashed, the two squads worked together effectively and even came to develop a respect for one another. Using Qibbu's criminal contacts, the strike team was able to lure their terrorist targets\u2014who they determined hailed from Jabiim\u2014under the pretense of having a supply of five-hundred-grade thermal plastoid explosive that they were willing to sell. After a meeting between Skirata and the terrorist leader Perrive establishing a time when they would supposedly make the explosives sale, Delta Squad spent an evening enjoying themselves at Qibbu's bar with the other members of the strike team, at least until the revelry was cut short by a call from Perrive stating they would need to move up their time and change the pre-established location. Fortunately, the new location for the trade was a CoruFresh produce distribution depot in Quadrant F-76 of Galactic City, a location Delta Squad had personally reconnoitered earlier.

Delta completed their assignments as ordered, but instead of exfiltrating as they were supposed to, the commandos instead decided to assist their former training sergeant Vau in his personal mission, one that consisted of robbing Mygeeto's own Dressian Kiolsh Merchant Bank. While Fixer held position near the squad's snowspeeder on the planet's surface, Boss and the other two members of Delta Squad followed Vau into the underground halls of the bank, where Scorch proceeded to electronically disable the locks on the main vault's door. Once inside, however, Vau refused to allow the squad to assist him any further in the heist, determined not to compromise his trainees' integrity by directly involving them in the actual act of stealing. It was during Vau's raid on the vault's numerous safety deposit boxes that Boss learned of his former training sergeant's past as a disinherited aristocrat from Irmenu, and that the purpose of the theft was to regain the inheritance his mother and father had denied him.

When satisfied with Boss' accounting, Zey passed along the compliments of General Ki-Adi-Mundi to the squad before detailing their next assignment: Supreme Chancellor Palpatine had ordered the capture of the rogue Kaminoan scientist, Kamino's own former Chief Scientist Ko Sai. Considering her capture as near a priority as locating the Confederacy's Supreme Commander, General Grievous\u2014not only to deny her expertise to the Separatists, but primarily to have an experienced cloner unassociated with Tipoca under Republic control\u2014Palpatine insisted that Zey put his most qualified squad on the assignment, from which Zey selected Delta Squad for the job. Ko Sai had gone missing during the Battle of Kamino, and was suspected to have defected to the Confederacy by Kamino's Prime Minister, Lama Su. Despite the length of time between her disappearance and Delta Squad's tasking of her retrieval, Kaminoan intelligence was able to track Ko Sai's movements to the planet Vaynai. Zey insisted that Delta Squad not inform Kal Skirata of their assignment, knowing of the Mandalorian's extreme hate for Kaminoans.

Chura had been moving cloning materials from Arkania to Dorumaa, but the Twi'lek had already relayed this information to Skirata and Vau. In order to keep Skirata and his quest a secret, Jusik influenced Chura to recall Mandalorians wearing green armor instead of Skirata and Vau's more recognizable golden and black sets when asked, and upon learning that Chura had delivered the consignment to a location near Dorumaa's Tropix Island Resort, Jusik erased the pilot's memory of both Delta and Skirata's band, along with deleting the records on his datapad. In spite of this, Boss and his brothers acquired SCUBA trooper armor and traveled to the resort world of Dorumaa. There, they acted as part of a utilities maintenance crew in order to gather surveillance which led them to a collapsed area underneath Tropix's neighboring ActionWorld island. Upon investigating, the squad found the skeletal remains of a human who had been chained beneath the water, and the collapsed entrance to the facility that had previously belonged to Ko Sai. Skirata and his crew had arrived first, capturing the Kaminoan scientist, destroying the laboratory, and taking her back to Skirata's home on Mandalore. The squad was tasked with the slow excavation of the area; at one point they inserted a small strip-cam through an available opening, finding the armored remains of the Mandalorian bodyguards Ko Sai had hired. Though Delta found no further evidence over the next few weeks of excavation, they remained unyieldingly loyal in covering for General Jusik's absence while the Jedi Knight secretly sneaked away to aid Skirata. Five hundred and forty-eight days into the Clone Wars, Boss and the other Deltas were called back to Special Operations Brigade on Coruscant, where they were met by Kal Skirata. There, Skirata gave Sev a package containing Ko Sai's severed head; the rogue Kaminoan had taken her own life while being held on Mandalore, and was cut into pieces post-mortem.

However, as time passed, the Republic began to assign more and more Grand Army forces to Haurgab, and Delta Squad, much to their displeasure, soon joined them. During a visit from General Etain Tur-Mukan\u2014who had replaced Bardan Jusik as commander of Delta Squad's Commando Group, Zero Five Commando, following his resignation as a Jedi General and his departure from the Jedi Order\u2014the four members of Delta Squad joined a number of other clone troops in the mess hall of the Republic's base on the outskirts of the Haurgab city of Hadde. While Delta was sitting at a table with their food\u2014trading jokes and theories on assorted topics\u2014the base was struck by a missile from within the city limits; though numerous troopers were killed and wounded in the attack both from the blast and the resultant shrapnel, Delta Squad had been spared the worst injuries thanks to their hardy Katarn armor. The shock of being attacked in a place that had always been perceived as safe and the sight of so many dead and injured clones drove the normally lighthearted Scorch into a rage, and together with Omega Squad, General Tur-Mukan, and elements of the 85th and 14th Infantry Brigades, Boss led Delta Squad in a retaliatory strike against the rebel forces. When they arrived at the house where the missile had originated, Scorch insisted on being part of the assault team for the raid; recognizing the catharsis that confronting the responsible party would bring, Boss obliged his brother, and he and the rest of Delta stood by as security to deal with any potential attack from another source. During the shootout, four rebels were captured, while another three were killed. Death would prove not to be enough for Scorch, however: the infuriated commando dragged the rebels' lifeless bodies out into the street where he riddled them with blasterfire before finally spitting on each of the charred corpses.

There, Vader reformed the Republic's former special forces soldiers as the Imperial Commando Special Unit, an elite unit within the Imperial 501st Legion that would be tasked with hunting down Jedi who managed to escape Order 66, along with clone deserters, Jedi sympathizers, and other Imperial dissidents. Their serial numbers' \"RC\" prefix was replaced with an \"IC\" to denote their new position as Imperial Commandos, and the squad was also given a different and more numerical-based name, similar to the former Omega Squad being renamed \"Squad 40.\" Although initially under the command of the Emperor's Hand, Sa Cuis, the Imperial Commando Special Unit was taken over by Imperial Commander Roly Melusar\u2014a native of the planet Dromund Kaas and a man with a firm hatred of all Force users\u2014following Cuis' death.

Though a natural leader, Boss was relatively taciturn, and often when he did speak, it was to issue an order to his squad. Boss earned the respect and loyalty of his Delta Squad comrades, and did his best to repay their faith in him with strong, effective leadership.
