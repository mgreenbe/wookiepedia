The Galactic Republic had a presence on Denova due to the fact the planet contained baradium, an ore. Thus, the Galactic Republic hired a mercenary army known as the Warstalkers to protect the mines from the Sith Empire. However, the Warstalkers eventually went rogue and aligned themselves with the Imperial Army. This betrayal was eventually solved by an elite ops team, and the planet, along with the mines, returned to Republic ownership. Denova and the rest of its system was then given military security to ensure this wouldn't happen again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, the planet and its system would eventually leave the Republic for the Eternal Alliance when the planets personnel did the same."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
