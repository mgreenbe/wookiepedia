An independent vagrant traveler about whom little was known, he was notably present in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina in Mos Eisley, Tatooine, on that fateful day that Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi first met Han Solo and Chewbacca. Sitting in a darkened booth with the Ithorian Momaw Nadon, Duaba witnessed Skywalker and Kenobi enter into an altercation with Dr. Cornelius Evazan and his companion Ponda Baba. Over thirty years later, Duaba was also present at Maz's castle on Takodana when Han Solo brought Finn, Rey, and BB-8 to meet Maz Kanata. Due to a hyperspace-rip side-effect, the Stennes Shifter, along with many other patrons, witnessed the destruction of the remote Hosnian system directly from Takodana. Shortly thereafter, Maz's castle was leveled by the First Order, which killed many of its inhabitants. Duaba, however, managed to slip through the chaos unharmed and seek shelter elsewhere."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trinto Duaba first appeared in the cantina scene of the Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.
