In the year 0 BBY, Toos was posted in Station Control West and was on shift under the command of Station commander Pamel Poul when the YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon was brought aboard by tractor beam. The freighter was forced to land in Docking Bay 327, which was under the jurisdiction of Toos's station, resulting in all traffic scheduled for that bay being diverted to Docking Bays 328 and 329. Toos sat at a monitoring station control console next to Sublieutenant Slallen, and the pair argued about the quality of the YT-1300 until Poul approached them to discover why Docking Bay 327 was causing a seven-minute delay."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Slallen explained that she and Toos could not clear the dock, as a scanning crew under the command of Captain Edmos Khurgee was still searching the Millennium Falcon. Poul's shift replacement, Commander Sheard, then arrived, and Poul told Toos and Slallen to report to him when Khurgee was finished. Sheard approached and ordered Toos to bring up the Falcon on the main screen.

Toos looked to Slallen and on her signal warned Solo that they were sending in a squad; however, Solo quickly claimed there was a reactor leak and that, therefore, no one should be sent. Suspicious, Sheard asked to know who was the officer on duty in the detention block, and Poul answered that it should be Lieutenant Shann Childsen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Toos knew that the voice speaking to him was not that of Childsen and asked for Solo's operating number. Panicking, Solo ended the conversation by blasting the comm, wryly dismissing their \"boring conversation.\" Poul ordered Toos to perform a systems check, and, when he and Slallen reported that there was no reactor leak, Poul ordered the security squad sent in and that Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin be contacted about the situation. Tarkin had the battle station put on full alert, but the crew of the Falcon managed to escape the Death Star with Organa.
