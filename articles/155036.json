However, the arrival of Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Anakin Skywalker turned the tide and Rish Loo was chased away but not before gravely wounding Lyonie during a skirmish."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jar Jar Binks was seen to resemble Lyonie a lot and since Lyonie never got a chance to call off the attack, Jar Jar was to pose as Boss Lyonie and call off the attack. The plan worked but then General Grievous, who still thought the Gungans were his allies because of Rish Loo, sent the tactical droid and a few battle droids to inquire about the canceled attack. The tactical droid then led Jar Jar and a Gungan warrior, Roos Tarpals to Grievous. Apparently, Grievous saw through the trick and tried to kill Binks but got himself captured after he and Tarpals had a brief duel, ending in Tarpals being stabbed with a spear, but with him likewise piercing Grievous's armor with his own spear, allowing him to be subdued with a barrage of Boomas. At the same time, Skywalker was captured by Dooku and a few Magnaguards while chasing Rish Loo. The tactical droid was present when an exchange of both hostages took place. She threw Skywalker's lightsaber back at him and left the planet with Grievous."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
