The protocol droid C-3PO considered the process terribly dangerous and sinful, claiming only dregs and criminals would perform it on unwitting droids, but in 35 ABY, he agreed to undergo the process in order to learn what had been written upon a Sith dagger. The bypass was performed by the droidsmith Babu Frik on the planet Kijimi, who plugged a large number of wires into the back of C-3PO's head as part of the procedure. It resulted in C-3PO successfully accessing the forbidden translation, but also caused the protocol droid to undergo a full memory wipe. C-3PO's memories were later restored from a backup."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A complete redacted memory bypass was first shown in the 2019 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
