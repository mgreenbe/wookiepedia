It was where the shadowport's government gathered to discuss important plans and developments. It had better life support than any other region of the comet, which meant better air and more stable gravity. Tight security only allowed visitors with proper passes or escort in or out. Council Chamber and Zietta's Palace were also located in that area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
