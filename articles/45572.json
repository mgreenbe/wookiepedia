It was during this assignment that she would first encounter the clone commandos of Omega Squad, with whom she would later become increasingly involved."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After finishing her mission on Qiilura, Etain completed her Jedi Trials under Arligan Zey and became a full Jedi Knight. She served in multiple command positions throughout the Clone Wars, and completed assignments with both Omega Squad, Delta Squad and other clone units on Coruscant, Kashyyyk and elsewhere. During one of these missions she would break the Jedi Code's rule of attachment by falling in love with Darman, RC-1136, a clone commando in Omega Squad, and becoming pregnant with his child, Venku Skirata. The two would later marry in the traditional Mandalorian way shortly before her death in 19 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Etain was killed shortly after the issue of Order 66 in the aftermath of Operation: Knightfall at a security checkpoint at Shinarcan Bridge, Coruscant near the Jedi Temple.

On the way to the rendezvous, Etain had to pass through a security checkpoint on Shinarcan Bridge when several Padawans were discovered in the crowd. A melee ensued as the Padawans tried to escape, and Etain instinctively jumped between a clone trooper and a panicking Jedi Padawan, receiving the downward arc of the blow meant for the clone, severing her spine and killing her nearly instantaneously, only meters from her loved ones."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early years"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taken from her parents at a young age after being discovered to be Force-sensitive, Etain Tur-Mukan was trained in the ways of the Force at the Coruscant Jedi Temple.

They worked for several weeks in deep cover, gathering information on a number of Separatist facilities around the planet's capital, Imbraani, including Dr. Ovolot Qail Uthan's biological research facility and the Separatist communication facility near Teklet. Fulier, although greatly skilled, was known for his sympathetic and just nature, oftentimes drawing unwanted attention to the pair while undercover. Upon witnessing how the Neimoidians and the Mandalorian mercenary Ghez Hokan exploited and oppressed the local population, Fulier could not bring himself to resist intervening. After defending a few of the locals against one of Hokan's thugs, the same locals would later reveal his whereabouts to Ghez Hokan for little more than the price of a bottle of Urrqal, forcing Tur-Mukan to escape on her own with the building schematics they had recovered.

Right after she had narrowly escaped a drunk Weequay thug, she met with a Gurlanin, a shapeshifter species, by the name of Jinart, whom at that time was under the guise of an old woman.

When she first felt him in the Force, she was confused to sense a child rather than a man. Upon seeing Darman's Mandalorian-style helmet, she mistook him for Hokan and so attempted to kill him. However, Darman overpowered her easily and identified himself as a commando in her service. From Darman, Tur-Mukan first learned of the Grand Army of the Republic, as well as the fact that Jedi had been made commanders and generals in charge of leading the army. Given her self-critical nature, feeling she had been a disappointment to the Jedi, Tur-Mukan refused to take up on that role, going so far as to order Darman to disobey her if she gave an order that made no logical sense.

Skirata was adamant that the child would be raised Mandalorian, and knew it would not be safe for the child of a clone and a Jedi to become known to the Republic. So Skirata arranged to have Tur-Mukan sent to Qiilura until she came to term. After the boy's birth, in the event that Darman (for whatever reason) was unable to raise the boy, Skirata would raise the child. Tur-Mukan agreed to all Skirata's terms.

The droid instructed Tur-Mukan to cease her meditation, allowing the baby to develop naturally, and to reduce her stress levels. Etain was forced to leave the field of battle with Ordo, who headed to Dorumaa to meet up with Skirata, where he had captured Ko Sai. After they met up, they headed for Skirata's recently obtained bastion Kyrimorut on Mandalore. While there, she learned what she could of genetics and used her pregnancy to barter with Ko Sai, offering blood and the baby's umbilical cord, in exchange for the anti-aging formula for the clones.
