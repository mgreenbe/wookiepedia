The pilot used the Podracer to compete in a qualifying race for the Mon Gazza Maze event. The Podracer's cockpit was painted bright orange with an intricate design painted onto the side of it. At least two jets were situated underneath the cockpit, and a large windshield existed to protect the pilot from any potential debris that could come into contact with the pilot's face. The pilot did not win the qualifier match with the Podracer, however, losing to the Twi'lek pilot Kidd Kareen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Podracer was created by Henry Gilroy and appeared in the 2008 graphic novella The Clone Wars: Crash Course, and was illustrated by Matthew and Shawn Fillbach and colored by Ronda Pattison."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
