After the queen was informed that count Dooku was making his way to Zygerria, she trusted the guards to watch over Skywalker as she didn't want him to participate in the meeting. As the queen was leaving, this guard hit Skywalker with his weapon and made him turn around. R2-D2 then saw this and bumped into this guard as a diversion, drawing the other guard's attention as well and allowing Skywalker to jump down and evade them.\nThis guard then sent the other one down to look for the Jedi after which Skywalker jumped back up and grabbed this guard and threw him off the terrace into a fruit stand below."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
