Commonly used for hunting or self-defense, the SKZ was a popular model of sporting blaster for centuries. It was not as powerful as military-grade blaster rifles, but it was powerful enough to bring down medium-sized quarries up to all but the largest game. They had a modular design to allow for attachments, and could be easily broken down into three pieces for easy transport and storage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
