Once a member of the Galactic Senate, Clovis worked closely with Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala early in her career. The two were romantically linked, until she insisted they return their relationship to a strictly professional level. With regret, Clovis respected her wishes. He continued to serve his people in the Senate, and became an influential representative of the InterGalactic Banking Clan. When the Clone Wars erupted, Clovis secretly betrayed the Galactic Republic to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early career"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clovis' father was an advisor to a Muun banker. After his parents died in a shuttle accident, Clovis was adopted by the Muun, who treated him as his own child. He eventually entered galactic politics and became the Senator of Scipio. During his time in the Galactic Republic Senate, he grew close to Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo, who had entered the Senate the same year as he had. About four years before the start of the Clone Wars, Clovis and Amidala accompanied Jedi Master Depa Billaba and Senator Caelor Gaans on a mission to Gaans' homeworld of Bromlarch. Clovis and Amidala would develop the Mid Rim Cooperation Motion in the aftermath of their mission, beginning new economic collaboration between Mid Rim systems while providing aid for Bromlarch and authorizing defense spending to fight off pirates that were attacking Republic transports. After the bill passed, Clovis celebrated with Amidala, even kissing her. Amidala was horrified, making it clear she was not interested in Clovis that way. Eventually, Amidala chose to end her relationship with him."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Senator Clovis during the Clone Wars secretly conspired with Trade Federation Senator Lott Dod and Geonosian Archduke Poggle the Lesser to rebuild a droid foundry on Geonosis in exchange for the profits it would yield.

They both went to Cato Neimoidia aboard her star skiff accompanied by Captain Gregar Typho, R2-D2, and Anakin Skywalker disguised as her pilot. After they landed, Clovis and Amidala were greeted by Dod. Clovis showed Dod and Poggle a disk that digitally carried the coordinates to the new droid foundry. He told them that it was the largest ever built and that it would bring great profits to them; but Poggle and Dod demanded a greater share of the profits for the risks they took. He refused to comply and went to Senator Amidala. He gave her a relishing tour, sharing her of some private investments."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clovis was then embraced by Amidala who told him that she was glad to be there with him, and fainted. He realized that she had been poisoned and he confronted Dod about this, but Dod assured him that she was a Republic spy. Clovis refused to believe it, until he saw that Amidala had stolen his disk. He later confronted her, but she told him that she did it for the Republic. Skywalker came in to protect her. Clovis told him that Dod poisoned her. At first, Skywalker wanted to start negotiating with Dod, but Clovis said that Dod would kill him if he found out about the disk. Clovis ultimately decided to get Amidala to her ship. However, Dod refused to let them leave. Clovis began threatening and tempting to kill Lott Dod unless the immoral Neimoidian gave him the antidote. After Dod had given him the antidote, Clovis and Skywalker got Amidala to the ship.

Later that night, after Clovis tried to force a kiss on Amidala, Skywalker burst in and the two got into a violent fight, during which Clovis got injured badly. While a medical droid was tending to him, the droid revealed a message from Count Dooku, who stated that if the corruption was exposed, Clovis would be head of the Banking Clan.."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clovis and Nix Card then reported to Palpatine that they had exposed the corruption. The Core Five were removed from power, and Clovis was selected to head the Banking Clan by the Confederacy. The Republic voted for the same effect. In return for his favor, Dooku forced Clovis to raise interest rates on Republic loans, which caused outrage in the Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Clovis assumed power, Dooku arrived and a Separatist invasion of Scipio ensued, which was framed as a Clovis-endorsed takeover. Following this, Anakin Skywalker led an immediate Republic retaliation to retake Scipio. During the battle, a downed vulture droid crashed into Clovis' office containing Skywalker, Amidala, and Clovis. Sliding down the rooftop, Skywalker was able to catch both Clovis and Amidala before falling off the edge.

Clovis unknowingly helped Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, gain control after the banks after Scipio became a battlefield and the Republic forcefully took control of the banks. He later felt remorse for his actions and during the battle, chose to give up his life to save Amidala's."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite Clovis' various deceptions, he cared deeply for Amidala. He was persistent in his attempts to court her, which greatly angered her secret husband Anakin Skywalker.
