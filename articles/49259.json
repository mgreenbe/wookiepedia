They consisted of transparent bacta circulation and filtration tubing and a retaining collar lined by status sensors with wireless telemetry. When the Resistance had to evacuate their base on the planet D'Qar in the year 34 ABY, the injured First Order deserter Finn was put into an expired flexpoly bacta suit while in a medical coma and transferred to a storage room-turned temporary medical suite onboard the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus. He remained unconscious in the suit until after the Resistance fleet had successfully exited hyperspace after jumping to lightspeed, but then awoke and left his bed in search of the scavenger Rey. As he moved through the corridors of the Raddus the expired bacta suit began leaking as it had become fragile. Eventually, the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron spotted the confused and mostly naked Finn and found him a change of clothes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A flexpoly bacta suit first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, which was released on December 15, 2017.
