With alarms blaring and a laser system targeting the Jedi, Bane sneaked away from the distracted Kenobi and Windu, while the two were occupied. Kenobi pursued the bounty hunter, but the Duros escaped through a concealed hatch. Breaking out of his binders, Bane fled Black Stall Station in an escape pod. Meanwhile, Kenobi managed to retrieve the holocron and both Jedi Masters managed to make their way back to the shuttle and depart just before the station exploded as a result of a self-destruct."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
