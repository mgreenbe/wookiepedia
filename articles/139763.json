While at the academy, Tamlen was assigned to work in the academy's library where he would update the records with new discoveries, such as the lore of Ajunta Pall. While studying Pall, Tamlen came across a legend regarding the Sith Lord's blade. Interested, Tamlen told another student about his discoveries without knowing he was actually speaking with the amnesic Dark Lord of the Sith Revan. Revan had been captured by the Jedi Order and reprogrammed to serve as their weapon against the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Tamlen's encounter with Revan, the former Dark Lord sought out the legendary blade in the tomb of Lord Pall and recovered it. Shortly thereafter, Revan returned to the academy and assassinated the Academy's Headmaster Uthar Wynn with the assistance of the redeemed Sith Yuthura Ban. Together Revan and Ban purged the academy of all Sith students who would not convert to the Jedi teachings. Tamlen, refusing to abandon the Empire, was slain along with the rest of the academy's occupants."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tamlen was voiced by Ethan Phillips in the video game, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
