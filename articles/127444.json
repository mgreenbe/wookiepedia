They began selling recordings of Tarasin music to tourists, and business soon took off, because the recordings gained popularity among members of aquatic species. However, in c. 31 BBY, the Cularin system's senator, Lavina Wren announced that she was getting engaged, and the S&N Music distribution center was subsequently graffitied with a statement that was hostile to the wedding.
