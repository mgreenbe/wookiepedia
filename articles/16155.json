Bendu encountered Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus in 2 BBY. He developed a friendly relationship with Kanan and his Padawan Ezra Bridger and helped the two Jedi repair their relationship and deal with their fears and anxieties. Despite his wisdom and powers, Bendu refused to take sides in any conflict, and was angered when Kanan called him a coward for not intervening during the Battle of Atollon, which caused him to unleash a storm against both the rebel and Imperial forces on Atollon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An ancient being, Bendu claimed to represent the center of the Force, standing between the light and the dark side.

Kanan had retreated into meditation after losing his sight during a Mission to Malachor. Bendu called out to Kanan and eventually led him into a series of mesas in the wilderness. When Kanan finally arrived, Bendu told the Jedi Knight that his imbalance had awoken him from his slumber. After introducing himself, he allowed Kanan to identify himself as a Jedi Knight. Bendu listened as Kanan told him about his fear that his apprentice Ezra Bridger was falling to the dark side. When Kanan showed him the Sith holocron that Ezra had obtained on Malachor, Bendu explained that an object could not make someone good or evil. However, he stressed that only a person could choose to change themselves. Bendu then took an interest in Kanan's sensor beacon, which the Jedi had used to ward off several krykna, arachnid predators that were indigenous to Atollon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bendu then destroyed the sensor marker. When Kanan protested, he told the Jedi that he would never regain his sight but that he could teach Kanan to see through his other senses. When Kanan agreed to take his lesson, Bendu instructed the Jedi to empty his mind, turn around and walk forward. Kanan was quickly surrounded by two krykna which did not attack him. Bendu then explained that Kanan's bad experience with creatures stemmed from not seeing them for what they actually were. Kanan began to make peace with the krykna but was startled when he sensed that Ezra was in danger. After igniting his lightsaber, Kanan realized that the krykna had been feeding off his fear and emotions. When Kanan deduced that he had isolated himself from everyone and the Force, Bendu commented that he had finally regained his Force connection. Before leaving to rescue Ezra, Kanan left the Sith holocron with Bendu.

The two Jedi were surrounded by several krykna but Bendu awoke and scared them away. When Bendu asked the two Jedi whether they had come for a chat, Ezra related to the Force-wielder their predicament with Maul. Ezra and Kanan explained that Maul desired both the Sith holocron and Kanan's own Jedi holocron. While Bendu was unfamiliar with Maul, he remarked that the convergence of the Sith and Jedi holocrons would be dangerous."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bendu corrected Ezra's view that the holocrons were merely libraries and pointed out that they could grant clarity of vision but also produce chaos. When Ezra reiterated that he needed the Sith holocron in order to save his friends, Bendu optioned that the object was a source of imbalance between him and his master Kanan. However, he told the boy that he needed to enter a cave inhabited by krykna in order to retrieve the Sith holocron. Before entering the cave, Kanan instructed his apprentice to leave his lightsaber behind and to use a comlink instead. When asked why, Kanan explained that his apprentice needed to learn how to resolve problems without a lightsaber. Kanan then went in after him when Ezra's comlink was damaged by krykna, asking Bendu to keep an eye on their lightsabers. Remaining outside, Bendu remarked to himself and a curious dokma that perhaps the two would mend their bond or perhaps they would be eaten instead, but brushed off the latter option as being the way of things."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two Jedi successfully managed to retrieve the Sith holocron after a trial which involved Ezra learning to overcome his fear of the krykna and forgiving himself for the events on Malachor, mending the frayed bond between himself and his master; outside the cave, Bendu sensed this and smiled. After Ezra and Kanan returned from the cave, Bendu expressed satisfaction that the imbalance between master and apprentice had been resolved. However, he warned the two Jedi that their true test had just begun. Since Maul was unable to open the Jedi holocron, Bendu told the pair that the task would have to fall on one of them. When Ezra suggests they could wield the power of both holocrons, Bendu warned him that it came with a price.

When Bendu asked Ezra what he wanted, he advised Ezra and Kanan not to turn around. Despite his warnings, the two Jedi turned around and saw Maul watching them from atop a dune. When Kanan turned back around Bendu was gone. Maul then persuaded Ezra to come with him to Dathomir in return for keeping the location of Chopper Base a secret.

Kanan went to the wilderness to seek out Bendu for help. However, Bendu refused to help Kanan in order to keep his neutrality and blamed him for bringing the war to Atollon. Kanan then called Bendu a coward, which led to Bendu rising into a ball of smoke and exclaiming that perhaps it was the will of the Force to destroy the Jedi \"and all your kind,\" which he vowed to carry out.

He then cried \"I bring death!\" and unleashed powerful lightning strikes onto the ground, destroying two AT-AT walkers and several grounded rebel starfighters. Desiring his world to be left in peace, Bendu ordered both Rebels and Imperials alike to leave Atollon, killing several death troopers with his lightning strikes as emphasis. Kanan and his fellow Rebels then attempted to flee on the Ghost; noticing the fleeing rebel ships, Bendu called out to Kanan by name and struck the Ghost with lightning, though not hard enough to destroy it. One A-wing was destroyed by him but the others escaped, so Bendu increased his onslaught on the Imperials, demanding again that they leave.

When Tano explained that she had to know the truth, Bendu retorted that everything would change as a result of their encounter, including her.
