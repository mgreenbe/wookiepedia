They operated with limited oversight, and received little in the way of support in terms of equipment and reinforcements. While mission groups were given assignments, Special Ops Team got requests; most of the time, Special Ops Teams went looking for their own missions. They used Alliance supply caches to get their operations running, or established their own supply networks through trading and using the profits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
