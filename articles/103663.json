After being assigned a mission to gather the Resistance's allies, Black Squadron traveled to Pastoria in the hopes that their king, Siroc, would join the Resistance in their struggle against the First Order. Whilst on Pastoria, Black Squadron were tricked into helping Siroc kill the closest rival to his throne so that when the First Order arrived on the planet, they could negotiate with him rather than his rival, who would try to resist and end up getting the Pastorians killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
