From humble origins, Darklighter went on to become a decorated pilot in Rogue Squadron, then Rogue Leader, then commanding admiral of a battle fleet. Born to moisture farmers, Darklighter grew up in the shadow of his older cousin, Biggs Darklighter\u2014hero of the Rebellion. When he turned sixteen, Darklighter felt the pull of the stars, and determined to make his own way in the galaxy, joining the New Republic. With his parents' blessing, Darklighter entered the New Republic military and the piloting talents he had honed in his skyhopper at home landed him in the legendary Rogue Squadron, the successor to Biggs's unit. Despite his youth, Darklighter distinguished himself early, serving in the campaign to take Coruscant and resigning his commission to pursue Ysanne Isard, then rejoining with the rest of the Rogues and helping bring down Warlord Zsinj. During that time, Darklighter met and fell in love with a Bothan, Asyr Sei'lar. By the end of their service in the Thrawn campaign, Darklighter and Sei'lar were ready to marry and adopt children. This plan was cut tragically short when Sei'lar was reported dead during Rogue Squadron's campaign to oust the warlord Delak Krennel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darklighter bounced back, however, marrying Sera Faleur and raising a family of five children. When iconic Rogue Leaders Wedge Antilles and Tycho Celchu retired in the wake of the peace treaty with the Imperial Remnant, they handed command of the New Republic's most elite squadron to Darklighter. Darklighter proudly carried on the Rogue tradition during the Yuuzhan Vong War, fighting the invaders at every turn and recruiting future Rogue Leader Jaina Solo into the squadron. After the war, Darklighter transferred to Fleet Command, just as Antilles had some twenty years before. He quickly rose to the rank of commodore, during which time he served in the Swarm War, and then Rear Admiral. When the Second Galactic Civil War broke out, Darklighter continued to serve the Galactic Alliance despite having friends on both sides, but increasingly grew to resent Jacen Solo's methods of operating the Galactic Alliance. During the Battle of Balmorra, Darklighter gained command of the Galactic Alliance Fourth Fleet when his superior was killed in combat and was quickly able to force an enemy withdrawal. Darklighter continued serving the Galactic Alliance until the conclusion of the war, after which he became the commanding officer of the Galactic Alliance Marines."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Tatooine farmboy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gavin Darklighter was born in 10 BBY on Tatooine to Jula and Silya Darklighter. Moisture farmers in the Anchorhead area, they led a life of hard work in difficult circumstances. Darklighter had two younger sisters, Rasca and Anya. His father, Jula, was the brother of Huff Darklighter, a wealthy local land baron; Huff did not share his fortune with Jula, preferring to instead subtly rub in his excellent circumstances during family gatherings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His cousin Biggs Darklighter, Huff's son, was ten years older. Biggs and Gavin were not close, but Biggs would sometimes spend time with his younger cousin. On occasion, Biggs would take Gavin along when Biggs visited Luke Skywalker, during which trips Darklighter met Owen and Beru Lars. When Gavin was ten years old, Biggs was killed in combat, a Rebel pilot at Yavin 4. The entire family was saddened by his death, but Darklighter had simply not known him well enough for his loss to truly register. Following Biggs's death, Huff felt the desire for more children and divorced his current wife, who wished to bear no more. He then married Darklighter's aunt on his mother's side, Lanal, further uniting the family and giving Darklighter many more younger cousins."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, Darklighter's father purchased the Lars family farm from Throgg, whom Huff Darklighter had been planning to ruin financially due to the imposition of an alien landowner tax, and allowed Throgg to stay on as a tenant rather than let Huff ruin him and gain the farm. At some point, the Darklighters themselves moved onto the farm, and Darklighter spent several of his formative years where Luke Skywalker had grown up."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darklighter lived a simple life on the family farm. He would visit Anchorhead on a monthly basis, and even made it to Mos Eisley on one occasion. Family celebrations, generally held at Huff's estate, were a highlight, though Darklighter resented being continually seated at the children's table. Darklighter was educated via classes taken over the HoloNet, as there was no local school in Anchorhead. That gave Darklighter a good deal of free time and, like many other Anchorhead youths, he spent much time flying his T-16 skyhopper through the desert, making runs through Beggar's Canyon, and otherwise honing his piloting abilities. By his mid-teens, Darklighter suffered a growth spurt, becoming a large and lanky youth who looked older than he was. As a teen, Darklighter developed a crush on Rebel leader Princess Leia Organa. He pursued local girls as well, though to no lasting relationships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 6 ABY, on his sixteenth birthday, Darklighter left the party as it concluded and walked up to the edge of the pit into which the farm was sunk. He looked out across the sand, wondering if Skywalker had done so, and was approached by his father, who told him that he had the \"Darklighter look\" on his face. Jula explained that all Darklighter men reached a point in their lives at which they looked at the outer world, at the possibilities beyond. Gavin's grandfather looked only at the end of his life, regretting missed opportunities. Huff, said Jula, had looked out long ago and chosen to ignore it, to build up his own world on Tatooine. Biggs had looked at the same age as Gavin and had left for the stars. Gavin told his father that he could feel his destiny out beyond Tatooine. Jula refused to stand in his son's way, and let him go and join the New Republic, with his blessing and the knowledge that he would always be welcome back on Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rogue"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darklighter joined the New Republic Starfighter Corps, serving as Biggs had. He immediately heard that Rogue Squadron, the New Republic's most elite starfighter unit, descended from Biggs's Red Squadron, was to be reconstituted and approached its commander, Wedge Antilles, and asked to be included in it. Antilles had been a friend of Biggs, and felt an obligation to Darklighter. Additionally, Antilles believed in him and his determination and dedication to prove himself. Darklighter's test scores were as good as any other Rogue Squadron candidate's, but his selection was opposed by Antilles's superior, General Horton Salm, who felt that Darklighter was simply too young for such an elite squadron. Salm instead preferred the inclusion of Deegan. In a discussion before Admiral Gial Ackbar, Antilles successfully argued that Deegan's inclusion would over-represent Corellians within the squadron and that Darklighter would be a valuable addition. Darklighter was approved, provided he performed well in the Redemption scenario. The training and selection process was not formally over, however, and when Darklighter's time came to complete the notoriously difficult simulation, he succeeded in it and shot down Bror Jace, widely regarded as one of the two best pilot-candidates. He had performed excellently, gaining the second-highest score among the candidates, behind only Corran Horn, the second of the two top prospects. Within only weeks of joining the military and without any formal training, Darklighter was accepted to Rogue Squadron. He knew that his cousin's reputation had been key to his acceptance, however, and was determined to work his very hardest and earn the position himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darklighter was assigned his own X-wing, the callsign Rogue Five, and an astromech which he named Jawaswag, and was given the wingmate Riv Shiel, a Shistavanen; Antilles thought the two would make an effective pair. Jawaswag quickly got in the habit of giving Darklighter weather updates for Coruscant and Tatooine as a greeting, which persisted even after memory wipes, causing Darklighter to become very fond of the droid. Darklighter was quick to make friends in the squadron, but frequently felt nervous and somewhat overwhelmed by being thrust from the relative isolation of Anchorhead into the cosmopolitan and mature world of the New Republic forces; his youth only compounded the problem. Darklighter took to the squadron, however, and was the one to create its twelve-starfighter crest, which quickly caught on as the symbol of Rogue Squadron despite having no official endorsement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though selection was complete, training was not yet over, and Darklighter continued to hone his skills at Folor Base. Darklighter's astrogation skills were weak, but he accepted tutoring from Lujayne Forge and quickly brought them up to par, demonstrating a natural aptitude. When Horn's targeting data was beamed back to the rest of the squadron without his knowledge during one run, giving all the subsequent pilots knowledge of target locations before they made their runs and leaving Horn with the lowest score of the group, Darklighter was among those who objected, feeling Antilles had been cruel and unfair in his treatment of Horn. After discussing the situation with Antilles, Horn himself told Darklighter and the rest that it had taught him a valuable lesson about flying without ego; any plans Darklighter had to write a statement to Salm protesting Antilles's methods were halted."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First combat"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Only one month after the squadron roster was finalized, Rogue Squadron was moved to active duty. They were to be moved to Talasea, but for security reasons the squadron members were told that they were merely on an extended field training assignment and were not given their location. The trip to Talasea was intended to be a practice run, but on their way through the Chorax system, the Interdictor cruiser Black Asp pulled the squadron out of hyperspace. Darklighter and the rest of the squadron safely escaped, with Darklighter scoring his first kill against the Imperial TIEs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rogues' next mission was to Hensara, where they were to rescue the downed frigate Battle of Yavin. When the Strike-class cruiser Havoc returned to the system during the operation, Darklighter flew against the TIEs it deployed, picking up one pursuer, which Horn destroyed. Darklighter picked up no kills in the engagement, however, unlike the rest of his comrades."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the subsequent celebration back on Talasea, Jace began to pick on Darklighter for his lack of kills. His squadron-mates jokingly awarded Darklighter the award of \"worst pilot in the squadron\" and sent Nawara Ven to speak to the senior officers\u2014Antilles, executive officer Tycho Celchu, and naval captain Afyon\u2014and request a fitting punishment. Darklighter was embarrassed and resentful, and Antilles perceived that, knowing that Darklighter's skills were far from the worst in the squadron. Celchu suggested that Darklighter be apprenticed to the best pilot in the squadron, a solution with which Antilles concurred, thinking that Horn, who had the most kills, would not be particularly rough on the young man. However, Jace insisted that he was the best pilot in the squadron, citing his higher percentage of kills relative to the number of fighters he had engaged. Horn stepped in with an offer: he would average his kills with Darklighter's, giving all three men five kills, and continue the contest with the averages in place, requiring either Horn to perform twice as well as Jace or Darklighter to start performing as well as the other two. Jace accepted, and Horn sprang the trick of the agreement\u2014by averaging the kills, Darklighter gained four from Horn, making Ven, not Darklighter, the worst pilot. Horn's display of confidence heartened Darklighter, and he would later tell his parents about the difference Horn's support had made, though he downplayed the nature of the incident."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few nights later, Horn and Rogue Ooryl Qrygg were awake when Imperial stormtroopers landed at Talasea, its location having been deduced by Imperial Intelligence agent Kirtan Loor. The two defeated some of the troops outside the main building and proceeded within. Darklighter and Shiel were in the nearest room, and Horn woke Darklighter and warned him that there were stormtroopers inside the base, rigging it to explode. Horn gave Darklighter a blaster and moved to engage the two stormtroopers who had just entered the hall. Unprepared for a firefight, Darklighter stepped out into the hall before Horn had cleared it, getting off only one shot before he took a blast directly to the naked abdomen and went down, passing out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rogues were evacuated and the stormtroopers defeated; Darklighter was placed in a bacta tank aboard the medical frigate Reprieve. He was removed at the same time as Horn, who had been shot later in the battle, in time for both to learn from Antilles that Forge had been killed in her bed by stormtroopers. Darklighter was devastated to learn that the friendly, bubbly Forge, with whom he had been close, was dead. It was the first time anyone he had truly known had died, as previous deaths, such as that of Biggs and the Lars family, had been the relatively abstract losses of people whom he was not accustomed to seeing regularly. When he expressed this emotion, Biggs was brought up, and Antilles shared stories of the man, giving Darklighter a better feel for his cousin as a person. The time Antilles spent with him comforted him greatly and helped him work through his grief."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The drive to Coruscant"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Republic tracked the stormtrooper platoon responsible for the attack to Vladet, and Rogue Squadron was given the honor of leading the retributive strike. After a memorial service for Forge, the Rogues and Salm's Defender Wing struck Vladet. Darklighter was among the X-wings flying cover for the Y-wings bombing the Imperial base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vladet was merely a hit-and-fade operation, however. Rogue Squadron's next mission was to take Borleias, a world which would provide a stepping-stone with which to take Coruscant, capital of the Empire. Known to the Rogues only as Blackmoon, Borleias was to be taken in an operation overseen by General Laryn Kre'fey. Darklighter and the other pilots spent two weeks in intense training and simulations for the mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the time came, Darklighter was among the Rogues, assigned to cover the assault shuttles descending to the planet's surface after the shields collapsed. Kre'fey had been far from meticulous in his planning, however, and Borleias suddenly began to demonstrate far greater defenses than Kre'fey's information had indicated. General Evir Derricote, the Imperial commander, had reinforced his base with extra starfighters and power generation capacity from the abandoned Alderaan Biotics facility on-planet, the existence of which Kre'fey had not even known. Peshk Vri'syk and Andoorni Hui were quickly killed, with several other Rogues having their fighters destroyed and being forced to go extravehicular. Shiel was wounded but continued flying, and Darklighter had to force him to seek medical care after the New Republic forces retreated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darklighter and the other survivors returned to Noquivzor, where they were based. Given data collected by Horn's astromech, Whistler, Horn and Antilles were able to devise a plan to take Borleias in a second assault, having discovered the existence of the Alderaan Biotics facility and a weak point in which the power conduit crossed a rift valley and was exposed. With the dearth of fighters and the difficulties of extraction if a pilot were to be shot down, it was to be a volunteer mission. Darklighter volunteered. As Shiel was grounded, Darklighter was paired with Rhysati Ynr for the mission. The pilots trained relentlessly for the run against the small conduit in the valley; with his Beggar's Canyon experience, Darklighter hit the conduit in simulation more frequently than any other pilot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The night before the mission, Darklighter recorded a message for his parents in the event he was killed\u2014something Biggs had never gotten the chance to do. The next morning, Darklighter departed with the rest for Borleias. Their insertion to the planet amid a meteor shower was clear, but a patrol of twelve TIE/LN starfighters was detected crossing their path. Gavin was among those who engaged the patrol while Antilles and Horn began the first canyon run. The two pilots missed, but Darklighter, Ynr, Jace, and Ven were too busy holding off the TIEs\u2014shortly to be reinforced by TIE Interceptors\u2014to make their runs. Antilles was successful as Horn, low on fuel, moved to exit. Darklighter became an ace in the dogfight, racking up his fifth kill, before he and the rest\u2014minus Horn, who did not have enough fuel to leave and had to go to ground on Borleias's moon\u2014headed back to base to refuel, but not before tangling with ten Interceptors while outbound to thin the ranks that would be searching for Horn. The squadron occupied its time on the return trip thinking up plans to rescue Horn, but were pleasantly surprised on their return to find that Horn had been rescued by Celchu and smuggler Mirax Terrik, who had gone to Borleias in Terrik's ship after becoming concerned about a possible security leak."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Commandos took Borleias, and the squadron moved its base there, spending a month simply patrolling Borleias space. When the freighter Vengeance Derra IV, a ship in the use of Warlord Zsinj, probed Borleias, it was eventually tracked to Mrisst, where Darklighter, now under the command of Lieutenant Pash Cracken in Two Flight, was among the pilots who destroyed the ship and forced another ship in league with it, Contruum's Pride, to stand down.\nAt that time, Rogue Squadron began to prepare for the capture of Coruscant. They were to be inserted covertly on the planet and to scout its defense network for weak points. Councilor Borsk Fey'lya appended to the operation one of his own, which would release Black Sun operatives from Kessel to disrupt Imperial operations on Coruscant. Rogue Squadron was assigned to release them, and Darklighter flew cover while several other Rogues landed on Kessel and negotiated with the warden, Moruth Doole, for the release of several hardened criminals as well as innocent political prisoners.

All the pilots were sent down in independent cells, none knowing if any others were along.

Upon first seeing the planet, he was taken aback by its level of development and activity, never having seen anything even close to Coruscant's urbanization.

He and Shiel spent much time alone, scouting the area around the Alien Protection Zone, a nonhuman ghetto better known as the Invisible Sector or Invisec. After one week, he and Shiel rendezvoused with the rest of the group\u2014Ven, Ynr, Qrygg, and Aril Nunb\u2014at the Azure Dianoga Cantina. Shortly after all arrived, a patrol of stormtroopers arrived to make a security sweep. They demanded Darklighter's identification, but it passed their check and, after a bribe from Ven, they departed. He was then approached by Asyr Sei'lar, a black-furred Bothan female. She asked Darklighter for a dance, but, nervous and uninterested, he refused. The Gotal at the next table, in league with Sei'lar, had used his ability to sense mental states, and informed Sei'lar that Darklighter had been nervous when she approached and relieved when she accepted his refusal. She, the Gotal, and many other members of the Alien Combine drew blasters on Darklighter, misinterpreting his emotions and accusing him of bigotry.

Dmaynel Kiph, the leader of the Combine, was unmoved and ordered Darklighter's death anyway. As his executioner took aim, however, Imperial forces raided the gathering. Darklighter tackled Sei'lar to save her from incoming fire, then grabbed a blaster to begin shooting back. He was nearly killed by return fire before Sei'lar returned the favor, tugging Darklighter down and blasting the stormtrooper. The two fled outside, where they met up with the rest of the group\u2014minus Nunb\u2014and, due to coincidence, Horn. They also met up with Inyri Forge, Lujayne's sister and the lover of Zekka Thyne, one of the Black Sun figures released onto Coruscant, who had been chasing Horn.

Darklighter became increasingly taken by Sei'lar, and finally worked up the courage to ask Horn about interspecies dating. Terrik and Wessiri intervened, telling Darklighter the story of Horn's brief relationship with a Selonian, Chertyl Ruluwoor. In the end, they reassured Darklighter that it was worth acting on his attraction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the time came to implement their plan to slip sliced memory cores into Coruscant's main computer control system, Darklighter helped Antilles deliver the sliced cores to the Imperials in charge of the computer system.

Darklighter took cover, firing back, until a hovertruck crashed into the Mekuun Hoverscout providing the majority of the firepower. The Rogues escaped and fled up a large building, but were pinned down by stormtroopers when Celchu suddenly appeared in a Z-95 Headhunter fighter, destroying the opposition.

Kre'fey, Farlander's superior, then withdrew to Kashyyyk and, under Admiral Ackbar's new battle plan, engaged in multiple small-scale combats to season the troops, such as at Ylesia.

Finally, in 29 ABY, the Galactic Alliance leadership decided that the time was right to retake Coruscant.

Along with the Chiss-led Vanguard Squadron and Solo's Twin Suns Squadron, the Rogues were assigned to eliminate tentacles fourteen through twenty. During their attack run, however, the tentacle pattern shifted, bringing up many new reinforcements and killing many of Darklighter's pilots, leading him to combine forces with the survivors of Twin Suns Squadron.

Piloted by Leia Organa Solo and Saba Sebatyne and accompanied by four Jedi StealthX pilots\u2014undetectable by Mon Mothma's sensors\u2014the Millennium Falcon was hailed by his subordinates and warned to turn back; the Utegetu Nebula was under complete blockade. Organa Solo demanded to speak with Darklighter, who by now was considered a firm friend of the family; she was convinced Darklighter could be counted on absolutely.

When the StealthXs began putting targeting locks on the XJ3 X-wings trailing the craft and Organa Solo used a shipboard repulsor to push them away, Darklighter finally took to the comm personally. Frustrated enough to resort to profanity, he demanded that Han Solo\u2014whom he thought was in command\u2014stand down. Upon learning that Solo was not aboard, he apologized to Organa Solo for his language but insisted she stand down. When she refused, he attempted to detain the Falcon via tractor beams, but was unsuccessful. Regretfully, he ordered her to halt or he would open fire.

He may have been sympathetic to her but could not take any action that would help her, as Bwua'tu was present, hiding his flagship, Admiral Ackbar, farther in the nebula.

He then led her outside to Sebatyne and took the pair up to see Bwua'tu. Darklighter had been consulting with the admiral, and assured him that the pair would keep their word if they gave it. He also suggested, if they refused to swear that they would not attempt to escape, that the Falcon's drive nacelles be holed to keep it from being used as an escape craft. After hearing the threat, the pair gave their word. Darklighter appealed to Organa Solo to bring the Jedi in StealthXs in to surrender before they ran out their supplies, but Organa Solo would not, and insisted the Force told her of a great danger aboard the ship. She could not tell precisely what was the matter, however, and Bwua'tu was inclined to dismiss her statements as fear-mongering. Darklighter insisted that Organa Solo would do no such thing, but the admiral accused Darklighter's judgment of being affected by his friendship with the prisoners, stated that Darklighter's statements only supported her fear-mongering, and threatened Darklighter's command.

Bwua'tu and the Jedi had made it safely off the Ackbar before the Killiks boarded and captured it, and Darklighter and the admiral spent much time in planning sessions, debriefing. Darklighter was able to chat with the Solos and Skywalker, who had escaped the Killiks, before Bwua'tu received a message that the Chiss Ascendancy had declared a state of war against the Killiks. Bwua'tu, now commanding from the Mothma, ordered Darklighter to launch fighters and begin an attack on the Killik nest ships, which badly outnumbered the Galactic Alliance force.

Colonel Solo, now co-chief-of-state, was present, personally supervising the battle from his Star Destroyer, the Anakin Solo. The odds suddenly turned against the Galactic Alliance when the Commenorians revealed that they had possession of stolen long-range turbolaser technology, battering the \"Fearless Fourth\" from out of its range to strike back. Ratobo repeatedly requested permission to withdraw from Solo, citing the untenable position of the fleet and the possibility that the Commenorians could have more stolen technology as well.

Solo began to wonder if Darklighter's ascent to command could be the key event he had sensed which would swing the tide of the war firmly in the Galactic Alliance's favor.

Darklighter took full advantage of the Jedi assault, cutting through the fleet and engaging the Huttese landing force.
