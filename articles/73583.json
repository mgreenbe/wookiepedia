Several parsecs in size, it extended at least into the Ryndellia system and was sometimes home to neebray mantas, who often migrated along the Balmorra Run."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the second year of the Clone Wars, Count Dooku, wishing to exploit the Jedi's care for their troops, assigned General Grievous to destroy the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center, which was at the time unprotected and treating over 60,000 clone troopers wounded in action. After receiving intel that Grievous had attacked medical transports near the Ryndellia system, Anakin Skywalker, using his knowledge of the Balmorra Run, led Shadow Squadron, with Jedi Master Plo Koon flying fighter escort, to Kaliida Shoals through the nebula in order to get to the medical center before the Confederate General, who had to maneuver his bulky flagship around it. The squadron encountered a swarm of giant neebray mantas inside the nebula, but there were no casualties, and the Republic forces managed to reach the medical station concurrently with Grievous."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
