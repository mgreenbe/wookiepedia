Despite his shady past, Fuller used the Croc of Gold to deal in legal goods, though he was not very successful until he met Owen Sareth, a Rebel operative who possessed an acumen for business that Fuller lacked. Fuller and Sareth became friends and eventually Fuller joined the Rebellion. Fuller continued to pilot the Croc of Gold until it was destroyed by Imperial forces near Tashtor Seneca. Fuller escaped the freighter's destruction and gained ownership of another starship that eventually met a similar fate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
