The droids lacked an advanced independent decision module, causing the droid to replace healthy parts with cybernetics. This blunder was only the first in a series of failures. During the waning years of the Galactic Republic, MerenData released the flawed EV-series supervisor droid, which was accidentally fitted with an MDF motivator, a module usually attached to torture droids. The EV droids were then recalled by MerenData, but it was too late to counter the damage caused. It was a blunder which MerenData never fully recovered from. MerenData continued to market droids to the Galactic Empire, such as the V-series droid supervisor and GD16-series pilot droid, but by then the company had lost its reputation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
