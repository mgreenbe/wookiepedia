He was an associate of Lando Calrissian and Lobot. In 0 ABY, he showed DarkNet footage of the Battle of Yavin at his cantina, where a shocked Calrissian asked him to replay the part of the footage with the Millennium Falcon attacking Darth Vader and his TIE escorts several times. This came in spite of Okkul having already watched the footage multiple times, yet did not mind Calrissian's request.
