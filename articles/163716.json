They are identifiable by their upgraded, green armor that allowed for easier operations in humid and poisonous environments. Their armor was tinted green to allow for camouflage in forested wetlands. While training aided the swamp troopers in navigating the swamps, a sealed suit and body glove with environmental sealants to keep out various biological perils thriving in swamps (such as toxic bacteria, swarms of stinging insects, amphibious carnivores, and the like), custom rebreathers in the helmets allowing the troopers to breath under water for a short amount of time, emergency flotation package, and enhanced viewfinder with multi-spectrum view-finders and terrain mapping software provided a greater chance of survival in the often dangerous swamps in which they operated.\nEach swamptrooper was armed with the Golan Arms FC-1 flechette launcher, except for the squad leaders, who carried Imperial Heavy Repeaters. Their survival kits include an emergency float and a serrated vibroknife."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The early versions of swamptrooper armor closely resembled the armor of the Galactic Republic's clone scout troopers, and they also resembled forest-style camouflage versions of scout troopers.
