In 137 ABY, Orland was a private in Joker Squad, a fighting squadron of the Empire's 407th Stormtrooper Division under the command of Sergeant Ran Harkas. That year, the Jokers were part of an Imperial force led by the Sith Lord Darth Stryfe that was dispatched to the planet Ossus to search the world's former Jedi Temple. Although the temple was widely believed abandoned following an attack by Darth Krayt's One Sith seven years prior, Stryfe suspected it was a haven for Jedi survivors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Stryfe waited aboard a Star Destroyer in Ossus's orbit, Orland and the rest of the Jokers searched the temple and its surroundings on the planet's surface. Orland found nothing and reported such to Harkas, who reminded the Private that Stryfe demanded thoroughness. Meanwhile, Corporal Anson Trask and one other trooper stumbled across a group of hidden Jedi in a sub-basement of the temple, but the Jedi Knight Shado Vao used a mind trick to cloud their thoughts and convince them that the temple was indeed abandoned. Satisfied, Joker Squad returned to the Star Destroyer and reported its lack of findings, but an unconvinced Stryfe ordered an orbital bombardment of the temple."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like the other members of Joker Squad, Orland wore stormtrooper armor and carried an ARC-9965 blaster rifle.
