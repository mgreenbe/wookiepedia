While not as powerful as regular DC-15 blasters, the DC-15s was handy in close-quarters combat, or when conserving ammo was necessary. The DC-15s had a recharge rate of one round per second and was capable of seven consecutive shots with energy fully recharged; after seven shots, the user had to wait for recharge of energy for at least one shot to fire again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
