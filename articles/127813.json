It served as base of operations for the Talusian Smugglers. The base was made of several structures: an operations building, a landing pad, living quarters and a supply building. The base was protected by a tall defensive wall and the three hills that surrounded the base were guarded by smuggler guards. Many of the operations in the base were carried out by droids, including EG-6 power droids and CLL-8 binary load lifters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Smuggler Base was located near a cave inhabited by the Selonians of the Neetha Den. After the Battle of Yavin, several Selonians were captured by the smugglers and kept as hostages in order to force the rest of the den into mining for them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 1 ABY, the Corellian Security Force was aware of the situation but was unable to intervene in Selonians matters. Agent Taarna thus recruited an independent spacer in order to help the Selonians without involving the CorSec. The spacer later worked with Tika Sileste, Ravi Thienta, Lika Fimente and Kiki Dorente, the advisor to the Neetha den mother, to develop a strategy against the smugglers. The spacer then attacked the base and killed many smugglers, including their leader. The spacer also destroyed the smugglers' droids, and the weapon caches, and retrieved stolen Selonian supplies of food, hides and electronic parts. However, the spacer discovered that the captive Selonians had already been shipped to Ord Mantell and sold as slaves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Smuggler Base appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
