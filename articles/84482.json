Linden kept the plant's production at a minimum to protect the Sekct, a species native to the planet, and M-3PO-C admired him for that. The droid was dismayed upon learning of his death. After Vost Tyne and the Empire overtook Marca, M-3PO-C was reassigned to managing the housekeeping droids at the plant. When Alliance agents crashed on Marca and decided to help the native Sekct, M-3PO-C happily assisted the agents while they were on the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
