Like other Bilar claqas, Unni Yerudi was made up of several Bilars which, while capable of only animal intelligence on their own, formed a sentient collective intelligence when together. Unlike other claqas, which typically had four to seven Bilars, Yerudi was made up of ten Bilars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the size of its claqa, Yerudi's intelligence went beyond what other species would class as genius level. It used this intelligence as an interplanetary con artist. In time, it was successful enough to buy several clubs on Cloud City, and eventually become the richest being in the Anoat sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
