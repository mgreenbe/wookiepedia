They were mounted to laser cannons and were generally fitted with flashback suppressors. The tips deteriorated with each shot fired, and had to be replaced periodically. Laser tips were found at the very end of the four laser cannons mounted on the wings of the T-65 X-wing starfighter. A visual inspection of the laser cannon's barrels, flashback suppressors, gate couplers and laser tips was done prior to takeoff by every Rogue Squadron pilot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
