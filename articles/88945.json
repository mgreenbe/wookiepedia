Menelath was the second-largest settlement on Iol and it was originally constructed to act as an extension of Haven, the world's capital, that was situated nearer to Iol's mineral deposits. Menelath consisted of a large, primary dome, which contained most of the city's functions, while two additional domes contained the bulk of Menelath's residential zones. From about 28 BBY to the fall of the Galactic Empire, Menelath was ran by Tol Ferin, a Chadra-Fan who held the position of Vice President within Tagan Industries."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
