Their armaments included frontal torpedo tubes, concussion missiles, a top-mounted quad laser cannon, and a bottom-mounted bomb/spotter droid drop pod.\nThey had three engines and were painted black. Their pilots wore green and black/white suits. At the time of their first combat operation, the Shriek-class vessel was so new that Galactic Alliance sensors were unable to recognize it as anything other than a YT-series variant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As of 40 ABY, only ten late-model prototypes and several earlier models existed.
