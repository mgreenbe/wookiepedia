Vader, driven by a hatred for the Rebellion, took two Star Destroyers as escorts, his personal flagship Executor and the Colossus. The Sith Lord intended to have D'rinba IV close enough to be within the battlestation's superlaser range, so that both the Rebel base and the planet could be completely destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel Alliance, however, managed to intercept the Empire's plans, and assembled some of their best troops: a small team of Force-sensitives and Alliance Special Forces members, with the objective of disabling the Death Star superlaser before it got too close to the planet.
