If two Ranat hunting parties engaged in combat, the result was either death or escape. Surviving members of the conflict would then organize a vengeance party in order to restore their honor. These parties were gala affairs for the Ranat's tribe, as each member of the town would assist in preparation even if only a small handful of individuals actually enacted the revenge plan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
