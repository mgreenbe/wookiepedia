This is similar to ships in Star Trek, which possess phaser banks on rings on the top or bottom of the ships. Due to the amount of projectile ordnance the Demolisher possessed, the ship's design seemed to have been focused on missile delivery, suggesting that Gladiators were used as artillery support ships, and not actually used for capital-ship combat. The small number of traditional capital-ship weapon emplacements would only be a threat to small ships, such as blockade runners, and the missile launchers would have to be used as the primary weapons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
