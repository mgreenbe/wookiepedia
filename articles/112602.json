The New Republic scored several victories against the Empire and was boosted by defecting Imperials and planets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While scouting the Outer Rim for Imperial activity, the New Republic Captain Wedge Antilles spotted two Imperial Star Destroyers above Akiva. Before he could report their presence to the Republic, he was captured by Admiral Rae Sloane. Despite his capture, Antilles managed to send out a distress transmission to Akiva. Admiral Sloane had traveled to Akiva to organize an emergency summit to discuss the future of the Empire. Shortly later, she was joined by several other Imperial officials and commanders including the financier and slaver Arsin Crassus, Grand Moff Valco Pandion, General Jylia Shale, and the Imperial Adviser Yupe Tashu.

Not trusting his mother, Temmin told his mother to meet him at his Aunt Esmelle's house before jumping off the bike. Shortly later, Temmin was captured by the crime lord Surat Nuat, who wanted to settle a score with the boy for stealing a shipment of data cubes.

This had the effect of sparking a riot in Myrra which turned into an uprising. Meanwhile, Norra killed two TIE fighter pilots and stole a TIE fighter.

The Republic officers opted to delay sending a fleet to Akiva in order to avoid raising tensions.

Despite the attempted Republic landing, Admiral Sloane decided to proceed with the Imperial summit.

However, Temmin survived his fall after being rescued by the crowd. Climbing up the palace's wall, Temmin managed to infiltrate the Golden Harp, which was carrying the departing Imperial officials and their rebel prisoners.

As Admiral Rae and her pilot Morna Kee brought the shuttle into space, they found the Imperial ships including their home ship Vigilance under attack from a New Republic fleet led by Commander Kyrsta Agate on board of the Alderaanian frigate Sunspire.
