With its lack of story-driven campaigns, it is not generally viewed as a part of the regular series of X-Wing games, with the successive X-Wing Alliance, instead, considered by fans to be the third installment in a trilogy preceded by X-Wing and TIE Fighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Gameplay and features"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Technically superior to its two predecessors, the game is multiplayer oriented. XvT runs on Windows, and requires a joystick (the others could be played with mouse as well). Technical improvements include: CD audio soundtrack, high resolutions, texture mapping to the ship models of the in-flight game engine, 3dfx support and a sophisticated pilot and mission selection system which tracks the points and awards the player accomplishments."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The game engine was completely rewritten. In the previous two games, the player's craft was at the center of the game grid (at coordinates 0, 0, 0) and the position of all other items was stored relative to the player craft. \"Movement\" of the player craft therefore meant that the relative position of all other items was altered. This approach was only possible in single player mode, however, and had to be abandoned for a multiplayer game."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An important addition is the ability to choose the squadron that the player wants to participate in (e.g. in a disable and capture mission, the player can choose between either the Y-wings that disable a ship, or the X-wings that support them), ship, and armament. Furthermore, due to the multiplayer aspect most missions featured in the game can be flown by teams of players, either together against the computer or even pitting player teams against each other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Response to the game, on the other hand, considered it infamous for being the only part of the series designed exclusively for multiplayer and/or personal practice only. The original X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter game lacks a storyline, coherent scenarios, and cutscenes. Instead, the game only features two \"Battles\":"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These Battles comprise eight individual combat missions each which can be played on either the Rebel or the Imperial side, either as single missions (Combat Engagements) or as a \"Battle\" where three successful missions are required for one side to be considered the winner.

Following Imperial mission #5, the Interdictor cruiser Compellor is sent away to a repair yard in the Swellen system to have an anti-warhead defense system installed. During Imperial mission #7 the Imperial task force receives a full shipment of TIE Avenger starfighters for their elite Avenger squadron and Gunboats which are subsequently formed into the newly created Talon squadron.

Here it can be assumed that both sides successfully accomplished their respective campaign missions. This and the events depicted in the cutscenes are thus canon. The timeline given above is based on this premise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, this approach creates a problem in the last mission (Battle of Nocto) because of the conflicting mission objectives: The Rebel side must destroy the SSD Vengeance and prevent the destruction of their shipyard, while the Imperial mission objectives are reversed. This can only be resolved by assuming that the destruction of the SSD Vengeance and the shipyard occurred more or less simultaneously.
