Fives is quarantined to a room which has a window where he can see Tup being operated on. Fives is increasingly concerned at Tup's discomfort during the procedure, but his protests only lead the Kaminoans to block his view.

Suddenly, Tup awakes and blabbers about killing Jedi, making Shaak Ti wonder if this is a Separatist brainwashing plot.

Shaak Ti, wanting an atomic brain scan on Tup, goes to contact the Jedi High Council, while Nala Se, wanting to terminate the clone and do an autopsy, heads to Prime Minister Lama Su.

Back in Fives' medical room, he decries the plans for Tup's termination and convinces AZI-3 to do a biopsy. After setting a false intruder alarm, AZI-3 extracts the tumor from Tup's brain only to have Nala Se and Shaak Ti walk on them.
