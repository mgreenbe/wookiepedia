The Phylon Transport projector's inescapable tractor beam drew in not only a Nallastian freighter and a Fondor Space Patrol ship, but also a Z-95 Headhunter piloted by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. The projector was destroyed by Kenobi's lightsaber-wielding Padawan Anakin Skywalker, enabling not only the three ships' escape through a hologram-concealed docking port exit, but also the Skywalker-initiated proton-grenade destruction of the false Sun Runner itself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
