Bane, in his Theta-class T-1 vessel, Triumph, made the dangerous trip to the Deep Core world of Prakith. There, he found the fortress of Darth Andeddu, where he was attacked by many of Andeddu's followers. He defeated all of the cultists who attacked him and found Darth Andeddu's holocron in the Sith Lord's ancient tomb. Quickly leaving the planet, he studied the holocron on the trip back to his home on Ciutric IV, forcefully taking the knowledge of transfer essence from the holocron when the gatekeeper refused to teach him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
