During the raid, the vessel was destroyed by the privateers to stop it from sending out a distress signal. One of the privateers, the Wroonian Dasha Defano, later discovered that one of her best friends had been aboard the transport at the time, and had been killed. Defano's shame over her actions led her to leave the privateers and join the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
