Savi and his employees did sell scrap metal and parts salvaged from wrecked starships in the junkyard on the outskirts of the outpost, but they were also a group of Jedi admirers and believers in the Force who were known as the Gatherers. Most locals referred to them as \"scrappers.\" The Gatherers would sort through finds from the starships for possible items of interest that were presented to Savi for his evaluation. If he determined that they were likely historic artifacts, they were preserved and protected rather than sold. Within the outpost's Land Port, Savi's Workshop ostensibly served as a main office and workshop, but in reality housed a secret area where the Gatherers taught visitors about the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As of 34 ABY, Savi had operated the business for multiple decades, although the author Eloc Throno wrote in his book Traveler's Guide to Batuu that he had never seen the \"son\" indicated in its name despite his years of visiting Batuu.
