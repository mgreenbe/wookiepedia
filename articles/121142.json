Scram managed to grab the smuggler after he insulted the gangster, but Tumperakki kicked the Gloovan in the chin and knocked Scram back. The Scram Gang then entered the cantina and prepared to attack Tumperakki for humilating their boss, but the bounty hunter Dengar opened fire on them before they could attack. In the ensuing fight, Tumperakki managed to escape through the cantina's skylight. Scram was a sore loser with purple skin and blue eyes.
