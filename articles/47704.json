Many were destroyed when Falleen Prince Xizor's lab, which was in the droid plant many of the feral droids resided in, exploded. Many droids probably survived as well, and also probably continued to haunt the Factory District."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Feral droids could look like anything, because that term described any droid in the Factory District that would kill a sentient being. However, some of the BXL-99 labor droids that Jax Pavan encountered had modified themselves in unusual ways. One had Plasticine tubing with multicolored fluids added inside it, another had lights that ran up and down its arms and blinked on and off randomly, and the third had tall, thin vanes protruding from its head that ran electric discharges between each arm. All had antiquated electronic devices welded to them at seemingly indiscriminate spots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Droids that became feral would attack any sentient being, and output random Binary. They appeared to destroy random machinery, including Xizor's lab.
