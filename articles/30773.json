Among her many achievements, she was responsible for capturing a holovid of Jyn Erso's inspiring speech at Yavin 4. She was later present at the Rebel Alliance's Echo Base on Hoth to capture more footage for future propaganda. She desired to speak with the three most well-known heroes of the Rebellion, Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, and Han Solo, but was not able to meet with any of them before the Empire discovered the base and attacked, forcing the rebels to evacuate. Selgrothe, who due to her recent arrival was unfamiliar with their evacuation plan, was assisted in evacuating by a rebel soldier named L'cayo Llem. Inspired by heroic actions from an average soldier, Selgrothe began to talk to her fellow evacuees after they successfully passed the Imperial fleet. Selgrothe was also friends with the propaganda artist Janray Tessime."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
