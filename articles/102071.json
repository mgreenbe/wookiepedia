The store was owned and operated by the Outer Rim Oreworks Company and was the only store located on Apatros in 1003 BBY. The building the store occupied was once a barracks, but it had been converted into a place for workers to buy supplies. The shower that had been located in the building was converted into a secure storage room, and the bunks had been replaced by shelves. ORO also fastened a black-and-white sign to the wall outside the store that displayed its hours of operation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ORO Market only stocked the most basic items, and the goods sold at the store were all overpriced. Store credit was available to customers, but it was advanced against future wages, and the interest rates that ORO charged were extremely high. As a result, workers were often forced to take extra shifts in the company's cortosis mines on Apatros to pay off the extra debt they incurred by taking store credit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ORO Market was first mentioned in the novel Darth Bane: Path of Destruction, written by Drew Karpyshyn and published on September 26, 2006."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
