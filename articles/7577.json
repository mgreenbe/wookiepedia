When a vehicle passed over a mine, the mine's sensors would detect its weight, specific alloys, or repulsorfields, triggering the device. It would not detonate if troopers were to step on one, as their most sensitive settings required far more weight than even that of the most encumbered trooper and a larger repulsorfield than repulsor boots or packs were capable of generating."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Troopers often camouflaged anti-vehicle mines in large numbers along key roads to block otherwise indefensible approaches to bases and strategic positions. Such defensive minefields were often marked to prevent casualties to allied units."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
