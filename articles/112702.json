In an effort to gather hard data on the Imperial search force, Rebel Admiral Nammo ordered a reconnaissance mission. Nammo also suspected the Imperials would be seeding the area with probe droids\u2014after what happened at Hoth, the Rebels all knew how effective those units could be\u2014and authorized the destruction of any probots encountered during the mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two A-wings from Blue Squadron, including Ace Azzameen, launched from the Defiance and proceeded through several systems deemed likely locations for the Imperial search efforts.

While Blue 1 provided cover, Ace moved to inspect all the capital ships, determining their IDs and captains."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Ace's initial inspection pass, the Corrupter began launching probe droids, followed by the Cerebus and the Vigiliance.

However, the loss of the probe droids made the Imperials hard-pressed to maintain coverage on the surrounding systems, and by the time they were resupplied, the Defiance Task Force had rejoined the rest of the Rebel fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
