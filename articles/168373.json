A Sith Temple was located on the barren world, and was used by the Order of the Sith Lords for hoarding Sith artifacts. The planet was strong with the dark side of the Force, which severely affected Obi-Wan Kenobi when he and Bail Organa were on it. Zigoola did not appear in the Jedi Archives and its location was kept secret by the Sith. During the Clone Wars, Bail Organa, and Obi-Wan Kenobi traveled to Zigoola and destroyed the Sith Temple, but were unable to recover any of its artifacts for further study. They were rescued by Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and a squad of clone troopers, who were sent after Kenobi telepathically contacted the Jedi Temple for help."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
