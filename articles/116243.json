He led the forces that were tasked with quelling the resistance movement on the Outer Rim world of Acherin. Both sides clashed for nearly a year, until the Imperials finally proved to be too powerful for the resistance. Their leader, Toma, announced their surrender, however, Riwwel felt that surrender wasn't enough considering for the number of Imperial lives taken in the battle.
