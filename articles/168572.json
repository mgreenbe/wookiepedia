They were adapted to the extreme cold of the planet. As their sun's radioactive emissions increased, the Zolanders created a skin-altering gene, inadvertently creating a genetic offshoot of the Zolanders, the Clawdite. After the formation of the New Republic, the Zolan Civil War broke out between the two species, and the Zolanders became dominated by the Clawdite, whom they previously treated as a lesser species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
