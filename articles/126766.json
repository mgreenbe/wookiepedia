Solo flew out in her StealthX to confront the pirates, finding that their forces consisted of an S18 light freighter and BDY crew skiffs. She hailed them and warned them to turn away immediately, and when they neglected to comply, Solo fired a shadow bomb at one of the skiffs. The bomb destroyed the crew cabin, but her use of the Force to direct the bomb informed the attackers where she was, and they opened fire on her craft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo's shields overloaded, and her R9-series astromech droid, Rowdy, reported that the signal had come from the light freighter. As soon as she launched the next shadow bomb and began to guide it through the Force, however, the Sith found her again and opened fire on her once more, causing her to lose her grasp on the shadow bomb. Rowdy reported that the StealthX's maneuverability was limited and that their shields had not yet come back online, and Solo decided to launch the next shadow bomb.

As the targeted skiff rolled to try and bring its weapons to bear, Solo flew her StealthX right under the Rockhound's belly, staying in her target's efflux trail. The bomb hit its target, and Solo contacted Calrissian, who reported that he had found and destroyed the sabotage droid aboard the Rockhound. Solo requested that he have his protocol droid, Ornate, begin plotting a hyperspace jump course immediately, and to jump as soon as it was ready.
