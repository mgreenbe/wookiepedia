With multiple jets located on the ventral side of a ship, the jets would direct bursts of pressurized gas at the surface below the ship when landing and taking off in order to provide auxiliary thrust and aerostatic lift. Temperature sensors built into the landing jets would regulate the heat produced to prevent damage to the landing surface. The smuggler Han Solo modified these sensors on his ship, the Millennium Falcon, so that bursts of intense heat could be used as an anti-personnel measure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Landing jets were also features of the pilot seat, employed during emergency eject."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
