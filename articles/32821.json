Before being sold into slavery, DD-BD served on a Morseerian pirate ship. However, when the ship was impounded by the Empire, he was found there and sold at auction to the Pyke Syndicate for just a fraction of his worth. From there, he was put to work as a slave in the mining operation center on the planet Kessel. In 10 BBY, DD-BD was freed from slavery when his restraining bolt was removed during a slave revolt in the mines started by the droid L3-37. As the first of many droids freed, DD-BD helped spark a rebellion on Kessel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like other adminmech droids, DD-BD was programmed to be driven by efficiency and quotas and never question orders.
