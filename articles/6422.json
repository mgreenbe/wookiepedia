Rike was a strong Republic loyalist with a history of exceeding his orders to fulfill what he viewed as his duty to the Republic. When the Eternal Alliance rose to prominence as a new major power in the galaxy while utilizing a large number of Republic defectors in its ranks, Rike went to view it as the Republic's enemy regardless of the current political situation. Following the death of the Eternal Empire Empress Vaylin in 3630 BBY, Rike led a group of loyalists including Captain Dakarus Garnik, Lieutenant Jom Shomo and Major Nayva Isoder to displace the Alliance forces on Denova and seize control of the Denovan Baradium Mines. Alliance Admiral Bey'wan Aygo, who knew Rike back from his Republic days, sent a strike team to Denova to reclaim control of the mines. Rike's followers were taken out one by one, and eventually Rike himself confronted the Alliance forces in a prototype hovertank, claiming the mines were stolen from the Republic in the first place. After his hovertank was damaged, Rike proclaimed that impossible odds were no reason to surrender and engaged his opponents directly, but was overwhelmed and killed. After his death, Aygo proclaimed that Rike, though misguided, was a true Republic patriot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "General Amos Rike appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne as the final boss of the \"Trench Runner\" Uprising."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
