He let the planetary ruling council oversee the day-to-day running of Pamorjal and only got involved in public affairs if he believed that Imperial interests were at stake. During 3 ABY, he began to come under pressure from various megacorporations that had interests on Pamorjal to take action against the Pamorjal Freeman's League, a resistance group that opposed the exploitation of Pamorjal by offworlders. Vellion was reluctant to do this, but felt that he would be forced to do so, because they were \"loyal\" Imperial corporations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
