During the Battle of Ilum in 3640 BBY, Darth Malgus took control of the space station and proclaimed himself the Emperor of a New Empire. A strike team was dispatched to take Malgus down and encountered the Entity on their way to the throne room. After being released from the containment, the Entity attacked the group, but was defeated, after which it returned to its incorporeal state.
