Both served as replacements for the previous two Bith brothers Ujaa and Ujii who left when the lead singer Elinda found Ujaa's lackluster music skills intolerable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This second incarnation of the Twisted Rancor Trio began to rise to fame around the year 3956 BBY, being especially popular on its homeworld of Taris as a result of Elinda's voice. The group's big break seemed to have arrived when they were invited to perform for the local businessman Davik Kang at his estate. However, while Uksaris was ecstatic for this opportunity, Elinda objected on the grounds that Kang was heavily rumored to be connected with the crime syndicate the Exchange. In fears that their lives could be in danger should their performance be unsatisfactory to Kang, Elinda opted out, and Uksaris replaced her with her sister Ashana on the eve of their scheduled performance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fodo only appears as a hologram in the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic as a part of a puzzle that the player, Revan, can solve in order to crack a security crate booby-trapped with a Holo-Sec Corp anti-theft explosive.
