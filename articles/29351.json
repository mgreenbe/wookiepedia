To counter this, the Priests would conduct an hour-long ceremony to consecrate another planet. At the end of the ceremony, the Ssi-Ruuk would dedicate the planet to the Ssi-ruuvi Imperium, and give it a Ssi-ruuvi name."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The only consecration ceremony viewed by non-Ssi-ruuk was when Bakura was consecrated by the Keeramak, during the Ssi-ruuvi attempt to re-conquer Bakura. Interestingly, the Keeramak itself led the ritual, which should have been done by the Priests. It is possible that its unique status in Ssi-ruuvi religion allowed the Keeramak to consecrate a planet. It is also possible that consecration was a province of the Shreeftut, as the Keeramak was the Shreeftut of the Ssi-ruuvi Imperium at the time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
