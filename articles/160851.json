He joined the ISB directly from COMPNOR at the age of 27 and was assigned to the Investigations arm mere weeks before the destruction of the second Death Star. After that, he operated with Imperial governors throughout the Outer Rim Territories as a spy and assassin, often bringing warning of New Republic attacks weeks before the attack would even be scheduled to take place."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even though he missed the glory days of the Empire when he was well-equipped and well supported, Grieves loved the dangers of operating independently. He sometimes considered leaving Imperial service entirely and perhaps becoming an independent spy or even bounty hunter. Grieves was last seen operating in the Rintonne system and was suspected to be working with Imperial Governor Serdif Tount."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
