It was there that he defended HK-47 from a group of spacers, though he eventually failed and was destroyed. AK-Prime was similar to his lesser, but still effective, AK-3 Reaper, AK-1A Hammer, CLL-8 Combat Droids, and, oddly enough, CWW-8 Load Lifter Droids, upon which the design was based."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "AK-Prime sported a wide range of weaponry, including Republic Sfor Carbines, a plasma flamethrower, and rocket launchers.
