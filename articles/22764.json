From space, it was a dull, brown, almost lifeless world. Calipsa was a brown world of little vegetation, rich in natural ores. It was dominated by mining operations which caused much air pollution and hazy air, not entirely suitable for Human consumption. The raw materials mined from the systems of the Calipsa Province were shipped to Calipsa where they were processed into alloys for export.
