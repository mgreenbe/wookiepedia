Here, walking the original surface of the planet that never saw the sun due to the shadows of Taris' massive skyscrapers, they endured a lifetime of horror marked by starvation, rakghoul attacks and rakghoul infections.

Forn was able to reproduce the serum, and used it to cure the Outcasts of the disease and Esala, the village healer, was given hundreds of vials from Zelka Forn. Revan also met Rukil and helped him discover the Promised Land. Revan found journals belonging to Rukil's grandfather, father and apprentice Malya in and around the city sewers.

It was also shown, in the last successfully preserved time recording, that the last generation alive had lost so much information about the world, they didn't even know how or what brought them there and the remaining members died out from toxic waste which ultimately resulted in their extinction like the rest of the planet's population many years earlier. The information about them was lost until a Jedi retrieved the information about their post-apocalyptic history via hologram recordings both in the Promised Land and in the Undercity and gave it to a local Republic history keeper, in 3643 BBY."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The only legacy they left behind, was a sample of a rakghoul serum which was found by pirates in Zelka Forn's second medical facility, which was located in the Undercity in the remains of their village and was later given to a Jedi, although the Nekghouls were technically the descendants of the Outcasts. The Jedi group then gave it to a Republic scientist so someone could alter and improve the vial from someone infected so it wouldn't be useless.
