It was mainly used in luxury resorts as a means to sightsee. The 3 meter wide wings would fold up into a small, 2 kilogram, lightweight backpack when not in use, and could be deployed or re-furled rapidly via servomotors. It had a maximum flight time of 1 hour before the power pack had to be replaced, and a flight ceiling of 1,000 meters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
