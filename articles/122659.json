It ranked above Senior Commander, and below Rear Admiral. The rank was the equivalent of Imperial Army and Starfighter Corps Colonel. A Captain of the Line commanded a tactical unit known as a line of battle. Lines were theoretically a unit of four starships but, in practice, it comprised between one ship (a single Star Destroyer was considered a line in itself in the Navy Order of Battle) to twenty. Senior Captains held a position of Captain when they commanded only one starship and a position of Commander when they were in charge of a small group, below the squadron level, of escort ships. Captains of the Line could often serve as the adjutant to an admiral."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after the Battle of Yavin in 0 ABY, prior to his promotion to the flag rank, Thrawn held this rank in the months following the first Death Star's destruction while on a mission against Nuso Esva."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ranks of Captain of the Line was created in the Imperial Sourcebook released in 1989.
