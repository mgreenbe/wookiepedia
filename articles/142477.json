For over a century, it collected aquatic specimens from across the galaxy. It had been lost for over ten thousand years before it was retrieved in 520 BBY. That same year, it was placed in the Baobab Archives on Manda. The ark was included in the list of the Twenty Wonders of the Galaxy by the historian Vicendi in his 10,000 BBY publication Arturum Galactinum."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
