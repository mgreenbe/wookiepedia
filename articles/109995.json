R2-B1's last assigned duty was on Naboo, in the repair droid pool on the royal cruiser belonging to Queen Amidala. During the blockade of Naboo and the subsequent heroic escape, the ship carrying Queen Amidala was hit by enemy fire and damaged. The droids stored on board were sent out to repair the damage, R2-B1 was one of the droids destroyed in this event. Only R2-D2 survived to restore shield power to the cruiser."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hasbro toy company has produced three distinct \"basic line\" action figures portraying the R2-B1 astro droid character. The first was issued in the year 2000, following the release of The Phantom Menace, as a single carded figure in the Episode I\u2013packaged toy line. The second was released in 2007 as part of the 30th Anniversary Collection. The last iteration was included in the \"Royal Starship Droids\" four-figure \"Battle Pack\" (#38608), which was part of the 'Discover the Force' series sold exclusively at Walmart stores in early 2012. While all these replicas measure about 2\u00bd inches tall (6 cm), each is cast from different molding tools, and is painted in a notably different manner; for instance, the first version has inaccurate metallic silver \"chrome\" accents on the dome. This original Episode I figure was rather difficult to find in the marketplace when offered, and became a sought-after collectible at the time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For Star Wars Day 2015, Gamestop released an exclusive Funko POP!
