During the Galactic Empire's attack on Echo Base in 3 ABY, Sendak and a number of other personnel were at the living quarters when the kitchen worker Chase Wilsorr arrived to help other stragglers. After it was announced that the GR-75 medium transport Bright Hope was leaving in ten minutes, the lights in the base went out, and Sendak stressed that the officer could not navigate the corridors. Wilsorr advised the group of personnel to follow him and guided them to the Bright Hope. After the kitchen worker then helped a tauntaun handler make it to the transport, the passengers cheered Wilsorr, and the Bright Hope soon took off to flee Hoth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sendak appeared in the short story \"A Good Kiss,\" written by C.B.
