The skyline of Junk Junction was dominated by large towers of trash, and although it was located below the open air of the Upper City, one could almost see the Tarisian sky from Junk Junction. There were a few remaining intact buildings still poking out from the refuse. The area of Junk Junction was large enough, and the piles of trash high enough, to conceal an entire junk hauler vessel within the waste. Said junk hauler was The Last Resort, which masqueraded as the home of Arkanian Offshoots Jarael and Gorman \"Camper\" Vandrayk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Junk Junction was once the site of a grid of high-rise buildings, although they were torn down to make room for something else\u2014however, nothing was built to replace them, and Junk Junction was eventually established. By the end of the Great Sith War, Junk Junction was one of the largest junkyards on Taris. When the Arkanian Offshoots Jarael and Gorman \"Camper\" Vandrayk decided to settle on Taris, they chose to live in Junk Junction, because it was large and open enough to conceal their junk hauler, The Last Resort. Jarael and Camper set traps within the trash to deter visitors, and they disguised The Last Resort as their home, surrounding it with tents and awnings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3964 BBY, Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick was accused of murdering four classmates and went on the run along with an accomplice, local Snivvian hood Marn Hierogryph. Hierogryph took Carrick to Junk Junction to meet with Camper, who had helped him ship criminal Zovius Mendu off the planet not long before. After brief hostilities with Jarael, who meant to protect the elderly Camper, Carrick and Hierogryph were spotlighted by a Taris Civil Authority gunship that was tracking the fugitives. Carrick, Hierogryph, Jarael, and Camper escaped the gunship by taking flight in The Last Resort, leaving a large hole in the middle of Junk Junction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Junk Junction first appeared in Knights of the Old Republic 3, a comic written by John Jackson Miller and released in 2006.
