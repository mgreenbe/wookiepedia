With that in mind, most of the information Rey included was about life on Jakku and instructions for scavenging. Despite this being the main intent, Rey used the guide for other purposes, too. She wrote about her personal life, including events from her past. She also taped and pasted little items she found, from a Bespin postcard to print schematics of ships. The guide even doubled as a sketchbook, as Rey added various drawings to the pages, such as self-portraits, portraits of people she knew, the wildlife, terrain, and ship parts."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A New Start"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rey took the guide with her when she, Finn, and BB-8 escaped Jakku in the Millennium Falcon, encountering its previous owners Han Solo and Chewbacca, who agreed to take them to Takodana to help get BB-8 to his base.
