In 0 BBY, when the Alliance learned about the existence of the Empire's Death Star superweapon, Melshi led a rebel extraction team during the rescue of Jyn Erso\u2014daughter of Galen Erso, the Death Star project's chief engineer\u2014from a labor camp on the planet Wobani."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Erso's liberation, the Alliance employed her to make contact with her father, discovering that he had deliberately left a crucial weakness in the Death Star's design as an act of sabotage. In an effort to retrieve the Death Star's schematics needed to pinpoint that weak spot, Melshi helped Andor assemble a ragtag group of volunteers dubbed \"Rogue One.\" The squad then set off on a mission to the Imperial security complex on the planet Scarif, where the plans were being stored. During the subsequent battle on the planet, Melshi and the rest of Rogue One successfully obtained the Death Star plans, but they all gave their lives to ensure the mission's success."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early Alliance service"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ruescott Melshi was a human male born at some point between 39 BBY and 30 BBY. Growing up in the galaxy ruled by the Galactic Empire, Melshi grew to detest the authoritarian government and readily joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the early Galactic Civil War, intent on fighting the Empire every step of the way. An experienced soldier and infiltrator, Melshi was given the rank of sergeant in the Pathfinders branch of the Rebel Alliance Special Forces due to his experience as an undercover soldier. During his time with the rebels, Melshi became a good friend of Captain Cassian Andor, a member of Rebel Alliance Intelligence Service. As an infiltrator, Melshi served as a leader on a number of missions and often had to perform dirty work in the name of the Rebellion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one point, Melshi served together with Lieutenant Caluan Ematt on Gaulus. Sharing his expertise with other members of the Rebellion, Melshi also made additions to a rebel field manual, writing a section on various Imperial stormtrooper variants and describing the distinctive features of each of those branches. By 0 BBY, Melshi was a member of the Massassi Group, the largest rebel cell operating from the Great Temple on the fourth moon of the planet Yavin, where he answered to General Davits Draven. By that point, the sergeant was considered one of the Alliance's seasoned veterans."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rescue of Jyn Erso"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, Andor received intelligence that the Empire was building a superweapon with enough firepower to destroy a planet. The Alliance, in an attempt to make contact with the weapon's leading engineer, Galen Erso, decided to locate his daughter, Jyn. The rebels uncovered recent arrest files on Erso indicating that she was being held inside Imperial Detention Center & Labor Camp LEG-817 on the planet Wobani under the alias \"Liana Hallik.\" Having verified that information, General Draven approved the formation of Extraction Team Bravo, a rapid-response team of marines led by Melshi. The team included two other rebel troopers as well as K-2SO, a reprogrammed Imperial KX-series security droid, which was recommended to Melshi by Andor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following a rescue plan personally devised by Melshi, the extraction team used a U-wing starfighter designated Bravo One to reach Wobani, timing their arrival to coincide with the moment when Erso was being transported on a workers' convoy. Evading Imperial sensors, the team landed on the planet and proceeded undercover to a halfway point between the prison and the convoy's destination. With great risk to themselves, the team overtook and boarded one of the Empire's HCVw A9 turbo tanks that held the captive Erso. Melshi and his men took out two stormtrooper guards, after which the sergeant unlocked Erso's stuncuffs, informing her that she was being rescued. However, Erso believed that Melshi was a member of the Partisans group, sent by her former mentor Saw Gerrera with the mission to assassinate her. As such, when another prisoner asked Melshi to unbind him, Erso took advantage of the distraction, punching Melshi in the face and grabbing a nearby shovel. Erso knocked out Melshi and his companions with the shovel before rushing from the tank, only to be intercepted by K-2SO outside."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Erso taken into custody, Melshi and the extraction team returned to Bravo One and left the planet. However, the team experienced a technical malfunction with the U-wing's navigation computer, rendering them unable to make the jump to hyperspace and forcing them to take refuge inside an asteroid field in the Wobani system. The situation necessitated K-2SO to call for assistance from the Alliance Fleet, which quickly responded by sending Red Flight, a group of four T-65B X-wing starfighters, to assist Melshi's team and provide escort until the rebel CR90 corvette Vigilant arrived to pick up the team. However, as soon as the Vigilant arrived in the system, an Imperial-class Star Destroyer emerged from hyperspace, destroying the corvette and catching Bravo One with a tractor beam. While Red Flight fought off the Star Destroyer's complement of TIE fighters, K-2SO was able to repair their craft's navigation computer. Red Flight then destroyed the Star Destroyer's targeting array, momentarily disabling the tractor beam and allowing Melshi's team to make the jump to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Breaking the rules"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Safely arriving on Yavin 4, Melshi escorted Erso to a meeting with the Alliance High Command, keeping her in binders and warning her not to try to escape again. After delivering his captive, Melshi also made sure to inform Lieutenant Voren Na'al that despite her young age, Erso should not be taken lightly, telling the lieutenant about Erso's ability to overpower trained Alliance troopers during her escape attempt on Wobani. The Alliance recruited Erso on a mission to locate her father, a task that she completed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Through Galen, Jyn learned that the Imperial superweapon project was named the \"Death Star\" and that her father had secretly sabotaged the project. Galen had placed a crucial weakness in the station's design that could be taken advantage of in order to destroy the superweapon. However, the only way the Alliance could identify that weak spot was by obtaining a copy of the Death Star's technical readouts, which were being kept inside a secure vault in the Imperial security complex on the planet Scarif. Jyn attempted to persuade the Alliance High Command to assemble a strike team to retrieve the plans, but the rebel leaders vetoed the mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, before the official decision was even announced, Andor had started assembling a volunteer force to accompany Erso to Scarif. Melshi was against the Alliance High Command's decision to do nothing, so when he was approached by his friend and asked to form an infiltration team, he enthusiastically accepted the offer. Melshi hastily began assembling a team among the SpecForce commandos, making it clear that the mission was voluntary and those who joined were disobeying orders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Melshi was grateful when more than a dozen commandos volunteered for the mission\u2014including the Drabatan warrior Paodok'Draba'Takat and a higher-ranking officer, Lieutenant Taidu Sefla\u2014as well as some non-SpecForce soldiers, such as Corporal Stordan Tonc. Melshi and his recruits joined a team consisting of Andor, Erso, K-2SO, defected Imperial pilot Bodhi Rook, and the Guardians of the Whills Chirrut \u00cemwe and Baze Malbus to form a squad of over two dozen men. After appropriating as much rebel equipment as it could, the team\u2014taking on the callsign Rogue One\u2014boarded a stolen Imperial cargo ship, SW-0608, and departed for Scarif."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Scarif"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An important Imperial location, Scarif was protected by a planetary shield, with the orbital Shield Gate space station providing the sole means of entry. Since Rogue One was in possession of the stolen shuttle's Imperial access codes, the rebel infiltrators were able to pass through the Shield Gate. As the shuttle approached landing pad nine of the Imperial security complex, Andor and Erso instructed the members of Rogue One in their plan. Melshi, Pao, \u00cemwe, and Malbus were to go with the main rebel team, which was supposed to provide a distraction and draw out as many Imperial forces from the complex as possible, allowing Andor, Erso, and K-2SO to sneak inside the data vault and steal the Death Star plans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to his complete trust in Melshi's skills, and believing that the sergeant had mission-specific knowldedge crucial to the success of the mission, Andor assigned him as the overall commander of the rebel forces instead of the highest-ranking officer, Lieutenant Sefla. After the shuttle landed, an Imperial inspection team boarded it, but the rebels, hidden inside a cargo compartment, overpowered them. Andor and Erso disguised themselves with uniforms taken from the Imperials and left the ship. Leaving five men aboard the shuttle with Rook, Melshi took the rest of the rebel troops and sneaked away through the shuttle's bottom hatch, using cover provided by blasts of coolant that spewed from the shuttle's purge vents per standard Imperial landing procedures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As instructed by Andor, Melshi led his troops into the jungles of Scarif eastward from the shuttle, until they reached a small hillock near some Imperial barracks. Distributing demolition charges among his team, Melshi had his troops set explosives on the various landing pads outside of the complex while \u00cemwe and Malbus dispatched any stormtroopers who posed a danger to the infiltrators. After planting the charges, the team reassembled at Melshi's position at the barracks, taking cover and preparing for an ambush of Imperial forces. When Andor, Erso, and K-2SO entered the Imperial complex, Melshi received contact from Andor, who gave him the go-ahead to detonate the explosives. Melshi triggered the bombs, and the explosions on multiple landing pads led the Empire to believe that it was being attacked by multiple groups of rebels at once; Rook added to the confusion with false reports of rebel activity via radio. Responding to the attacks, the Imperial garrison rushed from the barracks, right into the path of Rogue One's fire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the surprising nature of Melshi's attack, the battle at the barracks initially went in the rebels' favor. However, as Imperial reinforcements began to arrive in great numbers, Rogue One took heavy casualties. Melshi's troops attempted to hold their ground at the hillock, but the stormtroopers took a spearhead formation in an attempt to break their defense. In the heat of the battle, Melshi spotted a brief opportunity to break the Imperial formation. The sergeant ordered his forces into attack, and Rogue One destroyed a number of Imperials with a well-aimed shot from a missile launcher. However, Rogue One failed in its last-ditch attempt and had to retreat into the jungle, as the Empire threw all of its forces, including AT-ACT walkers and TIE strikers, at the rebels."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Last chance for victory"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the Rebel Alliance fleet\u2014having intercepted Imperial communications regarding rebel activity on the planet\u2014arrived at Scarif to assist Rogue One. The Alliance was able to reinforce Melshi's squad on the surface with a number of U-wings carrying rebel troopers, while X-wings from Blue Squadron provided air support. The Empire quickly responded by closing the Shield Gate, effectively trapping the rebel forces on the surface and preventing them from contacting the rebel fleet. Melshi and a dozen survivors from the battle at the barracks emerged from the jungle onto the beach of Scarif, where they witnessed the arrival of rebel reinforcements, who successfully destroyed several AT-ACTs. In the midst of the continuing battle with Imperial forces, Melshi was contacted by Corporal Tonc\u2014one of the troopers left behind at the shuttle with Rook\u2014through the long-range communications booster that the sergeant carried."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tonc and Rook informed Melshi that he needed to locate something called a \"master switch\" in order to link up the Imperial complex's massive Citadel Tower with Rook's shuttle. Doing so would allow Rook to contact the rebel fleet in space and instruct them to create an opening in the planetary shield, enabling Andor and Erso to transmit the Death Star plans to the rebel ships. Rook instructed Melshi that the master switch was located inside a bunker complex within the outer perimeter of the Citadel Tower. Following Rook's instructions, Melshi led the remainder of Rogue One\u2014partially reinforced by arriving rebel troops\u2014to the Citadel Tower. While the team was approaching the bunker complex, elite Imperial death troopers joined the fight, killing rebel soldiers one by one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As he was trying to help a wounded rebel to safety, Melshi himself was hit by enemy blaster fire. Gravely injured, he was forced to take cover at the door of the bunker complex. The only ones who made it to the bunker alongside Melshi were \u00cemwe, Malbus, and Lieutenant Sefla. Melshi was contacted by Rook, who informed him that Andor and Erso had successfully retrieved the Death Star plans; now the rebels desperately needed to turn the master switch, which Melshi spotted located at a workstation ten meters away from the bunker, directly in the line of fire of the death troopers. Sefla attempted to make a run for it, but he was immediately gunned down by the enemy soldiers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few moments later, Melshi succumbed to his injury and died as well. However, \u00cemwe was able to activate the master switch, before he and Malbus also met their ends at the hands of the death troopers. With the link between the Citadel Tower and Rogue One's shuttle established, Rook successfully contacted the rebel fleet, telling them about his plan to transmit the Death Star plans before being killed. The Alliance Fleet successfully destroyed the Shield Gate, allowing Andor and Erso to beam the Death Star plans to the rebel ships.

Decades later, when Ematt\u2014now a major in the Resistance against the First Order\u2014obtained a copy of Melshi's article on stormtroopers, he fondly remembered the fallen sergeant.

In that capacity, Melshi came to perform some dirty work for the Alliance, never hesitating to do so in the name of the Rebellion's pure ideals.

Melshi was adept at reconnaissance and displayed an affinity for combat tactics, personally crafting a successful strategy to liberate Jyn Erso on Wobani. Highly intelligent, Melshi also quickly realized that since the Empire heavily outnumbered the rebels on Scarif, their only choice was to attack in such a way as to appear more powerful than they were.

He praised the overall filming experience as an amazing chance to live out his childhood dreams. With regard to the filming of the Scarif scenes\u2014which were shot on the Maldives\u2014Pow especially remembered the hot climate.
