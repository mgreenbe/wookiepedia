R-27 served in the Republic Army on the planet Makeb in 3637 BBY, and erroneously reported to the Shroud that the planet's tectonic instability would lead to its destruction. Not long afterwards, R-27 was unexpectedly reassigned to a frontline posting, and while pursuing a Mantellian ambassador en route to Dorin, R-27's starship was destroyed by what evidence later determined was an Imperial stealth fighter, which piqued the Shroud's curiosity, noting that the attack was deep in Republic space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
