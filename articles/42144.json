Their plating was made of a heavy metal known as Arcetron. It could track an opponent with motion, heat, energy, and sonic detectors. Visual stimuli were processed through the droid's single photoreceptor, which could also produce a blinding spotlight to identify and track its targets. They were equipped with two dual repeating blaster cannons mounted on their arms. They could also function for extended periods without a direct connection to a Central Control Computer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though more formidable than their predecessors, they were not without flaws.
