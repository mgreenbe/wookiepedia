Bestia had various creatures at her disposal which she claimed were 'legion', acting as one for her bidding. These creatures, though mutated and quite powerful, listened to her call and did as she ordered."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bestia used her monster forces as her front line offence most of the time, though this did not mean she was unskilled in combat; in fact it was far from it.
