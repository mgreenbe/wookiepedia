Once the door was closed, there were no controls to unlock it from the inside. This might have been a change made by the Cell, but Riboga the Hutt had never been concerned about fire code violations. Inside the restaurant was split into three levels, each being 1.5 meters apart. A hallway ran from the back of the second level to the kitchen. A railing ran along the third level. Three meters above the third level was a balcony area overlooking the restaurant, which was large and strong enough to support hundreds of individuals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 31 BBY, the business had been closed for some time, being littered with trash, and with many of its furnishings destroyed.
