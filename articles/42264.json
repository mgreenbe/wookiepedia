The Moraysian cruiser was stolen by the mercenary Ledesmar, and EV-6B6 was thus forced to serve her. When members of the Spice Runners of Kijimi boarded the cruiser to locate Ledesmar, EV-6B6 encountered Poe Dameron and Zorii Bliss and led them to Ledesmar, but regretted having to do so. Dameron and Bliss rescued Eevee from Ledesmar, and the droid worked with their cell of the Spice Runners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "EV-6B6 was eventually shot and destroyed under orders from the gang's leader, Zeva Bliss, due to being former property of a competitor. Dameron retrieved Eevee's body and attempted to repair her, and Bliss, having noticed him doing so, had the droidsmith Babu Frik repair the droid on Kijimi. EV-6B6 continued to work with Dameron and Bliss, and accompanied Dameron when he betrayed the Spice Runners during the Kijimi summit, when Zeva Bliss intended to execute numerous criminal allies and enemies. However, EV-6B6 was destroyed once again by the Spice Runner guard Gezlar, suffering damage too severe to be repaired."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
