Equppied with four powerful talons and a long hooked beak, the Skysnare had two eyes on the top of its head and two on the bottom. Skysnares that lived near to the ruins of Acablas possessed slight Force-sensitivity, allowing them not only to sense prey, but to pull prey up into the air with the Force and catch it in its huge beak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
