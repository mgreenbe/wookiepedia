The vehicle was rectangular in shape, with an engine protruding on either side of the vehicle's rear end, with the speeder's pilot and passenger seat located between. The TT-86 had silver and black chromium-alloy plating with integrated chromomites which covered a discreetly armored power plant at the front of the vehicle. In the year 34 ABY, Thandisten Pikalo owned an unmodified SolarNova TT-86 and used it in the city of Canto Bight on the planet Cantonica, where most other vehicles had been customized with modifications in some way."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The SolarNova TT-86 first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, which was released on December 15, 2017.
