The tubes had several fire modes, including individual fire, seven tube salvos, or full launch of all twenty-eight. The design of the Leveler I meant that no ammunition that was not loaded into the twenty-eight tubes was carried. Instead, a repulsorlift ammo wagon was employed, and reloading of the weapon was handled manually. Designed for artillery support, the Leveler I featured minimal shielding and no defensive armament. To fire on targets over the horizon, the Leveler I employed a dedicated energy receptor that relayed target information to the crew's holodisplay so the fire modes such as narrow, medium, or wide, could be programmed in."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Leveler I was designed by Bryn & Gweith, a subdivision of CoMar Combat Systems, as a fortified long-range siege weapon.
