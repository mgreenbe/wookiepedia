When the duo arrived at the village, Viscus directed his fellow Nightbrothers to attack the Jedi. As the battle progressed, Skywalker leaped to the roof where Viscus stood, and after a brief scuffle, grabbed him and held his lightsaber to the helpless Nightbrother's throat. Viscus ordered his men to stop fighting, and reluctantly told Kenobi and Skywalker to seek out Mother Talzin for the information they sought. As Skywalker released Viscus and departed the village with Kenobi, Viscus prevented his men from further attacking the Jedi, allowing them to leave in peace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in 20 BBY, Viscus and a team of Nightbrothers were later sent to Ord Mantell by Mother Talzin to assist Darth Maul and his Shadow Collective, who were preparing a trap to capture Count/Legends Dooku and General Grievous of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Nightbrothers arrived just as the battle began. Viscus and the Nightbrothers fought against Dooku himself. Many were killed by Dooku and Viscus himself was badly injured during the battle, but saved from death due to the intervention of Maul's allies, who were successful in capturing the Sith Lord."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the battle, Brother Viscus returned to Dathomir where he greeted Maul, who returned home to the Nightbrothers' village with the captive Count Dooku and brought them to the heart of Mother Talzin's power.
