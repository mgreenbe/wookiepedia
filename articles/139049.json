The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. Due to the nature of many older quests in Star Wars Galaxies, the species and appearance of Taergle changed each time a player performed this quest. However, the quest dialogue given by C-3PO indicated that Taergle was a male. Furthermore, the species of Taergle cannot be inferred from his relationship with Deasie A'Fresel, as she too had randomly generated appearances in the game. Therefore, the canonical species of Taergle remains unidentified."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although not mentioned in the quest dialogue, Taergle, identified primarily as Captain Taergle, was also revealed to be a First Lieutenant if examined by the player. This was likely a result of game's character generation mechanics, however while Taergle was most officially recognized as a captain, the possibility of him holding this second rank of First Lieutenant cannot be fully discredited."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
