Shortly after the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Lellis overheard his nephew Tuttel speaking with his friend Giggek, who was plotting to destroy the fortress of the recently deceased Sith Lord Darth Vader. Lellis, accompanied by Kra-Ka, confronted the two and attempted to prevent them from carrying out Giggek's plan. However, Giggek refused to be dissuaded, shattering the light he had been carrying onto the floor. The glare momentarily blinded Lellis and frightened Kra-Ka, allowing Giggek and Tuttel to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
