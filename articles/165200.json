Commander Rezi Soresh made this experiment to create the perfect assassin, who would then go on to serve the Galactic Empire. Soresh had their faces surgically altered and wiped their identities from a computer database system. He then started his brutal reconditioning program, which was designed to turn them into mindless servants by removing their past memories and emotions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At first, X-1 became friends with X-2, X-3, X-4, X-5, X-6, and X-7, the other participants in the training program. However, after Soresh started torturing them with electrocution, X-1, like the other trainees, had his personality and mind changed completely until he felt no emotions. Around ten years prior to the Battle of Yavin, the participants were pitted against each other in combat until only one remained. X-7 easily killed X-1 and earned the right to become Soresh's personal assassin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "X-1's only appearance in Star Wars canon is in a flashback in Rebel Force: Target, the first book of the young readers series Star Wars: Rebel Force, published on December 2, 2008 and written by Alex Wheeler."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
