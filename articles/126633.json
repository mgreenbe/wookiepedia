Khorda planned to place the artifact in the planet's power relays, causing it to explode and release a massive amount of Force energy, destroying the planet. However, Fett, Wesell, and Poof were able to defeat and kill Khorda and his men, saving Coruscant in the process, though Poof was also killed in the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
