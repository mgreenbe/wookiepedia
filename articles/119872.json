Due to the seismic instability in some parts of the Doaba Badlands, gigantic rifts could open into chasms hundreds of kilometers deep, then close again without leaving a trace of anything that had been under it on the surface at any time. The disappearance of colonists and their settlement in the area that would be known as the Adsila Rifts was attributed to a sand well. The Ibhaan'I tribe, who lived near the Adsila Rifts, were particularly attuned to the phenomena, and could feel the approach of an opening sand well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
