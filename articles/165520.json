It required an enormous amount of power, supplied by the standard base power generators. The turbolaser also had a very slow rate of fire, causing it to become overwhelmed very quickly. Because its firepower was focused mostly on land vehicles, it could be destroyed by squads of infantry. The guns were highly inaccurate against small, quick-moving targets such as infantry soldiers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These towers were used to protect surface bases from large aerial assault craft. In such cases the main guns could rotate upwards to achieve a completely vertical firing arc.
