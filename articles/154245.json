The Orincan captain and his crew were stranded when hyperspace routes were closed in the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace Disaster, and took refuge aboard an abandoned space station along with numerous other vessels that had been stranded in the same star system. The Orincan, like several of the other parties, intended to loot the station, but the looting was eventually called off by the Jedi Master Cohmac Vitus. Several days into their stay on the station, the Orincan still refused to cooperate, as did several other groups. Leox Gyasi, captain of the Vessel, convinced the parties to share their resources by reminding them of their luck in surviving the disaster; the Orincan captain offered his foods. Limited hyperspace travel was eventually permitted, and the Orincan departed the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
