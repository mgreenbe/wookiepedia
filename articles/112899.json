When based on Courkrus in 11 ABY, its crew congregated in a cantina called the Warren, along with Riistar's Raiders. The bulk cruiser Booty Full was also once affiliated with the Red Nova crew. Though the Red Nova crew was never specifically targeted by Corran Horn in his \"Ghost Jedi\" guise, fear of the Jedi caused their ranks to be decimated by desertion. The remaining crew began negotiating with the LazerLords to merge their gangs, as neither had enough remaining members to adequately function alone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
