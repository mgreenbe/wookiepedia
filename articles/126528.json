It was a rigged sabacc card which the player would surreptitiously slip into his hand to replace one of the cards provided by the dealer. The player could then alter the skifter's suit and value, independently of the game's normal shifting. This was usually accomplished by tapping one of the corners of the card."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
