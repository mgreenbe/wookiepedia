The squadron was temporarily rechristened as Red Squadron to honor the original Red Squadron that had faced the first Death Star during the Battle of Yavin. Santage would operate under the call sign Red Seven during the coming battle. The Alliance battle plan called for a strike force to fly into the half-completed superstructure of the Death Star and destroy the main reactor core. The resulting chain reaction explosion would then destroy the superweapon.

However, the shield was still protecting the battlestation, forcing the Alliance fleet to engage an Imperial force led by the Star Dreadnought Executor. During the engagement\u2014which had been a carefully planned trap orchestrated by Palpatine himself to destroy the Alliance\u2014Red Squadron performed better than their counterparts in the newer A-wing and B-wing starfighters. They racked up an impressive kill count, and Red Squadron remained relatively intact throughout the battle, suffering only a small number of casualties compared to the losses of other units."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Assault on the second Death Star"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Solo's team was able to destroy the shield generator, exposing the Death Star to the planned Alliance attack. General Lando Calrissian, leading the fighter wings under the call sign Gold Leader and flying the Millennium Falcon, ordered fighters from Red and Gold Squadrons to begin their attack on the main reactor. Santage joined Calrissian in the attack, along with Red Leader Commander Antilles, Gray Leader Colonel Horton Salm, Tycho Celchu, of Green Squadron, and Jake Farrell, also from Green Squadron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skimming the surface of the battlestation, Santage dodged turbolaser fire before entering the superstructure via an access shaft, taking up the rear position in the Alliance fighter formation. TIE fighters and interceptors followed the Rebel fighters into the shaft, intent on destroying them before they could take out the main reactor. Navigating through the tight confines of the reactor shaft, Calrissian ordered the pilots to lock onto the strongest power source to lead them to the reactor core. Although Santage successfully avoided several obstacles in the shaft, he was exposed to the enemy; his fighter was hit by several bursts of laser cannon fire from the lead TIE fighter. His fighter broke apart, and he was killed. His death prompted Calrissian to order several other fighters to break off from the assault and head back to the surface in an attempt to draw pursuit off of the strike force. Celchu, Salm, and Farrell complied, leading half of the pursuing Imperial fighters away from Calrissian and Antilles, which in turn allowed them to destroy the Death Star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Keir Santage had brown hair and light skin, and had grown a moustache. He was considered to be an excellent pilot, which led to his assignment to Rogue Squadron, the Alliance's elite starfighter squadron, alongside notable pilots like Wedge Antilles. During the Battle of Endor, Santage diligently obeyed orders and followed the Alliance battle plan by flying into the interior of the Death Star in an attempt to knock out the main reactor, a decision that cost him his life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Keir Santage first appeared briefly in the 1983 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, where he was portrayed by Billy J.

He was unnamed, and his brief scene culminated in his death as he was shot down by a TIE starfighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2000, Decipher, Inc. released their Death Star II Limited expansion for the Star Wars Customizable Card Game. The set established Keir Santage's name, the fact that he was a Rogue Squadron veteran, and that he flew as Red Seven during the battle. The image used to represent Santage's X-wing on its CCG card is actually a shot taken of Wedge Antilles' fighter from Return of the Jedi as it skims the Death Star's surface en route to the reactor shaft.
