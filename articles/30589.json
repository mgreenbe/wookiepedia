There, at the factory, where Bug-Eyes is, and where Xizor is hiding, and also where Rostu has set the trap for Vader to capture Jax, the group is attacked by rogue factory worker droids. Nevertheless, Jax's company finds Bug-Eyes and retrieves the information for the Whiplash. In the process, Jax gets into a fight with Xizor, where the latter uses Jax's lightsaber, and Jax uses a lightwhip. At the end of the fight, Xizor flees as the Imperial forces arrive for Jax. Though Jax has figured out that Rostu betrayed him, he lets him go of any punishment or consequence. Jax then tries to lose Vader by dropping his own lightsaber into the factory's nuclear core, which will cause a chain reaction that will lead to the factory's destruction and make Vader believe, at least temporarily, that Jax died in the explosion. Haninum Tyk Rhinann sees that the failure for Jax's capture will lead to his own demise at Vader's hands, so he departs Vader's service for Jax.
