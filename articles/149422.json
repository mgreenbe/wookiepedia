With his career already in jeopardy, Sllus agreed to transfer into the starfighter/commando squadron that Commander Wedge Antilles was putting together. Some time during the initial training and culling process that the candidates went through, he lashed out and physically struck the Mon Calamari and fellow candidate Jesmin Ackbar, the niece of Admiral Ackbar. For this action he was washed out of the squadron two days later and, presumably, Starfighter Command altogether."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
