Many of them would later receive proper names in the works of the Expanded Universe. These characters included Pruneface, Squid Head, and Rancor Keeper. Two similar looking characters were both identified as Klaatu wearing different outfits, but later sources confirmed one of the two was a separate character named Wooof. It was also later revealed that the names of action figures \"Nikto\" and \"Weequay\" were actually the species names of the characters Lathe and Pagetti Rook."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though most of the line featured toys based on the film, a few original items were produced. To avoid the high cost of creating large vehicles for the line, small Mini-Rig vehicles that did not originate in the films were created (starting with the toys from The Empire Strikes Back). Many of these went on to appear in the fiction of both the Legends and later canon continuities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The baton that then-Captain Ackbar holds in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episodes \"Water War\" and \"Prisoners\" is an homage to the 1983 action figure that came with such an accessory.
