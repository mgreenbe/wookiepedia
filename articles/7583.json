Imperial stormtrooper TK-421, who was stationed on the Death Star, accidentally recorded himself via the MSE-6 series repair droid MSE-6-G735Y complaining about how constantly wearing a helmet was ruining his skin and had given him a large pimple. After Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin saw the holorecording when the droid collided with his ankle, he sent the droid back to TK-421 with a message and a delivery of antibacterial nanofoam. The stormtrooper recorded a response saying he would shower with the product."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
