New Mandalorian officials from the planet Mandalore, which had its supply lines cut due to its neutral stance against the war, began communications with the Moogans in order to smuggle products to the surface and establish a black market. Among the goods was the Ardees Beverage tea, which was diluted with a harmful chemical in order to increase their profits from the sale of the tea.
