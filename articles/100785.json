However, the world supported a large population of flying serpents, which were among the most distinctive life forms native to Ophideraan. The massive winged lizards ruled Ophideraan's skies, communicating with each other through tones at pitches beyond Human hearing. The serpents originated from the Great Well, the main source of water on the arid planet, and which was regarded as the source of all life on Ophideraan. Ophideraan had at least a pair of moons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the era of the Galactic Civil War, Ophideraan was ruled by the Serpent Masters, a group of Human scavengers who had learned how to control and ride upon the planet's native flying serpents. The group's Supreme Serpent Master, a man named Tyrann, not only discovered the arid world but learned the secret of how the flying serpents communicated, creating a device that could replicate their ultrasonic tones and allow for their use as mounts. The Serpent Masters made use of a large amount of slave labor in maintaining their society\u2014among the unfortunates held there was the Human Josen Shire and his daughter Tanith, who had crash-landed on Ophideraan and were immediately taken captive. Tanith was allowed to serve the Serpent Masters offworld by steering wrecked ships to the planet for salvage, and in 0 ABY she returned with a friend in tow: Luke Skywalker, a Rebel pilot and budding Force-user."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pressed into servitude by the Serpent Masters, Skywalker immediately began working to overthrow the bandits, starting by attempting to uncover the secret of how they controlled the flying serpents. Skywalker's droid R2-D2 uncovered how the Serpent Masters were commanding the beasts, and used the astromech's capabilities to claim a steed of his own. Having learned of the device Tyrann used to maintain his group's dominion over the serpents took the form of a medallion worn around his neck, Skywalker flew his serpent into battle and cut the medallion from Tyrann's neck. Tyrann leapt to his death trying to catch the falling trinket, and the medallion's destruction led to the serpents being turned loose and the downfall of the Serpent Masters. Afterwards, R2-D2 fixed the transmitter and turned it over to the bandits' former slaves, giving them the tools to rule over Ophideraan themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 0 ABY, Ophideraan was mostly populated by the Serpent Masters and the sentients they enslaved, as they stripped wrecked ships on the planet's surface of all their valuables and survivors.
