It was built, in a limited number, by Sienar Fleet Systems in the years before the Battle of Yavin. The few ships built were gifted to members of the Inquisitorius or other favored Dark Side Adepts of the Galactic Empire. The prototype had a sleeker design and thus a smaller sihlouette than its eventual successor, because it featured a more compact wing panel configuration."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The description of the TIE Advanced prototype matched that of the TIE Advanced v1, even though the latter was designated under Canon while the Imperial Handbook was designated under Legends."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
