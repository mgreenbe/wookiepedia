It also was equipped with a backup shield generator, as was standard Mon Calamari practice.\nIt had a landing claw, standard landing gear, and inflatable puncture-proof pontoons for water landings. The MC-18 was also submersible (maximum depth 1,000 meters). When submerged, its shields had to be reconfigured to handle the strong exterior pressure and this weakened the shields versus other attacks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
