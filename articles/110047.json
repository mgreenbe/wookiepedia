Albin Johnson, the founder of the 501st Legion, wanted to build a pink droid for his daughter Katie, who was dying from brain cancer (In fact, the \"KT\" suffix would appear to be a reference to her name). When it was realized that he did not have enough time, R2-KT was built by Jerry Greene, master droid builder, with the help of the R2-D2 Builders Club. R2-KT makes appearances at children's hospitals, Star Wars Celebration, and charity events in the southeastern United States. A Hasbro action figure of this droid was sold at San Diego Comic-Con 2007 and the character had a cameo in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars film. In large part because of this, she later replaced the astromech droid P3-NUT in the MMORPG game Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures in the role of the gift for the child's play charity event in 2011."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R2-KT was originally going to appear in The Clone Wars D-Squad episode arc. However, since those episodes featured R2-D2 as a main character, The Clone Wars crew wanted to avoid the audience confusion when addressing the droids. As a result, they created the astromech QT-KT instead as a homage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the blog series From World War to Star Wars, R2-KT alongside her substitute QT-KT's pink coloring as well as acting as a secret weapon was acknowledged as having a precedent during World War II where certain fighter planes, such as one of the Spitfire planes, were colored pink to effectively camouflage them during dawn and dusk to photograph enemy targets without being detected, which had been proposed by Lord Mountbatten for the British Royal Navy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
