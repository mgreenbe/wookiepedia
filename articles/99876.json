Members of the Old Guard had been or were considered as members of the Jedi Council. Jedi considered within the Old Guard included Qui-Gon Jinn, Sifo-Dyas, Mace Windu, Dooku and Roan Shryne who was considered a peripheral member, along with many others. Windu was the only known member who served on the Council until his death. Sifo-Dyas's views on the Jedi as a militarized force were considered too extreme and resulted in his expulsion, Dooku left the Order and became a Sith, Jinn's consistent rebellion against the Jedi Code prevented his membership and Shryne was never made privy to the Council's decisions. Following the Great Jedi Purge in 19 BBY, the Sith Lord Darth Vader found mention of the Old Guard in the Jedi archives while hunting Shyrne, who had survived the Purge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Old Guard was mentioned in Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader, a 2005 novel by James Luceno."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
