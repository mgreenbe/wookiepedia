It was an omniprobe sensor array and was usually mounted on a variety of ground vehicles. The device resembled a segmented dome and could be easily seen when placed atop weapons platforms. The GroundSweeper-3 worked by making low-level scans magnetically keyed to a planet's gravitational center. This allowed it to detect movement even when the target was outside the unit's line of sight. Although terrain provided no protection against its scans, the GroundSweeper-3 had a maximum altitude limit of 2 meters. For this reason, the GroundSweeper-3 was often used in conjunction with other sensor systems, such as the Siep-Irol GlobeScan and Melihat UniScan Sensor System, especially in defense of Alliance to Restore the Republic bases."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
