Finding his route into the tomb blocked by large boulders, he used the Force to clear them aside, killing a mercenary standing on the balcony in front of the entrance in the process. Korr moved on through the tomb, engaging mercenaries and cultists and killing them. Attempts to demolish bridges in the tomb in order to deter Korr were made, although he managed to bypass these difficulties, defeating further cult members as he continued towards the burial chamber. Upon reaching the chamber, Korr encountered a New Reborn wielding a saberstaff. The two dueled, and Korr emerged victorious. He resealed the casket, allowing the dead Jedi to once again rest in peace. But in doing so, the burial chamber began to collapse. Korr escaped from the sanctuary, while those cultists who remained were killed in the ensuing destruction of the dead Jedi's mausoleum."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mission to Chandrila was one of the two missions included in the demo of Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, the other mission being Mission to Mos Eisley."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
