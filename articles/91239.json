Slipping past her Imperial escorts, Organa was able to contact Spectres member Sabine Wren and led her to the tape's location. Upon retrieving it, however, the pair were attacked by the droid bounty hunter IG-88, who was also after the data-tape.

While walking through the spaceport, Organa's group were ambushed by a female in Mandalorian armor.

A bay door closed behind Organa, after which the Mandalorian introduced herself as Sabine Wren, a member of the Spectres. The kidnapping was nothing more than a ploy to separate Organa from her escort so that the acquisition of the data-tape could commence.
