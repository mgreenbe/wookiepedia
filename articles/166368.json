Created during Shimrra's purge of the Jeedai heresy, these pits were filled with toothy yargh'un creatures, who fed on the corpses of those Yuuzhan Vong who had been condemned to death for heresy\u2014sometimes even those who were still alive. How many pits were carved out was unknown, however Shimrra was willing to build more to house the dead. These pits also served to relax Shimrra, as he found the screams to be soothing while he communed with the Gods."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
