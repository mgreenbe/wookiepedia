Ramana was enlisted as a dancer in the Cantina on Telos IV, being made to dance on the stage along side a band made up of Bith. Though Harra eventually wanted Ramana back, enlisting the aid of Meetra Surik who freed Ramana though a wager game of Pazaak. Ramana came back with Surik to Harra, though Ramana would not stay with Harra.
