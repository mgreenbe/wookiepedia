Jagged Fel, who had successfully convinced the Moff Council to unify with the Galactic Alliance, was disgusted by Daala's willingness to have anyone who revolted against the Alliance killed and even innocent people like journalist Madhi Vaandt who was killed during the revolt on Blaudu Sextus by Mandalorians working for Daala. Although he promised her Imperial troops to help destroy the revolts, he decided to withdraw the Remnant from the Summit as he wasn't willing to unite under the authority of Daala who had finally shown her true colors. He was also disgusted by the fact that she blamed the Jedi for the revolts even though she had no proof and it was only motivated by her hatred of them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
