Navigating a starship through an ion storm was dangerous, as it was impossible to predict where and when the lightning bolts would strike. At one point, the Spectres tried to lose an Imperial flotilla by entering an ion storm. However, the rebels' ship, the Ghost, was struck by a lightning bolt that damaged its engines, targeting systems and turbolasers. The rebels were able to fix the systems just in time to get rid of their pursuers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
