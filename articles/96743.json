The experiences of the New Imperials differed from those of the older generation of Imperial officers who had struggled to reach the top during the time of the Galactic Republic. Unlike the New Imperials, the older generation struggled to keep in pace with the new rules. Some notable New Imperials included Rae Sloane and Lero Danthe. Sloane believed that the Empire would be a better place once people in her and Danthe's age group were in charge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
