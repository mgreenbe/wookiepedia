However, it came under the ownership of the dangerous Baath brothers, and slowly degenerated over the years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Featured were games of sabacc, overseen by Kiughfid card-dealers, jhabacc, and betting on such sports as podracing, nuna-ball, and Odupiendo racing, which were displayed on telescreens. The main gambling floor level was the Digisee Gaming Floor, where most public gambling took place. The criminal underworld also had a presence, including death stick dealers like Elan Sel'Sabagno and con-artists like Achk Med-Beq and Dannl Faytonni. It catered to more shadowy, illegal activities; in the lower levels, fights were staged between varying combatants, and there was even betting on the Galactic Games, which was illegal. The club took its gamblers so seriously that it provided sleeping compartments for those whose games lasted some time. These compartments also allowed them to enjoy the various temporary companions who could be found in the club, suitably dressed to suggest their availability. Wilst Molan, who worked as a dancer in the club, was often seen mingling with patrons on the gambling floor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jango Fett went to the club looking for a deathstick dealer, Jervis Gloom, who would help lead him to Komari Vosa. Approximately ten years later, Fett's on-and-off partner Zam Wesell ran inside to escape Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker after she failed in her attempt to assassinate Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Outlander's chief bartender was Bufon Taire, who used ingredients such as Aludium pu-36 and the \"starshine special\" (added only for the right wink), but who had a habit of watering down the drinks. He was assisted by assistant bartender Ganwick Trag and waitress Jynne Celwik. The club was next door to the Snapping Septoid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "About one year before the Battle of Yavin, Han Solo and Chewbacca visited the Outlander Club, where Solo shared a drink with a female Zygerrian. Bounty hunter Dengar was also there at the time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Outlander Club was originally intended to be much more club-like, with its patrons dancing. After it was deemed too distracting, the gambling and underworld dealing aspects were enhanced."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The shot of the betting area with the three large view screens was a late addition to the sequence, filmed in miniature and populated by Lucasfilm employees shot in front of a blue screen. There were only five people available, who went through different costume changes. As such, visual effects producer Jill Brooks is in the shot three times, and Amy Allen twice. These extras were also used to fill out the pick-up shots filmed in England, notably the exchange between Anakin and Obi-Wan about the bounty hunter being a changeling."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An orange-skinned being who closely resembled a Lepi, though may not have been, was present in the Outlander Club when Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker were searching for Zam Wesell."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though this may have been a simple mistake made before the name of the Outlander Club was decided upon, many Aurebesh advertisements present in the Coruscant Entertainment District level in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter advertise a \"Club Orb.\" These advertisements also exist within the Outlander Club itself. It could be an alternate name for the club (such as the case with the Mos Eisley Cantina, which is also known as Chalmun's Cantina), or perhaps one of the two other bars located in the level. However, it seems unlikely that a nightclub's interior would have advertisements for another nightclub."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
