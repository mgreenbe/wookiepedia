The truth was far more damaging than the lie that the heroes had been lost; Dagger Wing's war crime\u2013the unauthorized bombing of thousands of Imperial civilians on Fest on misinformation, assuming that they were hitting a Sith Lord named Ondorru\u2013would have destroyed Republic credibility and created a diplomatic crisis. It was through only the leadership of Dagger Wing's commander, Conrad Gall, was he able to dissuade his wingmates from going rogue. Republic High Command disavowed their actions and imprisoned the squadron on Belsavis. When Command announced that Dagger Wing was missing in action, it was a harsh blow to morale."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the start of the Galactic War, when the Empire reignited hostilities with the Republic under General Rakton's leadership, Havoc Squad was dispatched by General Elin Garza to Belsavis to extract Dagger Wing for the war effort, regardless of their past crimes, as pilots of their caliber were in short supply. At the moment, Dagger Wing was actively assisting prison security with the breakout instigated by the Imperials. Havoc assisted with their efforts. However, Gall discovered Ondorru's presence on Belsavis and pursued him in order to clear his squadron's name. Havoc followed their quarry into the Deep Prison, where the squad was faced with a difficult choice: abandon an injured Gall to a rancor and pursue Ondorru or save the Dagger Wing commander. Either way, Dagger Wing was committed to the war effort."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
