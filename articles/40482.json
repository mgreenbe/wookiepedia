They bore a similar appearance to the spikes of droid landing craft. They saw action on Kamino, being used to get into the hangar where battle droids, aqua droids, super battle droids and droidekas were then able to unload and attack the clones. Drill-spikes were also used on Tatooine, Mon Calamari and Christophosis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
