Cham retorts that the people won't believe the Empire's lies, but Rampart believes they will turn against him easily. He then appeals to Eleni, saying that its dangerous out there, and if they tell him where Hera is, he can ensure her safe return to them.

Howzer objects, saying he was there, and the blast that hit Taa did not come from Cham or his fighters. Rampart asks who was responsible then, and Howzer admits he doesn't know.
