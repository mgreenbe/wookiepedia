The owner of Osisis Station, Galus Vez, had an asteroid thruster hidden on an asteroid in his personal race track, Fool's Run. He used the thruster to drive the asteroid into competitor's vehicles will he raced, being able to activate it remotely from his Gauntlet fighter Splendour. Vez deployed the thruster during a race against the Twi'lek pilot Hera Syndulla, hitting her starship Ghost and damaging its stabilizers. Syndulla was still able to beat Vez in the race despite the damage, as two of her crew members used the Force to drive asteroids into the Splendour as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Asteroid thrusters first appeared in canon comic strip \"Ring Race\" which was written by Martin Fisher and illustrated by Bob Molesworth.
