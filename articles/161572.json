It was the homeworld of the sentient Vodran species, along with dianogas, carnivorous cephalopods that spread themselves across the galaxy by climbing aboard starship bilges and stowing away in their garbage tanks. It was conquered by the Hutt Cartel, which was controlled by the Hutts from the neighboring world of Nal Hutta, who turned the Vodrans into slaves or vassals. Sometime later it was controlled by the First Order after the Hutt Clan abandoned the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vodran was first mentioned in Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope, a 1989 Star Wars Legends sourcebook cowritten by Michael Stern and Grant S.
