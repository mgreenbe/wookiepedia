Its duties were to safeguard the Republic's Galactic Senate and the Supreme Chancellor. The Senate Guard was centered on the galactic capital planet of Coruscant and had a tradition that went back thousands of years, making it one of the oldest law enforcement agencies in service to the Republic. It also served as a secondary police force for Coruscant in addition to the Coruscant Security Force. Next to the Jedi Order, the Senate Guards were seen as the defenders of democracy and symbols of peace and security on Coruscant. In law enforcement circles, Senate Guard investigations were well known for meticulous and excellent investigative and forensic work. The Senate Guard's specialized division, the Senate Commandos, were the best of the Senate Guard. When not conducting police investigations or taking on secret missions for the Republic government, the Senate Commandos took a leading role in the protection of dignitaries and government property. The Senate Guards were a frequent sight in the halls of the Senate Building, their ceremonial uniforms and robes helping to blend in with the formal settings. In the waning days of the Republic, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine formed a personnel security detail, the Red Guard, who he favored over the Senate Guard. He additionally began to phase out the Senate Guard with the clone shock troopers of the Coruscant Guard. As Galactic Emperor, Palpatine disbanded the Senate Guard altogether and replaced them with his Emperor's Royal Guard and the Imperial stormtroopers, and to a lesser extent the Imperial Senate Guard and Imperial Senate Sentinels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Duties and organization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Senate Guard was an elite security force that was responsible for defending the Senators and Supreme Chancellors of the Galactic Republic. Centered on the galactic capital planet of Coruscant, the Senate Guard tradition went back thousands of years and it was as old as the Galactic Senate itself. Senate Guards were more than just bodyguards as they were also police officers. The distinctive and familiar blue armor and robes of the Guard served as symbols of both peace and security in Galactic City for which the Guard operated as a secondary police force. In order to protect the thousands of senators, the Guard was responsible not only for the Senate Building, but also the entire Senate District. Senate Guards would also be found on senatorial transports, in order to protect their charges, and conducting secretive government missions. Guards worked to protect senators from external threats such as assassinations but also from internal threats such as the bribery of senators which Guards had to report to their superiors. As time went on, the Senate Guard became a legacy system with several generations entering the service. Especially in the waning days of the Republic, the legacy system allowed corruption to breed such as senators paying their Guards to look the other way on criminal acts. This, despite the efforts of the loyal internal affairs department."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To become a Senate Guard, candidates would go through a full training program while those who had previous experience as planetary police officers would go through a shortened training program. Immediately after graduating, Guards were given the rank of private and generally assigned to the Senate Guard Headquarters where they processed prisoners and profiled suspects. Corporals were assigned to protect a prominent senator, a group of less prominent senators, or government VIPs. The sergeants handed out bodyguard detail assignments and provided security for the Grand Convocation Chamber which was overseen by the Sergeant at Arms. A lieutenant would oversee a squad, composed of two to four Guards. Commanders were responsible for task forces of six to eight guards. The leader of the Senate Guard was called the Captain of the Guard who answered to a Senate committee and officials in the Republic Judicial Department. The elite of the Senate Guards would become a part of the Senate Commando division, considered the best and bravest of the Guards. Led by a captain, the Senate Commandos were volunteers who were selected and had to undergo a grueling four week combat training program. Often they were called on to perform secret government missions or conducted police investigations. They wore armor that was more functional then their regular Guard counterparts."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Training and equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prospective recruits were cautiously selected from among the most respected law enforcement agencies in the galaxy. Part of the guidelines for selection involved the fact that all candidates must be superb combatants and that they be completely dedicated to the Galactic Republic. The candidates were trained at the Senate Guard Academy and upon graduation assigned to headquarters By the end of the Republic, membership in the Senate Guard increasingly became hereditary, with several generations of some families serving in their ranks. This meant that candidates were often dominated with family connections. However, acceptance was extended to distinguished members from recognized planetary law enforcement bodies. Should that be the case, these more experienced recruits often went through a shortened academy training program."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The most notable element of the Senate Guard was their symbolic blue robes and helmets. Their blue armor had remained as a trustworthy symbol of both peace and security of the Galactic Capital for thousands of years. The striking blue robes had another symbolic meaning of representing the supreme authority of the Senate along with its long tradition of a wise and just rule. In addition to the robes, the helmets had large crests and the uniform consisted of simple drapes but these were ceremonial rather than functional. In terms of weaponry, new guardsmen were often provided with ceremonial rifles that were distinctive, powerful and accurate. These weapons were noted for capable of firing a strong stun blast and while they were known for being primarily ceremonial, they saw increasing usage during the final years of the Republic. Should their mission or security demand it, guardsmen were known to discard their long weapons in order to be outfitted with more practical forms of weaponry. The Guard were given extensive blaster training and instructed in the use of Force pikes. They were also drilled in the Hijkata martial arts discipline. To get around the capital, Senate Guards used a speeder. When in more serious situations, the Guard used the heavily armed assault vehicle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among the facilities available, the Republic Guard used fully equipped and modern analysis laboratory's which were used to help them conduct their investigations.

The Senate Guard served as police force for Coruscant, but was secondary to the CSF which had primary jurisdiction of Galactic City. However, in cases involving the safety of senators, the Senate Guard also had primary jurisdiction. There were exceptions as the murder of Senator Onaconda Farr was investigated by the CSF, not the Senate Guard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among the skills that distinguished the Guard was their use of some of the best investigative and forensic work in capital. However, this had the effect of leading to some among the ranks of the Blue Guard to be distrustful of the Jedi as the Guard preferred to deal in cold hard facts. Thus, they often relied on the field of forensic evidence rather than rely on what they believed to be the mysticism of Force sorcery. As such, they were often at odds with the Jedi Order due to their less tangible methods of evidence gathering."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the coming of the Clone Wars the Coruscant Guard was formed to assist the CSF in securing the capitol. The clone shock troopers of the Coruscant Guard took over the responsibility of the Senate Guard as Coruscant's secondary police force which diminished the power of the Senate Guard.

The undercover informant sent in to investigate was discovered by the gang and held at a constructions site. The Senate Guard requested the assistance of the Jedi and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had also been investigating the Black Heth, to assist in the rescue the informant. Fighting his way through several Black Heth thugs, Kenobi was able to prevent the execution of the informant who was being questioned as to his true identity. The informant passed on to Kenobi that the Black Heth were importing large quantities of illegal weapons into Coruscant. Kenobi then took charge of the investigation, eventually tracking down and eliminating the smuggling operation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Separatist Crisis, the Guard was led by Jesra Loture.

The terrorists demanded that the Galactic Republic withdraw its forces and cease interference in the affairs of their homeworld, Haruun Kal.

However, Argyus had been contacted by Separatist leader Count Dooku and bribed into releasing the viceroy and returning him safely to Separatist space. Not wanting to be forever bound to Republic guardsmen duty, Argyus secretly changed allegiances. During the Tranquility's journey, the warship came under attack by vulture droids and three Droch-class boarding ships, which pierced the hull of the Tranquility, releasing a Separatist boarding party. Eventually, clone troopers under the leadership of Commander Gree destroyed the invading battle droids, but they had only been a distraction to allow Separatist assassin Asajj Ventress to infiltrate and cripple the Republic warship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ventress briefly rescued Gunray in the detention level, despite Argyus's conveyed attempt to prevent it. Ventress Force-pushed Argyus out of her way, intent on departing with the viceroy. The arrival of Jedi Master Luminara Unduli thwarted Gunray's escape, however, and forced Ventress to flee. Unduli pursued Ventress into the engine room of the Tranquility, leaving Ahsoka Tano, the Padawan of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, to guard the captive viceroy alongside Argyus, his commandos, and Gree. Argyus told the Padawan that following one's heart made them distinct from droids. At his urging, Tano went off to find Ventress, leaving Gunray under the watch of Argyus, his men, and Gree.

Argyus signaled Ventress to inform her of his success and he and Gunray made it to a docked Consular-class frigate, which they used to make their escape. Ventress, meanwhile, had eluded the Jedi and entered an escape pod, arriving aboard the escaping cruiser before reaching Separatist space. Argyus arrogantly gloated to Ventress about his mission's success, and that he had been responsible for Gunray's rescue.

Senate Guards accompanied Palpatine as the beast arrived under heavy guard. Doctor Sionver Boll, throughout the course of her examination of the beast, found that she couldn't remove the Zillo Beast's scales without harming it. On briefing Palpatine of this, he ordered her to kill it, angering the Zillo Beast. Later, during the attempted execution, the beast escaped from the facility and began a rampage across Coruscant. As alarms began wailing across Coruscant, orders were given for the Senate staff to evacuate to the lower levels.

As the shuttle left the docking bay, it was seized by the Zillo Beast. Skywalker cut the shuttle in half, loosening the passenger compartment from the beast's grip. However, the Commando and Palpatine were unable to jump from the falling shuttle. Upon it landing on the ground, the Zillo Beast noticed the Chancellor and the Commando and moved towards them just as R2-D2 arrived. Seeing the Zillo beast come towards them and knowing that R2-D2 could not carry both of them, the Commando forced Palpatine onto the droid to be carried to safety, sacrificing himself as the beast slammed its foot down on top of the shuttle's remains, killing the Commando.

Tano stood with the Senate Guards at the front of the room during the speech. It was at that point that she felt a disturbance in the Force. Rushing to the walkway above the room, Tano interrupted the bounty hunter Aurra Sing shortly before the assassin fired a shot at the senator. The shot struck Amidala in the arm, wounding her though not seriously. The Senate Guards rushed in to cover the Senator as Tano chased Sing. However she lost sight of the assassin. To set a trap for Sing, a droid was dressed up in Amidala's robes and entered the meeting room under a heavy Senate Commando guard force. Senate Commandos also swept the corridors and the walkways around the meeting room, ensuring that the area was secure. From her sleeping quarters, Amidala spoke through the droid using a comlink. However, Sing, realizing it was a trap, attempted to kill Amidala in her quarters. She was again interrupted by Tano who used her lightsaber to deflect the bolt.
