Following her assistance in bringing down Moff Kohl Seerdon, Moor retired from being an active member of Rogue Flight to be an advisor to Mon Mothma, Chief of the Rebel Alliance.

Moor and the 128th were so well regarded that both she and the squadron were mentioned as an example of what the best pilots and machines can do in the official Imperial Handbook: A Commander's Guide."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Her views on the Empire changed following the destruction of her home planet, Alderaan, by the first Death Star. After she was assigned to put down a rebel uprising on the planet Gerrard V, Kasan's TIE Interceptor's controls were damaged by repeated ion cannon blasts from Gold Squadron member Crix Madine. When Madine forced Moor to surrender herself, Moor admitted her quarrels with the ideals of the Empire, and offered defection to the Alliance."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Work with Rogue Squadron"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kasan was taken to Rebel service during the Liberation of Gerrard V by one of Crix Madine's Y-wings. Moor donated her TIE interceptor to the Alliance Fleet, and offered her knowledge of Imperial installations to Rogue Flight, led by Lieutenant Commander Luke Skywalker. Due to her knowledge and prowess as a starfighter pilot, Moor was inducted into the group as Rogue Seven. Her knowledge was used to lead a raid on an Imperial storage facility on the Jade Moon. Rogue pilot Wedge Antilles did not trust Moor, but Moor continued to prove her allegiance by assisting the Rogues in attacks on Balmorra and Kile II."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moor took part in the rescue of Antilles from the Imperial prisons on Kessel following his capture on Kile II. With the Rogues again at full strength, Moor assisted in attacks on Taloraan and Fest, raids which were aimed at reducing the resources of Imperial Moff Kohl Seerdon, who was amassing his forces for a massive attack on the Alliance's bacta supply on the jungle world Thyferra. She confronted Seerdon directly during Seerdon's retaliatory attack on Chandrila, homeworld of one of the Alliance's founders, Mon Mothma. Seerdon insisted that her defection to the Rebellion would be her undoing, and was a waste of her prowess. While Moor was intent on pursuing Seerdon, Luke Skywalker persuaded her otherwise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moor's knowledge led to another raid on Imperial territory, this time on the Capacitor on the volcanic planet of Sullust. Seerdon had used this raid to his advantage, and used the time that the Rebellion was focused on Sullust to achieve his goal of seizing the Alliance's supply of bacta on Thyferra. Moor took part in the battle to reclaim the bacta.
