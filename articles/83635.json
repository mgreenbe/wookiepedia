Lowwel was a thief who used a CS-12 Stun Master to incapacitate targets after infiltrating starships disguised as a merchant. After taking control of the vessel, Lowwel would take the ship to where some accomplices waited so they could plunder as much as possible. Since Lowwel used the contact stunner, none of the victims could identify their attacker, and the bountywas light because no one was killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lowwel also believed that weapons like the neuronic whip were cruel and had no reason to exist, and those that used them, like slavers, were evil. Lowwel made these views known on Gundark's Gear Datalog, and was challenged by the slaver Ellylyn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
