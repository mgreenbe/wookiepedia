Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa used one to secretly transport medical supplies for the Rebel Alliance but were intercepted by an Imperial Star Destroyer. As they tried to make the jump to hyperspace, the ship was damaged, and the craft traveled beyond the galaxy into the intergalactic void, where they encountered the living spacecraft known as Ship.
