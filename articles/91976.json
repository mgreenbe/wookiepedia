Its ecosystem included needlefishes and tumblebaskers amid seatree fronds. The region was sent beneath the surface of the ocean by a seaquake that occurred many centuries before the fall of the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Strangely for a region on Dac, the native Mon Calamari never wanted to build there any floating city. In fact, many Dac inhabitants considered that it was a sacred ground. Mon Calamaris believed that their species came of age on this chain, and that most of the island sank beneath the waves many centuries ago due to a seaquake. It was unclear why the other intelligent species of Dac, the Quarren, considered Mkbuto a sacred place. It was also unclear what the exact effect of this status was."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Mkbuto could provide important clues about Dac prehistory, it was analyzed for some years by archaeologists, looking for artifacts or building foundations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one particular moment, archaeologists discovered a planetary repulsor chamber like those on the Corellian system, beneath the sand of the largest Mkbuto island. This discovery, which would later reveal to be a poor fake, began attracting the attention of the media, including Kaminoan reporter Haum Do. It was soon obvious that a security increase was needed, and Colonel Guarran was chosen to protect the excavation site. It is believed that Mon Calamari bounty hunter Bringe was an assassin looking for Guarran."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Admiral Ackbar researched the tectonic plate activity on Mkbuto from a floating habitat some time after the Battle of Calamari.
