After the Valahari refused to stop selling advanced engines to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Republic established a blockade of the planet. Refusing to acknowledge the blockade, the planet's Viscount Harko Vane tried to break through with a convoy of freighters. The Jedi in charge of the blockade, Obi-Wan Kenobi did not want to resort to using the force, but Vane's freighter exploded in what looked like a Republic attack. In reality, his ship had been sabotaged by the CIS. Vane's death prompted his escort to open fire on the Republic forces, and after a brief fight, the battle ended. The Republic retained the blockade; however, the Valahari, believing the Republic responsible for Vane's death, joined the Confederacy and destroyed the blockade days later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
