Its population included individuals from a number of sentient species, such as Aqualish, Barabels, Bothans, Duros, Humans and Ishori. A short distance from a spaceport on the planet was a plaza that contained the Stand of Public Expression. The plaza was lined with paved pathways and flowerbeds, and was bordered by the Bothan-owned Solferin Shipping Company. In 19 ABY, Drend Navett, Klif and several other Imperial agitators instigated a riot against the Solferin Shipping Company, ostensibly in outrage at Bothan involvement in the Destruction of Caamas in 19 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
