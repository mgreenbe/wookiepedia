These sieges took place sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, but before the Battle of Hoth. The plan to invade Bestine and other cities throughout the galaxy was concocted by the Rebel Alliance, but was intercepted by Imperial Intelligence, allowing for the Empire to prepare a proper defense. The invasion culminated in a series of violent sieges between the two factions, resulting in a back and forth occupation of the capital throughout the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
