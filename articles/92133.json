Chiefly a military weapon, the CR-28 needed to be fired from a stable, unmoving platform, mounted on vehicles or fired from a tripod stand. It used a specialized fuel canister for ammunition. Though the weapon was reserved for close quarters, the effects were devastating. The flame cannon shot a large cone of fire 18 meters long and 12 meters wide at the terminus. Replacement tanks for the flame cannon cost 600 credits and weighed 20 kilograms each."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Czerka Arms produced a similar flame weapon, designated the CZ-28 Flamestrike flame cannon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Corporate Sector Authority mounted the CR-28 on ground vehicles for use in their brutal crowd control situations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
