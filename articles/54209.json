After the destruction of the starship Steady Wing around 232 BBY, the only survivors of the incident discovered that the shuttle they had escaped on had been sabotaged. During an ensuing discussion about whether the incident had been planned, the protocol droid J-6 sarcastically remarked to Jedi Padawan Imri Cantaros about the extremely low odds of both the Steady Wing having collided with an unknown object and the failure of multiple shuttle systems occurring simultaneously and offered to show him the math, asking how he was at Gherillian proofs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
