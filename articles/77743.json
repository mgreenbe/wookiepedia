They worked as pack hunters, moving silently and using body heat to track their prey, which they disabled with a single sting. Able to grow to a length of thirty centimeters, the kouhun had a segmented carapace and stingers on the front and rear of its body used to deliver venom produced by specialized glands within their body. Their venom was highly potent and particularly effective against humanoid species. Once injected, the venom was typically fatal within minutes. They crawled on multiple legs and could slink their way across almost any surface. Kouhuns were known for their ability to evade security. They could be used in assassination attempts and were starved before release. After their release, they typically headed straight for warm-blooded life forms. It was virtually impossible to trace them back to the user. They also seem to show some degree of intelligence, as when R2-D2 scanned Senator Amidala's bedroom, one kouhun hid under the bed and another hid in a space where it could not be discovered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bounty hunter Zam Wesell used a pair of kouhuns in her second attempt to assassinate Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala while on Coruscant. The creatures were given to her by her colleague Jango Fett, who felt that a more subtle approach would succeed in finally killing the senator. The creatures were loaded into a ASN courier droid, which flew to Amidala's apartment, cut through her bedroom window and quietly released the pair of deadly creatures into her room. The kouhuns fell onto the floor and started making their way to the sleeping Amidala's bed. When R2-D2, who was in the senator's room guarding her, detected something and turned on his lights to scan the room, the kouhuns froze. Once the droid went dark, they crawled up to where the senator slept. Anakin Skywalker, who was in the next room, was able to perceive through the Force that Amidala was in deadly peril. He quickly rushed into Amidala's chamber and deftly sliced the creatures in half with a couple swings of his lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
