The captain became injured at the bottom of a turbolift shaft, and with Arvad missing, the Deliverance's bridge was left without command. Syndulla, receiving no response upon contacting the bridge, hoped that the captain was merely at his station and out of contact; the general's aide, Stornvein, eventually reached the bridge and took charge. The captain died as a result of the attack, and Commander Arvad was subsequently promoted to fill his position."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that year, during the Battle of Jakku, Seedia revealed her actions to the New Republic pilot Wyl Lark, taking credit for the deaths that the attack had caused.
