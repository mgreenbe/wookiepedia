Since sea crabs reproduced so quickly, they had the potential to choke out the other creatures in the Tinallian seas without predation from the treshers. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, pollution had taken a toll on the tresher population. In response, the Tinallian government outlawed the hunting of treshers, in order to stave off the potential ecological disaster of a sea crab population explosion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
