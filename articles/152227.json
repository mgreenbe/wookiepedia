While there, he attempted to retain the attentions of the cantina's hostess Selbie, having wanted to get together with her. Upon the arrival of Pijal's Jedi Lord Regent Rael Averross, Selbie pulled away from the Chagrian to attend to him. The patron continued to vie for the hostess's company, starting an argument with Averross over his scruffy appearance. However, after the Jedi brandished his lightsaber, Selbie gleefully informed the patron that Averross was the ruling regent of the planet, which caused him to leave in embarrassment. The Chagrian possessed a massive figure, horns, and gray-blue skin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chagrian patron appeared in Master & Apprentice, a 2019 novel by Claudia Gray."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
