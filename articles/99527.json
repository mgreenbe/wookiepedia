These gunships were used as troop transports during planetary invasions in the Republic Dark Age and saw action during the invasion of Sarrassia. They were subsequently used to ferry Grumani Hierophants who had been enslaved by Odion's forces back to Odionate territory. They bore a significant superficial resemblance to the Galactic Republic's Low Altitude Assault Transport gunships which were used during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
