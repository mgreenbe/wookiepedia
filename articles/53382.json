The stations could then launch an attack, either alone (as their firepower equaled some capital ships), or in conjunction with Allegiance-class battlecruisers and other warships, which were tirelessly patrolling the system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to being part of the orbital defense, the Gauntlet stations also provided headquarters for Human officers to supervise the daily operation of the Byss Security Zone.
