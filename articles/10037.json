In addition to the Atrivis Day group, the convoy was composed of the Container Transport group Kempman, the Modular Conveyor group Altar Moon, the freighter group Rimrunner and eight other container ships.

However, upon reverting from hyperspace, it found the Organarms facility destroyed, the target of a lone Imperial Missile Boat, still in-system. This enemy craft was joined shortly after by the Imperial Strike-class medium cruiser Arjun. As the small Imperial craft moved to engage Atrivis Day 1 and its companion freighters, the rest of the convoy began to arrive in-system, beginning with a number of BTL Y-wing starfighters and Z-95 Headhunters from Red Squadron, who moved to attack the Imperial forces."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The role of the Atrivis Day 1 at this battle was later included in an Imperial simulation used to train pilots for the Missile Boat.

There, it appeared as an enemy vessel in the first simulator mission, training the player in the use of the Missile Boat. These simulator missions were based on in-universe historical missions. Consequently, the actual existence of the Atrivis Day 1 in canon is confirmed, but the specific outcome of the original engagement is not. Instead, the simulation allows the player to accomplish the mission to varying degrees of completeness. As the destruction of the Atrivis Day group is only a secondary goal for the player, the mission can be accomplished with or without their destruction, leaving uncertainty as to the ship's final in-universe fate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The name of this freighter is likely a nod to the Atrivis sector, a sector of the Outer Rim Territories known to be an early hotbed of Rebel activity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
