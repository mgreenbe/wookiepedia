The program's failure had helped to turn the Joint Chiefs away from using battle droids in the Imperial Military. Accordingly, the Phase II was a heavily-armored black and silver body suit worn by a human pilot. Its helmet featured a pair of glowing red lenses and an assault cannon was mounted on the left forearm. Phase II Dark Troopers were used to storm enemy defenses and several could be carried by a K79-S80 Imperial Troop Transport for deployment during combat operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, Phase II Dark Troopers were being evaluated by the Imperial Military and were deployed during the Battle for Tatooine. Ultimately, it was decided that the human pilot was the final weakness of the dark troopers, so the next generation returned the dark trooper to its combat droid roots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Phase II Dark Trooper first appeared in the Star Wars canon in the 2014 mobile game Star Wars: Commander, where its appearance was modeled after that of the purge trooper from the Star Wars Legends continuity.
