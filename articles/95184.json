They were among the most common \"bug\" weapons used by the Yuuzhan Vong, such as blast bugs and razor bugs. Its wings were very powerful, emitting a loud buzzing sound when active, and causing a distinctive \"thud\" when striking an object. A thud bug's maximum velocity could exceed 150 kilometers per hour, knocking an opponent to the ground or breaking limbs. Thud bugs could also be used in such a way so as to stun or disorient targets, making them easy prey for capture. Thud bugs had the ability to home in on their target, even turning corners. Masters of these weapons could cause the thud bug to return to their hand if they missed their target. Thud bugs shaped from sparkbees were the baseline for all such \"bug\" weapons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thud bugs could be killed with a lightsaber, but their sturdy exoskeletons usually could not be broken in normal combat. If a thud bug became lodged in the ground, it could free itself using its wings and legs. They could simply be thrown at their target or shot at foes using a thud bug launcher."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These biots served as the primary ranged weapon of the Yuuzhan Vong warrior.
