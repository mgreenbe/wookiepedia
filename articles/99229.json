Directly below this slim bar was the black ridged handgrip, which occupied the central third of the hilt. The activator was throttle-style, the same sort featured on Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber design. The covertec wheel was black held onto a rigged black extension.

Ventress held them both off, even attacking telekinetically, hurling some furniture at Kenobi, though he quickly cut it down with his blade. The Jedi began gaining ground on Ventress, forcing her to retreat to a library within the base. After a brief telekinetic struggle, they demanded her surrender, advancing on her. However, she reignited her twin lightsabers into the floor, causing it to collapse under the Jedi. Gloating over the two Jedi, she only prompted them to pursue. Retreating to an external ledge, she revealed the droid reinforcements landing outside.

Fortunately, the Separatist forces were routed and forced into retreat by the Clone heavy cannons, the one thing Slick didn't destroy. At that moment, the shuttle returned. However, instead of bringing supplies and reinforcements, it brought the Jedi Initiate, Ahsoka Tano, who had just been assigned as Skywalker's Padawan. To make things worse, the Separatist forces set up a massive deflector shield to protect their forces, slowly increasing the diameter as their troops advanced.

Kenobi casually cut it in two and blocked Ventress' second set of dual-overhands. Shoving her back, Kenobi quietly advanced, blocking her follow-up attack and engaging in a brief flurry of swordplay.

Enraged at her failure, Ventress attacked. Kenobi gave ground, holding off Ventress' whirling, double-ended weapon. Cutting Ventress' saberstaff in two with a swift overhand, Kenobi fended off her counter, jamming her twin blades into the rampart ledge. Taunting her, Kenobi then forced both of her blades vertical before hooking one out of her grip and off the rampart, at this point Ventress called for a Vulture droid to provide an escape. Kenobi easily held off her following attack, shoving her back. Raising his own blade to guard, he called for her surrender. Ventress instead leapt off the rampart, landing on the Vulture droid she had signalled earlier. Kenobi rejoined the clones outside, deflecting blaster volleys as he took cover.

After Skywalker led a daring bomber run of the Malevolence, disabling the ion cannon, Grievous was forced to retreat. However, in a bid to save the cruiser, Dooku revealed that Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala had been sent to the sector to negotiate with the Banking Clan, on a tip from Palpatine. Grievous captured her ship, and while she managed to escape the droids onboard, her presence forced the Republic battle group to break off its attack. Quietly approaching the Malevolence aboard Skywalker's personal vessel, the Twilight, the two boarded the heavy cruiser. Initial resistance was light, consisting of only two battle droids. Kenobi and Skywalker quickly cut them down. Making contact with Amidala, they went to rendezvous with her in the Malevolence's internal maglev chain. When Amidala arrived in the massive chamber, under fire from several battle droids, the two Jedi charged to her rescue. As they leapt from train to train, they got separated, Skywalker going after Amidala, while Kenobi went after her droid, C-3PO. However, Kenobi's efforts were foiled by the constantly moving trains.

Retreating back to the maglev hall, Kenobi was pursued along one of the trains by Grievous, who had drawn two of his own lightsabers. Using an overhead crane to swing around, Kenobi drop-kicked Grievous in the chest before reigniting his lightsaber. Grievous was quick to recover, hacking at Kenobi with dual-overhands. Kenobi initially bladelocked before shoving Grievous back and retreating towards the trains leading car.

This information pertained to a remote and unknown world known as Zigoola, a place that Organa's contact believed to be of great importance. Arriving at a secret space station out in Wild Space to meet her, they found the station had been attacked by an unknown assailant. Kenobi led the way, lightsaber ignited. Entering a command center on the station, they encountered three droideka reinforced by three human shooters gunning for Organa's contact. Kenobi deliberately made himself a target, drawing the fire of the three humans and two of the droids. As one of the droideka's shields began to fail, Kenobi focused his blast-deflections on it. Organa finished it off, and Kenobi leapt away from it as it exploded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, at that moment, two more men and another droid blasted their way in. While Organa took cover, Kenobi leapt about the cramped control center, lightsaber blazing. By the time he was done, all but one of the men were down.

Organa's contact, a woman named Alinta, was left severely wounded and dying. She managed to provide the location of Zigoola on a data crystal and asked that they destroy the station before expiring. Doing so, they journeyed to Zigoola, despite Kenobi's objections that they stop and consider their actions. As they neared the world, the profound Dark Side aura brought about by all the Sith artifacts on the planet overwhelmed Kenobi, compelling him to crash the ship. At the last moment, Kenobi broke free of the control and instead crash-landed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they traveled across the wastes towards the Sith temple on the planet in an effort to find a way off the world, the Sith spirits tortured Kenobi constantly. As they picked their way through a dying forest, the spirits conjured a vivid illusion, convincing him that he was fighting Asajj Ventress. Kenobi carved his way through the forest, attacking and defending against a non-existent opponent. Caught up in the fury of the vision, Kenobi even turned on Bail Organa. He attacked the senator, but managed to stop short of actually killing him. Dropping his lightsaber, Kenobi realized what had happened. Not wanting to take such a risk again, Kenobi left his lightsaber with Organa for safe keeping as they continued on. When they reached the temple, they found a Sith crystal that boosted telepathy, though it also effected Kenobi very strongly. Kenobi became reliant on physical pain to clear his mind, for it somehow silenced the Sith voices whispering in his head. He forced Organa to gently scorch Kenobi with his own lightsaber while the Jedi attempted to use the crystal. Kenobi got through, contacting Yoda, who sent rescue.

Returning Skywalker's lightsaber, which had been left with him for safe keeping, the two began searching the frigate for Dooku. Barging into the Count's meditation chamber, weapons drawn, they prepared to engage Dooku, all the while with their own warship attacking the frigate. Rather than fight, Dooku instead fled through a secret escape chute in the chamber, with Skywalker in pursuit. Kenobi arrived in the hangar just before Skywalker, just in time to see Dooku leave.

As the two began searching for a way out, Kenobi attempted to ignite his lightsaber to serve as a light source. However, it had been damaged in the cave-in, spluttering and dying in Kenobi's hands. At that moment, they were also set upon by a gundark living in the cave. While Anakin distracted the gundark, Kenobi began disassembling his lightsaber in an attempt to ascertain the damage.

Kenobi deflected the volleys fired at him and led two clones up close. The two clones tossed EMP grenades onto the wall, with a little telekinetic assistance from Kenobi, taking down the defenses. As they advanced through the village, the droids unleashed a pack of gutker on the droids. Kenobi initially drew his lightsaber, but seeing how the gutker were tearing apart the clones, he instead used a powerful Jedi mind trick to lure them into a dead end alley, leaping out while the clones blocked it off. Shortly afterwards, the scouts Kenobi had dispatched earlier rejoined the group, with a young Twi'lek girl in tow. The girl, Numa, led the clones through the tunnels and catacombs beneath Nabat to the droid base.

Flying through the flak and fire of the battle, they crash-landed onboard Grievous' cruiser, the Invisible Hand, where Palpatine was being held.

While Anakin's astrometrics droid, R2-D2, hacked the controls to get them moving again, Anakin himself cut a hole in the ceiling, intending to climb the shaft himself. R2 managed to get the lift going again, and Anakin reentered, surprising Kenobi, who brandished his lightsaber.

However, after a brief banter with the Count during a lull in the combat, Kenobi and Skywalker switched over suddenly to the advanced styles that they had practiced and mastered during the war. Dooku was forced to give ground. Unable to penetrate Kenobi's staunch defense, Dooku blasted him aside with a Force push to focus on Skywalker solely.

Obi-Wan brandished his lightsaber, but rather than engage the MagnaGuards, he instead crushed them with a large shipping container hanging from the ceiling. Quickly cutting down the one surviving droid, Kenobi advanced on Grievous. The bio-droid responded by splitting his arms into four and drawing all four of his lightsabers and advancing on the Jedi. Kenobi slowly retreated before jabbing his blade into Grievous's whirlwind. Two of Grievous' blades caught on Kenobi's, and the General pulled back. Kenobi unleashed a swift overhand and overleapt Grievous' counter, flanking him.
