However, in 2010, the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series episode \"ARC Troopers\" introduced another battle on Kamino. Due to the unestablished timeline of The Clone Wars, the date in which the \"ARC Troopers\" Kamino battle took place is not confirmed, thus conflicting with the Second Battle of Kamino's canonical name. Until a cohesive timeline is released, this article assumes that the name of the 20 BBY Mandalorian attack on Kamino is currently conjecture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
