When hyperspace routes were beginning to be opened up in the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace Disaster, the Journeyman departed Cerea with a load of mostly Cerean passengers. However, the hyperspace lane it travelled on had been prematurely opened, and it was struck by a piece of debris. The transport Vessel, carrying three Jedi passengers, happened upon the stricken Journeyman shortly after the accident, and the Jedi onboard assisted the evacuation of the starship before it exploded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
