The substance was produced the Ketes in their hive on the forest moon of Endor. The nectar was carried in small round containers known as nectar pearls which allowed the Ketes to easily stock the nectar within various storehouses inside the hive. Kete nectar was known for its use in the antidote to the powerful plant growth formula, and during the stranglethorn crisis, the two Ewoks, Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka and Wicket Wystri Warrick came to the Kete hive to obtain some of the prized nectar. It is unknown if this nectar was used as the source for honey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
