During the first campaigns of that conflict, the Nineteenth Army of the Republic Military was tasked with defending Noe'ha'on's vicinity against the military forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

The insectoids harvested and refined their homeworld's natural resources and manufactured rubber products, glues, spices, wood-fiber products, and specialty paper goods.

The Noehon weapons were usually inaccurate rapid-fire projectile devices."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Noe'ha'on was frequently visited by off-worlders, serving as a regular stopping point for several galactic merchants. Unscrupulous, independent interstellar traders introduced the natives to blasters and vibroweapons. As a result, Noehon tribal rivalries transformed into full-scale wars between the welds that would continue until one of the sides in the conflict was annihilated. Another effect of the inter-weld violence was that the reigning anarchy prevented the Noehons from ever developing space-flight technology of their own. However, the off-world visitors were willing to transport the Noehons off Noe'ha'on for a price, allowing a small fraction of the species to colonize other worlds in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A camp used by paleontologists was located near the fossil beds on Noe'ha'on.

If particularly successful, the companions would help the Sith develop an anti-k'lor'slug serum. With the 2016 Game Update 4.1, however, the text of the relevant mission was changed to instead state that \"Professor\" Skatheris was studying the dianoga creatures on Vodran.
