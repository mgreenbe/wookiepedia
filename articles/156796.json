Working alongside other members of the New Republic, the medic assisted former Emperor's Hand Mara Jade after the latter had awoken from an unconscious state caused by a recent battle. Assisted by an Emdee droid, the medic examined Jade's bandaged forehead with a medical scanning device since Jade had just awoken from neural reconstruction. As Jade was suffering from short-term memory loss, the medic assisted her by briefly telling the former Emperor's Hand what had happened during her stay in the hospital. The medic noted that Jade had been in a bacta tank and then had lain in a bed for just short of a month. After the medic informed Jade of what had happened, the former used a comlink to make certain that Jade's quarters in the palace were prepared for her. Shortly thereafter, Jade was taken to her room by Winter, a personal friend of New Republic official Leia Organa Solo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the time of Jade's visit to the hospital, the female medic was a middle-aged woman with fair skin who was professional in her work.
