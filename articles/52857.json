Orrelios regained his confidence by discovering that he was not the last Lasat. Later, Orrelios developed an unlikely friendship with his nominal enemy, the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Alexsandr Kallus, when the two were forced to work together to survive on the icy moon of Bahryn.

Zeb was enraged as the hallowed weapon was a badge of honor for members of the Lasan Honor Guard, who were also the only ones permitted to carry them, and viciously attacked the Imperial. Kallus revealed that not only had he personally murdered the Honor Guardsman whose bo-rifle he held, he had also taken part in the genocide of the Lasat species and given the order for the disruptors to be used, if possible making Zeb even more furious. Utilizing his emotion-laden attacks, Kallus soon gained the upper hand over the Lasat. Before Kallus could finish him off, Zeb was saved by Ezra who used the Force to push Kallus away from him. As a result of Ezra's actions, Zeb developed a better rapport with the young human. During the fighting, the rebels managed to destroy the T-7 disruptors and escape their Imperial pursuers.

During their flight, Zeb also fired on an Imperial gun turret. The Inquisitor also attempted to stop the rebels by hurling his lightsaber at them, but Kanan deflected its blow. After the Inquisitor retrieved his weapon, Zeb asked Kanan whether his lightsaber could spin in the same way as the Inquisitor's one.

When Rex joined the Rebels and began to be a more constant presence around the crew, Zeb would often joke around with the former clone captain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to his experiences during the Siege of Lasan, Zeb believed that he had failed to protect his people and the Lasan royal family. His guilt and shame led him to hide the fact that he had once been a Captain in the Lasan High Honor Guard from even his fellow rebels. Zeb was also skeptical of the supernatural and initially believed that the Lasat refuge of Lira San was a myth. Zeb was able to overcome his past guilt by fulfilling an ancient Lasat prophecy which involved him fulfilling three different roles: the \"Child,\" the \"Fool,\" and the \"Warrior.\" In the process, Zeb made a leap of faith by letting the Force guide his bo-rifle to Lira San."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zeb showed ingenuity when he used a stolen Imperial Troop Transport to ferry a stolen hyperdrive back to his rebel comrades. Later, Zeb showed initiative when he convinced his rebel comrades to board a Mining Guild ore crawler."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While a ferocious fighter, Zeb still valued honor and refused to fight a wounded opponent. Despite his antagonistic relationship with the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus, Zeb developed an unlikely friendship with him during a mission to Geonosis. He realized that Kallus was not the monster that he had grown to hate and that the Imperial agent also valued honor. Zeb's warmth towards Kallus was also helped by the two nominal adversaries teaming up to survive the cold and several bonzami monsters while stranded on the ice moon of Bahryn. Zeb's encounter with Kallus made him realize that not all Imperials were evil."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his valor, Zeb hated insects, and had a fear of the large krykna creatures that inhabited Atollon. In missions, Zeb was a team player who accepted his leader's instructions. After Ezra's recon mission on Reklam Station when awry, Zeb offered to shoulder the responsibility until Hera clarified that it was Ezra's responsibility. Zeb regarded the Iron Squadron as a na\u00efve bunch of Ezra-like wannabees who did not understand what they were fighting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zeb had a low opinion of the pirate Hondo Ohnaka due to his slippery and double-dealing nature. He distrusted the pirate and regarded Hondo as a liar after learning that Hondo had omitted certain facts during a recovery mission on the planet Wynkahthu: that he had lost most of his Ugnaught crew during an earlier recovery attempt. Zeb's contempt for Ohnaka was best reflected when he threatened to rip off the Weequay's arms and insisted that the rebels' cargo of proton bombs precede Hondo and his companion Azmorigan's treasure. Despite his dislike for Azmorigan, Zeb's concern for his team's well-being led him to search for the Jablogian. When Ezra questioned his leadership of the mission, Zeb insisted that it was his turn since Ezra had led previous missions. Despite his leadership role, Zeb still deferred to Captain Syndulla."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a warrior, Zeb was initially disappointed when he was unable to attend a training exercise because Captain Syndulla needed someone to guard Chopper Base. While Zeb was annoyed by AP-5's jokes about him and the inventory droid's fastidious attention to detail, he still respected AP-5's ingenious plan to reprogram a captured E-XD infiltrator droid as a time bomb against the Empire. By working with Chopper and AP-5 to defeat the Infiltrator Droid EXD-9, Zeb and AP-5 gained a better respect for each other. Zeb admired AP-5's wit and ingenuity while AP-5 came to admire his martial prowess and abilities. Zeb was also known for his good sense of humor during difficult times, such as at the Battle of Atollon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zeb was overcome by grief and rage following the death of Kanan during a mission to rescue Hera. Seeking revenge against the Empire, he and Sabine decided to sabotage the Imperial victory parade. Zeb and Sabine subsequently discovered that Kanan's death had not been in vain because the explosion that claimed his life dealt a severe blow to Imperial military production on Lothal. Zeb almost killed the Noghri tracker Rukh but relented at the urging of Sabine, who spared his life but spray-painted the Imperial tracker. While Zeb was initially skeptical about the Spectres' mission to save the Lothal Jedi Temple, he insisted that they continue with their mission despite learning that the Emperor was interested in the excavation site."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zeb was able to work as a team with his rebel comrades during an operation to trap Governor Pryce and an assault on the \"Dome\" during the Liberation of Lothal. Zeb's hatred of the Empire and Rukh led him to laugh as Rukh was electrocuted after the shields at the Dome were restored. Following the Battle of Endor, Zeb's friendship with his former foe Kallus led them to travel together to Lira San, the original homeworld of the Lasat people where the species still thrived."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Lasat, Zeb possessed strength, agility, and reflexes superior to any human, being able to ragdoll many stormtroopers, perform astounding jumps and leaps, move the Ghost's dorsal turret from outside the ship with his bare hands, and briefly contend with and push back the equally physically strong Fifth Brother, all with little effort, though he was eventually defeated by the Brother."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He was also strong enough to lift and carry other sentient beings like Chava, Ezra Bridger, or Kallus. While stranded on Bahryn, Zeb demonstrated considerable skill in climbing out of an icy cave while carrying Kallus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zeb was also strong enough to take on the Imperial Infiltrator Droid EXD-9. He could also take considerable punishment at the hands of the powerful recon droid. Zeb was also strong enough to single-handedly hold a hyperdrive unit in one hand while clinging onto rocks at the same time. Zeb used his physical strength to subdue the Mining Guild captain Seevor. Later, Zeb acquitted himself well against the Mining Guild overseer Proach, who wielded an electro-whip. Despite being outmaneuvered by his more wily and agile opponent, Zeb used his strength and brute force to defeat his opponent. Zeb felt pain when stung by the electro-whip but managed to shake Proach off and hold on long enough for Kanan to rescue him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zeb was fearsome in hand-to-hand combat mostly because of his physiology and would have beat Rukh to death in their first encounter had Sabine not intervened. During the liberation of Lothal, Zeb used his prehensile legs to pry open the blast doors to the Dome's upper level and later to trap Rukh's leg against two metal bars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a member of the Lasat Honor Guard, Zeb was a skilled fighter who was trained in the art of the bo-rifle. Due to his large physique and combat skills, Zeb served as the \"muscle\" of the small Lothalian rebel cell. He enjoyed fighting and beating up stormtroopers. While Zeb was unable to match the Force powers of the two Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister, he was able to rescue his companions Ezra and Sabine by luring them and their captors to a hangar bay where they made a quick escape in their shuttle, the Phantom. Zeb's combat skills led him to pride himself as a warrior, and he took offense at being called a child or fool."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite not having any formal training, Orrelios turned out to be a skilled pilot, on one occasion stealing an Imperial TIE fighter and teaching himself to fly it. On this single joyride, Orrelios managed to hover, spin, fire the cannons, fly sideways, and land without causing any damage to the craft. Orrelios and Bridger had to land in order to clean off the canopy, which had been covered in fruit juices. After taking off again, Orrelios attacked an Imperial prisoner transport convoy, and rescued Ezra Bridger by flying inverted with his head and arms dangling out of the open cockpit, and controlling the yoke with his feet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his combat abilities, Zeb was no match for the Force powers of the former Sith Maul, who easily bested Zeb and his comrades. Zeb was also a competent tactician who worked with the former Imperial inventory droid AP-5 to plan a mission to evacuate cargo from a derelict Imperial cargo ship. He was also familiar with technology such as grappling hooks and magnetic cables."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Zeb and Sabine were outmatched by Rukh's cloaking device, the two were able to work together to defeat him.

They went to the Ghost and rescued the young orphan. Bridger then suggested they charge the Star Destroyer's bridge and hide behind it, and eventually the warship jumped to hyperspace. At another time, the Ghost was damaged by a Star Destroyer, forcing it to go to a space station for repairs. Orrelios and Jarrus left in escape pods and made it to a planet.
