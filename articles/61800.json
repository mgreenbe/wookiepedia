The name was based on Holdo's sacrifice during the First Order's attack on the Resistance navy, which consisted of Holdo ramming the cruiser Raddus against the Supremacy at lightspeed to buy the surviving Resistance members time to escape to Crait. One year after the Battle of Crait, Beaumont Kin proposed to use the Holdo maneuver against the Sith Eternal fleet, but the former stormtrooper Finn dismissed it as a \"one-in-a-million\" shot. The maneuver, however, was later used to destroy a First Order vessel above the forest moon of Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the sole remaining member of the crew of the Raddus after ordering all others to join the Resistance transports ferrying survivors to the surface of Crait, Vice Admiral Holdo performed this maneuver in an effort to force the pursuing First Order fleet to halt its attack. Powering up the hyperdrive, she brought the Raddus about to directly face the Supremacy, at the head of the First Order fleet. This was initially dismissed by General Hux as a transparent attempt to draw their attention away from the fleeing transports; by the time he realised Holdo's intent and ordered the fleet to turn its fire upon the Raddus, it was too late to stop her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Holdo initiated her hyperspace jump, and at the short distance between her and her target, the Raddus was still in realspace when it collided with the Supremacy. While the ship itself was destroyed in the impact, the energy of the Raddus' experimental deflector shield continued on at near lightspeed, ripped through the Supremacy and sheared off its entire starboard wing, and destroyed twenty other Star Destroyers that were in escort around it and docked in its internal hangars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Holdo maneuver first appeared in the 2017 film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, the second installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy.
