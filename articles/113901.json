Renna started to have issues with her security forces due to this. When one particularly brazen theft occurred in her own compound by thieves wearing her (stolen) security uniforms, one of the pirates, Lars, was captured by a group of strangers. Renna was so impressed with them over her own security forces, she offered them jobs. Those strangers ended up bringing down the pirates and recovering some of the stolen goods."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Renna capitalized on the troubles the Metatheran Cartel experienced a few months later, as the group she had hired proved instrumental in revealing Velin Wir's rogue activities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Renna was involved in a news investigation soon afterward due to the rapid growth of her business.
