The weapon was not designed primarily for offensive use, and, against stationary targets that were reasonably well-armored, it lacked the velocity to cause significant damage. However, when fired at objects that were moving extremely quickly, the combined velocities could do extreme damage to the moving foe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This tactic was used by Jadthu pilots during the Battle of Haruun Kal, where it proved highly effective against the masses of fast-moving Vulture droid starfighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A caltrop is a small spike that can be dropped on the ground and will pierce the feet of people or animals that step on it or the tires of cars that move over it.
