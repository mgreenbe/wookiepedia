In 4 ABY, Mothma considered traveling to the Alliance-friendly world of Durkteel to lure the Galactic Empire away from an impending attack in the Endor system. Underholt, however, objected that Mothma should not risk it, stating that the ruse would work just as well if she, her closest aide, went to Durkteel with bodyguards and a detachment of soldiers. However, the mission did not go as planned, and Underholt died when the Empire bombed Durkteel's Tak-Beam complex."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hendri Underholt was a dark-skinned female human with black hair.
