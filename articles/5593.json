Theron accompanied the Commander to a meeting that was arranged for them by SCORPIO with a false promise of high-yield explosives. Traveling to the Spire on Zakuul, Theron and the Commander found Firebrand at an abandoned tram station, attacked by Skytroopers led by Security Commander Towen Sor. Dispatching her attackers, they approached Firebrand, who turned the blaster on her rescuers and introduced herself as Kaliyo Djannis. She agreed to consider the Commander's proposal in exchange for assistance with her current operation, and Theron let them go through with it, departing to meet a contact of his own. Together, the Commander and Kaliyo rigged ion grenades into Power Junctions 353, 754 and K-H82 throughout the Old World and Breaktown. Along the way, Kaliyo claimed that her only goal was to hit the Overwatch, from which the Commander could obtain the complete schematics of the Spire. Afterwards, the two went to wait in Kaliyo's apartment, detonating all three junctions at once during the power grid cycle, which knocked down the Overwatch security. They traveled to Overwatch in Kaliyo's speeder and stormed the facility, eventually reaching the control room where Kaliyo planted her explosives at the droid controls while the Commander downloaded the Spire's schematics. Overwatch Administrator Tayvor Slen arrived with the skytroopers and attempted to stop them, but was defeated and mortally wounded during the fight. Before he passed away, Kaliyo mocked Tayvor's attempts to manipulate her and revealed that she used his daughter Alianna Slen to plant explosives around the city. Kaliyo then revealed to the Commander that she intended to not only shut down the droids, but also set off dozens of explosives around the Spire that would cause a mass panic and throw the Spire into chaos. The Commander convinced Kaliyo not to hurt the innocents and destroy only the droid controls, after which the two escaped the Spire and the Knights of Zakuul that arrived to stop them.

While sniping off Skytroopers, Jorgan asked the Commander about their opinion on the Eternal Emperor Arcann before explaining how the Republic was descending into tyranny and decadence under ex-Chancellor Leontyne Saresh and her puppet Jebevel Madon. Witnessing civilians fleeing from skytroopers, Jorgan and the Commander rescued a group of Zakuulan exiles and stopped the droids from burning their homes before meeting with their leader Pashna Veyaad. Unwilling to leave civilians behind, Jorgan radioed ahead and ordered Havoc to prepare their camp for the refugees, while clearing the path for them alongside the Commander.

After the Commander defeated her in battle, \"Vaylin\" disappeared, revealed to be nothing more than an illusion. Marr and Satele then explained that the illusion was a warning signifying that Arcann and Vaylin had an army at their command. Marr stated that Commander's current weapon was insufficient, and the Commander realized that all the items they collected were to construct a new weapon. The Commander proceeded to create it at a nearby altar, infused with pure Force energy. Marr proclaimed that the new weapon would overpower Arcann and unite the galaxy, but cautioned that leading the Alliance was far different than the Commander's previous role in the Galactic War.
