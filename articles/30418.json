For a time, Davin served as a Journeyman Protector, one of Concord Dawn's respected constables, and acquired experience in special forces operations. However, by the year 30 BBY, Davin had ended his career with the Protectors and answered the call of Jango Fett to become one of the Cuy'val Dar, a one-hundred-person group recruited by the veteran Mandalorian soldier to train the clone commandos of the Galactic Republic's Grand Army on Kamino. Though he was among the non-Mandalorian minority within the Cuy'val Dar, like the others, he disappeared from the known galaxy at Fett's request, and trained the clone soldiers assigned to him for close to a decade, until their deployment at the Battle of Geonosis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the outbreak of the Clone Wars at Geonosis, a conflict waged between the Galactic Republic and the Separatists of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Davin stayed on as clone training sergeant, assisting the Kaminoan cloners with the instruction of new Advanced Recon Commandos and clone commanders as part of an advanced learning program instituted by ARC trooper Alpha-17. Among Davin's trainees was CC-1138, known by the nickname \"Bacara.\" From Davin, Bacara learned the ways of the Journeyman Protectors, coming to think of himself as a enforcer of law and order. Davin also taught Bacara the Concordian dialect, and came to view the early graduate of the commander training program as one of his most successful students."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cort Davin was first introduced to Star Wars canon in the Guide to the Grand Army of the Republic, a Star Wars Insider article authored by Karen Traviss and Ryan Kaufman, and published in September of 2005 as part of the magazine's eighty-forth issue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his blog on StarWars.com, Ryan Kaufman revealed that he had named Davin after a character his childhood friend created in his youth, back when the two had played together with their Star Wars action figures."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
