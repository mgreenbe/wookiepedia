It was where many krayt dragons went to die. The bones of hundreds of these creatures littered the valley floor. When an aged krayt sensed death approaching, it instinctively began the arduous journey to this resting place. Tatooine settlers long wondered where these creatures went to die.

None were known to have returned."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The scientists Dusque Mistflier and Tendau Nandon explored the graveyard during the Galactic Civil War and managed to find a krayt dragon egg."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
