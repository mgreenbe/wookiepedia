A Star Tours-owned StarSpeeder 1000, having escaped from an Imperial-conducted raid at Spaceport THX1138, eventually got involved in the conflict just after escaping the station with a Rebel spy onboard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The skirmish"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Chewbacca had returned to the planet Kashyyyk to aid in freeing his people. Using a Raddaugh Gnasp fluttercraft, Chewbacca ended up pursued by a squad of at least two Imperial scout troopers on 74-Z speeder bikes. A Star Tours-owned StarSpeeder 1000 spacecraft, having earlier escaped from the Imperials due to a raid commenced on Spaceport THX1138, inadvertently got involved in the chase. The fluttercraft was eventually shot down by the scout troopers, sending Chewbacca flying onto the StarSpeeder behind them. Although Chewbacca attempted to climb up, he slipped and fell onto the ground, although he ultimately survived. Eventually, the scout troopers broke off from the chase, both due to the StarSpeeder unexpectedly appearing behind them, and having already accomplished their objective anyway. The StarSpeeder eventually made its way to a Wookiee tree city before departing from Kashyyyk as a Wookiee on a watchtower bid them farewell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mission is based on a scenario from the ride Star Tours: The Adventures Continue, which featured the use of the StarSpeeder 1000 ST-1401. Because of the nature of the ride, the skirmish on Kashyyyk is issued randomly, although it is always the middle portion of the ride. In large part because of the random nature of the ride, the StarSpeeder 1000's flight number is not given in the article."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The segment was added in as a request by Walt Disney Imagineering principle creative advisor and chief creative officer of Disney & Pixar Animation John Lasseter. In addition, the Wookiee that hit the windshield of the StarSpeeder 1000 was not identified in the ride itself, but was identified via various Disney promotional materials as Chewbacca, the co-pilot of the Millennium Falcon. In addition, Chewbacca ramming the window of the StarSpeeder 1000 was one of the few aspects, if not the only aspect of the ride to require live-action stunt work in the primarily-holographic ride."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
