A vicious series of battles, it was believed, in fact, by the wider galaxy that everyone on the planet of Carnelion IV had destroyed themselves in the fighting. The planet was surrounded by a dense debris field which made entry by any vessel extremely difficult. In fact, a civil war continued to rage, yet the destruction of technology caused by the war meant that nobody involved with the war had the technical means to contact the outside galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Open and Closed were bitter enemies who blamed each other for the conflict. The Closed blamed the Open for poisoning their world and cities with the Celadon Sea. By contrast, the Open blamed the Closed for starting the war and claimed that they were the only ones preventing the planet from falling into chaos. The two factions fought each other with airships, some of the few remaining technology still functioning on Carnelion IV. What little technology that remained was salvaged from Carnelion's ruined cities.

Hoping to enlist the Jedi's help in destroying the adult Open and Closed so that she could reeducate the young, Sera sent a communications signal to the Jedi Order using a faulty transmitter she had managed to reactivate.

In the midst of the battle, Skywalker arrived with Kolara and the other Open youth. Despite Sera's pleas, the Open youth joined their older brethren in the fight.
