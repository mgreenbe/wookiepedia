This resistance fighter joined in the fight. When Naboo's Queen, Amidala returned to the planet after her exile, she rounded up all the surviving officers to plan the end of the war. The Gungan Grand Army would draw out the main part of the Trade Federation Droid Army while the Queen led a ground assault of the capital city of Theed to capture the Viceroy. This resistance fighter was stationed at a resistance outpost on the Great Grass Plains. The Trade Federation sent the Army B to flank the Plains and attack the Gungans, but the army engaged the outpost instead. The resistance fighter ordered her outpost to get ready to fight. Two spacer allies of the Security Forces, Nym and Vana Sage were on hand to protect the outpost. The resistance fighter kept up a running commentary while the two spacers engaged Army B. The base was being overrun when two more pilots showed up to protect the base. The combined firepower drove off the attacking vehicles and starfighters. The resistance fighter then thanked the pilots as they flew off."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This resistance fighter appeared in the video game Star Wars: Starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
