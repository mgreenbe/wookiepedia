The sport was practiced in the garbage pits of the Lower City. Contestants competed in unique, individually-made pit racers, gliders in which they descended the garbage pits to the lowest levels, where they collected scales from the backs of garbage worms.

The pair immediately began to make plans once more to move to Felacat, and Venco himself said that he would foot the bill for their departure. First, however, Venco asked Reymet to repay him for his kindness with a small favor\u2014the access codes known only to Senate Guards. Reymet, not fully aware of his uncle's past, was impressed by Venco's generosity, and agreed to his stipulations. As Reymet's codes had been invalidated due to his suspension from the Academy, he gave Venco his father's access codes, which Autem was unaware that his son knew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon, Reymet was confronted by his father while packing to leave with Siao, and he was made aware of the full breadth of Venco's sins; the planning of two assassinations, one completed and one still in motion, in order to bench the Financial Reform Act that sought to prevent the Galactic Republic from tearing apart.
