It was a compact twin-seated scout craft used to patrol the dangerous lower levels of the jungles of Kashyyyk, as well as for rescue missions. The vehicle had no armor and relied on speed and agility to avoid enemy fire, though it was fitted with a rear-mounted laser cannon operated by the vehicle's gunner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Raddaugh Gnasp was developed as a civil security patrol vessel, and was commonly used in recon missions and perimeter scans in the dangerous underbrush of Kashyyyk's forests.
