The amnesiac Dark Lord of the Sith Revan, who had crashed on Taris, encountered Gorton Colu preaching his speciesism.

Colu is not involved in any essential parts of the game's plot, so whether or not Revan conversed with him is ambiguous. If Revan does engage the man, he can either agree completely with Colu's message or call him crazy. Revan later has two non-Humans join his party, the Wookiee Zaalbar and the Twi'lek Mission Vao, and should Revan talk to Colu while either of them is walking with him, Colu will chide Revan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
