In fact, Phasma's skill with traditional melee weapons was a marker of her primitive past."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 34 ABY, when the cruiser Raddus activated its hyperdrive and destroyed a great part of the Supremacy, Phasma used her baton to fight against Finn after many of her men were either incapacitated or killed in the destruction caused by the Resistance ship. Finn, on the other hand, used a Z6 riot control baton of a deceased stormtrooper to combat Phasma. During the battle, despite Phasma's ability with the baton, Finn was able to ultimately strike her down with his weapon, incapacitating her long enough for the ground below her to collapse, sending the baton to a fiery fall.
