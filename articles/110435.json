Because memories were made of RNA, it was thought that this virus would enable the Galactic Empire to brainwash anyone they wished, which was self-propagating and would destroy any chance of a rebellion. Though the researchers were screened for Rebel sympathies, they were so horrified by the implications of the research that they destroyed the project and defected to the Rebel Alliance. A datatape containing their research turned up in an auction aboard the Ananuru Express and, though Imperial Intelligence agent Secesh Trant attempted to steal it, it was recovered by a group of Rebels. It was thought to have then been destroyed so it could never fall into the wrong hands."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
