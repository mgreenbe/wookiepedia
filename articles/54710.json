He used it to combat the Galactic Empire. The army consisted of OOM-series battle droids, B1s, B2s, Droidekas and MagnaGuards. In response, Darth Vader sent the 501st Legion to assassinate him and shut down his entire operation. In the Battle of Mustafar, the droids were deactivated and the factory was destroyed, making sure no more could be manufactured."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to the droid army, Dellso developed a new Confederate infantry prototype.
