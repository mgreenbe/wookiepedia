It could also be referred to as an Observation dome, Observation blister, or Observation platform.

The observation deck was fundamentally a form of passive sensor collection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Notable locations include the Emperor's throne room on board the first and second Death Star, the surgery suite on board the Redemption, and the General's quarters atop of the Wizard's Tower on board the Invisible Hand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
