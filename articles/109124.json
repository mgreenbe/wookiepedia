He was a mysterious individual, showing up only when it suited him (usually for high profit deals or for amusement value), and always in disguise. His most common appearances were as a young man, an older man, or an aged crone, but he once disguised himself as a Cerean. The way he was typically identified was that he would wear a cutting of a ny'yosin bush. Endac was very serious while conducting business, and had no patience for those who cracked jokes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
