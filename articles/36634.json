She attempted to use her looks to seduce the mark, but he realized her plan almost immediately and attacked her with a flamethrower. Suffering burns to the left side of her scalp and losing much of her hair, Netal still managed to draw a knife from each of her boots and kill the competitor, going on to successfully steal what Kloda had sent her for. She later told the spy-in-training Orri Tenro about her encounter with the competitor in order to teach him the importance of remaining unseen while on a job."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The competitor was first mentioned, but not named, in the short story \"The Perfect Weapon\", which was written by Delilah S.
