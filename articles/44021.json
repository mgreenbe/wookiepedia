However, the Emperor was opposed by the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython, who had broken free of the Emperor's mental control and joined forces with the former Emperor's Wrath Lord Scourge after the Sith revealed the Emperor's plans. With aid from the rest of the Jedi Order, the Republic Military, and the Hero's own crew, the Knight foiled the Emperor's agents on Belsavis, Voss, and Corellia, freeing the other Jedi under the Emperor's control in the process. After learning of the Emperor's location on the Imperial capital of Dromund Kaas, the Hero infiltrated the Dark Temple on the planet while the Republic fleet engaged the Imperial Navy above the Dromund Kaas, and in a final battle the Knight managed to strike down the Sith ruler and seemingly end the threat he posed to the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
