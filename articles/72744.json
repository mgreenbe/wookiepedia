Lang attempted to intimidate him with his threatening demeanor. By using Jedi mind tricks, Jinn was able to discover from Lang that he had been hired as an assassin by Jabba the Hutt to capture podrace competitor Teemto Pagalies to be fed to the sarlacc, minutes before the race began. By giving Lang the wrong coordinates of Teemto, Master Jinn saved the Podracer's life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another possible ending is that Qui-Gon Jinn could kill Lang for his evil deed. Jinn could also give Lang accurate information about Teemto Pagalies, sealing the racer's fate. This is non-canon, given the fact that Pagalies indeed participated in the podrace in the film. The player can also intimidate Lang into showing Jinn respect, instead of using mind tricks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
