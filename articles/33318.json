He was the son of Xelian, a female Sith Lord who was connected to Chagras, the titular ruler of the Hegemony. His mother Xelian openly favored him over his older brother, Odion, breeding an intense sibling rivalry between the two brothers who hated and sought to defeat each other.

Baradium was a volatile compound used in the production of munitions. The Jedi launched Operation Influx in an attempt to disrupt the transportation of baradium to the frontline. The Jedi mission ended disastrously due to a raid on Chelloa by Odion, who had also intercepted intelligence on the baradium leaks.

These factors worked into Daiman's schemes of trapping Odion on Chelloa and using kinetic corruptors to ignite the planet's surface. While Daiman succeeded in destroying a large part of Odion's army, he failed to kill either Odion or Kerra, who had managed to evacuate much of the population on a makeshift fleet of transports known as the Freedom Fleet.

Daiman planned to lure Odion's ground forces onto the volcanic planet where they would be bombarded by his artillery cannons. However, their grandmother and family matriarch Vilia Calimondra intervened and convinced the two brothers to put aside their difference and attack Lord Bactra, since he had outlived his usefulness to the Calimondra family. Following the collapse of the Bactranate, Daiman and Odion were both present during the family Bequest. Tensions between the two brothers flared after Daiman was bequeathed the company Industrial Heuristics, leaving Odion with the Bactranate capital of Jutrand.

Zodoh was able to exploit Sith rivalries by persuading the other Sith Lords to harry Daiman's forces while Zodoh himself assailed Daiman's worlds. Odion personally took advantage of his younger brother's misfortunes by keeping Daiman's forces spread thin across the borders while Zodoh assailed the Daimanate. Daiman also lost control of Aquilaris Minor to Kerra and the Republic's Grace Command, a special paramilitary relief agency that was covertly distributing the narcotic Deluge within Sith territory as a means of undermining the Republic's enemies. Daiman was nearly brought to the brink of defeat at Zodoh's hands during the Battle of Darkknell when the Hutt's fleet of Stormdrivers flooded his capital of Xakrea.

However, Odion was merely seeking to overthrow Daiman and establish himself as the ruler of the Grumani sector. Thus, he sought to harness the dark side powers of the Helm of Ieldis, an ancient Sith relic capable of driving sentient beings into a mindless killing frenzy. Ultimately, Odion would be defeated through the efforts of Kerra and Odion's second-in-command General Beld Yulan, which ended in the death of Odion and the destruction of the Helm.

Odion alleged that he constantly suffered excruciating headaches throughout his life from the moment that Daiman was born. While Xelian constantly mistreated and ignored Odion, she spoiled and pampered her younger son Daiman, which caused him to develop a grandiose worldview of himself as the \"Creator of the Universe\" with the power of life and death over other sentient beings.

The sibling rivalry between Daiman and Odion was further aggravated by their grandmother Vilia Calimondra, a Sith Lord who ruled extensive territories within the Chagras Hegemony. She promised to bequeath her empire to the heir that conquered the most territory. During the Republic Dark Age, the weakened Galactic Republic had abandoned much of the outlying territories to the various Sith Lords and retreated to a safety cordon behind the Colonies. This left much of the galaxy in anarchy with rival Sith dynasties battling for supremacy. Xelian's actions led to a series of feudal conflicts between her descendants known as the Charge Matrica.

However while Treece planned to disrupt the shipping operations and liberate the slaves, Odion desired to exploit Chelloa's baradium ores to fuel his war forge The Spike. The Jedi were assisted by Gorlan Palladane, a field agent who worked as the leader of Daiman's slave workers. Despite initial successes in infiltrating the transport hub at Oranessan during the initial phase of Operation Influx, the entire Jedi team with the exception of the female Jedi Knight Kerra Holt was wiped out during a raid by Odion's forces on Jenith Spaceport.

Palladane pleaded for help in treating the wounded but Daiman was more concerned with discerning how his rival Odion and the Jedi discovered his secret baradium mining operations. When Palladane expressed his ignorance of the matter, Daiman used Force choke to strangle the former. However, Kerra intervened and tried to force Daiman to stop tormenting Palladane at gunpoint. Amused by her courage and dismissing her as an orphan, Daiman relinquished his grip on Palladane and fondled with her, making obscene gestures.

Earlier, Skodo had been found with a transmitter which he and Palladane had used to contact Odion with information about Daiman's baradium operations.

To distract Holt, he then revealed that his brother Odion was preparing a second attack and that Odion had a mobile space station known as The Spike which was capable of producing various arsenal particularly kinetic corruptors.

Meanwhile, Palladane chanced upon Skodo's house and found Daiman's transmitter in his hiding place. Unaware that Daiman had tampered with the real transmitter, Palladane contacted Odion and attempted to get him to leave Chelloa by claiming there were no more baradium mines.

When Daiman threatened to take his life back, Palladane begged for mercy. Daiman also delved into his narcissistic philosophy of himself being the Creator of the universe. After interrogating Palladane about the Jedi infiltrator Kerra, he spared and released Palladane on the grounds that Palladane had unwittingly played into his greater plans to defeat Odion.

Odion now intended to seize the pyramid complexes and requisition them for his own war effort. Daiman deployed a disposable contingent of his own troops and vehicles to provide some token resistance.

His more realistic and skeptical subordinate then counteracted that the mountain was not listening. Daiman manage to evacuate his forces from Chelloa prior to its apocalyptic destruction and then went to Nilash III, a planet within Daimanate space. There, he discovered from Uleeta that the Freedom Fleet had recently passed by and raided the munition plant. Kerra and her followers liberated the slaves and stole a high-powered laser to disrupt Daiman's war effort. This laser was used for cutting cortosis during the manufacturing process. Daiman instructed Uleeta to keep news of Holt's raid a secret and instead propagated the myth of her demise on Chelloa.

However, Daiman's Correctors were able to sense through the Force that he was concealing something in his mind. Daiman himself interrogated Narsk and through mind-reading found out that Kerra was on Darkknell.

In response, Bactra claimed to have no prior knowledge of the strike, or any recognition of the Bothan spy who had been partially responsible for the loss of the research facility.

Daiman's aide Uleeta suspected that Bactra planned to destroy the Vellas Pavo facilities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Secondly, Daiman contacted several independent mercenaries and convinced them to set up an ambush on Gazzari.

Odion's forces would then invade Gazzari and the mercenaries would hold them at bay until Daiman's regular forces and attack fleet emerged from hyperspace.

Rusher also explained that only 'autonomous forces' like himself understood the complexities of operating an artillery brigade; also adding that the complexities of Daiman's galaxy meant that it was difficult for lesser beings to cope.

Daiman blamed Zodoh for the illicit supply of Deluge spice that have crippled his princedom and mocked Zodoh's Stormdrivers concept due to their reliance on a massive data processor for coordinating planetary strikes. Daiman then had his rival executed with a miniaturized Stormdriver which drained the moisture out of the Hutt.

With Daiman's acquiescence, she was able to infiltrate Tergamenion disguised as a factory worker. Tergamenion was a bleak factory world and police state that was controlled by a highly-efficient security apparatus of holograms which allowed Daiman to monitor his subjects' every movements and conversations.

Glenk went missing following the invasion of Sarrassia and returned to his master to report his intelligence findings. He revealed that the Helm was located on Skarpos, a bleak desert planet which had been recently annexed by Odion.

Since Odion's acquisition of the Helm challenged the balance of power within the Grumani Sector, Calimondra rallied her family to prepare for a military assault on the Odionate.
