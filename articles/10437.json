One of them accompanied Duum's chief of security Sabat to the moon of Cavamina Minor to hunt the Jedi Knight Aayla Secura after Secura crashed her starfighter. While fleeing Sabat's armed gang, Secura was rescued by the Force-sensitive Shon-Ju. Shon-Ju confronted Sabat, and attacked Sabat's men when the latter refused to back down. Jumping over Sabat, Shon-Ju channeled the Force through his hands to dismantle the droid. Fearing for his life, Sabat escaped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Secura collapsed from her injuries, and she was taken to Shon-Ju's castle to recover. After she woke, she recruited Shon-Ju's help in arresting Duum. The next morning, they stole two of Sabat's abandoned ships and infiltrated Duum's base. Shon-Ju deliberately tripped the alarm to be captured and brought to Duum. The alarm alerted Duum's security force to their presences; armed guards and one of these droids. Secura Force-pushed the guards and used her lightsaber to destroy the droid. Sabat took Shon-Ju hostage and Secura surrendered. The two Force-sensitives were put in bonds, and two droids were stationed nearby. Shon-Ju used his Force-powers to break free and destroy the droids. He then went off to kill Duum. Secura also broke free to stop Shon-Ju, allowing Duum to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These droids appear in the 2010 graphic novella The Clone Wars: Deadly Hands of Shon-Ju."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
