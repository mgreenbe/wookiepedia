They were edible by humans, and according to Devaronian chef Torro Sbazzle, were liked by everyone in the galaxy. When Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian unexpectedly asked Sbazzle to prepare dinner for Darth Vader on Cloud City, she made dumplings. Her version used midnight-hued pastry flour and zaffa oil for the dumpling casings which were baked before adding a filling of three finely diced jogan fruits and cheese. They were finished off by frying them, dunking them in sticky honey-wine, and garnishing the tops with candied rind. She considered making them with bantha butter instead of zaffa oil before deciding she would not make a bland dish for what may have been the last meal she ever cooked."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dumplings appeared in \"But What Does He Eat?,\" a short story written by S.A.
