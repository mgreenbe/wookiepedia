The bay was oval-shapped and included a small office and a set of fusion generators. During the time of the Galactic Republic, the Clawdite Prit Kessek landed her transport Skinchanger to Docking Bay 117, to collect a shipment of credits that she had been hired to take to the planet Zygerria on the behalf of the shipping magnate Brevis Taug. However, Kessek and her second-in-command Kloofus were attacked in the bay by a group of agents who were investigating the transfer of Taug's funds. The agents seized control of the Skinchanger and subsequently departed from Bazarre in it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
