Within a couple of years, Moff Bandor was installed by Emperor Palpatine to bring order to the planet, which he accomplished with widespread arrests and speedy executions. He then promoted the planet's preexisting criminal tyrants to official positions of power, enabling them to continue their reigns of terror."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Late in the Galactic Civil War, a trompa went berserk during a parade honoring Bandor's birthday. The reason for the creature's rampage turned out to be Bandor's Hurlothrumbic Generator, a fear-generating device constructed in secret on Questal under Bandor's order. A group of Rebel operatives were on hand to subdue the trompa, minimizing loss of life and property damage. The same operatives eventually defeated Bandor and disabled the generator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Moff Bandor's Palace"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Designed to imitate the Imperial City style of architecture, Moff Bandor's palace stood out as a huge collection of sharp ebony spires located in the center of Gralleenya, Questal's capital.
