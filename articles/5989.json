Their skin tones ranged from light blue to deep indigo, and their hair color ranged from pure white to purple to black. Originally a group of wandering nomads, they developed a society that placed great importance on the development of one's self and spirituality. Through artistic expression and cultural awareness, Altiri focused on expanding their knowledge of the universe by peaceful, scientific means. They were perpetually warring with the planet's other native sentient species, the Anarrians. Most Altiri spoke Basic in addition to their native tongue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
