Cham. The ship itself was painted in a pearlescent white color with fluorescent pink and green headlights. The inside of the ship was retrofitted for Cham's job as a HoloNet News presenter with a camera set on the top of the cockpit and an editing suite in the cargo area. The ship was used by Cham to transport a group of Rebels into the Cynestra Space Craft Show by hiding them inside cargo, which was unloaded on the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
