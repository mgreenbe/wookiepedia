It featured an equatorial belt of islands as well as a polar region with mountains and glaciers. By 4000 BBY, the planet was the site of the Truuine Jedi Praxeum, a training facility established by Jedi Master Mroon Jassa. Around that time, the Gotal Kith Kark visited Truuine and encountered Jassa, which eventually led to the former taking up Jedi studies at the Praxeum. During the reign of the Galactic Empire millennia later, Truuine's islands were home to Karkarodon and Patrolian settlers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Truuine was the only planet located within the Truuine system. Orbiting at least one sun, the planet constituted a part of the regions known as the Inner Rim and the Slice.

Shortly after their arrival, the trainees met the Gotal male Kith Kark, who had come to visit Truuine on a sightseeing trip. The group of apprentices, joined by Kark, then traveled to Jassa's training compound. The Jedi Master welcomed the students but not Kark, whom he refused to train as a Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The offended Kark left Truuine, but he returned a year later after extensively studying Jedi-related texts and documents. However, Jassa once again rejected the Gotal. Leaving Truuine for the second time, Kark spent the following year trying to understand what he had missed in his studies that had led Jassa to reject him. Eventually, the Gotal realized that his mistake had been viewing the studying and use of the Force as a vocation instead of a duty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once again returning to Truuine, Kark used his revelation to finally convince Jassa that he was ready to begin training as a Jedi. The Gotal trainee studied on Truuine for a year until Jassa was called away on an assignment elsewhere, leading Kark and the other apprentices of the Praxeum to leave to finish their training on the Outer Rim Territories planet Ossus."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Lost history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point after the establishment of the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, the information broker Amara mentioned Truuine on a private shadowfeed.
