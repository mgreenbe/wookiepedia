Gianna married a man named Kendrel who had trained on Korriban as a Sith but failed in his training and ended up serving a Hutt on Nal Hutta. The pair had son named Zi'am, who was also Force-sensitive and Gianna wished for him to be trained on Korriban to become a Sith so he could succeed where his father had failed. Kendrel, however, did not want his son to face the trials of the Sith world and attempted to flee Hutta with the boy, traveling to the spaceport in the town of Jiguuna. Having learned of her husband's plan, Gianna asked an Imperial-aligned individual to bring back her son. The individual agreed to carry out the task and found Kendrel in the spaceport. After defying the individual's request to send his son to Korriban, Kendrel was killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gianna was a female Human who lived during the Cold War. Some time before 3643 BBY, Gianna married a man named Kendrel, who had trained on the planet Korriban to become Sith and serve the Empire. He failed his trials and fled before the Sith could kill him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Instead of serving the Empire, he came to serve a Hutt on the planet Nal Hutta. The pair had a son despite this humiliation and named him Zi'am. When they discovered the boy was Force-sensitive like his father, Gianna wanted to send him to Korriban so he too could train to serve the Empire as a Sith. Kendrel, however, refused to allow his son to go through the same terrible experience he had training as a Sith and so took the boy and attempted to flee with him. The pair reached the spaceport in the industrial town of Jiguuna, where they arranged to travel off-planet. However, a comm officer named Mekks, who worked at the spaceport, recognized the pair and informed the boy's mother since he owed her a favor. Gianna then traveled to a cantina in Jiguuna called the Poison Pit, where she sought help to retrieve her son."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gianna eventually approached an Imperial-aligned individual and asked that they help her retrieve her son. She offered to reward them for returning Zi'am and claimed she was willing to give them everything she had if they helped. The individual agreed and before they left for the spaceport Gianna warned them that Kendrel might not give up the boy peacefully."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The individual found Mekks in the spaceport, and the comm officer called over Kendrel and Zi'am. Once the individual explained why they were there, Kendrel refused to hand over the boy as he didn't want to risk his son's death in the Sith trials. The father asked that the individual let them flee and tell Gianna they had gone to Korriban so she wouldn't search for them. The individual refused and shot Kendrel, killing him before before he could react. After his father's death, Zi'am fled home to his mother, although visibly upset by his father's death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon the individual's return, Gianna thanked them for retrieving her son and informed them that he would soon be sent to Korriban. She stated that she didn't care what had happened to her husband but that Zi'am's grief and hatred of her due to his father's death would help him to become a strong Sith. She then paid the individual 30 credits for their work. Gianna then sent Zi'am to Korriban, as she had planned to, where he came under the tutelage of a Sith overseer named Harkun."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gianna cared deeply for her son Zi'am and was willing to give up all she owned for him to be returned to her from her husband. She believed that he was talented in the Force and would one day grow up to be a strong and powerful Sith who could defend her. Gianna was willing to have Zi'am hate her for her involvement in her husband's death and was not upset by her son's grief, as she believed both would make him stronger. She cared little for her husband Kendrel and thought him a failure and a coward due to the fact he did not complete his training on Korriban. She considered that their marriage had been dead for a number of years prior to Kendrel's actual death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gianna first appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, which was released by BioWare and LucasArts in 2011, voiced by Adrienne Wilkinson. She is involved in the quest \"Dreams of Korriban\" on Hutta, where she asks the player to retrieve her son from her husband. The player has a choice to either allow Kendrel and Zi'am to flee once they reach the spaceport (light side) or to kill Kendrel and return his son to his mother (dark side). If the player chooses to allow the pair to flee, the only options when returning to Gianna are to lie, saying that her son was taken to Korriban. This article assumes that the player chose to take the \"dark side\" option and killed Kendral due to the fact only Imperial characters of the Bounty Hunter or Imperial Agent class can undertake this quest. This is due to its location on Nal Hutta, which Republic players cannot access. If the player kills Kendrel, then they will receive a message from Overseer Harkun, informing them that Zi'am is now training on Korriban, and rewards the player with 13 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
