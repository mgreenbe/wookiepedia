During the reign of the Galactic Empire an Ithorian populated area known as Hammertown was located in the city. In 3 BBY,[source?] it was the site of a duel between the Spectres, Ahsoka Tano, and the Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The domes and steeples seen on many of the buildings in Takobo City resemble that of real-life traditional Eastern Orthodox architecture found in Russia and some of its neighboring countries; likewise, the pattern seen several times on Takobo and used by some of its inhabitants (such as the one that Alora is swaddled in) bears a strong resemblance to the folkloristic designs often found on embroidery and regional costumes in Poland and Belarus. These facts, combined with the tower block laden landscape of Hammertown akin to the cities of Ukraine and other Eastern European countries, suggest that the planet of Takobo was heavily inspired by aesthetics of the Slavonic nations. Its climate also seems to resemble the Siberian tundra of North Russia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
