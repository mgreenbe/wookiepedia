Responsible for assisting the Queen with everyday tasks, they also served as her bodyguards and those chosen to join the entourage often closely resembled the current queen, allowing them to function as decoys should the need arise. The tradition of using handmaidens as protection and security for royal leaders originated generations prior to the Invasion of Naboo, during more uncertain times."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Naboo Royal Handmaidens assisted the sovereign with everyday tasks including hair, makeup, and clothing. However, handmaidens were often trusted by their monarchs as close friends in addition to playing important security roles as bodyguards, which required working closely with the Royal Naboo Security Forces. Each handmaiden was trained in self-defense and marksmanship and would carry a small blaster pistol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Reviving the tradition"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tradition of royal leaders using handmaidens as bodyguards and protection originated generations before the Invasion of Naboo, during more uncertain times. Handmaidens had fallen into history prior to the election of Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, but Captain Panaka proposed reviving practice. It was Panaka's intention to choose one girl who had a close physical appearance to the queen, allowing the handmaiden to pose as Amidala and serve as her decoy while the true sovereign would be in disguise. Amidala disliked other people being at risk for her own safety, but she suggested that multiple handmaidens would better serve to hide her amongst their numbers. Several of those selected as her handmaidens had features in common with their queen, allowing for more than one to potentially take her place, but one in particular would be her primary decoy. Five young women were chosen and adopted names similar to Padm\u00e9's own: Eirta\u00e9, Rab\u00e9, Sab\u00e9, Sach\u00e9, and Yan\u00e9."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amidala's handmaidens were trained in defense and security by Panaka. They wore matching hooded outfits in order to conceal their identities, with billowing cloaks that allowed them to conceal weapons used to defend the queen in case of an attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Panaka led Amidala's security team during the Invasion of Naboo. During the crisis, Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala frequently exchanged places with Sab\u00e9, who posed as the Queen in her makeup and black traveling gown while the real Amidala dressed in the same flame-colored robes as her handmaidens. The deception allowed the \"handmaiden\" Padm\u00e9 to escort the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn into Mos Espa in a simple guise when her party was stranded on Tatooine, while her decoy remained on the royal starship. Two other handmaidens, Eirta\u00e9 and Rab\u00e9, also escorted Amidala to Tatooine as well as Coruscant, and watched as she plead Naboo's case to the Galactic Senate. Rab\u00e9 also helped to deceive Anakin Skywalker into thinking that Padm\u00e9 was out on an errand while she was actually present in the room as Queen Amidala. Later on the queen's return to Naboo, they were reunited with Yan\u00e9 and Sach\u00e9. The handmaidens took part in the mission to re-capture the Royal Palace from the Trade Federation. Sab\u00e9 stood in as the decoy queen in her royal battle dress, playing a major role in the success of the operation after Amidala was captured."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Senator's handmaidens"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Amidala became a Senator representing Naboo in the Republic Senate, handmaidens continued to assist her and serve as decoys when needed, though not to the same extent as when she was queen. Prior to the start of the Clone Wars, the handmaiden Cord\u00e9 served as Amidala's decoy but was killed along with the handmaiden Vers\u00e9 in an assassination attempt aimed at the senator. Amidala shared private tears with a handmaiden named Duja over Cord\u00e9's death. A handmaiden named Dorm\u00e9 witnessed a second assassination attempt on her mistress, and expressed concern when Amidala was ordered by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to return to Naboo under Jedi protection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, following a Separatist terror attack on Coruscant, a handmaiden named Teckla Minnau spoke with Amidala about the effects that the Republic's military spending were having on her family and other families like hers. Shortly after, Amidala delivered a speech to the Senate inspired by her words, which defeated a bill to increase military spending and order more clone troopers. Later, escorting Senator Amidala on a mission to Scipio, Teckla was killed by the bounty hunter Embo while detonating a charge to grant Amidala access to the InterGalactic Banking Clan's Main Vault."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the end of the conflict, another handmaiden named Mote\u00e9 was present in the Galactic Senate Chamber when Palpatine declared himself Emperor."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The tradition continues"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amidala's successor, R\u00e9illata, was an older queen who brought with her several handmaidens around her own age, as well as a younger handmaiden, her niece. Her eventual successor Jamillia, was also attended to by a cadre of handmaidens, and Queen Apailana was escorted by her own handmaidens during Amidala's funeral."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the death of Emperor Palpatine, two royal handmaidens were present in a meeting between Queen Sosha Soruna and her guest, Princess Leia Organa. They later helped Soruna dress into her flight suit as she prepared to pilot an N-1 starfighter to protect the planet from an Imperial attempt to render Naboo inhospitable, code named Operation: Cinder. When Captain Korro suggested one of the handmaidens take Soruna's place, the queen replied that she could never ask her handmaidens to make a sacrifice she would not make herself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Naboo Royal Handmaidens first appeared in the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, the first installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The concept of a handmaiden decoy originated in George Lucas's rough draft to Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, where two handmaidens named Alana and Mina accompanied Leia to the Chatos Academy.
