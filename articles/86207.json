Although they rejected the violent ways of their ancestors, the pacifist New Mandalorians placed a cubist mural depicting the crusaders doing battle with Jedi below the throne room balcony on the outside of the royal palace that overlooked the main square in their capital city of Sundari on the planet Mandalore. A similar mural of a single crusader slaying a Jedi and being fired upon by an individual wielding a blaster pistol was located in the dining hall of the governmental complex on Mandalore's moon of Concordia. According to the Qel-Droma Epics, at one point the Mandalorian Crusaders served under the command of the fallen Jedi Knight Ulic Qel-Droma out of the Iron Citadel on Empress Teta, and rode Basilisk war droids into combat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A mural depicting the Mandalorian crusaders first appeared in \"The Mandalore Plot,\" the twelfth episode of the canon animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars' second season.
