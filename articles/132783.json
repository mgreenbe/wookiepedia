They come upon a mysterious floating city, and soon discover that the city is the psychic creation of the long lost Rebel hero Cody Sunn-Childe. Sunn-Childe turned his back on his violent past years ago when he discovered this powerful mystical ability, and so created his City of Dreams to live with his friends in peace away from the Galactic Civil War. Calrissian rejects Sunn-Childe's views claiming that there are times that violence is necessary and he proceeds to repair the Falcon to leave Sunn-Childe's paradise. But before he can depart a fleet of Imperial Star Destroyer attack the city after finding an opening in the dimensional fabric. Under the command of Captain Plikk, they drain their power in their attack on the city, and though Sunn-Childe could easily demolish the fleet with his power, he decides to hold to his pacifist beliefs and allow himself and his city to be destroyed. Calrissian leaves the Imperial fleet stranded in the other dimension as punishment for destroying Sunn-Childe's dream."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This story's writer, J.M. DeMatteis, originally had Lando Calrissian accept Cody Sunn-Childe's pacifist views, but Lucasfilm overruled him and had Marvel Comics change the ending so that Lando decried Sunn-Childe's views as wrong. The writer strongly disagreed with this change, and had his name taken off the project, choosing instead the pseudonym Wally Lombego. The unedited version was published in issue #141 of Marvel UK  Its later reprint in The Empire Strikes Back Annual #2 and Dark Horse collections is of the U.S. version."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
