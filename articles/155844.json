The hunter accompanied Veldar to Neral's moon in search of the gambler and smuggler Lando Calrissian, who owed Veldar a debt. The bounty hunter confronted Calrissian within Ne'eda's Tower, where the gambler was being escorted by a Wookiee Stalwart of the crime lord Ne'eda Frip. The Wookiee began to argue with the bounty hunter over Calrissian, who escaped while they were distracted. The hunter pursued Calrissian once he realized his target had vanished, and Calrissian used a hold-out blaster to shoot him in the leg and wrist, knocking him to the ground."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
