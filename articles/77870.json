During a four-day battle against Imperial forces, Kral was wounded in the stomach. Lying on a stretcher, he encountered his fianc\u00e9e during a retreat; initially, she would not leave him until he pointed out that he could not walk, they could not spare the men to carry him, and that he had a painkiller with him to survive until the Empire picked him up.
