Treasure Ship Row was located there. Despite its reputation as Corellia's most dangerous area, given the high crime rate, it was where most offworlders tended to visit. Its name derived from Blue Sky Boulevard, the main road leading into it from downtown. Blue Sector was dotted with cantinas, tattoo parlors, fences, casinos, flophouses, brothels, and pawn shops. A large junkyard on the outskirts of Blue Sector was referred to by the locals as \"The Pit,\" where it was rumored that \"organic drop-offs\" were buried alongside metal scrap and chemical waste."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
