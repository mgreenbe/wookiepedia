To that end, the Republic established Glid Station, a clone trooper outpost built within a massive ice spire. But the Separatists too had established a temporary base on the surface, and all this activity aggravated the planet's native Talz. They attacked the newcomers, wiping out both the Republic and Separatist outposts and leaving no survivors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic sent a task force to investigate, led by Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, assisted by a squad of clone cold assault troopers. The Pantoran side was represented by the Chairman Chi Cho and Senator Riyo Chuchi. Upon entering the Glid Station Cho believed that the Separatists had attacked the outpost, but the Jedi have investigated the disappearance of their troopers and discovered the village of the native Talz. The Republic forces continued to use Glid Station as their base for a short time, but after the One-Day War, Senator Riyo Chuchi, backed by the Pantoran Assembly, ceded ownership of Orto Plutonia to the Talz, allowing them sovereignty over the planet. She withdrew both the Republic and Pantoran presence from the world, leaving the Talz free to live their lives, and the Glid Station was abandoned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
