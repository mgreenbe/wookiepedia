It was a far more difficult and esoteric power than the Sense-based instinctive astrogation. Instead of feeling out the correct path and related equations, Jedi would use the Force to enhance their mental abilities, allowing them to calculate the incredibly complex mathematical equations of hyperspace navigation in their heads. This was mostly used as a meditation and training activity, as the task was so difficult that even Jedi were prone to potentially deadly mistakes. It was known only to the most theoretically-minded of Jedi, including the Jedi mathematician Hart Daele. Daele wrote a doctoral thesis on this ability proving that the high-order equations could be solved or, under special situations, approximated using standard Jedi meditation techniques."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
