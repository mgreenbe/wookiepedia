After the death of his neighbors, the veteran Mandalorian soldier Novoc Vevut adopted their young orphaned son, Ghes Orade, in Mandalorian tradition. Vevut raised Orade, and the two lived together at Vevut's home and workshop in Keldabe, Mandalore's capital city. In the year 40 ABY, Orade met Mirta Gev\u2014granddaughter of the current reigning Mand'alor, Boba Fett\u2014and the two began a relationship that led to the pair getting married. The wedding marked the initiation of Gev into the Vevut clan, and the celebration following their private marriage ceremony was held at the clan's Keldabe home."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Living in Keldabe, the capital city of the planet Mandalore, the Mandalorian soldier Novoc Vevut owned a home that doubled as a workshop where he crafted and repaired weapons. At some point in time, Vevut's neighbors died, leaving their young son Ghes Orade orphaned. Vevut had known the boy his whole life, and with his parents dead, decided to adopt Orade in the Mandalorian tradition. The two did not get off to a pleasant start to their relationship, finding it difficult to accept each other in their new roles. In time, though, Vevut and Orade eventually grew closer. Vevut taught and trained Orade, and guided him through his verd'goten, the traditional right of passage in Mandalorian culture that marked a coming of legal age."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 40 ABY, both Novoc Vevut and his son, Ghes Orade, were called to the planet Drall, located in the Core's Corellian system. There, the two met with Mand'alor Boba Fett\u2014leader of the Mandalorian clans\u2014at the local cantina known as Zerria's Bar, to discuss an offer from Corellia's President Thrackan Sal-Solo, who sought to enlist Mandalorian aid in defending Centerpoint Station against any attack from the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. Neither Vevut or Orade was enthusiastic about Sal-Solo's offer, and they soon departed the negotiation table in order to engage in a game of Cheg with a female bounty hunter that was later revealed to be Fett's estranged granddaughter, Mirta Gev. Following their initial meeting at the cantina on Drall, Orade and Gev began to develope a romantic relationship, and in need of a place to stay following the death of her mother, Ailyn Vel, Gev came to live with the Vevut clan at their Keldabe home. As time went on, Orade and Gev's relationship grew more serious, and Gev took to wearing the traditional golden sigils of Clan Vevut on her Mandalorian armor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Mandalorians were contracted by Imperial Admiral Natasi Daala, Vevut, Orade, and Gev all took part in the Second Battle of Fondor against the forces of the Sith Lord Darth Caedus. During the engagement, Orade piloted one of Mandalore's new Tra'kad-class transports, while Gev and Vevut boarded the Turbulent-class Star Destroyer Bloodfin. Gev gravely wounded Caedus' Sith apprentice, Tahiri Veila, with a stab to the leg, impressing Vevut with her combat ferocity. In the aftermath of the battle and the victory against Darth Caedus, the Mandalorian commandos returned to Mandalore, where Gev and Orade were wed in a private marriage ceremony. Vevut subsequently threw a celebratory feast at their Keldabe home, happy to welcome Gev into the ranks of Clan Vevut."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clan Vevut members Novoc Vevut and Ghes Orade were first pictured in the Star Wars Insider article, The Mandalorians: People and Culture, written by Karen Traviss and illustrated by Tom Hodges.
