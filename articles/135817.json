Unlike a conventional blaster pistol, it did not have a muzzle orifice; the end of its barrel was an antenna-like stub. A stingbeam was a powerful weapon, extremely lethal at close quarters, but it had a very short effective range. Most were capable of only a very limited number of shots (typically five) before recharging; when not at point-blank range, these shots acted as stun blasts, unless the wielder chose to use all the charges for one extra-strong blast. The stingbeam made a piercing, whistling noise when fired, and each shot left the weapon hot to the touch."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lando Calrissian armed himself with a five-shot stingbeam during his time in the Centrality.
