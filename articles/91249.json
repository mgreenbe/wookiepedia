Pilot Wedge Antilles and three others were sent to Gobindi to investigate the Mah Dala Infirmary for Imperial activity. The Empire blockaded the planet shortly after the Rebels arrived, claiming there was heavy pirate activity in the area and labeling the four Rebels as wanted pirates. With help from teenagers Tash and Zak Arranda, the Rebels discovered that the infirmary was a front for the Imperial Biological Weapons Division, which was producing a deadly virus, and successfully put an end to the project."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
