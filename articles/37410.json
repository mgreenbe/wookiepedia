Representing the struggles and desperation of the film's protagonists, the  leitmotif is rhythmically unstable. It is developed from The Force Awakens's tension motif, and in The Rise of Skywalker, the motif is in turn developed into the \"Anthem of Evil.\" The tension motif itself shares similarities with the motif representing the Grand Army of the Republic featured in the Attack of the Clones track \"The Arena.\""}]}
