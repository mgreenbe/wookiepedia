It was governed by the Grand Hutt Council, whose members were the heads of the five Hutt families. The Clan itself was one of the members of the five syndicates. During the Clone Wars, the clan aligned itself with the Galactic Republic, and briefly with Darth Maul's criminal empire, the Shadow Collective. During the Galactic Civil War, they clashed on multiple occasions with a group of mercenaries operating on the planet Tatooine, and established an alliance with the Galactic Empire. Following the death of Jabba Desilijic Tiure and the fall of the Empire, Hutt power waned significantly, allowing other criminal organizations to flourish in its absence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The High Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the era of the High Republic, the Hutt Clan was not blind to the danger the swell of peace and prosperity spreading across the galaxy was for their ambitions. They plotted with a leader of the Directorate, Lord Isamer, in 257 BBY[source?] to reduce the influence of the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order in the Directorate's region of space. This plan triggered the Eiram\u2013E'ronoh crisis, which successfully collapsed the Directorate as had been the Hutt plan all along. They now had no major criminal rival in the region, opening the path for future operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Twenty-five years later,[source?] a ship of the Hutt Cartel arrived on the planet Sedri Minor to fulfill an agreed-upon bargain, which would supposedly deliver the colonists from tyranny."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fall of the Republic"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Before the Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the final days of the Republic Era, Jabba Desilijic Tiure and his fellow Hutts were known to preside over Tatooine's podraces. Notably during the Invasion of Naboo, Jabba was present when the human slave Anakin Skywalker won the Boonta Eve Classic in what was considered a monumentous event. Jabba was also possibly at the event for business, as a hologram image depicting Jabba paying bounty hunter Aurra Sing after the crash of podracer Neva Kee was acquired by police inspector Tan Divo. The image displayed two of Jabba's henchmen pulling Kee out of his podracer. All identifying authentimarks were scrubbed from the hologram, so it was unclear if it was legitimate. If it was true, it suggested Sing and Jabba had a hand in what happened to Kee. Divo also developed a theory that Farwan & Glott, the original manufacturers of Kee's podracer, had hired Sing so that they could acquire the racer's customization secrets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the Separatist Crisis, the influence of the Hutts was great enough to warrant a political faction of the Galactic Senate of the Galactic Republic, the Militarists, to advocate for a standing, centralized military to check Hutt expansion, pirates and organized crime.

The chaos of the war allowed the Hutts to seize opportunities it provided to expand their influence to the far reaches of the galaxy. In particular, the Hutts extended Hutt Space from its traditional holdings in the Outer Rim all the way into the Expansion Region to the edge of the Mid Rim. With Republic forces busy engaging Separatist forces elsewhere, it was left to inadequate local system governments to defend themselves against Hutt influence. However, much of the Hutts territorial expansion was itself contained by large swatches of Separatist space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Also during the war, the Black Sun and Pyke Syndicate were considered rivals to the Hutt Clan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Early into the war, Rotta, the son of Jabba, was secretly kidnapped by the Separatists, orchestrated by the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus with help from Jabba's uncle Ziro. The plot was meant to discredit the Jedi Order and scuttle negotiations between the Republic and the Hutts, but the Jedi were able to rescue Rotta from the Separatists. The crime lord had promised his support to whomever returned his son, and when the Separatists and Jabba's uncle, Ziro, were revealed to have orchestrated Rotta's kidnapping, Jabba pledged his support to the Republic. This allowed the Republic to navigate essential Hutt hyperspace lanes and circumvent Separatist space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At another point in the war, the Hutt Clan hired bounty hunter Cad Bane to get information on the Senate Building on Coruscant. After gaining the information, the Grand Hutt Council hired Bane to free Ziro the Hutt before he revealed the Council's records, which were kept in a holodiary on Teth, to the Republic Senate. Thus, there was a hostage crisis that took place at the Senate Office Building on Coruscant, in which bounty hunters led by Bane held the Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine of the Galactic Republic and other senators hostage in order to free Ziro from the Central Detention Center. Ziro, with the help of Bane, escaped from the custody of the Galactic Republic. However, two Jedi\u2014Quinlan Vos and Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2014 found him dead on Teth after he was killed by his lover Sy Snootles, at the behest of Jabba."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Shadow Collective"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Near the end of the Clone Wars, the Shadow Collective, an organization lead by the former Sith Lord Maul, landed at the Hutt Palace on Nal Hutta to gain the backing of the Grand Hutt Council for their coup on Mandalore. In the council chamber, Maul, Savage Opress, and Pre Vizsla asked for the Hutts to join them by promising to spare their lives in exchange for the Hutt territories. The Council laughed at them, unimpressed by Maul's threats. Jabba called for his bounty hunters to stop them. Sugi, one of the bounty hunters, hurled a knife at Maul but it was stopped by Opress, who hurled it back and the bounty hunters opened fire. Maul and Opress cut through several guards while Vizsla set fire to the council table with his flamethrower so that they could have a head start. The bounty hunters chased after them and a firefight began. The guards and bounty hunters retreated back inside.

Sugi dropped down from above and knocked Vizsla over before getting into a fight with Maul. Maul knocked her to the floor and began swiping at her with his lightsaber, but she rolled out of the way of each strike. The bounty hunter Embo got into a fight with Savage while his Anooba Marrok attacked Maul, knocking the lightsaber from his hands and saving Sugi. Savage continuously punched at Embo, who used his hat to block the punches but was knocked to the ground nevertheless. Vizsla drew the Darksaber and cut down numerous guards. Maul managed to throw Marrok off when several smoke bombs were thrown. Latts Razzi and Dengar were at the end of the hall and yelled for their companions to get out. Embo, Sugi and Marrok followed them, and Maul let them go. Maul then decided to go to Tatooine to confront Jabba."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Shadow Collective attacked the perimeter of Jabba's Palace, paving the path for Maul, Savage Opress, and Pre Vizsla into Jabba's inner sanctum. After a very brief and violent struggle proving the Collective to be the more formidable, Jabba agreed to surrender his criminal empire and began channeling his resources to the organization's cause for an imminent takeover of the Mandalorian capital city, Sundari.

By the time of the Imperial Era, the Hutts were involved in a series of trade wars with the InterGalactic Banking Clan. The Vice Chairman of the Clan, Anolo, hired a Givin codebreaker, who was connected to an Imperial algorithm that made security codes, to wage a campaign to take control of the Hutt Clan's smuggling routes, but Jabba also learned of the Givin, hiring bounty hunter Greedo to lead a mission to Mygeeto to capture the Givin.

Solo's standing was jeopardized, however, when his ship, the Millennium Falcon, was boarded by Imperial authorities, forcing Solo to jettison his cargo. Jabba demanded compensation for the lost cargo and, when Solo did not pay, the crime lord sent bounty hunters after him. One such hunter was Greedo, who confronted Solo in a cantina in Mos Eisley, but Solo killed the Rodian bounty hunter before he could kill Solo. Jabba learned of this and found Solo in Docking Bay 94, where the smuggler said that he had no choice but to dump his cargo. Jabba agreed to give Solo an extension on the payment in exchange for additional interest. Solo accepted the offer, but he soon became involved in the Alliance to Restore the Republic and once again failed to pay Jabba.

Jabba provided him with Boba Fett, who Vader tasked with finding the Rebel pilot who destroyed the Death Star, and Black Krrsantan, who Vader tasked with capturing Cylo, an agent of the Emperor. After attending to his personal mission, Vader returned to Jabba's palace the next day and negotiated on the Emperor's behalf.
