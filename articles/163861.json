It was the lead ship of Task Force Whirlwind that was supposed to arrive at a convoy that was being ambushed by Grand Admiral Demetrius Zaarin's forces to trap them. Unfortunately Zaarin sent his own Immobilizer 418 cruiser called Maelstrom to destroy the Whirlwind. The attack was thwarted by Tan Maarek Stele, however, and they were delayed long enough to be unable to trap them so Stele had to be sent to save the convoy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
