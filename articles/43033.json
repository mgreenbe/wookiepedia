Z-95 Headhunters were also equipped with ejector seats. During the Rebellion on Akiva, the New Republic starfighter pilot Norra Wexley discovered that the Galactic Empire's TIE fighters did indeed carry ejector seats. She was able to eject to safety after her stolen TIE was hit by turbolaser fire. The TIE/sf space superiority fighters used by the First Order were equipped with such seats.
