Born on the planet Coruscant after Emperor Palpatine's death at Endor, she was discovered to be strong in the Force and came to the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 at a young age. She was trained by Master Skywalker and eventually achieved the rank of Jedi Knight under his tutelage. As a Jedi, she was assigned long-term intelligence missions to various corners of the galaxy, gathering information for the Jedi and working to help the New Republic. After many years in this role, Eelysa took an apprentice in the Barabel Saba Sebatyne, training her on her home planet of Barab I."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Eelysa worked alongside Saba Sebatyne with the Wild Knights, a group of Jedi Knights that all had ties to Eelysa and her Barabel apprentice. In this capacity, Eelysa worked undercover on the planet Corellia, and she played an integral part in rooting out Yuuzhan Vong collaborators, such as CorDuro, who had allied themselves with the invaders. As the war waged on, Eelysa came into conflict with Yuuzhan Vong Warriors, sustaining injuries that nearly killed her. Despite bouncing back from the near-fatal assault, she was killed in action on Corellia, a victim of the voxyn, genetically engineered creatures designed by the Yuuzhan Vong to hunt Jedi. Eelysa's death was felt by her apprentice, who informed Master Skywalker of the Jedi Master's death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The female Human Eelysa was born on the galactic capital of Coruscant shortly after Emperor Palpatine's death. Neither of her parents were Force-sensitive, so it came as some surprise when she was revealed to be highly attuned to the Force. She was eventually recognized by Luke Skywalker, and while still a child, she was brought to the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4. While there, she began to develop into a Jedi Knight under the personal tutelage of Master Skywalker. In 17 ABY, Eelysa was part of the youngest and most powerful class at the Praxeum. During one training session, in which Skywalker was demonstrating his telekinetic abilities to six members of this class, the Jedi Master felt a great disturbance in the Force. Shocked and dismayed by the great loss of life, Skywalker temporarily lost control of the boulders, the trees, and the droid that he was levitating, causing the objects to crash to the ground. Skywalker's students, including Eelysa, were troubled by this, not having felt the disturbance themselves. While three of the students went to retrieve the droid, R2-D2, Eelysa ran to her Master's side, hoping to discover what had caused him to lose control. Skywalker told the young girl that a million people had just suddenly died. Unbeknownst to both, this event was the first sign of the Almanian Uprising, and the Dark Jedi Kueller had just eliminated the population of Pydyr. Skywalker, concerned over the event, immediately ended his lessons for the time being and left for Coruscant to deal with the threat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after the conclusion of this crisis, Eelysa completed her training at the Academy. While still a young teenager, she was chosen by Skywalker to undergo several year-long intelligence missions. In this capacity, she went deep undercover, losing all contact with many of the people she had met at the Academy, including Han Solo. By this time, Eelysa had developed her own opinions on the nature of the Force, views that sometimes contrasted sharply with her Master's own. Despite this professional disagreement, Skywalker trusted Eelysa and accepted her judgments during her undercover work. These missions did not always have a specific goal in mind, and Eelysa would receive explicit instructions from Skywalker only after she had arrived at the location."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In her role as a Jedi agent, Eelysa spent several years completing tasks for the Jedi. While undercover, New Republic Intelligence kept tabs on Eelysa, recording the many missions that she had undertaken. Based on their reports, they believed the young Jedi Knight had completed close to five assignments. Among these included breaking slaver rings in the Outer Rim Territories, making contact with the reclusive Chiss, and working against the Diversity Alliance. It was during one of these missions that she arrived on the planet Barab I. She discovered a Force-sensitive Barabel, Saba Sebatyne, whom she took as her apprentice. This action was contested by Master Skywalker, who believed that Barabels did not have the appropriate temperament to become Jedi. However, Eelysa disagreed, claiming that if Wookiees such as Lowbacca could become Jedi, then Barabels could as well. Unable to send the Barabel back to the Jedi Praxeum due to her undercover mission and Skywalker's objections, she trained Saba Sebatyne on Barab I. Eelysa spent years training the Barabel, causing a close bond to form between the two. However, she was eventually chased off the planet by a hunting-pack that had subscribed to the anti-Human doctrines of the Diversity Alliance. Sometime after this, Eelysa also came upon the failed Jedi student, Izal Waz, who had halted his studies due to his crippling salt addiction. She was able to help the Arcona overcome his addiction, bringing him back on the path to Knighthood. Sebatyne, whom Eelysa eventually promoted to Jedi Knight, took over Waz's training shortly thereafter. Sebatyne came to train other pupils of her own, including her son, Tesar Sebatyne, and his hatchmates, Bela Hara and Krasov Hara."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Yuuzhan Vong War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Eelysa and several of her apprentices, including Waz and Sebatyne, were deployed on Corellia. The group maintained a fighter squadron known as the Wild Knights, but Eelysa did not usually fly with the squadron. In order to keep a low profile, the Jedi Knights made their base at the abandoned Cinnabar Moon Retreat. While on Corellia, Eelysa uncovered a conspiracy involving CorDuro and CorSec, who were collaborating with the Yuuzhan Vong, a species of extra-galactic religious zealots who had invaded the galaxy. CorDuro was misappropriating resources meant for refugees, and as part of their collaboration with the Yuuzhan Vong, they planned to turn over samples of bacta so that the invaders could study its usage. Eelysa and her apprentices discovered the rendezvous point and planned to disrupt the meeting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three weeks after the Battle of Duro, while working undercover, Eelysa was discovered by several Yuuzhan Vong Warriors and was injured in combat, sustaining thoracic lacerations. Although not killed by the Yuuzhan Vong, Eelysa had to undergo treatment in a bacta tank at a local medcenter. While there, she was in danger of being discovered by the Peace Brigade, Yuuzhan Vong sympathizers who were responding to Warmaster Tsavong Lah's decree that the Yuuzhan Vong would stop their invasion if the galaxy would surrender all Jedi. As a result, she was admitted anonymously by Izal Waz and kept a secret by the Jedi-sympathizer, Doctor Jasper Nimbi. Despite these precautions, three Peace Brigaders, Roxi Barl, Gad Sluggins, and Dex, who were searching for Leia Organa Solo, a fellow Jedi, nearly discovered Eelysa. She was saved by the intervention of Han Solo, who noticed the Peace Brigaders searching the medcenter. During the firefight, Eelysa aided her rescuer by using the Force to distract the Jedi hunters and even telekinetically used her lightsaber to eliminate Dex."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo was grateful for the assistance, and when Dr. Nimbi suggested that the Solos take Eelysa with them on their departure, Solo played along. Hoping to get Eelysa out of the medcenter, Solo and his wife, with the help of Izal Waz, claimed that the recovering Eelysa was their daughter, Jaina Solo. Although Thrackan Sal-Solo, the new Governor-General of Corellia, did not believe the ruse, Solo's threats of disgracing Sal-Solo in front of the local media allowed them to leave with Eelysa in tow. The Solos bought the bacta tank from the medcenter, allowing Eelysa to recover within the device while they escaped the world. However, before they left with the portable bacta tank, Sal-Solo specified that the tank should only be filled with generic bacta, not the premium strain that came from the capital of Coronet. The Solos, tailed by Izal Waz and CorSec personnel, made their way back to the docking bay where they had parked their ship, the Millennium Falcon. The Solos took on Waz as an extra pilot after he introduced himself, and the group left Corellia with Eelysa. Unbeknownst to the Solos, Waz allowed several other Jedi onto the Falcon, the Hara sisters and Tesar Sebatyne, who were under orders from their Master to protect Eelysa."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Escape"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Millennium Falcon left Corellia, Solo plotted a course for Commenor, but they were set upon by Peace Brigade starfighters. Eelysa's protectors revealed themselves to the Solos and convinced the group to make a course for a rendezvous near Corellia where Eelysa could be cared for. Despite escaping the Peace Brigade, Saba Sebatyne was not at the rendezvous point, and the group waited a full day for their contact to arrive. The generic bacta within Eelysa's bacta tank became contaminated, causing the bacta to become murky with fluids. As a result, she went into a healing trance to avoid fatal poisoning. The rendezvous point was actually the place where CorDuro was planning to turn over the bacta samples to the Yuuzhan Vong, and the extended wait was due to a delay in the meeting time. Eventually, the CorDuro ship Star Roamer appeared alongside a Yuuzhan Vong corvette analog, and Saba Sebatyne's squadron, the Wild Knights, attacked. With the Millennium Falcon's help, the ship was captured and the bacta confiscated. Eelysa was treated with a new supply of bacta from the captured ship and was able to recover."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After obtaining the bacta, Eelysa and her group returned to their Cinnabar Moon base, where both Eelysa and Leia Organa Solo, the latter of whom had sustained massive injuries to her legs during the fall of Duro, recovered from their wounds. After emerging from the bacta tank, Eelysa spoke with the Solos several times, helping them to understand Barabel customs and aiding Organa Solo in her recovery. Eventually, Eelysa noticed a mysterious task force investigating the system, and, believing the base to be compromised, suggested that her group abandon the Cinnabar Moon Retreat and seek a more secure location. While the Wild Knights prepared to change bases, Eelysa prepared to return to Corellia. Although her allies were worried that she was reentering active duty too soon, Eelysa was adamant that she keep an eye on Thrackan Sal-Solo's Centerpoint Party and their goal of reactivating Centerpoint Station for use as a superweapon. While back on Corellia, Eelysa continued to monitor the situation and made regular reports back to Master Luke Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Death"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although still undercover during her duties on the planet Corellia, Eelysa was once again discovered by the Yuuzhan Vong. A bio-engineered creature designed to hunt Jedi, a voxyn, sensed Eelysa's Force-sensitivity and was able to corner her. During the struggle with the beast, Eelysa radiated her fear to her apprentice, and Saba Sebatyne communicated the feeling to Luke Skywalker at a secret rendezvous point. However, Eelysa was unable to fend off the beast, and she fell in combat. Her death was felt by her apprentices, which affected them greatly. Although others in the Jedi Order, such as Danni Quee, believed that Eelysa's death might negatively impact Sebatyne, the Barabel continued to fight in the Yuuzhan Vong War, performing her duties alongside the other Jedi. Skywalker's belief that Barabels could not be effectively trained as Jedi was changed over time due to the competence of Eelysa's Barabel apprentices, and he admitted that he had been wrong. Eelysa's legacy was eventually honored in her apprentice, Saba Sebatyne, who became a Jedi Master and even served on the Jedi Council with Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eelysa was a well-trained Jedi Knight who was distinguishable by her dark brown hair and slender figure. Although discovered at a time when Master Skywalker was training adult apprentices, Eelysa was admitted to the Jedi Praxeum at a very young age. As an instructor, Eelysa taught her apprentices the value of patience and listening quietly, a trait instilled in her by the long training exercises of her Master, she voiced her grievances when she disagreed with her Master. Skywalker's belief that Barabels could not be trained to be Jedi was opposed by Eelysa, who proved her Master wrong by training a Barabel apprentice who eventually became a member of Skywalker's Jedi Council. Additionally, Eelysa was a compassionate individual, radiating good intentions and warm feelings toward those around her. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, this trait helped comfort Leia Organa Solo, who had been feeling depressed over her relationship with her husband at the time. This hope for the best caused her to take Izal Waz as her apprentice, even though he had become addicted to salt and had already dropped out of the Jedi Order. Her optimism was rewarded when Waz completed his training, vindicating Eelysa's faith in him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eelysa sometimes flew a starfighter into combat, and although her apprentices and their Wild Knight squadron often flew into battle, Eelysa did not usually join them. She was well-versed in a variety of languages, and she could speak Barabel, Mandaba, and Cheunh. During her missions, she also learned to read and write Selonian. While working as an undercover agent, Eelysa was reputed for her toughness and strength, returning to active duty almost immediately after her recovery from a near-fatal Yuuzhan Vong attack. This trait was noted by her apprentices and her Master, and when she radiated fear during her final battle with a voxyn, those that knew her immediately believed her to be in grave danger as a result. Eelysa's close bond with her apprentice gave them an intimate connection, and Saba Sebatyne could easily pick up on the emotions of her Master. This bond was closer than that shared between Eelysa and Master Skywalker, and during her death, Sebatyne felt much greater anguish over her passing than Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eelysa was strong in the Force and, according to her Master, was untainted by the evil that existed in the galaxy. She could radiate strong feelings of hope to those nearby, encouraging them with her love and support. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, she was able to go into a healing trance, using the Force to sustain her body even after the bacta within her bacta tank had become contaminated over prolonged use. She was able to use the Jedi mind trick and could even perform battlemind. She had some ability to predict the future and was skilled in telekinesis. Eelysa carried a lightsaber and was able to telekinetically control it, which she did against Peace Brigade soldiers. However, her skill was unable to overcome Yuuzhan Vong Warriors, causing her to be grievously injured, and she was unable to fend off the attacks of the Jedi-hunting voxyn, leading to her death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eelysa was created by Kristine Kathryn Rusch for the 1996 novel The New Rebellion.
