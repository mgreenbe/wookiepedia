A group of Trandoshan hunters had been bringing captive Jedi, especially younglings, to the world, so that they could hunt them for sport. A small team of these fugitives, led by Kalifa, evaded the hunters by staying hidden and out of combat. However, when Padawan Ahsoka Tano was brought to the moon, she advocated a more aggressive stance, and after Kalifa was killed, she took command of the remaining Jedi. Eventually, they destroyed a slave ship and freed its sole prisoner, the Wookiee Chewbacca, capturing a Trandoshan in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wookiee later attempted to construct a transmitter from the wreckage, but the two surviving younglings, O-Mer and Jinx decided that it wouldn't work and persuaded Tano and Chewbacca into attacking the floating fortress of the hunters. They first tricked their prisoner into calling a hover pod, then hijacked the vehicle when it arrived. When they reached the fortress, they had nearly been overpowered by the guards, but the arrival of Wookiee reinforcements led by General Tarfful\u2014who had been informed by Chewbacca's makeshift transmitter\u2014and bounty hunters turned the tide of the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 21 BBY, a group of Trandoshan hunters were actively capturing Jedi, mostly younglings, so that they could hunt them. During the Second Battle of Felucia, one of them stunned Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who was brought to Island Four on the moon Wasskah, along with several other captives. Upon arriving at the location, the prisoners were released, and the hunters opened fire. Tano evaded the blasts and escaped into the forest, where she met a team of Jedi, who banded together to survive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The younglings, led by Kalifa, explained her that they evaded conflict with the hunters, giving up the Jedi ways of life. When the Togruta observed two of her fellow prisoners getting killed without them doing anything, she furiously questioned their allegiance, prompting Kalifa to explain the situation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
