Instead of the Novaldex JV-71 ion engine of the Z-10, the ZH-25 was fitted with the more powerful JV-74 ion engine which had three additional collision tube pairs, but given its relatively larger size and weight, the ZH-25 was slightly slower in sub-light than the Z-10."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ZH-25 was armed with twin fire-linked pulse lasers of Taim & Bak's design, which were located on either side of the main fuselage of the ship near the cargo pods. They only fired to the front of the freighter, but the ship was maneuverable enough to allow the pilot to get into position for a shot. The ship was also equipped with a Sirplex P-12 shield generator. In addition to the standard armaments, weapons modifications were quite common, one of the most popular ones being forward concussion missile launchers and rear laser turrets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All the improvements came at the cost of the sensor system, as the Questor model was equipped with the slightly weak SoroSuub Corporation sensor package."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known Ships"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
