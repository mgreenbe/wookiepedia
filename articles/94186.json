Around 987 BBY, four Meerian brothers, including Salto Zendar, attempted to capture the official. However, their plan went badly, and two of the brothers were killed, one was captured, and Salto Zendar fled to a hospital on Bandomeer to receive treatment for his critical injuries. As a result, the Banking Clan put a bounty on Zendar, calling several bounty hunters from across the galaxy to hunt Zendar down and attempt to capture him. However, during the ensuing battle, Zendar was killed, along with four bounty hunters and several hospital staffers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
