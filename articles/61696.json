After Imperial forces arrived on Raada, Hoban and Neera joined a resistance group organized by Ashla, a recent arrival on the moon. However, finding Ashla's methods too cautious for his liking, Hoban organized more violent plans for resistance behind her back, which included a planned raid on the Imperials' base. This led to his death during the raid, while Ashla, actually former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, was forced to expose herself as a Force-user to save the surviving members of Hoban's force, including Neera."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
