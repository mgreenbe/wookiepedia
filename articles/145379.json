Boxy and armed with two pairs of forward laser cannons and two engines, it was similar in shape and purpose to the larger Y-85 Titan dropship. In keeping with the Empire's preference for muted colors, the barges' hulls were painted a bluish gray. Theta-class barges were notably used to carry newly constructed vehicles, such as 2-M Hover Tanks, MTV-7 light vehicles, speeder bikes, and various walkers, from their factories and ferry them to a nearby landing pad for deployment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Theta-class barge first appeared in Star Wars: Commander, a mobile strategy game which was developed by Disney Interactive and released on August 21, 2014 for iOS devices.
