Jinn told him to be patient and remain focused on what is happening. Kenobi agreed but argued that it would be hard for him to focus in the middle of the Life Day celebration. All around them the Wookiees were celebrating the holiday."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His master explained that the Wookiee ways of life were about harmony between families and tribes. He then asked Kenobi what he made of it. Kenobi believed it was like balance because the Wookiees were celebrating The Force. Jinn continued and told Kenobi that he wants him to understand the force but also that their connection to it is much more bigger than that. He also believed that it is important to learn to understand the force in different ways."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "But as they continued to talk, they were interrupted by Jinn's Wookiee friend, Brennonn who pounced on to him.

One of the Trandoshans knocked over Kenobi but Jinn came to his rescue and pushed the Trandoshan back with the force.

He helped Kenobi up and they went to help the Wookiees."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Brennonn managed to throw one of the Trandoshans, another stopped her with their blaster.
