A set of bafforr trees were located at the gardens. When the Yuuzhan Vong attacked Garqi, the local defenders and the Jedi made a stand at the gardens. The battle was short, though, as the bafforr trees soon unleashed pollen that attacked the Warriors' vonduun crab armor. To prevent the Yuuzhan Vong from learning of bafforr pollen's effects on Yuuzhan Vong armor, Corran Horn ordered the gardens to be burned, but he knew it was just a matter of time before the Yuuzhan Vong made an attack on Ithor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
