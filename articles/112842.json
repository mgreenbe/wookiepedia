When Tulkh steals the orchid, however, he finds that he cannot take it back to Scabrous alive without the plant's handler, Padawan Hestizo Trace. Taking them both back to the academy, the Sith Lord mixes the orchid in a strange device hooked up to Sith apprentice Wim Nickter, who had been taken by Scabrous for his purposes. Nickter dies, but comes back as a zombie. His infection quickly spreads throughout the academy in a single night, infecting even Scabrous himself. Hestizo soon finds herself trapped with Tulkh in trying to fight off hordes of zombies. Meanwhile, Scabrous preoccupies himself with finding a way to become immortal without the side effect of becoming a mindless monster. To do so, he infects the Neti librarian, Dail'Liss, and commands him to lure Hestizo to the library by mimicking the voice of the orchid, still alive amidst the infection known as the Sickness. The plan works after she and Tulkh part ways. Scabrous straps Hestizo down on a sacrificial altar, plotting to cut out her heart with a traditional Sith sword and become truly immortal; by consuming Hestizo's heart, Scabrous hopes to negate the decaying effects of the Sickness while retaining his eternal life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, as Tulkh does his best to survive and find a way off of Odacer-Faustin himself, he comes into contact with Scabrous's personal HK-series assassin droid, programmed as a protocol droid, and modifies it to combat the zombies. Together, the two of them make it back towards Tulkh's ship, the Mirocaw, where they find a stowaway named Pergus Frode on board.

She is then able to finish off Scabrous, now a complete zombie, by using his own Sith sword against him. Hestizo escapes infection from the remaining Sith zombies when the Mirocaw, piloted by Pergus Frode, flies in to save her. The ship manages to evade Scabrous's perimeter defenses long enough to reach the roof of Scabrous's personal tower. There, the HK manages to manipulate the perimeter defenses to destroy the tower instead of the Mirocaw as zombies invade the roof and the ship flies away. The tower is destroyed, along with all the remaining zombies and the droid, while the ship flies off into space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Hestizo finds that the Sickness still has a chance of infecting the rest of the galaxy - Tulkh was infected back on the planet when an infected tauntaun's spittle dribbled into his eye.

Before she can do so, however, an infected apprentice from the academy, Rance Lussk, attacks, but Hestizo is able to avoid his attack and send both Tulkh and Lussk out into space.
