Admiral Ackbar of the New Republic, meanwhile, lead the New Republic fleet into Zsinj's territory to secure worlds for his own government.

He ran directly into the middle of Rogriss and Ackbar's war, and the two-way conflict became a three-way fight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Republic was involved in some of the worst of the fighting, with its Star Destroyers getting the brunt of the conflict. The Star Destroyer Crynyd and most of the Hapan ships were lost, Emancipator and Liberator were severely damaged and had to be pulled back for repairs, and Leia Organa Solo's flagship Rebel Dream was attacked and captured by the Empire's Peremptory at the Battle of Storinal, though Organa was not aboard at the time. But Rogriss suffered more, losing the majority of his battles. Teradoc beat the Imperial admiral at Feriae Junction, winning the loyalty of many of Zsinj's ships, but it was not enough to save him. He lost heavily to Ackbar at Maridun and Thanos, the latter in his own territory; the New Republic moved in to take Gala and ultimately Teradoc's capital of Centares, and the warlord's kingdom collapsed. Teradoc fled the battle and his territory for the security of the Deep Core, where he established himself anew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the New Republic was doing more damage to the Empire than vice versa. When at last they captured the major shipyard world of Kuat in the Core Worlds, Rogriss was forced to retreat.
