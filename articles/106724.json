It contained many roleplaying articles, including advice for a Star Wars LARP. The article was called \"Vignette Characters & Scenes for Star Wars: Live Action Adventures\" and was written by Paul Sudlow. Like all supplements printed in Polyhedron prior to 2002, the article is considered ambiguously canon."}]}
