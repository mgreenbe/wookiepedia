Despite Antilles's protests of innocence, the captive Rebels were loaded into the Cilpari's tank and taken to Tamarack, where Loro showed them the results of Tascl's attack. The group arrived to find the body of Gates Harnik, a local grocer who had been supplying the Rebels, hanging from a street light. After Loro's people cut the body down and cremated it, Loro searched the wreckage of her parents' home, looking for any holograms that had survived.

Antilles instructed Klivian and Ilo to fire on a pile of rubbish outside the temple, causing the built-up gases from the decomposing rubbish to ignite, destroying the closest Imperial walker and providing a distraction that allowed Loro and the others to flee into the forest.

Although Loro agreed to avoid harming Dlarit's family as a sign of mercy, she was adamant that Dlarit's death would shake Xucphran society and make the population realize that those who supported Isard's regime could not avoid the consequences. Loro put together a team of twelve volunteers for the mission, including Wessiri, Quin and three of his former Special Intelligence comrades.

Loro's route allowed the group to avoid all but one patrol, which was quietly eliminated by Quin's troopers. Upon reaching the estate, the group overrode the door lock and proceeded inside, securing the ground floor without incident. Moving up to the main floor, they found Dlarit asleep at his desk. Loro instructed her team to set up a holocam so they could distribute footage of his execution. Wessiri, however, convinced Loro that there was more to gain by humiliating Dlarit.
