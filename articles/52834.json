General Grievous, under orders from Count Dooku attacked the planet with his droid army. During this attack, Saxon fought alongside his fellow Shadow Collective soldiers.

He later took Grievous to a high security cell while Maul attempted to persuade Dooku to join him as his new apprentice. Soon, Saxon was forced to take charge of his men when a Republic assault led by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Master Tiplee attacked the outpost. While the assault took place, Maul and his new ally Count Dooku joined the fray around the same time as Mace Windu and the Twi'lek Aayla Secura. Maul began to clash with Secura and Windu while Dooku fought Kenobi and Tiplee. While this occurred, Saxon instructed Kast to shoot a missile at Secura before she defeated Maul.

During the last days of the Clone Wars, the Mandalore resistance and the Galactic Republic mounted a joint invasion of Mandalore.

He then fired a rocket out into the crowd of clone troopers and turned to block a shot with his Personal Combat Shield as he continued to fire upon the enemy with his blaster. Ducking out of combat, Saxon contacted Almec and informed him of the strong opposition they were facing outside of the palace and the capture of the Sundari shipping docks by the enemy. With this, Almec ordered him to escape into the undercity, where he would be met by Maul. Saxon ended the transmission and continued to fire his blaster at the troopers before using his jetpack to fly into the undercity with several other super commandos while being pursued by several clone troopers. Reaching the undercity, he escaped into the sewage ports in order to set a trap for the former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Republic forces entered the sewage ports themselves, Saxon, Kast, and several other super commandos waited in hiding to spring their trap. Seeing that they were in an optimal position, Kast sprung the trap, firing an explosive at the Republic forces, disorienting them for a moment before they charged towards the super commandos. The super commandos easily outmatched the clones, and as Tano reached a clearing in the ports, attempting to regroup with her forces, the super commandos surrounded her, and Maul emerged from hiding to confront her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Tano escaped with the assistance of clone trooper reinforcements, forcing Maul and his forces away. However, they later led a counterattack leading to the capture of ARC trooper Jesse. During the interrogation, Maul sent Saxon to eliminate Almec. After he arrived at the prison, Saxon shot Almec in his cell while he was in the process of being interrogated by Tano and Bo-Katan Kryze. Saxon then fled, but was chased by Kryze, as Almec died but not before giving Ahsoka the name \"Skywalker.\" Saxon eventually used a falling elevator to damage Kryze's jet pack, with Saxon fleeing the prison by air, making his pursuer unable to follow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Saxon regrouped with Maul, who was speaking with the other members of the Shadow Collective, including Black Sun and the Pykes, who had rejoined since their abrupt departure.

However, Bo-Katan's forces arrived to reinforce the clones, and soon defeated Saxon's forces. As the super commandos were being pushed back by the clones and Bo-Katan's troops, he requested backup from Maul, who at the time was attempting to flee the battle, with Tano in close pursuit. Despite Saxon's pleas for assistance, Maul declined to send any support, telling Saxon to die well, before attempting to escape, only to be cut off by Tano.

Saxon's followers became Imperial Super Commandos, Mandalorians who served the Empire. As proxies of the Empire, Saxon and his Imperial Super Commandos enforced the Empire's will on Mandalore. As Viceroy, Saxon donned a variant of the Super Commando armour that was distinct from the rest, with large patches of red on the suit and helmet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Saxon also had a rivalry with Fenn Rau, the leader of the Mandalorian Protectors, a rival Mandalorian faction based in the Concord Dawn system. In 2 BBY, an opportunity for Saxon to move against Rau emerged when Saxon learned that the Protectors were allowing the rebellion to use the Concord Dawn system as a thorough-way to avoid Imperial sector patrols. In an attempt to lure Rau back to Concord Dawn, as well as to get rid of his rivals, Saxon and his Imperial Super Commandos attacked the Protectors Camp on the third moon of Concord Dawn, leaving no survivors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As expected, Rau returned to the third moon of Concord Dawn after learning that contact with his fellow Protectors had been lost. Saxon's plan was complicated by the fact that Rau was accompanied by three of his rebel captors: the Mandalorian girl Sabine Wren, a fellow member of House Vizsla; the Jedi Padawan Ezra Bridger; and the astromech droid Chopper. After the rebels attacked and destroyed an Imperial dwarf probe droid, Saxon and his men disembarked from their starship and traveled to the Protectors Camp.

A third Super Commando entered the room to report that he and his men had found no sign of the other rebels. However, Saxon was unsatisfied and proceeded to interrogate Ezra further."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Ezra feigned ignorance of the rebellion, Saxon reminded the boy that he was a seasoned Mandalorian warrior and not a fresh-faced Imperial Academy graduate. Despite Saxon's intimidation, Ezra continue to feign ignorance about Mandalore and the Empire. Losing patience, Saxon and one of his Super Commandos fired blaster bolts at Chopper, startling the droid and Ezra. Ezra then claimed that he was Lando Calrissian.

After Saxon threatened to dig out of Chopper's memory circuits, Ezra claimed that Fenn Rau had sent him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Saxon then questioned Ezra about Rau's whereabouts but the boy expressed ignorance. Losing patience, Saxon grabbed \"Lando\" by the throat before hurling him against the wall. Saxon then attempted to shoot Chopper in order to dig out the droid's memory circuits. However, Ezra used the Force to deflect Saxon's blaster bolts. At that point, Saxon ascertained that Ezra was a Jedi and would make a valuable captive.

Saxon recognized Sabine and claimed that her mother came round after Sabine abandoned her studies at the Imperial Academy of Mandalore. He also chastised her for shaming her family name. Out of respect for Sabine, he offered the rebel a chance to return to the fold by swearing fealty to him. Outnumbered, Sabine pretended to cooperate. When Saxon approached Sabine to demand her fealty, she told him that he was a fool before telling Chopper to upload Frequency 337 feedback into Saxon and his commandos' helmet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Saxon and his men were temporarily incapacitated, Sabine and her rebel friends fled into the canyon. Sabine and Ezra shared a stolen jetpack while Chopper activated his own rocket thrusters. Saxon and his men pursued the rebels through the canyon on their jetpacks.

However, Saxon and the remaining Imperial Super Commando caught up with them. Saxon prepared to execute Sabine and gave orders to his super commando to kill Ezra.

Saxon called upon Ursa to give him the Darksaber, which she had previously retrieved from her daughter to bargain her life with, seeking the ancient weapon to firmly cement his rule over Mandalore as legitimate. With the Darksaber in hand, Saxon declared that Ursa and all of Clan Wren had indeed held their end of the bargain, but to do so had consorted with traitors, making them liable to treason, for which he intended to wipe out the entire clan as an example. When Tristan Wren, son of Ursa and brother of Sabine, protested and said they were all Mandalorian therefore making such a betrayal unreasonable, Saxon realized he still had use and offered him a place to stay with the Empire over his family. To the Viceroy's satisfaction, Tristan initially seemed to side with him before declaring his place was at his family's side. Unconcerned, Saxon declared that Clan Wren would end with him and ignited the Darksaber as a signal to his men."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the massacre could happen, however, Rau broke into the stronghold, surprising everyone and giving the Jedi their lightsabers, causing the stronghold to erupt in a fierce firefight.

Despite Saxon's efforts, however, he was bested when the younger Mandalorian disarmed him of the Darksaber and held both black and green blade to his throat, demanding he yield. Saxon refused and stated she would have to kill him. However, instead of executing him as was traditional of Mandalorian custom, Sabine opted to spare him, which angered Saxon. Unwilling to accept his defeat, Saxon prepared to shoot Sabine in the back but was shot through the heart by Ursa, who refused to allow him to kill her daughter as she had exited the stronghold with the others to observe.

However, she rejected it, believing that by staying behind with her family she would find the true, capable leader. Saxon was succeeded by his brother Tiber Saxon.

This led some, such as Sabine Wren, to question whether his true loyalty belonged to Mandalore or himself. This also meant his honor was called into question, preventing him from claiming the title of Mand'alor. Saxon was a fierce and brutal warrior and commander.

Saxon was also extremely dishonorable and self-serving, reneging on a bargain with Clan Wren to protect them and twice attempting to kill his opponents from behind when they were distracted, the latter of which cost him his life and effectively showcased him as little more than a self-serving traitor.
