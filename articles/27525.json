Many luxurious settlements built in that style could be found on Mataou, including the estate of the Gnuda Kajidic. The classical architectural Hutt style was characterized by terraced buildings, with a predominance of off-white hues and ornamental red elements. On Jakku, the Hutt-founded settlement of Niima Outpost had an entrance gateway in that style as well, and it was the town's sole example of architectural pride. Similar Hutt style arches could also be seen on Takobo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
