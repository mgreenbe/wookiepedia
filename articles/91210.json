This was at the behest of the Jedi Council. Windu was tasked with putting a stop to hostilities between one clan of the planet's native Er'stacians and their rivals; unchecked, the Jedi Council feared one side might commit genocide. On the world, Windu finally negotiated an uneasy peace by dicing the Venerable One, a statue at the heart of the dispute, into pieces using his lightsaber, and thus forcing the enemy sides to work together to either divvy up the pieces or reconstruct the monument."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
