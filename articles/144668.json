The Padawan was as fearful as the natives, and the two almost attacked one another, but Windu diffused the situation. Soon after, Windu informed the Padawan that he was to find a nearby Sith Temple. Told that he must overcome an adversary within, the young Padawan ignited his lightsaber and headed inside. Inside, the apprentice found a cloaked figure and attacked it. The adversary was actually Windu, who blocked the student's attack and informed him that he had failed in his training. The reason for this failing is because the Padawan assumed that since the temple was a Sith Temple, everything inside must have been evil."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
