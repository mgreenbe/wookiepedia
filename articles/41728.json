Circa 1 ABY, a spacer working for Reimos Taligg, one of Jabba the Hutt's employees, infiltrated the White Thranta base in order to find evidence that the company was conspiring against Jabba. After going through the company's security files, incriminating evidence linking Durr to unethical medical experiments was found, and so Reimos ordered the spacer to kill Durr. It was only after Durr's death, however, was it discovered that he was not in charge of the experiments. Upon reading his personal logs, it became clear that Durr was a lazy employee working under Brok Ziam. Durr had diverted funds from the company into his own private account, and was actually planning to flee the company in the days before his death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Durr Roddack was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
