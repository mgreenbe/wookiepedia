The city was constructed by 6 ABY and consisted of a Command center and Prefab Shelters, was the site of an Imperial prison and two troop centers. Excellency Lathe Parthenian, one of the leaders of the Hanoon Imperial Resistance, was held in the prison. By that year, the city had collected one of the shards of the Vor'Na'Tu, an ancient Jedi artifact. The future founder of the New Jedi Order, Luke Skywalker, and his sister Leia Organa ventured to Hanoon to retrieve the shards of the Vor'Na'Tu, leading a small New Republic army. They made their way to Libreck, and the town agreed to give up their shard if the Republic forces freed Parthenian and removed the Imperial garrison, a group of stormtroopers. The Republic forces skirmished with the garrison and freed Excellency Parthenian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Libreck then gratefully gave up their shard and members of the Resistance joined with the Republic forces to continue their mission. Later, Organa and Skywalker decided to free the rest of the asteroid and took control of the Terraform Processor.
