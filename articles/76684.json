Throughout her life, Kiza harbored rage at her perceived \"oppressors\": the peace officers who hassled her, the chits-and-debits office that pursued her family's debts, and the highborn Corellians who looked down on her lowborn origins. During her adolescence, Kiza began to experience Force visions. Following the Battle of Endor, she was recruited by a man from the Acolytes of the Beyond, a cult of non-Force-sensitive individuals that revered the Sith and the dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Building her way up the ranks, Kiza initially started off tagging walls with the Darth Vader mask sigil and the warning \"VADER LIVES\".

In the months after the Battle of Endor, Kiza developed romantic feelings for a youth named Remi, who shared her passion for the dark side. Prior to the Coronet City revolution, the Acolytes assigned Kiza with the task of infiltrating the local Peace and Security station.
