Little more than an engine with controls, the Overracer could reach speeds of five hundred and thirty kilometers an hour, and had a ground clearance of twenty meters. Overracers seated a single rider, and could carry four kilograms of cargo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Overracers were armed with a single forward-facing Mk 2/S light blaster cannon, although they could be purchased without a weapon in the mount. New Overracers cost between 8,000 and 13,000 credits to buy, between 3,200 and 4,500 credits to purchase used. Unarmed Overracers could be bought for 10,000 credits new, and 2,500 used."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Overracer was a civilian speeder bike utilized by professional speeder racers, and as a scout by military forces without access to proper military equipment, such as insurgencies like the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The Overracer was widely used by the Alliance as a scouting vehicle during the Galactic Civil War. Modifications made to the speeder bikes included stripping non-essential equipment such as high-altitude lifters, civilian stabilizers, and long-range receivers, reducing the bike to little more than an armed engine with a comlink. They were equipped with sound dampers and sensor bafflers to reduce noise emanations and to distort sensor readings attempting to track the bike. The New Republic CR90 corvette FarStar carried six Overracers aboard. These bikes were equipped with comlinks with a maximum range of fifty kilometers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
