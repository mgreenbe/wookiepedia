It featured 2-1B, the medical droid who saved Luke Skywalker at the beginning of Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, as a bitter columnist. He alternates between answering reader questions and ranting that he is the unsung hero of the entire Star Wars saga."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dear 2-1B evolved from an editorial in Star Wars Insider 47 in which the droid laments the relative unpopularity of his character among Star Wars fans. The editorial was co-written by editors Scott Chernoff and Jon Bradley Snyder, with all subsequent columns written by Scott Chernoff."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}]}
