Before the battle started, Confederate General Piar Nagelsa was killed by a T-series tactical droid on the Confederate side, due to issues most tactical droids had with serving under organic leaders. The droid then assumed command as it threw away Naglesa's tactical plan, before leading the Confederate forces to win the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The First Battle of Plagen was first mentioned in 2012's The Essential Guide to Warfare, an extensive Guide on the conflicts in the Star Wars galaxy, written by Jason Fry and Paul R.
