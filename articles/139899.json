They were sent to pick up several Bothans who were sympathetic to the Alliance; because of these sympathies they were due to be sold into slavery by the Galactic Empire. After the Sentinel-class landing craft KDT carrying them were disabled by Y-wings, one of which was piloted by Ace Azzameen, the transports moved in, liberated the slaves and brought them back to the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Liberty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
