He was one of the first recruits into the reformed Stormtrooper Corps after the Clone Wars, and served in a brutal but efficient manner without distinction until his squad was assigned to hunt a Jedi Order 66 survivor. The mission cost him his unit and his right arm. Rumor spread amongst the stormtroopers as to whether the nickname was from his cybernetics or that he strangled the Jedi with the other one. Whenever the Jedi was mentioned, Ironarms merely got a pitiless glint in his eye. He carried a vibrosword as his weapon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Yavin, he was placed in charge of a quick reaction force of cavetroopers to guard the deposits of rubat lightsaber crystals.
