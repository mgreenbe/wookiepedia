It consisted of sharp noises that resembled low grunts and a series of barks. As Besalisks were easily able to learn Galactic Basic Standard and other languages, the Besalisk language was rarely heard off of the Besalisk homeworld of Ojom, with visitors to the world also rarely learning the language even if they were capable of making all the required sounds. Hearing a droid speak in Besalisk could be startling and surreal, although most translator droids had the language readily available for use."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Besalisk language was first mentioned in the 2016 Star Wars Roleplaying supplement Special Modifications, which was published by Fantasy Flight Games.
