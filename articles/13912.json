Rogue Squadron, along with a snoopscoot, were scouting the moon Distna, believing it to be where the Pulsar Station was being made. They ran into a large ambush established by Ysanne Isard's clone, and were only rescued by a TIE Defender force of the Xucphra Corporation sent by the real Ysanne Isard.
