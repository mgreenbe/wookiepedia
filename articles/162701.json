They were partway between animal and plant, and were grown on the world's sea-ranches. They had low intelligence, but were able to move on their own; they contained iodine-filled leaves which were harvested several times a year and distilled for medicinal use.

During mating season, wander-kelp glowed due to internal phosphorescence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wander-kelp's color was similar to that of Yoda's skin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
