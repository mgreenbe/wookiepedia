After crash landing on the planet, Solo and his partner Chewbacca found the cave and used it to store various items such as Corellian wine. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Solo and Princess Leia Organa visited the cave after escaping to the surface of the planet in order to evade the Galactic Empire. There, Solo found a bottle of Corellian wine and offered a drink to Organa, to which she angrily refused due to their circumstances."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
