As such, it could absorb about fifty heavy blaster shots before it failed. It also featured self recharging energy cells, capable of recharging the shield within a minute after depletion. As with most other personal energy shields, it was only useful against energy weapons, such as blasters. The Military Mobility Shield was small enough to be worn on a belt. Its components included a shield projector, cooling vents, activation panel, power indicator, power cell housing, and side clasp."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
