It contained a four-sided chamber of reinforced transparisteel which gave the Supreme Chancellor an unobstructed 360 degree view of the cityscape. The last person to use the office was Finis Valorum, as Palpatine, his successor, and ultimately the last Supreme Chancellor prior to his creation of the Galactic Empire, would create his own office in the Republic Executive Building. It was later replaced altogether with the Imperial Palace throne room."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
