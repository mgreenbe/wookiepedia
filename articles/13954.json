After the fledgling Alliance of Free Planets/New Republic repelled the Nagai and Ssi-ruuvi invasions of the galaxy, Mon Calamari forces that had been kept pent in by the Imperial navy began a campaign in the Outer Rim Territories against the forces of the Imperial Remnant factions. Emmer was an Imperial fortress world. Nevertheless, the Mon Calamari forces were able to defeat the Imperials there. As a result, another nearby fortress world, Makem Te, became isolated from other Imperial-allied systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
