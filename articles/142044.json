Highly-trained and highly-motivated, Corvae and her associates carried out vigilante actions against enemies of the New Order, to test and hone their combat skills, and to illustrate by direct action just how deadly and effective female warriors could be."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "In the Tapani sector"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Instead of seeing combat, Corvae found herself appointed instead to command the 1st Tapani Assault Battlegroup based on well-defended stronghold of Tallaan.

She could be both fair and vicious\u2014and sometimes both at once, as seen in the harsh treatment she meted out to troops who failed to come up to the standard that the Army expected. Her professional expertise was centered on armor and artillery operations, but she had honed her hand-to-hand abilities in Firebird Society training camps, and she typically carried two concealed vibroblades as well as her service pistol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "First introduced in the 1997 Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game supplement Lords of the Expanse with a brief mention in an individual article segment, Tessala Corvae was established as part of the Firebird Society.
