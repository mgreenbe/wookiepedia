The poison they generated in their spiked tail made them widely sought by assassins and collectors of exotic creatures. They usually burrowed in the ground with their tiny claws, and lived in hives of up to fifty individuals. They reproduced by laying small, black eggs in the dead bodies of their prey. They had a life span that averaged three years in the wild, and reached up to ten years in captivity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
