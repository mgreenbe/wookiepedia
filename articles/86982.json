The major difference between the Mark One and the later versions was that the Mark One's had a doonium casing that protected the droid brain. This made them extremely valuable to both collectors and those looking for the valuable doonium inside. Mitth'raw'nuruodo once purchased non-functional Mark Ones for 500 credits which he later fixed and brought with him on the Blood Crow whilst serving in the Imperial Military."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
