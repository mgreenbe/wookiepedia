He traveled to the planet of Coruscant, seat of the Imperial government, to attend the main Imperial Academy. Once there, Jovan met Kallus, who also wanted to join that institution. The two men took some of the same classes and formed a bond of friendship, with Jovan acting as an informal mentor to his comrade. Kallus would later recall that, without Jovan's help, he may have never graduated at all."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After completing his academy schooling, Jovan became a full-fledged member of the Galactic Empire. At some point, he was stationed on the world of Garel, where he started playing the Imperial system to his advantage, securing riches for himself.

Jovan somehow learned of Kallus' orders, and he managed to escape the Academy despite the intervention of Commandant Cumberlayne Aresko's military personnel. Having stolen a TIE fighter from the Academy's hangar, the lieutenant fled to the Lothal settlement of Dinar. Kallus, however, successfully tracked down his former friend, and the two engaged in a duel down an alleyway. Jovan ran away once again, but Kallus went after him, intent on bringing him to face justice. What started as a chase through the streets of Dinar ended up as a flying pursuit as Jovan and Kallus each piloted a TIE Fighter over the green plains of Lothal. Eventually, Jovan was taken down, tricked by a maneuver he had taught to Kallus when they were still friends. The rebellious lieutenant asked for Kallus' mercy, but the ISB agent refused to let him go. Jovan was taken away to be imprisoned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A male human with fair skin and golden eyes, Jovan had brown hair, which he wore medium long in the years prior to the Battle of Yavin.

Since his Academy days, Jovan preferred to operate under the shroud of secrecy. Although flying was never his specialty, he compensated it by his outstanding shooting abilities.
