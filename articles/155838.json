After tracking Solo down through Shrike on Coruscant, he shot and killed Shrike. However, Solo proved too much for the mercenary. During a scuffle, his head impacted with a building and cracked, killing him. In the aftermath of the firefight, Solo switched clothes with the deceased hunter and placed his own fake IDs on the body before he blasted the corpse's face with a blaster. He then pushed the corpse over the edge of the permacrete to fall down one of Coruscant's deep airshafts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
