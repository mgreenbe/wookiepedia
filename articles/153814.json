His unit preyed on Wookiee hunters, cloaking themselves, waiting for the Wookiees to be disarmed before attacking them. He and his troops were killed in 3956 BBY by a redeemed Revan, formerly the Dark Lord of the Sith who initiated the war, and his companions during their quest for the Star Forge, an ancient Rakatan space station controlled by Revan's former Sith apprentice, Darth Malak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This Humanoid commander was the leader of a Mandalorian Neo-Crusader poacher unit that was stationed in the Shadowlands of the planet Kashyyyk during the Jedi Civil War, a conflict between the Galactic Republic and Darth Malak's Sith Empire. His unit used personal cloaking devices and cloaked swoop bikes to track their targets. Revan, a former Sith Lord who lost his memories when his apprentice, Darth Malak, betrayed him earlier in the war, came to Kashyyyk to find a piece of the Rakatan Star Map. The map would help him locate the Star Forge, a space station that was under Malak's control and capable of creating an infinite amount of ships using the energy of the dark side of the Force as its power source."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Revan and his companions entered the lower Shadowlands with the elder Jedi Jolee Bindo, they encountered a group of three Mandalorians assaulting a Wookiee named Grrrwahrr. Revan and his comrades immediately rushed to the Wookiee's defense, killing the Mandalorians. When Revan healed Grrrwahrr's injuries, the Wookiee begged Revan to avenge his hunting clan, and kill the Mandalorians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grrrwahrr also told Revan that the Mandalorians would not attack armed targets, and requested that Revan bring him the commander's helmet. Revan and his companions drew the Mandalorian poachers out by hiding their weapons and entering clearings marked with Wookiee corpses. After two skirmishes, Revan retrieved a signal device belonging to a Mandalorian and located their swoop bikes. He then found a dataport in the swoop bike with instructions to insert the signal device so the swoop would start. After Revan inserted the device, the Mandalorian commander appeared with his remaining poachers. After a short battle, the Mandalorians were killed and Revan gave Grrrwahrr the commander's helmet as a trophy, also acting as proof that the deed was done."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like many Mandalorian warriors, the commander enjoyed fighting and warfare. His decision to attack only unarmed opponents after deactivating his cloaking device were seen as acts of cowardice by the Wookiees and Canderous Ordo, and his orders were even questioned by his own men. Nevertheless, he had been ordered to test the stealth field generators, and he followed the order to the letter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The commander used two vibroswords during melee combat, and was proficient with a blaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the Mandalorian Canderous Ordo is in Revan's party at the time, the commander acknowledges, saying, \"Another Mandalore, is it?\" and asks Ordo if he would \"draw arms against those you should serve.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is possible to avoid fighting the Mandalorian commander, or any of his soldiers, if Revan does not hide his and his party's weapons in the clearings, and fails to insert a datapad into the swoop bike.
