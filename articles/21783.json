In the year 20 BBY, the Separatists used the mortars against the Galactic Republic during the battle on the planet Drongar. Jos Vondar, a Republic surgeon, could occasionally hear the muffled sound of the mortars when he was at Barracks CT-Tertium, which was located well behind the front lines near the Rotfurze Wastes. Vondar noted that the use of the mortars meant that the Separatist forces no longer cared about damaging the bota, a rare plant with medicinal properties that the Republic and Separatists were fighting over."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The C-22 frag mortar was briefly featured in the 2004 novel MedStar I: Battle Surgeons, which was written by Michael Reaves and Steve Perry. The C-22 frag mortar is named similarly to the C-22 fragmentation grenade, a type of grenade manufactured by Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc. during the same time. However, the Arms & Equipment Guide featured the MobileMortar-3, as the launcher for the C-22 grenades."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
