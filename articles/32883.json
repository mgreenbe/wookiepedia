They were fitted to the Galactic Empire's stormtrooper helmets, but were later removed after the Empire discovered that the comlink's signal could be jammed by high-energy particles. As artillery explosions and TIE fighters produced emissions that generated such effects, it often affected Imperial operations. As a result, following the Battle of Yavin, the Empire began replacing the DH77 with Herzfall Corporation's DH107, which boosted power to mitigate the vulnerabilities of the DH77."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
