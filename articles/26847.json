They were introduced to Atraken when a free-trader left a pair of them behind. By the time of 6 ABY, there were a dozen living on the planet. They could grow up to a half-meter long with a one-meter wingspan. They had grown an appetite for the diehard, an insect that was native to Atraken. Like the Aga and the Avogwi, they were often tortured, drugged and used as guards by the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
