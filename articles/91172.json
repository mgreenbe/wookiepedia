Six starfighters\u2014three T-65B X-wing starfighters and three BTL Y-wing starfighters, went on the mission. Upon exit from hyperspace at Dantooine, Sarkli alerted the squadron that a large concentration of Imperial forces was in the area. Tycho Celchu then contacted Red Squadron, desperately telling them to abort the mission, as his defection had been discovered by the Imperials. His TIE interceptor was shot down by the time he attempted to warn them. Skywalker told his squadron they needed to get him out of there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thus, Red Squadron revised its extraction mission into a rescue mission. The strike team landed on the planet, with Skywalker and Sarkli proceeding on foot and ambushing two scout troopers nearby. Sarkli took them out by causing a rockslide with his blaster, and squadron leader Luke Skywalker congratulated Sarkli before going off on his own on a 74-Z speeder bike. Sarkli wanted to come with him, but Skywalker convinced him to guard the landing zone with the rest of the team while updating Skywalker via comlink. When he reached the destination, stormtroopers and storm commandos\u2014threatening that any secrets that Celchu managed to uncover while spying for the Rebels would die with him\u2014had already loaded Celchu onto an APC destined for one of the landed Imperial transports. Skywalker dismounted and ran towards an E-web emplacement. Skywalker took control of several more E-webs as the APC moved out of their fields of fire. Heavy blaster fire from the cannons disabled the vehicle and allowed Celchu to escape."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The escape"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Celchu grabbed another speeder bike, and the two pilots raced toward the other side of the canyon, with Celchu guiding the way.

During their escape, Sarkli contacted them, telling them that they were under attack and to hurry out of there. When they arrived at the encampment, they discovered the only survivor was Sarkli. The pilots left the planet in the three remaining X-wings and returned to the Rebellion. When Skywalker asked who was trying to arrest Celchu, Celchu explained that they were storm commandos, elite soldiers tasked with acquiring weapons for the Empire, and reported that he had information regarding a plan to capture scientists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Celchu supplied the Alliance with intelligence that several scientists on the planet Ralltiir wished to defect to the Alliance, but had been discovered. They were trapped in the main city, protected by only a force field. Celchu requested that the squadron help extract them before the Imperials got to them. Luke commented that he knew of a pilot who could rescue the researchers in time after deciding that they should alert the Alliance to send a rescue team to Ralltiir.
