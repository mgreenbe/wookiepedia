One of the over-5000 such pits on Coruscant (the planet producing a trillion tons of garbage per hour), it was two kilometers wide and three deep."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All of the unwanted garbage was collected and placed onto conveyor belts. The garbage was then directed to a pod, which was then loaded into a large gun-type machine. The pods were shot into space on pre-programmed trajectories, first through a tractor beam shield, to set their trajectories, and then through an acceleration shield, to guide the pod into orbit above Coruscant. There it was collected by garbage vehicles and disposed of. Some of the more volatile material was shot straight into Coruscant Prime. Unwanted material was dumped into the garbage pit bottom, where it was digested by worms and excreted as silicone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 29 BBY, early in his training as a Jedi, Anakin Skywalker navigated through the various shields in a hang-glider contraption and dropped through the different levels to the bottom. There he was to attempt to grab a scale off a worm and present to the race master to claim his prize, until he was stopped by Obi-Wan Kenobi, who saved him from an assassination attempt by a Blood Carver named Ke Daiv."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
