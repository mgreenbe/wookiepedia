The bikers, however, prepare to fight back. They are able to defend the cantina, but one of the bikers realizes that Wuntoo has stolen a swoop, headed for Jabba's Palace. Tracking the droid to Docking Bay 94, the biker is unable to stop it heading for the Palace, but instead continues tracking Wuntoo on his swoop. The chase eventually ends at Beggar's Canyon, where Wuntoo is defeated. However, his army, aboard the drone barge, rescue him, and capture the biker. The biker escapes, however, and contacts Jabba's Palace, warning them of the impending attack, before they are confronted by Wuntoo. Jabba's security forces attack and drive off the barge, while the biker safely escapes. Big Gizz, Spiker, and Twitch then tell Jabba that the droids intended to assassinate the crimelord, blurring the truth somewhat.
