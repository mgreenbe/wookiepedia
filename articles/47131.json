By around 5 BBY during the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire, a flight school was located there which was used to train rebel pilots. In a message from Commander Jun Sato to General Jan Dodonna, Sato found that the RZ-1T trainer was extremely helpful in certifying bush pilots for A-wing starfighters, and stated that if models were available, the flight school could use them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later during the early rebellion, Farstey was considered at least a level five starfighter hub, and was included in a map of the galaxy that listed safe worlds, starfighter hubs at level five or higher, regional headquarters and operations sectors, and deep space caches. In 3 ABY the Empire grew suspicious of potential rebel activity on Farstey. It and several other locations were identified in an Imperial Security Bureau report that generated targets for Viper probe droid surveys by cross-referencing areas with a high degree of suspicious activity with the unsettled parts of the galaxy favored by the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
