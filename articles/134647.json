In it, he detailed his experiences while attending the Star Wars Summit, a gathering of Star Wars licensees, foreign agents, and Lucasfilm Ltd. staff at Skywalker Ranch on November 3 and 4, 1994. Important announcements made at the Summit included George Lucas revealing he was outlining the Prequel trilogy; the complete retiring of the unchanged Original trilogy in favor of versions with new footage (what would eventually come to be known as the The Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition); the Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire multimedia project; and Star Wars-related exhibitions and events in San Francisco, Washington D.C., and Walt Disney World."}]}
