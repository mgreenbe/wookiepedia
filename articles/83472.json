At the start of the campaign, Grand Admiral Thrawn made a number of changes to his flagship, the Chimaera, including renovations to his staterooms, moving his art collection to his private cabin, and constructing a gallery and study. The campaign included several crucial battles, including the Battle of Atollon where Chopper Base and Phoenix Cell were destroyed, and the Liberation of Lothal, where the Imperial planet was liberated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lothal fell under control of the Galactic Empire in 18 BBY when they dispatched an Imperial Planetary Occupation Facility onto the capital. In the following years, there was resistance to the Imperial forces from people such as Ephraim and Mira Bridger. The Empire dealt with these threats however and the Bridgers were arrested leaving their son Ezra Bridger parentless. In 5 BBY, Ezra was a pickpocket and discovered the Spectres following an attack on patrols in the city. Ezra became inspired by the Spectres and joined them in their fight against the Empire. One of the Spectres, a former Jedi Padawan called Kanan Jarrus, discovered that Ezra was Force-sensitive and began training him in the ways of the force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Spectres performed daring acts against the Empire on Lothal, including infiltrating the Imperial Cadet program on Lothal and stealing a TIE Fighter during a mission to collect fruit. Kanan and Ezra's force powers attracted the attention of the Grand Inquisitor who attempted to kill them many times. The Grand Inquisitor even captured Kanan with the help of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin. Ezra and the others infiltrated Tarkin's Imperial-class Star Destroyer to save Kanan, killing the Grand Inquisitor in the fight. The Spectres were then rescued by Phoenix Cell, led by Commander Jun Sato and another former Jedi Ahsoka Tano. The Spectres went on many missions for Phoenix Squadron including the mission on Lothal where they stole three Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvettes. The Lothal resistance group began under the former Governor Ryder Azadi. Kanan, Ezra and Ahsoka attracted the attention of of Sith Lord Darth Vader and two more inquisitors, Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister.

Thrawn and his Seventh Fleet had been requested by Governor Pryce to destroy the rebels on Lothal with the blessing of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin. Thrawn's plan was to eliminate the rebels piece by piece and make them destroy themselves in the process. Thrawn then sent Admiral Konstantine, Governor Pryce and ISB agent Kallus to to Reklam Station. There, they attempted to stop the Spectres from stealing a squadron of Y-wing bombers. As Phoenix Squadron arrived to retrieve the bombers, Thrawn knew this was not the entire rebel fleet.

A portion of Phoenix Squadron arrived to rescue Iron Squadron and disabled the cruiser. Thrawn stepped in on his Star Destroyer, the Chimaera, before he could lose Konstantine. Thrawn eventually came to design and began constructing the TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter on Lothal. The rebels got curious and infiltrated the factory where Thrawn was cracking down on sabotage in Imperial vehicles there and they discovered that Agent Alexsandr Kallus was a spy for them.

Thrawn suspected there was spy in their ranks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn began committing resources to finding the location of Phoenix Cell's base. He sent out reconnaissance droids to many planets to search for it. However, one of them came back rigged with explosives and crippled one of Thrawns star destroyers. Thrawn took this as progress as he knew one of those planets he sent the droids to housed the rebel base. Thrawn soon became aware of a spy amidst his inner circle not realizing it was Kallus. He brought an old friend, Colonel Wullf Yularen, to question each high ranking officer. Ezra, posing as a bounty hunter, allowed himself be captured to extract Kallus and they would sabotage Thrawn's search for the rebels base. Kallus put evidence on Lieutenant Yogar Lyste, who Bridger impersonated, being the spy using his Code cylinders for access to rooms. He also told Lyste that Governor Pryce was the spy and the man became paranoid and attempted to capture Pryce as she intercepted Ezra in his escape.

Thrawn prevented the Rebel forces from withdrawing from Atollon with two Interdictor-class Star Destroyers. Commander Sato then began attacking the Star Destroyers using a tactic against. However, Thrawn recognized the tactic and compromised his plan in order to thwart their attempts. When they got desperate, the rebels tried charging the blockade but Thrawn continued tearing them apart. As a last resort, Syndulla told Bridger to take the Gauntlet and contact Mothma for reinforcements. To help Bridger escape, Sato had his crew abandon the Phoenix Nest and rammed his command ship into Admiral Konstantine's Interdictor vessel.

As Rebel Command debated on the attack, Mothma told Syndulla that the Empire had activated Protocol 13 on Lothal.
