The chef served Jabba loyally and prepared food, including chuba stew, for the Hutt. By the year 32 BBY the chef had been killed in an assassination attempt on Jabba in which the Twi'lek Romi Moola attempted to poison a chuba stew that the chef was preparing. Moola hoped that Jabba would consume the meal and die; however, the chef was killed instead of the crime lord. Jabba discovered Moola's identity, despite the fact that she escaped, and placed a bounty on her head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The chef was first mentioned in Romi Moola's bounty posting in the video game strategy guide Star Wars: Bounty Hunter: Prima's Official Strategy Guide, which was written by David Hodgson and released by Prima Games in November 2002.
