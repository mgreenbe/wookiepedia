Shrike was a tall, heavy-set Human male who carried a blaster. He was allowed to be armed aboard Trader's Luck because he was an officer. Shrike was severely injured aboard Trader's Luck by the Wookiee Dewlanna when a young Han Solo made his escape. Dewlanna, in rage, pulled and twisted his arm. Several pops were heard as tendons and ligaments gave way. When Garris Shrike found Solo on Coruscant, he remarked about Larrad Shrike's injury from Dewlanna, that he had never been the same."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
