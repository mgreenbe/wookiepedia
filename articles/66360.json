It was originally settled by the Galactic Republic centuries prior to the Galactic Civil War as commerce developed around the Corellian Trade Spine in the Outer Rim's Greater Javin region. Indellian's placement along the zigzagging border between the Yarith and Anoat sectors was part of an intentional Republic effort to cut off neighboring worlds and check local political power."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A low-gravity industrial planetoid, Indellian was the primary world of the Indellian system, which was tucked inside the meandering border of the Yarith sector. This area in turn belonged to the Greater Javin, a region in the Western Reaches portion of the Outer Rim Territories. Indellian represented the Yarith sector's first stopover for Rimward travel along the major Corellian Trade Spine hyperlane and also stood as the Coreward entry point for the backwater Ison Corridor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A millennium before the Galactic Civil War, the Corellian Trade Spine spanned only as far as the edge of the Mid Rim, while Indellian and other worlds lying beyond were considered then to be part of Wild Space. Only scouts and the most daring traders visited this imperfectly surveyed galactic frontier in hopes of tapping into its economic potential. However, the vast Twin Nebulae gas clouds greatly hampered regional navigation and prevented countless hyperspace explorers from expanding the Trade Spine's commercial reach."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galactic Republic transformed the local political landscape after defeating the region's native Mugaari in a brief, one-sided war, resulting in the establishment of the sprawling Javin sector in the Outer Rim and the colonization of several worlds running down the Trade Spine, including Indellian. Staging from these newly settled worlds, Republic traders continued the search for a hyperspace shortcut through the Twin Nebulae, but centuries passed before the entrepreneur Ecclessis Figg finally succeeded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thanks to Figg's new hyperspace routes, the Twin Nebulae region exploded into an economic powerhouse. The quiet planet Gerrenthum thus found itself at the nexus of three profitable trade routes and grew into a bustling port world, while Indellian and its neighbors followed suit. Indellian was reorganized into the Republic's new Anoat sector circa 400 BBY, but generations later it became part of the new Yarith sector\u2014the Republic deliberately drew the zigzagging border between Yarith and Anoat to cut off neighboring worlds politically and blunt local power. Even so, Indellian developed into a trade world, manufacturing hub, and government center for the Yarith sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Indellian was created for the 2004 Wizards of the Coast article \"Galactic Gazetteer: Hoth and the Greater Javin,\" an online supplement for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game.
