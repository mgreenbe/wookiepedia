During the Conquest of Makeb in 3638 BBY she was rescued from an Isotope-5 droid by a Galactic Republic agent, after which her councillor Soler asked their rescuer to cover the Tarlam shuttle padds with energy shields to prevent the Hutts from landing reinforcements. After being left in the City Hall, Erkens was taken hostage by the officer Balog of the reconstituted Sith Empire. Balog demanded the Republic agent to allom him and his men to leave with the sample of Isotope-5 in exchange for sparing the Mayor's life; his demands were eventually met. Erkens thanked her rescuer for the second time and proceeded to evacuate the planet on the Ark."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mayor Erkens appears in the Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel expansion, released on April 9, 2013.
