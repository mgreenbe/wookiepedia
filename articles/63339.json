Darth Vader and his Inquisitors arrived just as Koth's wife, Mira, was giving birth. Koth distracted Vader while Mira escaped and the two engaged in a lightsaber duel. After knocking Koth down briefly, Vader sent the Inquisitors to secure the child as a part of Project Harvester."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Koth continued to fight Vader, but was badly beaten in the process.

Among these survivors was the Zabrak Eeth Koth. He cut all ties with his former life, changing his name, and joined the Church of the Ganthic Enlightenment as a priest, hosting weddings and funerals.

Vader interrupted Koth shortly after his daughter was born. Koth tried to deny he was a threat to the with anymore and claimed he could help him track down other surviving Jedi. Vader did not care for this, so Koth threw his medical droid at him, covering Mira's escape with his daughter. He then grabbed his lightsaber with the Force and faced Vader alone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Koth lunged at Vader, resulting in a lightsaber duel. As they fought, Vader sensed fear, anger, and resentment in Koth. Something Koth thought was sourced from the fact he now had something to lose. Vader then Force pushed him away and told his Inquisitors to find Koth's daughter, who was Force-sensitive. Koth got up again and attacked him. As this happened, the Inquisitors split up into the city to find his daughter. The red-skinned Inquisitor reached out with the Force and was able to locate it before the other two could. She confronted Mira and her baby as they were about to board her father's shuttle. Mira pleaded with the Inquisitor, hoping to form a relation as they were both women. The red-skinned Inquisitor let her pass, much to the surprise of the other two Inquisitors as they arrived. However, she then pulled the baby from Mira's hands with the Force as the shuttle departed. The Twi'lek Inquisitor asked why she did this and she claimed it was so the Zabrak could no longer trust another woman again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile Koth and Vader were still fighting. While Koth had made aggressive moves to try and kill him, Vader Force choked him and injured him greatly. Koth swore to protect his family.

Shortly after this, the female and Twi'lek Inquisitors toasted to Koth's death with a drink from the planet he was on, dust Juice. The other Inquisitor on the mission, the Fifth Brother, reported what the red-skinned Inquisitor had done before capturing the baby to Vader. Vader suspected this as an act of defiance and went to kill the Inquisitor. The Twi'lek Inquisitor defended her, but after a short chase, they were both killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hunt for Eeth Koth first appeared in Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 19, a 2018 canon comic written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Giuseppe Camuncoli."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
