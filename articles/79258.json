He led a team of Imperial intelligence officers based aboard an IGV-55 surveillance vessel. After discovering the presence of the rebel droid Chopper at Killun Station, LT-319 led an ambitious plot that involved reprogramming Chopper into an Imperial double agent so that they could find the location of Chopper Base. This plot failed and LT-319 perished when Hera Syndulla caused a data surge that destroyed his ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "LT-319 was an Imperial intelligence agent who was stationed aboard an IGV-55 surveillance vessel. As part of his services to the Empire, he wore an AJ^6 cyborg construct and yielded part of his autonomy. LT-319 was part of Grand Admiral Thrawn's efforts to gather intelligence on the growing Alliance to Restore the Republic. He led a team of Imperial intelligence officers which included 3-9 and a female intelligence officer, who also wore cybernetic headsets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 BBY, LT-319 was aboard his surveillance vessel when one of his subordinates 3-9 informed him that an unauthorized droid had entered the Imperial Security Bureau's station on Killun 71. This unauthorized droid turned out to be the C1-series astromech droid Chopper, who was a member of Phoenix Leader Hera Syndulla's Spectres rebel cell. Believing that this was the spy droid that Thrawn had warned them about, LT-319 ordered his crew to set a course for Killun Station. After 3-9 obtained visual imagery of Chopper, the former Imperial inventory droid AP-5, and their stolen Sentinel-class landing craft, LT-319 confirmed that the droid was indeed Chopper and hatched a plan to hijack the droid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When 3-9 found that Chopper had plugged into a network terminal, LT-319 ordered him to \"capture\" the rebel droid by reprogramming him. Pleased with his results, LT-319 boasted that Grand Admiral Thrawn would be pleased. When 3-9 found that Chopper did not contain the coordinates for the Phoenix Cell's base, LT-319 decided to use the astromech droid to obtain this information. After the female intelligence officer expressed concerns that Chopper's companion AP-5 had stolen Lothalian clearance codes from the base, a defensive LT-319 insisted that the rebels only had a 31% chance of using the coordinates. Believing the odds favored them, LT-319 embarked on his plan to use Chopper to find the coordinates for the rebel base. He used the droid's visual processor to operate the hijacked droid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though AP-5 was suspicious of Chopper's changed behavior, LT-319 dismissed the traitorous inventory droid as a threat after AP-5 antagonized his colleague Wedge Antilles. Once Chopper had boarded the Spectres' ship Ghost, LT-319 sent Chopper to obtain the ship's hyperspace logs. When Hera stopped him, LT-319 then sent Chopper to the engine room and brought the rebel ship out of hyperspace. The Imperial-controlled Chopper then trapped the other rebels in the cargo bay and exposed them to zero gravity space in an effort to kill them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "LT-319 then ordered Chopper to install a data spike into the Ghost's navigation computer and download its information. When Chopper spotted AP-5 trying to open the cargo bay door from outside, LT-319 sent a blaster-wielding Chopper out to deal with AP-5. Chopper missed AP-5 on the first round which gave the inventory droid enough time to open the hatch leading to the cargo bay. Chopper then managed to pushed AP-5 into space on the second round. LT-319 then directed Chopper to return to the cockpit. However, the droid was stunned by the Lasat rebel Garazeb Orrelios, who hit him with his bo-rifle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another rebel named Ezra Bridger then removed the data spike from the navigation computer, disrupting LT-319's operation. Chopper's owner then plugged Chopper into the ship's computer and used the droid's visual processor to send a fierce message to LT-319. Denouncing him as an Imperial \"sleemo,\" she reverse-fed Chopper's data feed back at the surveillance vessel. This caused a data surge which fried the surveillance vessel's circuits and compromised its fuel cells. LT-319 and his fellow intelligence officers were killed when the vessel exploded in space. As a result, the rebels were able to restore Chopper's original programming and keep the clearance codes they had stolen from Killun Station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "LT-319 was a human male intelligence officer who worked for the Imperial Information Office.
