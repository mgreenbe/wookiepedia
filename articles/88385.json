At the Temple, a dedicated high-speed transport system connected the infirmary with the Republic Central Medcenter which was used to bring in non-Jedi with severe injuries or in need of specialized healing. Membership within the MedCorps included those Jedi who did not pass the Trials given to Initiates and were no longer eligible to walk the path of the Jedi Knights. Serving mainly as medical technicians or assistants to the healers who roamed the Halls, these individuals were often deployed onto the battlefield during conflicts within the Galactic Republic to serve as triage surgeons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the execution of Order 66 and the rise of the Galactic Empire, the MedCorps was dissolved and all its members were executed, or went into hiding.
