It was a large building with a steeply pitched roof, inside of which was a simple but soaring auditorium with pillars of pale wood designed to hold 2,000 people. At the eastern side of the building was the instructor's door that led into a short, wood-floored hallway, at the end of which was a sliding panel located behind the dais. At the entrance of the building was the lecture hall's small library."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was here in 36 ABY, that Luke Skywalker brought together nearly every Jedi in the New Jedi Order for the convocation where he officially took the position of Grand Master."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
