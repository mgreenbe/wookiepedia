The First Order fleet proved to be paramount during the regime's gradual conquest and colonization of the Unknown Regions. Following the annihilation of the New Republic in 34 ABY, the naval forces of the First Order were deployed from within the Unknown Regions to seize military control of the galaxy. One year later, following Kylo Ren's ascension to the position of Supreme Leader, the fleet was on track to be bolstered by the might of the Final Order, a Sith Empire crafted by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and his Sith Eternal, which wielded a vast armada of Xyston-class Star Destroyers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Origins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Galactic Empire's decisive defeat at the Battle of Jakku and its subsequent surrender to the New Republic with the signing of the Galactic Concordance, the Empire reformed into a military junta known as the First Order which would eventually cement its political sphere in the galactic frontier known as the Unknown Regions. There, away from prying New Republic eyes, the First Order would rapidly expand its military and research some of the former Empire's greatest military secrets in a bid to return to power. Via Project Resurrection, the First Order Navy would end up constructing hundreds of vessels within the Unknown Regions, including the Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought. With the New Republic's military disarmament program, many within the First Order Navy joked that their fleet was virtually unsurpassed strength. The First Order possessed enough capital ships to reclaim control of the entire galaxy as of the Battle of Starkiller Base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "About thirteen years before the destruction of the Hosnian system, the First Order began channeling billions of credits into the hitherto minor Nikto crime lord Rinnrivin Di's cartel through a militia group called the Amaxine warriors. Rinnrivin's cartel was involved in smuggling and gambling activities in New Republic space with the Amaxines serving as their financiers and partners. In addition, Rinnrivn's cartel and the Amaxines raided legitimate commercial shipping and extorted protection money from merchants. The proceeds were funneled to shadow corporations in the Outer Rim Territories and Centrist sources like Lady Carise Sindian, who transferred the funds back to the First Order, which used it to rebuild the Old Imperial fleet, which became the basis for the First Order's fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although impressive on its own terms, the First Order navy was nevertheless a mere fraction of that of the Imperial Navy that acted as its basis."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Road to war"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Roughly thirty years after Endor, the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer would represent the Order's newest vessel, however older models such as the Imperial-class continued to see service in the First Order's Navy, and would be maintained by unmanned repair drones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Cold War, First Order forces engaged in skirmishes with both the New Republic and the Resistance, a private paramilitary force that had been established by General Leia Organa to keep an eye on the First Order's movements. In 33 ABY, a First Order boarding party backed by TIE fighters captured the freighter Yissira Zyde near Suraz 4. The New Republic Rapier Squadron led by Commander Poe Dameron responded but were unable to stop the heist.

The Ravenous and its TIE fighters clashed with Poe's Black Squadron in a dogfight above Ovanis. After Black Squadron left with information from the Cr\u00e8che elder, Terex and his surviving troops were allowed to radio the Ravenous for a pick-up. The Resistance fighters allowed them to leave in order to avoid provoking a way between the First Order and the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, a Maxima-A class heavy cruiser led by Commander Malarus was sent to chastise Agent Terex, for embarking on an errant campaign to destroy the Resistance. Malarus' cruiser emerged towards the end of Terex's battle with Poe's Black Squadron and destroyed Terex's starship Carrion Spike.

After the destruction of Starkiller, surviving First Order elements regrouped near a terrestrial body, including the Finalizer, and the First Order Navy began an invasion of the New Republic with Rey estimating that the Republic's core systems would fall within weeks. Around this time, a Resurgent-class Star Destroyer was sent to the planet Castilon to secure the Colossus after Resistance sympathizers managed to overthrow the First Order garrison there. Before the Resistance could fully evacuate D'Qar, a First Order fleet of three Resurgent-class Battlecruisers under General Armitage Hux entered the system, and were joined by the Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought Fulminatrix, which destroyed the Resistance base. During the battle, the Fulminatrix was destroyed by the Resistance Cobalt Squadron, which took heavy casualties.

For the next eighteen hours, the First Order pursued the Resistance through space, waiting for them to run out of fuel.
