Like all members of his species, Gaff had stingers on his arms that secreted a potent poison, able to knock humanoids unconscious, though Koboks were also susceptible to their own poison. Over time, he honed his skills as a bounty hunter, assassin, and spy. He often wore a Koboth Insurgent Mantle, although it was not known if Gaff actually participated in the Mavvan Conflict, a brief war involving his species and the Galactic Empire. Gaff eventually returned to Roon, where he allied himself with Governor Koong\u2014a low point in his career, by his own estimation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Koong dragged Gaff into a number of schemes to curry favor with Admiral Terrinald Screed, though none went according to plan.
