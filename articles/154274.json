The bartender was both sarcastic and sympathetic toward his fellow Mandalorians, providing warnings for when a patron of the Oyu'baat had been placed on the galactic bounty hunting list. He was also understanding toward the plight of clone deserters from the Grand Army of the Republic who came to Mandalore, and was willing to keep them secret from those who would persecute the former troopers. The bartender also reached an agreement with the commander of Imperial forces in charge of establishing a garrison on land leased to the Galactic Empire outside of Keldabe, ensuring that Imperials would remain out of the Oyu'baat cantina."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This unnamed bartender first appeared in Star Wars canon in the novel Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel, written by author Karen Traviss and published September 16, 2008.
