By the year 11 ABY, Tekba had attained the rank of captain and was in command of the troopship Pelagia. During that time, the New Republic was caving in under the onslaught of the reborn Galactic Emperor Palpatine, who used his newest superweapon, the Galaxy Gun, to spread a reign of terror across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galaxy Gun was capable of firing particle disintegrator warheads that traveled through hyperspace and could destroy entire celestial bodies, as was the case with the moon of Da Soocha V, where the New Republic had operated its Pinnacle Base, as well as two other targets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after the destruction of Pinnacle Base, Tekba and the Pelagia were assigned to reinforce a New Republic siege of an Imperial shipyard that was taking place on the Galactic Rim.

However, Tekba realized that he would be unable to bring his ship to safety in time, as the Pelagia would require at least thirty minutes to reach lightspeed. As such, Tekba began preparing the forces under his command to take a stand against the warhead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the missile emerged from hyperspace, Tekba contacted the X-wings of Green Group that were still in space near the Pelagia, asking them to provide assistance. Tekba launched the Pelagia's own starfighter complement and sounded a full battle alarm, bringing all of the troopship's defense cannons to fire at the warhead. Yet even the combined firepower of the Pelagia and the X-wings was not enough to penetrate the warhead's deflector shields. Tekba was soon notified of the futility of their attack by Green Leader in charge of Green Group. As the missile approached the Pelagia, Tekba desperately attempted to perform evasive maneuvers, but it was to no avail. The warhead exploded on impact with the troopship, annihilating the Pelagia and killing Tekba as well as all those aboard."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fallout"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the meantime, Emperor Palpatine, who was watching the attack through a live feed transmitted through subminiature probe drones that had followed the missile, was ecstatic at the destruction of the New Republic warship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Emperor demonstrated the event to the ruler of the Gama-Senn species, using the fear of the Galaxy Gun to bring the species under his rule.
