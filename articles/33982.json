During the Galactic Civil War, he had already racked up eight combat missions before being transferred to the elite Rogue Squadron, which at the time was stationed at the secret Base Delta-Nine. His assignment to the squadron\u2014along with the Rodian Standro Jcir, fellow Human Avan Beruss, and the Tunroth Xarcce Huwla\u2014was part of an effort to bring Rogue Squadron up to full strength prior to the Battle of Brentaal IV, a New Republic effort to gain a foothold in the Core Worlds. Assigned the call sign of Rogue Ten upon joining the unit, he and his squadron mates underwent holosimulator training for an assault on the Imperial-held Brentaal IV moonbase. Following a recent reconnaissance mission undertaken by Rogue Squadron to Brentaal IV, Admiral Gial Ackbar and the New Republic Provisional Council decided that it was time to strike the planet as part of their campaign to liberate the Core Worlds and the capital Coruscant. Ackbar was to lead the task force assigned to capture Brentaal IV."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Staging from the planet Recopia, Keyis participated in the operation, during which the New Republic claimed victory by capturing the Imperial moonbase despite the presence of one squadron of elite TIE interceptors.

Keyis participated in the subsequent assault on the Brentaal city of Vuultin\u2014while Rogue Squadron hit the capital of the planet's ruler, Admiral Lon Isoto, as a diversion, New Republic Colonel Horton Salm's Aggressor Wing was to hit the city of Oradin and capture its spaceport. The opposition at Vuultin was light, as Fel had correctly surmised that Oradin was the true target for the Republic's assault. However, Isoto felt threatened since the Rogues were attacking him, and called Fel and his units away from Oradin. With news that Fel was heading for Vuultin, Ackbar ordered the Rogues to head to the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Independence, one of the capital ships assigned to his task force. Despite taking heavy losses, the New Republic succeeded in capturing Oradin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stationed at Oradin with Rogue Squadron, Keyis and Jcir were present in the main hangar when Lieutenant Plourr Ilo profusely thanked Rogue Squadron mechanic Koyi Komad for fixing her maneuvering jets. When Ilo asked Komad how she could repay her, Keyis and Jcir made several smart remarks about buying her a planet or a moon as a reward, due to Ilo's status as the Princess of Eiattu 6. Ilo offered to take the two pilots for drinks, reasoning that their dumb remarks would start a fight that she could enjoy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Without warning, an Imperial evacuation fleet arrived at Brentaal IV, intent on rescuing the wealthier citizens from the Republic invasion. Fearful that the escapees would take much of the planet's wealth and leave the economy in ruins, the New Republic Provisional Council authorized a mission to stop the population from evacuating. Rogue Squadron supported Aggressor Wing while they disabled fleeing transports with their ion cannons, first at Vuultin, then in orbit above the planet. During the space battle, Keyis' X-wing was hit by weapons fire from a TIE Interceptor. His fighter was destroyed, and Keyis was killed.
