That same year, as the Penetrator neared completion at the Kuat shipyards, Shannon Voorson\u2014a child amateur slicer and a resident of Kuat\u2014managed to slice into several Imperial computer files. One of the files Shannon hacked into was a registry of six new Star Destroyers, including the Penetrator, currently being manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards. Upon uncovering the list, Shannon found the Star Destroyers' names to be silly and the beings who named the ships unimaginative. Shannon later showed the registry to her cousin Deen Voorson, a member of the Rebel Alliance, and offered to give it to Deen so that he could take it back to the Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Penetrator's first and only mention in Star Wars Legends came in the short story Slaying Dragons, written by Angela Phillips and published in the Star Wars Adventure Journal 9 on February 1, 1996.
