The squadron's starfighters were flown by elite Rebel Alliance pilots, led by Lieutenant Shara Bey. Staff officers included Commander Wedge Antilles, Captain L'ulo L'ampar, and Evaan Verlaine. Other members included Mart Mattin and Freyta Smyth. The squadron received its orders directly from General Leia Organa. The squadron's starfighters, flight helmets and flight suits were emblazoned with an insignia, which consisted of a red starlight burst, occasionally with a vertical black stripe background."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Formation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the evacuation of Hoth in 3 ABY, the Rebel Alliance scattered its fleet to secret rendezvous points across the galaxy. The Galactic Empire, however, had cracked Alliance communications and Commander Ellian Zahra's Imperial forces continued to attack the divided fleet. With no way to communicate with Alliance forces across the galaxy, the Fourth Division's Commander Grek, devised a plan to reassemble the scattered fleet divisions, named Operation Starlight. Shortly after, Starlight Squadron was formed with the most elite pilots available within the division, and tasked with undertaking dangerous missions on behalf of Operation Starlight."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Operation Starlight"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Search near Felucia"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 3 ABY, Starlight Squadron took part in their first mission for Operation Starlight, led by Starlight Leader Lieutenant Shara Bey, upon which they were tasked by General Leia Organa with finding the scattered divisions of the Rebel Alliance fleet, to warn them that the Galactic Empire had cracked Alliance communications and to deliver a new Trawak security code that C-3PO and his team had developed. During their search, the squadron discovered wreckage of the Sixth Division near Felucia. Wedge Antilles noticed there were signals all around them, to which someone else noted that they were Imperial signatures. L'ulo L'ampar (Starlight Three) spotted Imperial probe droids waiting nearby and quickly realized they had been setup. The Starlight pilots took evasive action, but the probe droids latched onto the astromech droids of the squadron's X-wings and attempted to access their archives by drilling into their conical domes. Fearing the probe droids might get the coordinates of the other rendezvous points, Antilles suggested shooting them off, however Shara Bey questioned their ability to actually pull it off. Instead, Bey ordered all pilots to set their astromech's self-destruct and eject them, which meant losing their nav data and making it difficult to get back to the fleet. With no other choice, the droids ejected and detonated, saving their valuable data from the Empire."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Ambushed by Tarkin's Will"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With no time to catch their breath, the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Tarkin's Will arrived and ambushed the squadron. The Star Destroyer launched TIE fighters, which outnumbered the Rebel starfighters three to one. Mart Mattin (Starlight Four) suggested the A-wings leave while they still had a chance, as there was no way they could coordinate a hyperspace jump during a dogfight without their astromechs. However, Bey made it clear that she was staying to fight. After studying the TIE's tactics, L'ampar noticed the TIEs were not ganging up on individual starfighters, per the Imperial Tactical Manual when outnumbering the enemy, and quickly realised they were being herded. The Tarkin's Will engaged its tractor beams, catching the squadron's starfighters to bring them in for interrogation. Evaan Verlaine and Antilles agreed that using brute force to try to escape would not work. Antilles then suggested a maneuver that the Rebel pilots war-gamed back in Rogue Squadron but was untested. The maneuver involved accelerating full throttle and riding the tractor beam toward the Star Destroyer. As they did this, the Imperials aboard the Tarkin's Will remained unphased, as the starfighter tactics gave the impression the Rebels were planning to ram the Star Destroyer in a last-ditch suicide mission. As soon as the shields dropped to pull the starfighters in, the squadron targeted the tractor beam projectors and fired their concussion missiles and proton torpedoes, destroying it. With the tractor beam offline, and the Star Destroyer's targeting computers unable to lock on due to their speed, the Starlight starfighters raced into the hangar, and fired upon the TIE fighters and stormtroopers within. This prevented anymore TIEs from scrambling from the Tarkin's Will."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Escaping Tarkin's Will"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mattin and Verlaine's X-wings stood guard to keep the TIEs that were chasing them, out of the hangar, while L'ampar's A-wing covered the interior access door from stormtroopers. With the hangar temporarily locked down from further Imperial threats, the rest of the pilots landed and disembarked their ships. Getting close to the tractor beam generators had fried the A-wings' navigational memory banks, so Bey and Freyta Smyth scrambled to a group of Imperial astromech droids sitting idle nearby, while Antilles provided cover fire. Smyth sliced into one of the astromechs, and was surprised that it wasn't using tough encryption. Bey ordered Smyth to get the astromech back to an X-wing and start running the hyperspace calculations, while she stayed behind to do something."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just as L'ampar destroyed an AT-ST walker, more entered the hangar. Antilles urged Bey to hurry as the Imperial astromech in his X-wing had almost finished the nav calculations and all their ships were linked and ready to go. Bey explained that she was able to steal all kinds of valuable intelligence from the other Imperial droids in the hangar, which they could take back to the fleet. As Bey raced back to her A-wing, but it was destroyed by an AT-ST, leaving her stranded. On witnessing this, L'ampar told Bey not to give up, as Starlight would continue to fight the AT-STs and steal her a ship. However, Bey recognised the foolishness of these actions, as staying to help would lose them their only chance to get back to the fleet, and so she issued a direct order to L'ampar to go, along with a request for him to tell her husband, Kes Dameron, that she loved and have him kiss her son, Poe, for her. L'ampar reluctantly acknowledged the order, and the squadron left without her."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Returning to the fleet"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the way back to the fleet, L'ampar, now Starlight Two, sent the Fourth Division a transmission, stating the mission was unsuccessful. He mentioned finding the remains of the Sixth Division, and the ambush by the same Star Destroyer that had been hunting them across the galaxy. L'ampar also mentioned the fighting on it that resulted in leaving Starlight Leader Shara Bey behind, which Kes Dameron, who was listening in, was sad to hear. L'ampar finished off with the only bit of good news, regarding the capture of an Imperial astromech droid, with its memory banks full of useful navigational data, which was Bey's idea."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Hiding on Tarkin's Will"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Bey managed to slip away off the Star Destroyer's hangar deck before she was captured. She managed to find a place to hide somewhere on the big, city-sized starship. She managed to dismantle one of the Imperial astromech droids and raise communications with the Forth Division, where she was able to talk to her husband, Kes Dameron, much to his relief. Bey told Dameron that she was working on slicing into the Imperial systems and she was going to make herself useful getting more valuable information until such time as a team could be sent to rescue her. Bey then debriefed General Leia Organa on the intelligence she had already gathered while in hiding."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Starlight Squadron was first mentioned in Star Wars 6, a comic written by Charles Soule, illustrated by Jes\u00fas Saiz, and published by Marvel Comics on September 16, 2020.
