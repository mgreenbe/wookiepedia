Commander Wyl Lark led the more nimble starfighters of Wild Squadron through the asteroids to find a path, while the slower fighters and bombers from Flare Squadron and Hail Squadron, held back. As they neared, the 204th left themselves open to attack as the bulk freighter Yadeez was leaving the asteroid field to jump to lightspeed. Lark ordered the fighters to attack, Flare and Hail Squadron moved to either side of him, while Wild prepared to flank the bulk freighter. Out of nowhere, former Alphabet Leader and traitor, Lieutenant Yrica Quell, announced over the comm her allegiance to the 204th, warning the New Republic forces to withdraw or be destroyed. This caught the New Republic forces off guard, particularly the members of Alphabet Squadron, because she was presumed dead during the 204th's attack on Cerberon. Quell fired warning shots at Lark and during the confusion, Quell boarded her TIE on the freighter. But it was too late for Flare and Hail to reach it, and the Yadeez disappeared once again into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
