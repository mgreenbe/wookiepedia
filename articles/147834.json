Tosh was one of those Chev slaves, used in Phylus Mon's security guard: The Chev was to use his Force powers to increase the battle prowess of the other guards, or to create illusions of huge predators to scare Phylus Mon's enemies, although Tosh himself would not involve in any physical combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In around 20 BBY, Tosh was one of the three Chevs in Phylus Mon's throne guard, along with Niv and Drik - all of whom hated Phylus Mon. But, like all of Phylus Mon's slaves, they had an inserted explosive that would kill them instantly should Phylus Mon die. The Chevs were sitting at their master's feet, where they could Force-affect all of the bodyguards (including a group of Coruscani ogres, and a hidden wampa), and in a room big enough for an illusory rancor to attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Phylus Mon's mobile headquarters was in the Cularin system, the throne room was attacked by a local group who opposed to Phylus Mon's plans.
