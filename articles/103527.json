It needed only one parent of the female sex who would give birth when conditions and environment where best suited to raising the child. The M'shinn species reproduced through parthenogenesis, giving birth to tiny centimeter long babies which would live in their belly pouches for one hundred days before emerging. In optimal conditions M'shinn could give birth to a daughter every three years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Parthenogenesis was first mentioned in 1995 in Galaxy Guide 12: Aliens \u2014 Enemies and Allies, one of the Galaxy Guide series of sourcebooks written by Lisa Smedman and published by West End Games for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
