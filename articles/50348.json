At some point, the Lancer was captured by the Rebel Alliance near to the planet Malastare, and it was subsequently refitted by the Alliance for use as an anti-TIE Fighter attack platform. The Fowler performed an anti-starfighter role on a number of strike missions, in support of Alliance Y-wings, and it achieved a large number of combat kills. The Fowler later saw service with the New Republic, the Alliance's successor government, and it was eventually decommissioned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
