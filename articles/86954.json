In addition, these units were either also equipped with a self-destruct mechanism or an orbital strike beacon that could be activated remotely by the droid's owner. The self-destruct mechanism would blast the droid apart to pieces, and at the same time cause a destructive explosion capable of immediately killing or destroying any troops and droids unfortunate enough to be caught within the blast radius. Once initiated, the self-destruct mechanism could not be deactivated even by the droid's owner. However, it takes about five seconds for the droid to self-destruct, during this time it would become immobile and an easy target for any soldier quick enough to destroy it before it blew up."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Separatist droid snipers' Mark IV recon droids had an orbital strike beacon rather than a self-destruct mechanism. It could call upon a small orbital strike from any allying starships in orbit of the planet or moon. This device also required a few seconds to power up, but unlike the self-destruct mechanism, it was completely mobile even when it was activated. This device was just as devastating as the self-destruct mechanism, but the orbital strike did not always hit its targets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It should be noted that the Mark IV recon droid was identical to the R-1 recon droid, as well as the R-4 recon droid.

While the recon droids were all identical, the Star Wars Battlefront: Prima Official Game Guide lists them as different models from each other. The clone sharpshooters' recon droids were called the R-1 recon droids, the droid snipers had Mark IV recon droids, and the Rebel marksmen and scout troopers both had R-4 recon droids. By Star Wars: Battlefront II, however, all recon droids used by the new extra special class were designated Mark IV by its respective game guide.
