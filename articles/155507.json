The shuttle took students to the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4, a forested moon of the planet Yavin Prime, in 14 ABY. Dressed in a uniform similar to the ones worn by Rebel troopers at the time of the Battle of Yavin, the pilot was at the controls when one of its engines was damaged by the Dark Jedi Tavion Axmis. The pilot guided the craft to a safe emergency landing several kilometers west of the Jedi Praxeum. No one was substantively injured during the landing, and Jedi Master Luke Skywalker managed to contact the pilot using a comm unit. The pilot then led the students on foot to a nearby Massassi temple where they were all retrieved by an Academy shuttle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This pilot first appeared at the beginning of the video game Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, released in 2003.
