It was designed to rip the Force-essence out of a Jedi's body and contain it. Gog used the technology from a Ssi-Ruuvi Swarm-class battle droid that he had purchased from Raith Sienar. He placed it in the Jedi library on the Nespis VIII space station. This experiment was based on a theory by Jenna Zan Arbor. The Force-sensitive Human, Tash Arranda, managed to destroy it with the help of her uncle, Mammon Hoole."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The insane scientist, Umak Leth used similar technology in developing the Universal Energy Cage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
