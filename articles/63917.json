These materials were collected from the planetary cores by mining droids for the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Death Star contained a hypermatter reactor as one of the subsystems of the battle station's reactor core. Galen Erso's team proposed the use of a Hypermatter Annihilator Unit, intended to help reduce the recharge time of the superlaser and prevent radiation buildup that caused interference with the hypermatter annihilator. The proposed modification was not approved by Engineering Operations Manager Shaith Vodran. When completed, the Death Star transformed and focused its raw hypermatter reactions into its superlaser, which was powerful enough to destroy an entire planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A hypermatter leak in a starship's radiation refractors could leave a trail of particles that could be found and followed.
