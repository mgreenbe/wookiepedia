When the construction site was raided by slavers, Zeta sacrificed herself to allow fellow droid Z5-TXT to escape with the other droids and organic workers. Zeta was taken to work at a mining complex on the Unknown Regions planet known as the Deep, where Lady Eekee modified Zeta with an override chip to turn her into an enforcer droid, which forced her to enjoy the suffering of other droids while also being aware of the change in her programming. The mine was infiltrated by Luke Skywalker, who intended to rescue the astromech droid R2-D2. Zeta unwillingly attempted to stop the subsequent uprising, and Skywalker removed the override chip, repairing Zeta's circuits. With Zeta's knowledge of a flaw in the override chips, Skywalker freed the other enforcers, and the droids escaped the Deep, overthrowing the organic beings who ran the operation. Zeta's story later became known to G2-X, a droid aboard the starship Wayward Current."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
