Tani met Gilamar while he was a doctor, and the two fell in love. At some point later, they were married, and Gilamar was adopted into the clans, becoming a Mandalorian. Unfortunately for them both, their happiness together would not last, as Tani was murdered sometime before 32 BBY. Gilamar took Tani's death hard, initially drowning his pain in his continuing work as a doctor, and painting his armor in the traditional sand-gold coloring that signified a quest for revenge in the Mandalorian culture, swearing that one day he would find Tani's killer and return the favor in kind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
