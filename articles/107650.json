After he had finished, 0-0-0 inquired to Nuss on tracing a broadcast sent from his eyes. Nuss could not do anything about it and recommended him to Prexo. 0-0-0 saw no further use with Nuss and killed him. As he did this, Aphra found out Nuss had failed to remove their proximity bombs and hit a fail-safe in the process, setting the bombs to explode in ten hours. With Nuss out of the picture, Aphra looked up Prexo and realized he could be able to remove the bombs. The pair subsequently decided to travel to his home in South District Seven. When they got there, they found out Prexo was not present. He had been hired by Winloss and Nokk to trace the signal from 0-0-0 eyes back to the source so they could capture Cornelius Evazan and Ponda Baba. He killed the transmission once the two criminals were in custody."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prexo was a human male with a cybernetic left eye.
