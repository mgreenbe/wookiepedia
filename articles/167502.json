It had a high level of encryption that allowed users to access classified Imperial documents. The rebel Ezra Bridger and the Imperial cadet Zare Leonis worked together to steal a ZX-5 access disk from the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus' office. This decoder contained the coordinates of an Imperial kyber crystal convoy in deep space. Later, Leonis' girlfriend Merei Spanjaf used the decoder to decrypt several Imperial documents relating to Leonis' missing sister Dhara."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
