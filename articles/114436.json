The throwing razor incorporated both a small repulsor engine to guide it to its target and a homing beacon to allow it to return to its owner. Manufactured by Rheshalva Interstellar Armaments on Rodia, the throwing razor was often used by Rodian bounty hunters, though some mercenaries found them useful."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
