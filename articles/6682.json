It was operated by an Ithorian named Yuka Laka. The shop primarily sold repair and upgrade parts for droids, though it also sold actual droids as well as parts. In 3956 BBY Revan purchased the assassin droid HK-47 from this store. At the time, Yuka Laka was also working on a utility droid and a turret. There was an inoperative protocol droid in one corner of the shop."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
