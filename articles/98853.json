The paste was full of nutrients, particularly protein.\nNutrient paste could be heated and scrambled, but that would do little to improve the taste. Leia Organa jokingly thought that the paste sometimes included in Rebel Alliance ration packs may have been hull caulk, as it looked and tasted like it. The First Order had a gray paste which Vi Moradi compared to a deconstructed chicken that had passed through a happabore, while the version she later ate on Parnassos was light-brown with a chemical taste so strong that it seemed cold. Aboard the transport barge Wayward Current, crewmembers could purchase ration packs that contained bread and tubes of nutrient paste."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nutrient paste first appeared in the Star Wars Legends comic story Star Wars 28, published in 1979.
