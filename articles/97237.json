Her mother was a Senator in the Galactic Senate, representing the Cularin system, and when Night was seven, she was kidnapped by the Thaereian military, so they could blackmail the Senator into supporting their actions in the system. Night was taken to Thaere Privo, where she lived with Colonel Rast'tul and was cared for by Nannat, a nanny. Rast'tul convinced her that her parents didn't love her and that they had sent her to live with him because they didn't have enough time to care for her. After turning eight, she was rescued from Thaere Privo by the Heroes of Cularin, who had been sent by her mother to save her. They took her back to Cularin and she was reunited with her parents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
