They came into conflict with the Ewoks, who banished the wizards from Endor to another world. Eventually, an eclipse opened a rift in space through which one wizard, the Stranger, escaped. The wizard returned to Endor and stole the Sunstar from Bright Tree Village, using it to reopen the rift so that the rest of the wizards could speed through. After a decisive battle, the wizards were defeated and pushed back across the rift and back to their otherworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
