The surprise attack was orchestrated by the Jedi Master Dar'Nala as part of her conspiracy to destabilize the Treaty and reignite the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Empire. While the Envoy was in transit through the Kuat sector, an Imperial battlecruiser under the command of Captain Sivill of the Sith Navy intercepted the transport. Hoping to frame the encounter as an act of Imperial aggression against the Republic, Dar'Nala ordered the Envoy to fire on the cruiser. Sivill responded by exchanging fire and leading a boarding team onto the Republic transport. Dar'Nala met the team on the Envoy's bridge and feigned resistance when Captain Sivill moved to incarcerate her. In reality, the Jedi Master planned to be taken hostage so she could gain access to the Sith cruiser and to give her companion, Jedi Knight Satele Shan, an opportunity to escape and tell the Republic of the Empire's offenses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
