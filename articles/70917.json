Sometime after 10 BBY, Jhorstek was invited to a cantina in Phelar Port on the planet Eriadu by the Nautolan bounty hunter Nakano Lash. While they sat at a table with the twins T'ongor and T'onga, a young thief was caught by the bartender while evading stormtroopers of the Galactic Empire. Jhorstek warned Lash not to intervene as the Nautolan expressed sympathy for the boy. T'ongor sided with Jhorstek, saying that the thief was not their problem."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Lash insisted that they help the boy, another bounty hunter in the cantina, the cyborg Beilert Valance, attacked the stormtroopers as they approached the thief. As Valance defeated the troopers, Lash left the table where he, Jhorstek and the twins were sat. Jhorstek asked the Nautolan what she was doing, to which she insisted that Valance would get himself killed when Imperial reinforcements arrived. Valance took the fight outside the bar, where he was confronted by the subsequent stormtrooper reinforcements, who gunned him down. Lash, then attacked these stormtroopers, defeating them with ease. Jhorstek asked if Lash wanted him to fix the injured Valance. Lash agreed, telling the Abednedo to put it on her account."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Death"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime after, Valance, Lash and T'ongor were hired by Khamus, the heir to the Mourner's Wail Syndicate, for mission.

Around 3 ABY, Lash was spotted near the planet Kessel, prompting many bounty hunters to begin searching for her. The bounty hunter Boba Fett, who Khamus had also hired on the day of his death, found Jhorstek at the Safe House outside Phelar Port on Eriadu. Killing the other patrons at the bar there, Fett interrogated Jhorstek.

Although he could not hear what the tech dealer was saying, the cyborg read his lips on the recording and realized that he was saying Galmerah.
