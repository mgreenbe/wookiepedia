Aboard the transport, the snowtroopers question the route that the driver is taking, and one trooper orders the transport to be turned around. Before the driver can react, the bounty hunters Black Krrsantan and Tubleek Ruz attack, and the driver reveals herself to be the rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Aphra, having led the transport into an ambush in order to steal its cargo. Ruz turns on Aphra and threatens to take out the bounty on her, mocking her for her misplaced trust. Aphra reveals that she had never trusted Ruz, and the assassin Just Lucky shoots the bounty hunter dead with a sniper rifle.

Yao, having been inspired by a guest lecture Aphra taught several years prior, wished to hire her to find the Rings of Vaale, a lost artifact that Yao intended to write her thesis on. Yao explains that the Rings, which the university does not believe are real, supposedly granted eternal life and boundless fortune when worn together, but were also cursed.

Aphra is discouraged, having previously been classmates with Okka, though they had since fallen out.

Okka is similarly displeased to see Aphra, and refuses to help anyone finds the Rings of Vaale, having been asked numerous times by Ronen Tagge, scion of the powerful Tagge family. At that moment, a number of mercenaries working for Tagge enter the ruins, intending to force Okka into cooperating. Aphra initiates a firefight with the mercenaries, and Okka activates the large droid guardians of the ruins, causing them to attack the mercenaries. With the mercenaries distracted, Aphra, her associates, and Okka escape to the Ark Angel III, where Okka is convinced to help the crew find the Rings in return for receiving credit for the find. Explaining the history of the Rings, Okka identifies their location as Dianth in the Malitoris system, which had supposedly become corrupted by the artifact's curse.
