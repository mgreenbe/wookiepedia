Although it was unclear at which battle these weapons predominated, it was believed that the power of these carbines, combined with their high rate of fire played a considerable role in the rout of the Mandalorian forces. This would lend support for these carbines to have been used during the liberation of Onderon from the Mandalorians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
