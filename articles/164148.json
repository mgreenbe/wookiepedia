They were known to reach heights of 1.5 meters and were generally as wide as they were tall. They had to be transported unfrozen and were known to search anywhere they could for a snack; generally any form of meat. Yerkys ne Dago once ordered a smuggler and their crew to transport one of these creatures from Yelsain to Travnin when he was a month late with a payment. While on board their ship, the creature got loose and escaped into the engine spaces, managing to damage the Thelman Converter of the hyperdrive while it was attempting to get to the chief engineer to eat them. They managed to capture it, and later managed to feed it a homing beacon which led the Nadir Corporation to Dago."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
