During the war, the Sith Empire, under the command of Darth Malak, invaded and occupied the planet as part of its war effort against the Galactic Republic.  In 3956 BBY, upon arriving in the Taris system, the Republic cruiser Endar Spire was ambushed in a battle over the planet. Although the cruiser was destroyed, several troops were able to survive by fleeing to the surface of the ecumenopolis in escape pods. Among the survivors were soldier Carth Onasi and the amnesiac Sith Lord Revan, who possessed implanted memories of a Republic soldier. After they crash-landed, the pair took refuge in the Upper City's South Apartments, where Onasi hoped they would not be found by the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To prevent the escape of Jedi Padawan Bastila Shan, who had also fled the Endar Spire, the Sith imposed a planet-wide quarantine and began a search for her. During the occupation, Sith soldiers regularly raided and searched the apartments, to the annoyance of the residents. Several days after the occurrence of the battle overhead, the apartments were the subject of another raid conducted by a Human soldier and two Sentinel droids. When Ixgil complained, the Human became enraged and shot him in the chest three times, killing Ixgil."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Revan and Onasi witnessed the event and managed to defeat the Sith raiding party, saving Ixgil's friend.
