They were small, but could devour chunks of a humanoid, as was often the case when Gepta wanted to dispose of the corpse of a subordinate who displeased him. They were covered in black hair or fur, shunned the light and had multiple legs; the exact number is unknown, but at least three. They had no head or face, but a pinkish, gummy aperture into which they took their food. They made their bed in grey-green muck.
