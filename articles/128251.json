While the the resisters prepared for the last battle, an unexpected turn of events occurred. Raggold had, at an early age, betrayed the planet to the Empire, promising to win over Blackart with Imperial funds and thus allow them direct control over the planet. Consumed by the guilt over his betrayal and what it would lead to now that he had won the war, Raggold committed suicide. The Empire shortly thereafter resubjugated the world as planned, killing Mary in the process.
