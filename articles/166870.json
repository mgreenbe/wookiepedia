It was dangerous to fish for them in the deep underwater Abyss due to the risk of the fisher being eaten themselves by colo claw fish or opee. Tuggs originally fished for the creatures himself using traps in Lake Paonga, but he failed to get permission from the Boss of the Gungans, a move he would later characterize as a \"rookie mistake.\" Tuggs was brought into Otoh Gunga, where the Gungans established that he was not a threat and offered him a drink of Paonga Fresca. After that, Tuggs established a purchasing agreement with a Gungan who supplied him with yobshrimp at a reasonable price."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tuggs used his modified starship, in which he had cargo pods with built-in life-support systems, to transport live yobshrimp and other fresh ingredients that he served at his mobile restaurant. The yobshrimp were marinated and tossed over a cold noodle salad. Explorer Eloc Throno, author of the Traveler's Guide to Batuu, ate the dish on Batuu and named it one of his favorites to eat on warm days. Tuggs wrote about the dish himself; he included his Yobshrimp Noodle Salad recipe and anecedotes about yobshrimp in his cookbook, The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yobshrimp Noodle Salad debuted in the real world Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo at Disneyland's Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, when the theme park's opening in 2019.
