Ithes located the cube, but was upset to find that it did not work as expected. Ithes hired a spacer visiting the planet to investigate some local Jedi ruins. Ithes believed that the ruins held the information needed to activate the cube. The spacer traveled to the ruins and found several ancient tablets detailing the cube. After returning the tablets to Ithes, he was able to activate the cube, and as a reward, Ithes gave it to the spacer, on the condition that he would test it out for him by attempting to combine the various \"glowing\" items he found on Mustafar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ithes Olok was a non-playable character in the massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011.
