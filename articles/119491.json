During the Clone Wars, the Gotal homeworld of Antar 4 was occupied by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, which settled numerous Koorivar, Gossam, and other pro-Separatist settlers. Salikk joined a resistance movement headed by the Republic Intelligence operative Berch Teller, which included both Gotal and Koorivar loyalists.

The group opposed the Galactic Empire and harbored a special animosity for Tarkin, the architect of the Antar Atrocity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the next four years, Teller's insurgents accumulated a substantial arsenal of droid starfighters, warships, and communications equipment dating back to the Clone Wars era. They were aided by the Imperial Vice Admiral and Naval Intelligence Agency Director Dodd Rancit, who used his intelligence and underworld connections to supply the insurgents with equipment and weapons. Rancit was a rival of Tarkin who wanted to improve his standing in the Imperial Ruling Council.

They intended to used the powerful corvette to attack Imperial targets across the galaxy and broadcast them as holovids in order to inspire a rebellion. Vice-Admiral Rancit helped the insurgents by using the discovery of a communications cache on the former Separatist world of Murkhana to lure Tarkin and Darth Vader there. While the Imperials were investigating the cache, Salikk along with Teller, Cala, Anora, Hask, and Dr. Artoz seized the Carrion Spike and escaped offworld with the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to his piloting skills, Salikk was put in charge of piloting the Carrion Spike. While traveling through the edge of the Murkhana system, Salikk remarked that the ship flew herself.

Unknown to the rebels, Tarkin and Lord Vader had seized the Parsec Predator and were in hot pursuit. Vader was able to use his Sith meditation sphere to track down the rebels. After the insurgents realized that the Parsec Predator was matching their every move, they realized that their Imperial pursuers had left a tracking device aboard.

The rebels used the Carrion Spike's pintle cannons to disable the Imperial ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their successful raid, the Carrion Spike sustained some damage and Salikk worked hard to bring the stunned systems back to life. While the other rebels attended to the ship's damaged systems, Salikk reported that Galidraan Station had launched another squadron of starfighters. When Teller asked if they still had working sublight engines, Salikk expressed concern that the Imperial starfighters would sniff out their ion signatures. When Salikk suggested taking out Vader and Tarkin, Teller responded that the Imperials were replaceable and added that they needed to make the most out of the ship while they still had her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Teller and Artoz removed Vader's Sith meditation sphere, which they identified as a tracking device, Salikk complied with Teller's orders to move the ship to the jump-point.

For the operation, Teller disguised himself as an Imperial Commander named Abel LaSal. This led Salikk to joke about hearing good news from a human dressed as an Imperial. When Teller warned that they would have to flee at the first sign of trouble, Salikk asked where they would travel to. Teller told the rebels not to get ahead of themselves but to follow a plan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite Teller's efforts, the Phindian administrator of the Phindar tanker facility saw through the insurgent leader's disguise and alerted Tarkin. Tarkin instructed the Phindians to refuel the Carrion Spike as usual to avoid arousing the insurgents' suspicion. Before the rebels could finish refueling, Tarkin and Vader arrived aboard the Imperial escort carrier Goliath with the V-wing squadron Yellow Squadron.

When Cala expressed regret that their concealed explosive had not destroyed Darth Vader's black Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor and the V-wings, Salikk countered that they were lucky to escape. They then listened as Teller recounted Tarkin's ruthless career in the Outland Regions Security Force. Teller believed that the Emperor and his disciples Vader and Tarkin were in the process of subjugating the galaxy and outlined his plan to turn Tarkin's starship Carrion Spike from an Imperial symbol into an icon of resistance against the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While doing a pre-flight check of the instruments and systems, Salikk reported that there was a discrepancy in the fuel capacity since their trip to Phindar to obtain new fuel cells. While acknowledging that they had separated even though they had not finished refueling, Salikk said that the discrepancy still did not make sense. After some discussion, Teller sent Cala into the fuel bay to test the fuel cells they had obtained on Phindar. Cala subsequently discovered that one of the fuel cells contained a paralight tracker, a type of Imperial homing beacon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Based on this discovery, Salikk and his comrades predicted that the Empire had deployed forces to calculate the possible locations of their next jumps. Since they were unable to transmit false coordinates, Teller came up with a plan to send decoys to Obroa-skai in their place.

However, the Immobilizer 418 cruiser's gravity well projector malfunctioned, causing a massive hyperspace accident which killed 1,100 people. Despite the debacle, Vader and Tarkin managed to capture and question the crew of the Reticent, who revealed that they had been hired by Knotts to travel to Obroa-skai.

They decided to abandon the Carrion Spike but not before setting the abandoned ship on autopilot to Carida. Though Rancit had given Teller the green light to attack Carida's Imperial Academy, Teller rightfully suspected that Rancit was trying to lure them into a trap. In an attempt to cover his collaboration with Teller's insurgents, Rancit tried to destroy the Carrion Spike.

Though the escorts formed a defensive perimeter around the transports, they came under a withering attack from Teller's insurgents. However, the tide of the battle turned against the insurgents when Moff Tarkin arrived aboard the Imperial Star Destroyer Executrix. After dispatching starfighters and destroying the insurgents' Nebulon-B frigate, Tarkin attacked Teller's warship, crippling it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Teller, who was in a Z-95 Headhunter, counselled them to retreat, Salikk told his leader that they were already committed and that he had a better chance of escaping. Salikk also supported Anora when she urged Teller to flee to fight another day.
