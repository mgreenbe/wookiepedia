The elite group was hand selected by Sidious to lead Operation Shadow Hand in the Galactic Empire's quest to retake the galaxy. Sidious made sure that the group always contained seven warriors, and if one of their number was lost, he made sure to immediately appoint replacements. When a Dark Side Adept was selected into the brotherhood, they went through an initiation of sorts in which the adept was empowered with the dark side of the Force by Sidious himself. As the war accelerated, the Dark Side Elite began to take a more personal role in the war and were tasked with hunting down Luke Skywalker to prevent his interference in the Emperor's plans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Emperor's Dark Jedi were unable to match Skywalker's power, and with the help of other Jedi that Skywalker had found on his journeys, along with his sister Leia Organa Solo, the Elite were withered down to a paltry few. In fact, one of their number, Kam Solusar, defected to Skywalker's side, and began to use their powers against them. With a high number of failures on their record, the Elite holed themselves up in their headquarters at Bast Castle on Vjun. It was there that Skywalker and his Jedi besieged them, taking the fight to the enemy. The entire dark brotherhood was slain in the encounter with the exception of their leader Xecr Nist, who died in prison shortly afterward."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Origins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the death of Emperor Palpatine at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, many of his followers believed him gone for good. However, due to his many experiments with the dark side of the Force, he survived, and his spirit was able to make his way to a secure Imperial base on the planet Byss. It was there that Darth Sidious was reborn into one of his myriad of clone bodies that he had prepared on the dark world. Equipped with a healthy young body, Palpatine made plans to retake the galaxy. To accomplish this task, Palpatine put into motion a military strategy known as Operation Shadow Hand, designed to overwhelm the enemy. To lead this grand venture, the Emperor would need brutal warriors that were totally devoted to his will."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his writing of the Dark Side Compendium, Sidious had imagined a team of seven Dark Jedi. These warriors would be totally immersed in the dark side and led by the call of the Emperor. With his rebirth, Sidious put his dream into action. Among his many ranks of Dark Side Adepts, the Dark Lord of the Sith found his select group of seven. He chose the Dark Jedi Qaga Lok, a descendant of Jedi Knight Ulic Qel-Droma, both his Military Executor and replacement for his apprentice Darth Vader as the leader of the Imperial forces. After a humbling ordeal in front of the Emperor, Lok swore his devotion to Sidious and changed his name to Sedriss QL. The rest of the group was filled out by other hand selected warriors including the fallen Jedi Kam Solusar. The rest of the Dark Side Elite included Vill Goir, Krdys Mordi, Baddon Fass, Zasm Katth, and Kvag Gthull. Inquisitor Jerec\u2014who had read the Dark Side Compendium\u2014created his own corps of seven Dark Jedi, which included himself.

Unfortunately, as soon as it seemed that the Empire would be victorious on all fronts, the Emperor was killed by Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker and his sister, Leia Organa Solo. However, the Elite knew that their leader would return, and under Sedriss, they continued Operation Shadow Hand. Unfortunately, it was at this time that one of their number would finally come into contact with Skywalker. Kam Solusar, the son of a Clone Wars Jedi, found Skywalker at the spaceport above the planet Nespis VIII. The Jedi Master was able to best Solusar in a game of lightsider, eventually turning him away from the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The loss of Solusar became only a temporary setback as the Dark Side Elite quickly recruited another into their group, bringing their number back up to seven.

However, with the absence of the Emperor, the force of Sedriss' threats fell on deaf ears, and Balmorran Governor Beltane demanded independence from the Empire. In the following battle, Sedriss and his men were soundly defeated by Balmorran X-1 Viper droids. Sedriss was forced to sign a truce with Balmorra signifying their independence. The loss at Balmorra was a heavy blow to the Empire, and members of the Imperial Ruling Council began to call for Sedriss' execution. Sedriss and four of the other Dark Side Elite were recalled to the Emperor's Citadel on Byss."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the remaining two Elite, Baddon Fass and Zasm Katth, piloted the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Invincible to Nar Shaddaa in an attempt to capture Leia Organa Solo and her husband Han Solo.

The stubborn bounty hunter refused the darksiders' request and shot his way out of the encounter. However, Imperial spies were able to locate Solo's ship, the Millennium Falcon, and piloting their Star Destroyer over the city, Katth and Fass tried to capture the ship in a tractor beam. Unfortunately, some fancy flying by Solo kept the ship from locking onto the Falcon, and they instead ripped a large tower out of the city.

Sedriss witnessed the betrayal and took it upon himself to discipline the pair. As Sedriss executed the unfaithful traitors, the Emperor had finally found his way back into another clone body. Sidious congratulated his Executor for his loyalty and assigned him with a new task. Sedriss and his men would now be responsible for capturing Skywalker and his sister."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sedriss and the Dark Side Elite began to search for Skywalker, eventually locating Skywalker and Solusar on the planet Ossus. Unfortunately, at this time, Sidious received word on the fate of Fass and Katth.

However, Sedriss told Sidious that he knew the location of Skywalker, and that the Sith Lord should give him one last chance.

The Jedi's power in the Force allowed them to overcome the Dark Side Elite's men, and Sedriss and Goir were forced to continue the fight by themselves. However, Sedriss and Goir were outmatched by Skywalker's power. Goir was immediately cut in half by Solusar, and Sedriss was easily disarmed by Skywalker.

In order to neutralize Skywalker, the warriors released a group of Scarab Mark VI assassin droids which quickly attacked and poisoned the Jedi Master. Unfortunately, just as Tedryn-Sha and Mordi prepared to capture the wounded Skywalker, Leia Organa Solo and Jem Ysanna became aware of the presence of the dark warriors and attacked.

The battle resulted in the deaths of two more of the dark warriors, including the last of the original seven Dark Jedi in Kvag Gthull. Knowing that the battle was lost, and with the imminent arrival of Imperial troops, Nist and his two remaining Dark Jedi retreated to their Howlrunners. Luckily for the New Republic, Jedi Vima-Da-Boda was able to heal Skywalker of the poison introduced into his system by the Scarab droids. As the Imperial AT-ATs advanced, Skywalker and his fellow Jedi were rescued by a group of smugglers and an X-Wing flight group.

After learning from his physician that his clones were deteriorating at a rapid rate, he knew that he needed to introduce genetic material from a Jedi bloodline to restore the health of his clone's genetic make-up.

However, just as the Dark Side Elite were settling in, a large explosion rocked the front gate of the castle, creating an opening into the Dark Jedi's headquarters. Riding in the starship Jedi Explorer II, Skywalker alongside Empatojayos Brand, Kam Solusar, and Rayf Ysanna were ready to end the threat of the Dark Side Elite once and for all. Caught by surprise, Rayf and Brand easily killed two of the darksiders, and Solusar found himself in a fight for his life in a three on one battle. However, as Skywalker easily overpowered Nist in a duel, he found the time to push a statue of Darth Vader\u2014which had been erected by the late Sedriss\u2014on top of the Elite facing Solusar.

The structure also housed a carbon-freezing chamber, and apparently had the necessary resources for cloning tanks as well as the methods to genetically alter the created clones.
