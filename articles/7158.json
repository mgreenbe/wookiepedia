Her beauty garnered the attention of podracers Mars Guo and Teemto Pagalies, but she never seemed to notice them, regardless of their efforts surrounding the Boonta Eve Classic podrace. When Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn needed peggats to make a bet with junk dealer Watto, Ann introduced herself to Jinn and offered to arrange a meeting with Jabba so the Jedi Master could secure a money loan from him. Jinn agreed, and Ann led him to Jabba's private box where Jinn was forced to engage Jabba's champion in combat in exchange for the money he needed. Shortly afterwards, Ann and her sister gave Sebulba a pre-race massage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ann Gella was portrayed by British model Nifa Hindes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
