During that time, he became so frustrated with Pellaeon's tactics that he came close to assassinating the Supreme Commander with a blaster. However, his aim was spoiled by a Force nudge from Mara Jade Skywalker and the blaster bolt went harmlessly over Pellaeon's shoulder. After Flennic was taken into custody, Pellaeon agreed to overlook the attempt on his life as caused by the stresses of war, and allow the Moff to retain his post and his freedom, if he submitted to the Grand Admiral's proposals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He was beneficial in driving back the Yuuzhan Vong during the battle of Yaga Minor, through the use of his sector fleet.
