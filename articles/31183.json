Because of the destruction of his homeworld of Alderaan, Restin betrayed the Galactic Empire and plotted to defeat the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Learning of this, Cranwell warned Vader's Star Destroyer and turned against his superior. However, Restin captured him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Vader, pretending not to know Restin was a traitor, arrived at the scientist's base, Restin injected Cranwell with his weapon: a genetic serum that would turn its victims into Gamorreans. Though the infected Cranwell spread the infection to Vader's escort of two stormtroopers, the Sith Lord used the Force to hold them back. After forcing Restin to confess, he used the Force to make the scientist touch Cranwell and the other two Gamorreans, turning the scientist into one of them. Vader then departed as the three Gamorreans attacked their infected creator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
