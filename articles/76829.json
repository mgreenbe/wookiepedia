It was named for the sound made by an insect on the planet it was invented on. It was played by two people. Each player would get one card from a standard sabacc deck. They would then spend ten minutes talking to each other, attempting to determine whether their opponent's card was higher or lower than their own. During this conversation, insults were traditional and expected, however, a shrewd player might attempt to work into the conversation certain linguistic references to \"high\" and \"low\" in an attempt to gauge a reaction from their opponent. Once the time was up, the two players would place their bets as to whether their card was higher or lower than their opponent's. Whoever was correct won. Extremely high and extremely low cards swayed the odds. If, however, the two players tied, then the result was a push, but the casino still collected a 10% fee."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Charles Soule stated that he created the game because, a game played via conversation where the entire bet comes down to deciding whether your opponent's single card is higher or lower than yours, seemed like a good game for Lando Calrissian to play."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
