During the Galactic Civil War the continent was flat and riddled with ravines and canyons, with no resident life. Around 5 ABY, the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing took control of the Core Nine mining megafacility, the only of the facilities which had not been scrapped, suspecting that a remnant of the New Republic's 61st Mobile Infantry was looking to also use the facility. The 61st forces, realizing that the 204th's forces were diverting on Core Nine, launched an assault on the facility, with the fighter wing retreating aboard the sole freighter there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Scar of Troithe appeared in the 2020 novel Shadow Fall, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
