The Cluster allowed powerful Force-sensitives to amplify their powers, though it also pulled the Force from nearby life, which sometimes had deadly consequences. After its discovery, the cluster was occupied by a group of Nightsisters. The clan removed the cluster from its original site and caused it to become steeped in the dark side of the Force. When a salvage expert found a piece of the collection, the salvage operative Aloen Dresk felt a connection with it through the Force and stole it. The piece was eventually passed down his family until it became in possesion of Yeel Dresk. Yeel hired Corellian artist Quek Rai to add it to the Tragic Hope. The Tragic Hope would stand in the shop of the merchant Walisi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
