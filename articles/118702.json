It was a destructive carbine firing a rippling shockwave capable of tearing matter apart. During the Galactic Civil War, a number of these destructive, and by then outlawed carbines found their way into the hands of several spacers, treasure hunters and explorers on Mustafar. A group of pirates, settled on Mustafar, who called themselves the Coynite, modified a large number of SFOR Republic carbines, to cause an extreme temperature drop on the spot it hit, freezing the target.
