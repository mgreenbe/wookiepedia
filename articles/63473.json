Chief Hurdiss served aboard the Executor's command bridge during the pursuit and was present at his console when the warship lost the Millennium Falcon near the Anoat system. Vader ordered Admiral Firmus Piett\u2014the Star Dreadnought's commanding officer\u2014to detect all possible escape routes the Millennium Falcon could have taken, and to deploy Death Squadron in pursuit. Piett relayed the orders to deploy the Imperial fleet to Hurdiss, who responded and helped the Admiral carry out his commands.
