A hyperlane branching off the Senex-Juvex Loop connected it to the worlds of Tinallis and Tyluun. Home to the eponymous Sulphur Pits of Vulcar, its acrid atmosphere made employing humanoid workers to extract the world's oridium deposits barely cost-effective. Instead, Vulcar was primarily worked by droids of all types, including crab droids, reprogrammed to serve as miners until they froze up and rusted into scrap. In the year 15 BBY, an Intergalactic Droid Agency shuttle traveled to the Sulphur Pits of Vulcar after delivering the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO to the planet Dodz."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vulcar was first mentioned in Droids 1, the first issue of the Star Wars Legends Star Wars: Droids comic series published by Star Comics, an imprint of Marvel Comics, which was first published on April 1, 1986.
