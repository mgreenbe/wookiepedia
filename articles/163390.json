Their first attempt at marriage three years earlier had been interrupted by the Empire, led by Triclops, who attacked the attendants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The gala event took place six weeks after the battle at Cantham House, the Alderaanian Consulate on Coruscant, with Chief of State Mon Mothma officiating. C-3PO was the ring-bearer, although he had been stuffed in a closet up until the start of the ceremony. Earlier, C-3PO announced that Han's great-grandfather, Korol Solo, was the king of Corellia, before later discovering that Korol was in fact a pretender and was hanged for his crime. The best man, Luke Skywalker, who was running late after the shuttle driver mistakenly dropped him off at the Aldereenian Consulate, ran into Threepio and turned the droid off to prevent him from spoiling the wedding. A thousand guests attended, with billions more across the galaxy \"attending\" through HoloNet coverage. Footage of the marriage was replayed on the HoloNet for weeks after the event and drew huge positive reactions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the wedding, Yarna d'al' Gargan danced the Dance of the Seventy Violet Veils and was spotted by a designer, becoming the model for his jeweled brassieres."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 1993 novel Prophets of the Dark Side, the sixth and final book of the Jedi Prince saga, ended with a wedding between Han Solo and Leia Organa, which took place in the Grand Audience Chamber on Yavin 4 in the year 5 ABY. However, the Jedi Prince series was discontinued and the wedding has been disregarded by canon in favor of the one depicted in Dave Wolverton's novel The Courtship of Princess Leia. Paul Davids, coauthor of the Jedi Prince saga, had stated that the next book in the series would have had the wedding interrupted by Imperials.
