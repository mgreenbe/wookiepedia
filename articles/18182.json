When Admiral Gilad Pellaeon refused to comply with the Sith Lord Darth Caedus' orders to ignore the ceasefire and attack Fondor, Tahiri Veila assassinated him with the support of the Moff Council, including Quille and Rosset. The assassination instigated a mutiny aboard the Bloodfin among the crew, stormtroopers, and other security forces. The Bloodfin was then boarded by Mandalorian Protectors, which resulted in the deaths of many of the ship's crew including its security forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
