While Senators served the interests of an entire world or sector, representatives were chosen to give voice to a minority population or political group from that specific world. Though only senators were allowed to vote or introduce legislation in the Senate, a representative from the senator's world or sector could perform these duties in the senator's stead should they take a leave of absence or be otherwise unavailable. Jar Jar Binks served as a representative for the Gungan people under the tutelage of Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
