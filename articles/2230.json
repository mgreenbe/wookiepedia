The X-wings would then pull away, diverting attention away from the speedy A-wings as the Imperial convoy turned to counter a flanking maneuver by the X-wings. The A-wings would consequently have an open area to attack the convoy, often by launching concussion missiles against the convoy and pulling away."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The maneuver was used at the Battle of Qat Chrystac."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Pesitiin, Imperial Admiral Gilad Pellaeon used it against pirate attackers masquerading as Bel Iblis, in the final days of the Galactic Civil War. Pellaeon was attempting to arrange peace talks, and by using the maneuver successfully with Preybird-class starfighters in the role of the X-wings, and proton torpedoes in place of the A-wings, he confirmed his attacker was not Bel Iblis, whom Pellaeon knew would never be fooled by his own maneuver. This observation allowed the peace talks to proceed and to eventually end the war between the Galactic Empire and the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
