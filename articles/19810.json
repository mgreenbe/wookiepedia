Bowcaster troopers could be improved with technology from institutions such as War Centers and fortresses.

A group of at least ten bowcaster troopers were trained on the advice of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and led by the Wookiee Chewbacca to attack a nest of gundarks, a predatory species on Alaris Prime. The bowcaster troopers shot down two gundarks on their march to the nest but encountered B1-Series battle droids of the Trade Federation already eliminating the creatures. The droids attacked the Wookiees after dispatching all the gundarks, but the bowcaster troopers defeated them instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After that incident the leader of the colonists; Attichitcuk, set out to scout the Trade Federation's activity on Alaris Prime, taking two bowcaster troopers with him. On his return trip to a Wookiee base Attichitcuk was ambushed by a group of battle droids, who killed his trooper companions and critically injured him. To save his father Chewbacca mustered a force of at least ten bowcaster troopers and led them into the wilderness, while more bowcaster troopers were trained at the base in order to protect it. As Chewbacca and his company returned to the base with his wounded father the newly trained troops started on the path they had left on, with both groups surrounding and destroying another group of battle droids. Once Attichitcuk safely arrived at the base the bowcaster troopers had to fight off an attack from three droidekas."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Aggression against the Trade Federation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chewbacca then became the new leader of the Wookiee colonists while his father recovered, and he began a campaign to remove the Trade Federation from Alaris Prime, starting with an outpost that contained a droid-building troop center. He trained an army of twelve Wookiees, including bowcaster troopers, mounted dragon troopers, and thermal detonator troopers. At the outpost the dragon and thermal detonator troopers destroyed the walls surrounding it while Chewbacca and the bowcaster troopers fired on the five B1 battle droids that guarded it. After breaking through the walls all the Wookiees concentrated their fire on the troop center and destroyed it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At least two bowcaster troopers were present at a camp run by Chewbacca when it was attacked by battle droids commanded by LUH-989.
