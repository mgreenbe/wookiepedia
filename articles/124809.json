He was a neighbor and friend of Cliegg Lars, and was crippled by Tusken Raiders when he assisted Lars in searching for his missing wife Shmi. Late in his life, Dorr bought the abandoned Imperial droid 3B6-RA-7. When the destruction of the first Death Star made the droid a collectors item by destroying the majority of the rest of the RA-7 line, Dorr sold the droid at Eport for over a thousand times what he had paid for it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
