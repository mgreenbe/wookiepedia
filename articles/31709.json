Small squads of these soldiers could easily handle mobs of fifty or more, due to their crowd control specific equipment. Each trooper was equipped with a thruster pack, which mounted a heavy blaster module, a capture claw, and a supercharged taser. These highly maneuverable thruster packs enabled the troopers to fly at speeds up to 200 km per hour. However, the vehicles were also relatively quiet, which led to their occasional use by the Imperial Espionage Division. These stormtroopers came from shock troopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Crowd Control Stormtrooper was created by Hasbro in 1996, as a Star Wars figure in the Power of the Force 2 line."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
