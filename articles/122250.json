The droids were able to create a three-dimensional map of underground rock formations, which was useful in optimizing mineral extraction. After the Galactic Empire bought out the Ollet homestead, they sent in these droids in order to survey the area for conversion to mining. When Beck Ollet and his friends Zare Leonis and Merei Spanjaf paid a visit to the jogan fruit orchards there, they discovered that a number of the droids had been set to explode. The groups' visit had inadvertently interrupted this sabotage attempt, as the bombers hadn't had a chance to set the primers. Leonis informed the authorities of the sabotage and they defused the explosives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
