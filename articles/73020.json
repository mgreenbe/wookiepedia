Widely regarded as a fine ship that suffered from a high price and limited utility when it breached into a crowded and well established market, most KST-100's remain in operation, serving as military and government transports, personal starships for the wealthy, and as ships for smugglers who specialize in small and sensitive cargoes. One notable KST-100 was the Kasmiri, used by the Kalleran scoundrel Janus Kasmir."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Specifications"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A dashing and bold ship, the KST-100 had a small saucer-shaped hull reminiscent of other CEC designs, four powerful ion engines that gave it a top speed comparable to a TIE fighter, a tandem cockpit that provided an unparalleled field of view through numerous viewports, variable geometry winglets to provide stability and maneuverability in atmosphere, and two distinctive forward booms that housed sensors and the craft's twin light laser cannons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Internally the main hull was comprised of passenger facilities, with four small but well appointed staterooms surrounding a common galley and lounge. A small engineering station was located along the aft bulkhead, while a single small and cramped crew berth was located just beneath the cockpit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nearly more starfighter than freighter, the KST-100's speed, maneuverability, and decent shielding made it a capable, albeit expensive and short-lived, starship. Further, like many CEC designs, the KST-100 was highly modifiable, and contained a number of customizable hardpoints and systems - preserving CEC's legacy of highly modifiable ships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
