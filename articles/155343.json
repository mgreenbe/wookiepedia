When the negotiations were completed, he departed on the cruiser to the planet Teth to assist the Jedi Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano in the rescue of Rotta. Kenobi set out to the planet on his Delta-7B Aethersprite-class starfighter, accompanied by several V-19 Torrent starfighters. During the mission, Commander Cody, who was stationed on the cruiser was told by Kenobi to prepare the gunships for ground assault, to which he ordered four LAAT/i-gunships to launch from the ship's hangar bay."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the ship was attacked by a Separatist Munificent-class star frigate and a battle ensued. When Skywalker and Tano arrived on the Twilight, the Star Destroyer's crew assumed them to be an enemy ship and fired on them. After Skywalker identified himself, Admiral Yularen ordered the main hangar door to be opened and the deflector shield to be lifted.
