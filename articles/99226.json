The emitter barrel had all of the controls mounted onto it which included the activator, blade length and intensity control, and the blade power adjust. The weapon's radiator grooves were separated from the body of the weapon by a cut-back portion which also held the internal adegan crystal. Immediately below was the main body was a ridged handgrip, which thickened near the bottom of the section where the charging port was, concealed by the belt clip. The pommel was a black sphere and housed the power cell reserve cap which had six evenly spaced protrusions around the pommel. However, there were a few minor details such as the blade power being controlled by a gold knob."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being promoted to Jedi Knight, Obi-Wan Kenobi rebuilt his lightsaber in the style of his first lightsaber, destroyed during the Second Battle of Theed in 32 BBY in his duel with Sith Lord Darth Maul."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This model was created after Kenobi briefly wielded his former master's lightsaber and it stayed at Kenobi's side for a decade, and saw action during many missions.
