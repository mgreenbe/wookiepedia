Though their monarchy was hereditary, the rightful king could not be crowned unless he presented the royal scepter to an official known as the Keeper of the Tower at the first sun of the equinox. During the early Imperial era, the rightful Crown Prince of Tammuz-an, Mon Julpa, was mind-wiped by his vizier Ko Zatec-Cha, disguised as an android, and left on the planet Tyne's Horky. Zatec-Cha's intent was to take the scepter and present it to the Keeper of the Tower, thus becoming king."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After regaining his memories, thwarting Zatec-Cha's plans, and returning to the throne (thanks to the loyalist Tammuz-an Sollag Den, the Humans Jann Tosh and Jessica Meade, and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO), Mon Julpa tried to unite his planet's two feuding races by marrying Princess Gerin, daughter of Lord Toda of the Outer Territories. When the pirate Gir Kybo Ren-Cha kidnapped the princess, Toda worked with Julpa and his allies to free her. The newfound unity of the two cultures was strengthened by this struggle against a common threat, as well as by the love between the Mon Julpa and Gerin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
