He operated a droid industrial factory on Affa independent of the Hutt authorities, and had state of the art defenses, and ensured his guards were loyal and dangerous. In 21 BBY, during the Clone Wars, Noggox sold droid brains to the Galactic Republic. One of his freighters was intercepted by the pirate Dool Pundar, although the freighter had been insured and Noggox had instructed the captain what to do in such a situation. A distress call was routed to Coruscant, the Republics capital, and Supreme Chancellor agreed to provide escorts for the remaining shipment. The Jedi Nuru Kungurama was sent, along with his clone trooper squad. Before the Jedi could arrive, Noggox's guards found an intruder at the fortress. The intruder, the Dark Acolyte Savage Opress, warned Noggox was in danger because Count Dooku, the leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, knew that Noggox was dealing with the Jedi. Opress then proceeded to slaughter Noggox and his entire staff, although Noggox tried to negotiate with the Acolyte. When Kungurama arrived, he and his squad found the remains of the massacre when they arrived, but continued their mission by taking the freighter to Fondor. Republic investigators later concluded that the massacre had been perpetrated by a lone assassin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Noggox first appeared in The Clone Wars: Opress Unleashed, a 2011 comic released as a promotion on Free Comic Book Day.
