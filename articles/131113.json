The first two discs were an overview of the first five Star Wars films released (Episodes I, II, IV, V, and VI) and the third was dedicated to behind-the-scenes footage. In 2005, a DVD version was included with some initial copies of the Revenge of the Sith DVD only at Wal-Mart stores in the United States. The DVD was presented in full frame with Dolby Digital 2.0 sound and ran 1 hour in total. This version contained only the content from the first two VideoNow discs: The Story of Anakin Skywalker and The Story of Luke Skywalker. (As it was produced in 2002, the footage used contains no scenes from Revenge of the Sith nor does it have the changes contained in the 2004 DVD Special Edition releases.)"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
