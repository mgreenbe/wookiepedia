A similar vehicle, the groundlimo, was a ground-effect vehicle and not a repulsorcraft. Under Supreme Slavelord Trioculus, officers of the Galactic Empire commonly rode in landspeeder limousines when traveling on Kessel. Imperial Remnant Head of State Jagged Fel had one in use in 43 ABY, for which Baxton was the driver. The limousine was also rather tall, almost completely hiding Jedi Knight Bazel Warv\u2014who had developed an enigmatic psychosis and had been subsequently incapacitated atop the limousine\u2014from view."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
