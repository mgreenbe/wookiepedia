Founded by Deland Tyerell after the death of his father Ratts in the 32 BBY Boonta Eve Classic, the Foundation sought to have the sport outlawed across the galaxy. Although podracing was supported by powerful financial backers, including the Hutt Clan, the group's campaign gained traction in the waning years of the Galactic Republic, gathering new supporters as various criminal aspects surrounding the sport came to light. By 22 BBY, after several famous racers were arrested for various crimes, podracing itself was outlawed within the Core Worlds and viewership dropped by more than fifty percent thanks to the efforts of the Tyerell Foundation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ratts Tyerell Foundation was incorporated into the Star Wars canon in 2015 by the fifty-first issue of Star Wars: Build the Millennium Falcon.
