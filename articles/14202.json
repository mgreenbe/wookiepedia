During the assault, the Yuuzhan Vong deployed the Yo'gand Core tactic which involved using a Dovin basal to pull Hosk Station into a collision course with Kalarba. In response, the New Republic began evacuating the populations of both worlds. Fortunately, many lives were saved before both the station and planet were destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the space battle, Lieutenant Jaina Solo, along with Rogue Squadron and their Chiss allies, engaged the Yuuzhan Vong fleet. However, the Yuuzhan Vong then assaulted the New Republic flagship the Bothan Assault Cruiser Champion. Jaina attempted to defend the ship though the Yuuzhan Vong succeeded in destroying it. The explosion destroyed Jaina Solo's X-wing though she managed to eject and was eventually retrieved. Unfortunately for her, she suffered injuries that temporarily blinded her.
