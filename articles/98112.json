Sick and tired of this back and forth business, Jabba told Norba he would whisper his answer to her. When Norba leaned in close to listen, Jabba's tongue snaked out and grabbed Norba, pulling her through the window in the cell door and directly into his gaping maw. He then proceeded to swallow her whole. After a brief struggle, she dropped the key right into Jabba's hand, allowing the Hutt to escape the dungeon.
