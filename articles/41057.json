During his career as a pirate he worked with the starship Pillage, owned by fellow pirate Larken, and another pirate vessel named Trust Me, in an attempt to capture the Helix\u2013class light interceptor, Kizbon's Box based on a tip from a female named Sahr. The three vessels waited near the space station, Darknon Station, under the cover of a magnetic storm in order to ambush their target, who they believed to be unarmed. When the Box arrived the three ships moved into attack it, but much to Druug's horror they soon discovered their mark was not quite as harmless as they'd been led to believe, secretly possessing armaments including proton torpedos.
