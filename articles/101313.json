Located on the Apalis Coast, it served as the farm facilities for House Organa where they made their wine, and was served by the nearby Apalis Fields. During the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, the Empire-allied House Thul occupied the Vinerium during the Alderaan Civil War as a staging ground against the Republic-allied House Organa's palace. A Republic-allied individual destroyed House Thul's illegal CryoBan technology and drove back the Thul forces from the Vinerium, defeating the Sith apprentices that the Empire had sent to aid House Thul. Thanks to the individual's efforts, House Organa and the Republic were able to reclaim the Vinerium and push back the enemy from the coast."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Organa Vinerium was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011.
