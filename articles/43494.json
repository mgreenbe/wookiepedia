Piloted by experienced black-armored stormtrooper scouts, the speeders featured heavy blasters and powerful engines. The speeder bikes were black in color and featured red stripes that matched the red stripes featured on their pilots' breastplates. Laser cannons were placed on either side of the speeder's nose, and two more cannons that pivot up and down were placed between the 'fins' on the nose. The engine could be accessed by lifting the paneling in front of the speeder's control sticks. The bikes were generally used for high-risk missions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were carried aboard Resurgent-class Star Destroyers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The elite speeder bike and its uniquely colored stormtrooper rider were first introduced in the marketing campaign that led up the release of the 2015 film Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
