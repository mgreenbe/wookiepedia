Jabba often fed his enemies or those who upset him to the rancor Pateesa and enjoyed watching him devour those who had upset him. When the Twi'lek dancer Oola displeased the Hutt shortly before the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, he dropped her into the pit below his throne room where he kept Pateesa, and the rancor devoured her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after Oola's death, the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker arrived at the palace with the intent of rescuing his friend Han Solo, whom Jabba held captive. However, Jabba rejected his demands and threw Skywalker into the pit along with the unlucky Gamorrean guard Jubnuk. Pateesa quickly ate the guard, but Skywalker proved to be more of a challenge: the young Jedi Knight, when he first attempted to eat him, placed a large femur between his jaws, forcing the rancor to let him go before snapping it in two with little effort. He tried to devour him again, but Luke smashed his hand in self-defense with a rock. Luke, out of options due to the rancor's handlers preventing him from escaping, waited until the rancor followed him into his small holding pen at the back of the pit and smashed the control panel with a skull that belonged to one of Pateesa's earliest victims, Bidlo Kwerve, dropping the heavy door, piercing and crushing the beast's skull, killing him. As Pateesa died, he moaned weakly, with Malakili rushing to his aid, before breaking down in tears."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pateesa's death greatly upset Jabba, who immediately demanded Skywalker and his companions be executed at the Great Pit of Carkoon upon witnessing how a mere human was able to kill his beast. However, Jabba's decision ultimately sealed his fate, as he perished above the pit whereas the Jedi and his allies escaped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Malakili was devastated by the rancor's death, believing that he had failed him and no longer had purpose in life. The trainer was also bitter towards Skywalker for killing his pet and companion. Malakili found a new purpose in life when he encountered the vigilante lawman and Mayor of Freetown Cobb Vanth, who enlisted his services in looking after the Huttlet Borgo and taming two rontos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pateesa, then identified simply as Jabba's rancor, first appeared in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi and was later identified in Chuck Wendig's 2016 novel Aftermath: Life Debt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally, Pateesa was intended to be a man in a suit, but the results weren't satisfyingly realistic, so it was filmed in the form of a rod puppet.
