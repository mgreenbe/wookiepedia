It theorized that social groups cut off from their larger society were forced to revert to a more primitive state to ensure the survival of their group. Sentientologists claimed that the Bharhulai tribe of Socorro were an example of the theory, under the assumption that the tribe were the descendants of the survivors of one of the colony ships that settled Socorro. The ship crashed and the group were cut off from their fellow Colonists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
