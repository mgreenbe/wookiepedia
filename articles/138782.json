During a mission to infiltrate the Morak Imperial refinery Din Djarin was accosted by Imperial officer Valin Hess. Former Imperial sharpshooter Migs Mayfeld attempted to help Djarin by telling Valin Hess that Djarin had suffered ear canal damage.  He then tried to guide Djarin away by saying that they had to fill out TPS reports so they could recharge the power coils.
