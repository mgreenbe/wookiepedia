Between these two sections was strung a series of the modular Xizor Transport Systems cargo containers, connected via a small, flexible coupling section. The cargo freighter had substantial hauling power, and it was able to easily pull long chains that sometimes included even the Class-J cargo container, the largest in the Xizor series."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With this capacity, however, came the need for protection from piracy. Possessing neither warhead launchers nor laser cannons, the cargo freighter lacked any form of offensive capability. It was was equipped with a strong shielding system. However, its hull was not as robust as the Virella cargo tanker as it was less than half as durable as its sister class."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
