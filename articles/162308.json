The vurgats were considered to be the highest of all Tarasin ceremonies and details of how to perform them were handed down by the Tarasin from generation to generation. The rituals were held in select groves of trees on the planet Cularin that the Tarasin believed to be sacred, the ceremonies would only take place when the Tarasin leaders saw the importance of a vurgat as beyond what was normal.
