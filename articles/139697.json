Talzin arrived on the moon as the ritual began, but she was confronted by Jedi Master Mace Windu and Jar Jar Binks. Talzin summoned her sword from the mist and engaged the Jedi, but Jar Jar managed to free Julia and shatter the sphere containing the stolen life force, causing a massive explosion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
