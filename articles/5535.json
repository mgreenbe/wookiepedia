Emperor Palpatine's favorite Sith, Darth Vader, has a new rival, the 18-year-old Countess Mara Jade Claria, whom Palpatine has schooled in the Force to assume the special agent role of \"Emperor's Hand.\" Zahn depicts the intrepid Rebel quartet and the turbulent development of the Alliance while revealing the Human faces behind the stormtrooper armor of Daric and company, who become unexpected allies of Han and friends once the troopers are on the run after killing a superior officer. The author also underscores Mara Jade's tough-girl charm and blossoming Imperial clout against the background of Palpatine's dedication to Imperial domination and his insidious influence on his minions.

The brutal extermination of Alderaan not only demonstrated the magnitude of their murderous power, but served as a chilling testament to their resolve to crush the Rebel uprising. Standing against them, Skywalker, Solo, and the Princess remain uncertain opponents. Luke is gifted and brave, but unschooled in the power he possesses. Han has doubts about waging someone else's war\u2014and his contentiousness is one more burden for Leia to bear as she struggles to help keep the Rebellion alive. The three have been sent to mediate a dispute between Rebel Alliance factions in Shelsha sector\u2014agitating matters by forcing Han to deal not only with pirates, but with his more dreaded enemy, politics.

Without warning, they are confronted from behind by Major Drelfin, who first demands to know why they are not in uniform, and, on learning LaRone's identity, plans to bring him up on charges for disobedience of duty. LaRone stands his ground, pointing out that the ISB has no legal authority over Army troopers. A scuffle ensues, and Drelfin draws a small hold-out blaster, forcing LaRone to kill him in self-defense. Quickly realizing that his chances of a fair hearing are slim to nonexistent, LaRone decides he has no choice but to desert from the ship. Knowing that they will be implicated as accomplices, the other four - who already share LaRone's misgivings about Imperial service, especially after the massacre on Teardrop - agree to go with him. They commandeer the ISB's specially-outfitted Suwantek freighter and, by impersonating Drelfin, LaRone manages to bluff the bridge crew into dropping the Reprisal out of hyperspace just long enough for them to escape. Quiller, their pilot, sets a course for Drunost, just so they can ensure they have adequate supplies.

The five rogue stormtroopers feel obligated to stop the corruption, and LaRone reasons that a show of Imperial force will be enough to compensate for the fact that the patrollers outnumber them by several hundreds.  Sure enough, the sight of fully-armored stormtroopers is enough to cow most of the patrollers and energize the oppressed people, and a few well-aimed blaster shots dispatch the corrupt chief, Cav'Saran, and his top lieutenants, when they try to resist arrest.  LaRone reinstates the former police chief, Colonel Atmino, who asks for their unit number so the people can send their thanks to the Imperial sector governor.  LaRone implies that he and his men are a covert unit, acting unknown to the sector authorities, but \"mostly we're known as the Hand of Judgment.\"  Atmino passes on intelligence that Cav'Saran had links to a local pirate gang, if they want to investigate further.  Privately, LaRone and the others agree that they do.

Using her override code as Emperor's Hand, she orders the Reprisal to divert from its current mission, pick her up and assist her in locating the pirates' base.  Unknown to her, Mara's message sparks panic aboard the Reprisal by its Captain, Kendel Ozzel, and the deceased Major Drelfin's superior, Colonel Vak Somoril.  The two of them hurl blame at each other, but eventually agree that both their careers will be ruined if an Imperial agent boards the Reprisal and discovers the desertion of five stormtroopers and the theft of the Suwantek.

To Leia it sounds too good to be true, and Chivkyrie assures her that he has proof of Choard's intentions from the governor's own right-hand man, Chief Administrator Vilim Disra.  As long as the Alliance can coordinate simultaneous attacks in other parts of the galaxy to soften Imperial Center's retaliation when Choard secedes, Shelsha sector can be made into an impregnable bastion for the Alliance.

Disra tries to maintain a calm facade during the meeting, but Leia senses something wrong and cuts the meeting short.  Chivkryie starts to reprimand her for her rudeness, until one of his agents in the city informs him that Disra has returned to the governor's palace and locked down the spaceport, trapping them on Shelkonwa.
