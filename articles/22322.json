The troopers successfully ambushed Gerrera's camp on Onderon, killing several insurgents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Gerrera had already left the camp by the time of the squad's arrival. CT-9904 ordered the troopers to execute the prisoners, but ES-01 refused to comply with a command to kill unarmed civilians, and was consequently killed by the commander. The squad's remaining members obeyed CT-9904, executing the prisoners while the clone watched. Despite the loss of ES-01 and the failure to locate Gerrera, Tarkin and Rampart considered the mission a successful field test."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
