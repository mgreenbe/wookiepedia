Graballa feared that he would be unable to recognize Zander, Kordi or Rowan since humans aged faster than Hutts. However, Yeppau then suggested that Graballa could use the Freemaker's battle droid Roger to find the Freemakers and Skywalker's starfighter instead.

After landing, Graballa and his henchmen discovered a droid control ship, which they used to hijack Roger, who was traveling in a TUG-b13 with Zander's daughter Moxie Freemaker, the Drabatan Ka-Pao, and Maz Kanata.

Though Graballa and his minions managed to summon Roger, Moxie and her friends managed to access the droid control ship's control panel and retake control of Roger.

Graballa was about 462 years old following the Battle of Hoth but still saw himself at the prime of his life. Graballa was discontented with his life of managing an ore mine in the Belgaroth asteroid field and wanted to run a beachside resort and buffet. Unable to obtain start-up capital from Jabba, Graballa decided to kidnap the Force-sensitive Rowan Freemaker and force the boy to reveal the location of the scattered pieces of the Kyber Saber, an ancient weapon. As an ambitious and avaricious crime lord, Graballa was willing to feed Rowan to his pet nexu Smiley in order to force his cooperation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Graballa's desire to start a beachside resort and buffet led him to send his bounty hunters to hunt Rowan. At times, Graballa grew impatient with the incompetence of his hunters Dengar, Baash, and Raam.

However, Graballa underestimated the guile of Naare, who turned on Graballa after collecting six of the crystals and learning the location of the final one.

Graballa's ambitions were frustrated by his incompetent employees particularly Baash and Raam, who posed more of a liability.
