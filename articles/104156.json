After the Great Sith War ended, House Pelagia began selling these well-equipped gunships to outside buyers, which significantly increased their family holdings with profits from the design. A number of these ships were sold off just prior to the Mandalorian Wars and bought by wealthy individuals and bounty hunters. The ships performed so well, that the eccentric Baron Karoll Cilarnus sought to create a private version with twice the armaments. The result of this project would become known as the Moomo Brothers's personal transport, the Moomo Williwaw."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
