Instead, they sent a team of advisors\u2014Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Commander Ahsoka Tano, and Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\"\u2014to train the Onderonian fighters. The Jedi and Captain Rex taught them proper techniques and strategies for taking on the battle droid army, and, through their efforts, the rebels began to turn the tide. Gerrera came to resent that the rebels chose Steela as their leader, and he was soon captured in an ill-concocted solo effort to rescue the deposed King Ramsis Dendup from the Separatists. They were both rescued by the rebels, who eventually mounted a final battle against the Separatists. Through their efforts, the rebels liberated their world and returned Dendup to the throne. The fight, however, came at a personal cost: Steela was killed during the final battle, and Gerrera was left to mourn his sister\u2014feeling responsible for her death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the end of the Clone Wars, the Republic was transformed into the Galactic Empire.

Gerrera fought against the Imperial Military and led a resistance group known as the Partisans, a militant organization that some considered an extremist organization with terrorism tactics, and operated under the codename, \"Stoneface\". His resistance cell, a continuation of his Onderonian resistance, was one of the first in the group of cells that formed the Rebel Alliance. He was later involved in the early campaigns of the Rebel Alliance, by which time his more-extreme tactics had come to stand in stark contrast with those of Alliance leaders Bail Organa and Mon Mothma.

In 24 BBY, thousands of star systems seceded from the Republic and formed their own galactic government, the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Within two years\u2014in 22 BBY\u2014the Republic and Confederacy broke into all-out war\u2014a Clone War\u2014and King Dendup, wishing to keep his people out of the conflict, sided with neither the Republic and its newly-acquired Grand Army of clone troopers, nor the Confederacy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not more than a year after the opening salvos of the Clone Wars were fired during the First Battle of Geonosis, the Clone War continued to sustain itself on battlefronts across the galaxy.

And to make matters worse for Saw, King Dendup was ousted from his royal throne and replaced with King Sanjay Rash, a \"puppet leader\" who answered directly to Count Dooku. King Rash enacted a Royal Proclamation that declared any who tried to usurp him from his throne would be declared a terrorist.

Around this time, Lux Bonteri, the son of the late Mina Bonteri, the former senator of Onderon in the Republic's Galactic Senate joined Saw and his resistance. Having obtained enough armor, blasters, and various other small arms to supply their forces, Saw, Steela, and Bonteri plotted to take back Iziz for Onderon; the rebel leaders, however, after a number of small skirmishes with battle droid forces, came to the realization that they were both under-equipped and had neither the training nor skills to wage open war against the Confederacy. Therefore, Saw and Bonteri reached out to the Republic, requesting aid. As a result, the esteemed Jedi High Council on the Republic's capital world, Coruscant, heard Saw and Bonteri's story via HoloNet transmission. Diminutive Grand Master Yoda promised that the Jedi Order would find a way to aid them. A short time later, the freedom fighters were alerted to an intrusion in the jungle Sector S-11 and Steela led a squad to investigate.

Saw and Bonteri teamed for the exercise, but sharing in a tense rivalry, incidentally sabotaged one another by refusing to cooperate. Disgusted, Saw ridiculed Bonteri for being a \"terrible soldier,\" which disappointed the Jedi advisors. As the day wore on, Saw grew increasingly frustrated, berating Steela for regularly attending to Bonteri, with whom she shared a mutual attraction.

Protected by a deflector shield, droidekas were immune to blaster bolts. Skywalker, thus, indicated that a slowly rolled droid popper was the best way to disable the droids. Confident in his abilities, Saw stepped up and attempted the technique first; however, he rolled the grenade too quickly and failed to penetrate the shield. Bonteri tried next and succeeded. Later, after many tries and much coaching from Tano, Saw managed to roll the grenade at the right speed and pierce the shield."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly thereafter, the Jedi advisors moved on to coaching the rebels on how to properly utilize their blaster rifles. Steela, a sniper, impressed the Jedi with her skill. But while practicing, she was alerted to the fact that their encampment was under attack.

Saw narrowly avoided being taken out by a missile blast from a B2-HA super battle droid, and advanced onto the frontline of the skirmish and returned fire. At a signal from the Jedi and Steela, Saw and other rebels heaved disruptor explosives into the path of the droids. Still outgunned, Steela loosed the dalgos, falumpasets, and tee-muss mammals, which stampeded and trampled the remaining droids. With only the armored tank remaining, Saw and Bonteri tried once more to disable the tank. On this attempt, however, the rebels worked together and succeeded in destroying the tank with a pair of thermal detonators. Elated in their first victory, Saw quipped that Bonteri looked more like a soldier than a politician, due to the grit that had come to cover him during the altercation.

Saw and the rebels took as many chances as they could to disrupt battle droid patrols and destroy droids harassing Iziz civilians, engaging in as many as five engagements in a single day\u2014sometimes, even in high-traffic areas, such as Malgan Market.

Kenobi and Tano, however, believed that the public perception of Saw's rebels had not gone as planned; the people were growing ever more fearful of the sudden violence that had besieged their city. Saw, however, believed that the people were fearful simply because the droids were still active\u2014that he hadn't done enough to demobilize the Confederates. Steela and Bonteri added that they had to assure the general populace that the freedom fighters were just that: fighting for the freedom of the people. Steela believed the rebels had to win the hearts and minds of the people to gain their trust, something Saw did not understand. In order to prove to the civilians that the rebels could oust the Separatists, Bonteri proposed that they strike the Onderon power generator.

At dusk, Saw, Tano, Bonteri, and Steela scouted out the power generator complex. Lying prone on a rooftop, Bonteri explained that if they could manage to disable the power compound it would cause a city-wide power outage, which, given time, would bring the Droid Army to a literal standstill: the droids operated independently of a control computer, but still had to recharge periodically using power cells. However, before assaulting the generators, the rebels concluded that they needed to know more about the compound. Saw took it upon himself to gather the desired intel: he quickly descended the building and brutishly ripped the head off of a patrolling \"clanker\" in the street and returned to the rooftop where a robolobotomy was performed using a Republic-provided device. From the holographic images provided from the cranial unit, Saw and the rebels came to the conclusion that any attack on the compound would be futile; the droids were too numerous.

The rebels let the commander call for reinforcements, hoping that the Separatists would deliver aid in the form of an Assault Tank. First, however, a pair of droidekas were sent in.

Saw dove behind the disabled droideka, but was pinned down, so Steela leaped into action and deposited a droid popper gently into the droideka's shield bubble, disabling it. Just then, the desired Assault Tank rumbled onto the street and fired on the rebels. Saw and Bonteri rapidly closed the distance between them and the tank, taking down its B2-series super battle droid escorts on the way, and disabled the repulsorcraft using the duel droid popper strategy, just as they were trained.

Saw donned night vision goggles in order to see, and was pleased to see that the freedom fighters were being cheered on by the Iziz citizens. Saw, Steela, Tano, and Bonteri returned to the safehouse and celebrated, raising drinks for Onderon.

Later, Saw hid incognito on a city street and helped Steela and more freedom fighters destroy a Confederate Army convoy that consisted of a Troop Transport, an Assault Tank, and numerous battle droids. Saw single-handedly wrecked the Assault Tank using his training; he blew up the hovertank agilely using two grenades. Steela then delivered a speech to the Onderonoians who had gathered amid the wreckage.

Tano reasoned that if Dendup was executed he would become a martyr and bolster the rebel cause. For his part, however, Saw ignored both the words of the war advisor and his sister and took it upon himself to rescue King Dendup before Rash even had a chance to publicly declare Dendup a traitor.

Nonplussed, Saw encouraged Dendup, surprising the king with news that the rebels had the support of the Jedi Order. Greatly encouraged, Dendup agreed to escape with Saw, but when Saw fired his grappling hook to escape the royal prison courtyard, he was frustrated to find that it was blocked by a one-way shield, which alerted the Unifar Temple to the intrusion.

Saw boomed over Tandin's arguments, proclaiming that he fought in Dendup's name for the former king had chosen to politically fight for the people, therefore not choosing to side with either the Republic or the Confederacy for his own gain as Rash so quickly had.
