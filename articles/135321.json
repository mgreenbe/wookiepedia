However, their colony was unsuccessful and they eventually abandoned Station 300, leaving it to the few criminals and visitors that made their way to Giaca. About twenty years before the Clone Wars, the Shorak returned to Giaca and expanded Station 300, and they re-named it Station 3Z3. By the Battle of Endor, the station had been fortified, enabling it to support a permanent colony, which numbered 50,000 individuals by the fall of the Galactic Alliance during the Sith\u2013Imperial War. However, the colony regularly fell under attack from the Shorak's rivals, the Peroenians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
